A taste to remember!
Tibbatu is another intelligent choice when it comes to Lankan Cuisine. A vegetable high in protein it too has many medicinal benefits. Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, the Office of the deputy provincial Agriculture Director (Extension) Colombo, Thanuja Jeewandara on this vegetable that is excellent for health
Belonging to the family Solanaceae, Tibbatu comes in two varieties. One is Thitta Tibbatu or otherwise known as Katu Tibbatu (botanical name being Solanum Indicum) and the other variety is Rata Tibbatu also known as Hen Tibbatu/ Goni Tibbatu/ Ela Tibbatu (botanical name being Solanum Violaceum Ortega), said Jeewandara.
Tibbatu belongs to the same family as Chili and Tomato.
When comparing Thitta Tibbatu and Rata Tibbatu, the canopy size of Thitta Tibbatu is less than Rata Tibbatu. Thitta Tibbatu has a diameter of 2  2  meters while Rata Tibbatu has a diameter of 3.5 diameters. Both trees, however grown up to 1  - 2 meters.
The leaves of Thitta Tibbatu are dark green. It is thorny on the underside of the leaves and has more thorns than that of Rata Tibbatu. The flower of Thitta Tibbatu is purple. Rata Thibbatu flowers are yellow. The fruit of Thitta Tibbatu has a diameter of 12mm. The fruit is yellow/greenish. When it ripens it takes on a color of reddish/orange, stated Jeewandara.
Rata Tibbatu also has its unique characteristics.
The color of the leaves of Rata Tibbatu are light green. The color of the flowers is white. When you take the size of the fruit of Rata Tibbatu it has a diameter of 16mm. It has thorns, but compared to Thitta Tibbatu it is less. It is a little bitter but when comparing the plants, Thitta Tibbatu is bitterer, pointed out Jeewandara.
A popular vegetable
Commercially famers opt for growing Rata Tibbatu.

There is a bigger harvest with the bigger canopy, the fruits are larger and the bitterness is very much less. So the preference is for Rata Tibbatu. So consumption of this fruit has spread from the village and to the towns now. Now cultivated on large scale, the habit of consuming Tibbatu has become extremely popular, added Jeewandara.
Tibbatu is now cultivated in Pollonnaruwa, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Hambantota.
However it can also be grown in home Gardens in Colombo. Two or three plants are quite sufficient for a household. What was initially found in the wilds is now grown in villages. It is ideal for the dry zone, however it can be grown in the Wet Zone. It is tasty and has a high nutritional value, added Jeewandara.
It is a Perennial crop. It can be grown as a mixed crop with other crops, or as a mono crop. So, two or three plants in a home garden is more than enough. It is enough for our daily needs. Tibbatu can be grown as seedlings or stem cuttings. But the yield is more from seedlings, so more farmers use seedlings. Stem cuttings produce a relatively low yield. So commercially it is recommended to use seedlings, explained Jeewandara
Soil preparation
When planting you need to prepare the soil.
Before planting, when obtaining the seedlings you need to pick a ripe fruit and then you need to bring the seed out of their dormancy period. It does not get planted immediately. So they need to be treated. They can either be soaked in water which removes the Gell, or we can place them in a cow-dung solution for one or two days - 100g of Cow Dung mixed with water. That will break the dormancy.
When growing at home we can use a polythene bag filled in with Organic Manure and top soil and plant the seeds in it. When transferring to the hole made in the garden, the hole should be filled in with Organic Manure and top soil (prior to planting). Then a hole the size of the polythene bag is created in the hole (containing the soil medium), then the polythene bag is stripped apart and the soil mound containing the plant is inserted, explained Jeewandara
On a commercial scale it can be grown in a nursery bed (with top soil and organic manure).
After planting the seedlings, in about 10  12 days the plant appears and it takes about a month for four to five leaves to appear. However this is not immediately transferred to the field. Then they are removed and planted in individual pots. We keep them in individual pots until they grow to a height of 10  15cm. This all take around 2 months for the plants to grow, and it is this plant that we transfer it into the hole in the field. (When growing in a nursery bed, it is transferred without disturbing or damaging the roots system.)
The soil in the hole should have a good drainage system. It should be mixed with chemical fertilizer, organic manure and top soil and then the plant is planted. The hole should be 1  , 1  , 1  in height, width and long, said Jeewandara. Also then the plant needs a bit of shading.
If the plant does not die then we know it has been established there. After that chemical fertilizer is applied every four weeks, or we simply maintain it with organic manure/ fertilizer. To get a good harvest you water irrigate every week. However to get the first harvest it takes four to five months. Flowers appear in two or three months.
The fruits come in bunches and you need to be careful not to damage the tree. So you need to use a knife. One bunch contains 35  40 fruits. But only 80  85 percent are fully ripened.
Every year from a hectare we can reap 10  12 metric tons. So the farmer gets a really good income. So from that you can see that two or three plants in a home garden will be quite adequate for the family, explained Jeewandara.
Tibbatu can be mixed into Parippu, or used as a curry, or with dried fish. It can even be used for cutlet mixture
If grown in your home garden, from one tree you can reap 150g. So with a few trees at home you can reap 250g  500g, summed up Jeewandara

Taste without Sugar!
Nutrition plays a critical role in every stage of our lives. From conception through pregnancy, birth, childhood and into old age nutrition will promote a healthy and a good life. Nutrition also plays an integral part of management of diseases. Many diseases, especially Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), could be largely prevented and controlled with proper nutrition.
The Health Ministry declared the month of June as the National Nutrition Month under the theme `Taste without sugar'. During this month, it is expected to reduce consumption of sweetened beverages among all age groups and to create awareness among the people regarding the harmful health issues that arise due to addiction to sugar and sweetened beverages. Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Head of Nutrition Department, Medical Research Institute, Ministry of Health, Colombo joined the Daily News Health Watch to voice that too much sugar is not so sweet on your health.
Q: How do Non Communicable Diseases affect life in Sri Lanka
A: The country, at present faces escalating health care costs with rising rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, and asthma among many others. NCDs have already become the largest contributor to disease burden in Sri Lanka, accounting for 85 per cent of ill health, disability and early deaths. In Sri Lanka, non-communicable diseases cause more than three quarters of all deaths and nearly one in five people die prematurely from NCDs. This burden of NCDs which has now become a serious economic as well as public health issue in Sri Lanka fuelled by tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity will definitely see a rise in the future.
Q: Where does Diabetes stand among the NCDs
A: Diabetes is among the four leading Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) that affects morbidity, mortality, and disability in the world. It was the eighth leading cause of global deaths in 2015, and is expected to advance to be the fifth cause by 2030. Importantly, the low-and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to diabetes and related deaths. Sri Lanka too is experiencing an increase in diabetes patients. According to recent statistics the prevalence of diabetes among adults in Sri Lanka is 8.5 per cent.
Q: How does sugar consumption contribute to the increase of Diabetic patients in Sri Lanka
A: Excessive consumption of sugar is one of the contributing factors for diabetes. While it is an essential ingredient for energy; its excessive intake has negative effects. To prevent and control negative health effects of sugar among adults and children, reducing daily sugar intake is recommended.
For Sri Lanka, the recommended sugar consumption is about 25 grams/6 teaspoons of sugar per non-diabetic person per day. However, an average Sri Lankan consumes 36 grams of sugar a day and when a person consumes sweetened food and beverages this amount can more than double.
Q: What steps have been taken by the Health Ministry to tackle this issue
A: Prevention and control are the two means to address diabetes which has plagued our society.
Globally agreed targets are set towards halting the rise of diabetes and obesity by 2025, through the increased access to affordable treatment, including insulin for those living with diabetes. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health implemented a national policy for NCDs prevention.
The Ministry is also creating awareness through various campaigns such as `Taste without sugar' which will be launched on June 23 at Gampaha. Diabetes can be prevented by implementing lifestyle modifications including maintaining an age-appropriate body weight, engaging in physical activity, and consuming a nutritious diet.
A diet including fruits, vegetables, grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy products, and whole grain foods can help lead a healthy life. While reducing the sugar intake, it is also recommended to at least consume five servings of fruits and vegetables a day.
Q: How is the sugar consumption among school children addressed through such campaigns
A: It is revealed that more than 13 per cent of children, some below 12 years are being diagnosed as pre-diabetics.
Various advertisements on food promotion inducing demand for unhealthy food products such as processed and fast foods can play a major role, in affecting healthy food habits, particularly among the children.
Thus the campaigns of `Taste without sugar' will be launched in schools with the participation of children to create awareness of the adverse effects on the excessive intake of products such as biscuits, milk products and sweetened beverages.
Q: How effective is the `Traffic lights' colour coding system introduced by the Ministry to tackle the diabetic epidemic
A: In 2015, the government made a decision to display different colour labels for beverages to denote high sugar content. Colour coding at a glance tells the consumer if the beverages have high, medium or low amounts of sugar. Red means the drink is high in sugar and warns the public to consume with due precautions.
The ministry will expand this coding system to milk products, biscuits and other foods as well.
Finally, we as consumers have a major role to play in controlling our intake of sugar to prevent diabetes which will hinder leading a happy and a healthy of life.

Tone, and Slang
Kingdom Cons is a novel with music at its core, and theres no doubt that Yuri Herrera calls the tunes. On the surface level, the book is about a singer-songwritera corrido-writing accordion player, to be precise. The protagonist is a young man who is known, at different points in his life and career, as both Lobo and The Artist. He learns early on that school is not a place for him and that songs will save his life (despite later learning that they may also jeopardize it).
Transformation
Abandoned by his parents, Lobo takes up his accordion (Now hold it good This is your bread, says his father the day before upping sticks) and begins to compose. Much of the novel chronicles the transformation he undergoes after getting a gig at the Palace where he is employed to write and play corridos (ballads) in praise of the Kings infinite valor, power and general badassery. The Artists songs are all the rage with the general public and music to the ears of the King himselfand therein lies his limited clout.
Like all three of Yuri Herreras novels to date, Kingdom Cons presents us with a central character who is tough and yet sensitive, lives in a cruel and violent world yet finds tenderness, andmost importantlyis aware of the fact that he wields a form of influence which derives from words and the power of communication.
Also, although it is in Kingdom Cons where literal music-making takes center stage, musicality is central to each of Yuris novels. And when it comes to translating the book, as central as the tune-filled plot is the rhythmic prose (or poetry, arguably), which is full of chords that are deceptively difficult to strike.
Staccato
Herreras tone can be lyrical, stentorian, strident or staccato but always manages to seem improvised, almost offhanded and utterly natural. Descriptions are often in a higher register, full of sonorous finery whether reflecting The Artists early awe and naivet at the splendor surrounding the King or his later disillusionment and resolve.
Reflections
These descriptions seem almost to glide, their flow smooth; in musical terms, reflections of this sort might be seen as legato. Much of the dialogue, on the other hand, leans slangward and is short and clipped. Kingdom Cons is full of thugs, and they speak like thugs, their cadence more staccato.

Top 10 plant care tips
* Avoid annoying little flies by being careful not to tip tea and coffee into plant containers. The sugars left in the compost make it an ideal breeding ground for sciarid flies.
* Use trough planters as natural screens. They reduce noise and are useful as barriers to separate walkways etc.
* One of the most common causes of plant death is over-watering. If in doubt, leave it to experts!
* Your plants need water, light and warmth to survive. So when you're off on holiday, don't forget about your green friends. Make sure that someone else knows to keep the blinds open and the thermostat up.
* Peat free compost is suitable for all your indoor plants.
* Variegated plants (featuring leaves with white edges or white flecks) often need more light than their green cousins. Keep them nearer to a window so that they can get all the light that they need.
* Plants acclimatise slowly to different surroundings by changing their leaf orientation and structure. If you can, try not to move them around, as they may not adapt as easily as you think.
* Plants reduce stress. See our Plants in Buildings website for more information.
* You can still have plants where space is at a premium. Some of the latest designs use tall containers to show off the plants, whilst taking up as little floor space as possible.
* Regularly prune your plants to stop them becoming 'leggy'. Once they've lost the foliage on their lower branches, it's very difficult to get it to return.

The World Health Organization (WHO) will present awards to President Maithripala Sirisena and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne during the the Global Conference on Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) organised by WHO in Montevideo, Uruguay from October 18 to 20 2017, Health Ministry sources said.
The sources said the President and the Health Minister will participate in the conference.
The former Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala has informed about the conference and awards to the Health Minister.
Dr. Mahipala is the current Coordinator for Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Nutrition and Environmental Health at the WHO South East Asian regional office for 11 member countries in the region.
The WHO has identified Sri Lanka as the country in the region which has taken most successful actions to control NCDs. This is a significant achievement gained by Sri Lanka, the sources said.
The recent action taken by Sri Lanka to control NCDs such as increasing tax on tobacco, introducing 80 percent of pictorial warning for cigarette packets, banning tobacco cultivation by 2020, led the country to gain this opportunity.
Sri Lanka will soon ban selling of single cigarettes and selling cigarettes around a radius of 500 metres from a school, the sources added.

A special World Health Organisation (WHO) team is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in October or November this year. The WHO team plans to have a dialogue with the Cabinet Ministers on improving the mental health of Sri Lankans, Health Services Acting Director General Dr.J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
According to Dr.Bandara, Sri Lankas health indicators such as maternal and infant mortality rates etc are close or are on par as health indicators of developed countries but Sri Lanka is not doing well when it comes to mental health.
Earlier, the suicide rate in Sri Lanka was among the highest in the world,but,now it has gone down to a certain extent, he added. Meanwhile, Mental Health Unit Director Dr. Chithramali De Silva said the media, especially the electronic media should act responsibly when it comes to interviewing flood victims who lost all family members to floods or who faced similar disasters because forcing them to remind their bitter experiences can cause severe psychological damage to them.
Many people who were affected by natural disasters suffer mental trauma when they return to their homes. Their needs should be looked into. Otherwise, they face severe mental disorders at a later stage in their lives. We have to give them a patient hearing, Dr. Bandara said. Health staff working in the affected areas also need mental relief to overcome stress because they work under very trying circumstances.
Their mental well-being is very important. Journalists should not risk their lives when reporting disasters. They too can suffer by stress, she said.

Women are mind readers
Women are more likely to have a 'mind-reading' gene mutation that gives them the ability to read a person's thoughts and emotions by looking at their eyes, scientists including one of Indian origin have found.
Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK conducted a test of cognitive empathy called the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test on 89,000 people across the world.
The study has earlier shown that people can rapidly interpret what another person is thinking or feeling by looking at their eyes alone. Researchers found that women on average score better on this test and identified genetic variants in women that are linked to the ability to "read the mind in the eyes".
Previous studies have found that people with autism and anorexia tend to score lower on the Eyes Test.
The team found that genetic variants that contribute to higher scores on the Eyes Test also increase the risk for anorexia, but not autism.
They speculate that this may be because autism involves both social and non-social traits, and this test only measures a social trait.
"This is the largest ever study of this test of cognitive empathy in the world. This is also the first study to attempt to correlate performance on this test with variation in the human genome," said Varun Warrier, a PhD student at Cambridge. "This is an important step forward for the field of social neuroscience and adds one more piece to the puzzle of what may cause variation in cognitive empathy," said Warrier.
"This new study demonstrates that empathy is partly genetic, but we should not lose sight of other important social factors such as early upbringing and postnatal experience," he said.
"We are excited by this new discovery, and are now testing if the results replicate, and exploring precisely what these genetic variants do in the brain, to give rise to individual differences in cognitive empathy," said Simon Baron-Cohen, at the University of Cambridge in the UK.
"This new study takes us one step closer in understanding such variation in the population," said Baron-Cohen.
The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.

World fights for childrens rights
Today, June 12 is World Day Against Child Labour. It is observed worldwide to raise awareness of the plight of child labourers world-wide. Hundreds of millions of girls and boys around the world are affected.
In many developed countries, children have never had it so good, with access to education, health care, the internet and much more. But millions more are facing unprecedented upheaval. More than 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes due to conflict, poverty and climate change while millions more face violence in their communities. According to the UN, around 263 million children do not attend school and last year nearly six million children under five died from mostly preventable diseases.
The most joyous time
Today, throughout the world, around 215 million children work, many full-time. They do not go to school and have little or no time to play. Many do not receive proper nutrition or care. They are denied the chance to be children. More than half of them are exposed to the worst forms of child labour such as work in hazardous environments, slavery or other forms of forced labour, illicit activities including drug trafficking and prostitution, as well as involvement in armed conflict.
Many of these children are forced to work in plantations, mines, factories, as domestic slaves and as prostitutes. They perform exhausting work for many hours in a row, often in unhealthy and hazardous conditions. The work is physically, psychologically and morally harmful for children.
Poverty often leads to child labour. Parents regard their children as additional sources of income. War, migration and discrimination against minorities also results in child labour. The common belief is that child labour is normal. True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse.
Globally over 1.5 billion people live in countries that are affected by conflict and violence. At the same time, around 200 million people are affected by disasters every year. A third of them are children. A significant proportion of the 168 million children engaged in child labour live in areas affected by conflict and disaster. The World Day Against Child Labour this year will focus on the impact of conflicts and disasters on child labour.
As the world strives to achieve the elimination of child labour by 2025, on this World Day Against Child Labour, lets join forces to end child labour in areas affected by conflict and disaster! Child labour and forced labour in conflicts and humanitarian settings will be discussed at the IV Global Conference on Child Labour in Buenos Aires, November 14-16, 2017.
Skills and experience
Considerable differences exist between the many kinds of work children do. Some are difficult and demanding, others are more hazardous and even morally reprehensible. Children carry out a very wide range of tasks and activities when they work. Not all work done by children should be classified as child labour that is to be targeted for elimination. Childrens or adolescents participation in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being something positive.
This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These kinds of activities contribute to childrens development and to the welfare of their families. They provide them with skills and experience and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life.
The term child labour is often defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.
It refers to work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children; and interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school while obliging them to leave school prematurely. It also includes requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.
In its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities  often at a very early age. Whether or not particular forms of work can be called child labour depends on the childs age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individual countries. The answer varies from country to country, as well as among sectors within countries.
Parenting groups
There are almost 100,000 child workers in Sri Lanka, with girls working mostly as domestic helper in towns and boys doing agricultural work in the villages. Schooling is a distant dream for many children, a survey by the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry shows, with 13.9 per cent of the child labour population being aged five to 14 years  the period when school attendance is compulsory.
Anything you do to support kids and parents can help reduce the stress that often leads to abuse and neglect. By educating yourself  and others  you can help your community prevent child abuse and neglect from happening in the first place.
The behaviour of children may signal abuse or neglect long before any change in physical appearance. Get involved. Advocate for services to families. Help to establish parenting groups in your community. Ask your community leaders, clergy, library and schools to develop services to meet the needs of healthy children and families. If you suspect or are aware of abuse or neglect may be occurring, report it.
UNICEF estimates that over half of the 30,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue. All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nations gold reserves.

The humble burger, crafted and cooked to a high standard, can be a thing of beauty. But can a pimped-up patty ever justify a price of 1,785 (one thousand, seven hundred and eight five pounds)
That's exactly how much the world's most expensive burger - approved by Guinness World Records - will cost you.
The sumptuous sandwich consists of a Japanese dry-aged Wagyu and Black Angus beef patty, Oosterschelde lobster infused with Hermit - Dutch Coastal Gin, foie gras, white truffle, Remeker cheese, Japanese fruit tomatoes and caviar.
French lettuce, Iberian ham, and a specially-concocted sauce made with 35 lobsters, Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, Madagascan vanilla, saffron and Japanese soy is also added to the mix. And it's all stuffed in a brioche bun made with saffron and covered in gold leaf.
The decadent burger was created by chef Diego Buik, of the South of Houston restaurant, in The Hague, Netherlands. A Netherlands native, Diego developed a passion for hamburgers during his two-year stint working at SoHo House, London, reports Luxurylaunches.com. Shortly after returning to Rotterdam, he started designing and building his own burgers, and in 2015 he won the prize for the city's best patty and bun creation.But he was just warming up.
To mark International Burger Day on May 28, he set out to create the world's most expensive burger - and did just that. Speaking to Vice.com , Diego admitted it isn't even the best burger he's tasted.
He said: "Byron in London served me the best burger I've ever had - a beef burger on a brioche bun with dried bacon, Byron sauce, tomato, red onion, and aged cheddar. It cost me about 14."

Lankas tea production drops to lowest in decade
Ceylon Tea Brokers is hoping that the total tea crop for 2017 will at least record a figure over the psychological barrier of 300 million kilos.
Sri Lankas national tea production has dropped to under 300 million kilos and is the lowest for over a decade barring 2009.
This substantial drop was partly due to adverse weather conditions and, as importantly, the restriction placed on the availability of weedicide and consequent curtailment of necessary agricultural practices and inputs were contributory factors to this extremely poor performance.
All three elevations recorded lower figures, according to Ceylon Tea Brokers Chairman Chrisantha Perera.
This trend continued during the first two months of 2017, although there was a welcome increase in our national crop for March. It is too early to predict whether this pattern will be maintained for the rest of the year and we can only hope that the total tea crop for 2017 will at least record a figure over the psychological barrier of 300 million kilos, he said.
The single most redeeming feature on the performance of Sri Lankas tea industry last year has been the increase in the auction averages compared to 2015 both when expressed in Sri Lankan rupees and the US dollar equivalent.
Following the limited availability of tea, together with improved demand from some of our main markets, prices have moved up further during the first four months of 2017, he said At the time of compiling this Report to date, auction averages for the current year are at all time highs both in terms of rupees as well as the US dollar equivalents.
This encouraging sign however should be tempered with a word of caution in that if the availability of tea out of Sri Lanka continues to be limited, at some point, we may lose our market share in the more important importing countries due to a lack of regular and adequate supply, he said.
Ceylon Tea Brokers Director/CEO Waruna De Silva said that the revenue grew by 25.7% to Rs. 419.7 million during the year from Rs. 334.0 million previous year.
Profits from Operations was Rs. 158.36 million, a 77.08% increase over the previous year, he said.
In addition, the company had a more successful year in 2016/17 compared with 2015/16, although the Sri Lanka tea industry continued to experience challenging times.
Tea prices at the Colombo Auction appreciated fairly sharply, particularly as the year progressed in the backdrop of a sharp fall in Sri Lankas tea production compared to previous years.
Tea prices also benefitted from higher oil prices that encouraged greater demand from Middle Eastern countries and Russia who are the two most important market segments for Ceylon Tea.

Accused wife killer ready to be deported to Sri Lanka
Canadas Immigration Department says a murder suspect who was set free after his trial exceeded the legal length limit is expected to be sent back to Sri Lanka in the next two weeks.
Ewa Staszewicz, a lawyer for the department, is confirming steps are being taken to obtain the necessary travel documents for Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingam.
Thanabalasingam,(31), told an Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada hearing today he doesnt believe he will be in danger in his home country and no longer needs to be protected as a refugee.
He was accused of murdering his wife in 2012 but the charges were stayed in April after the length of his legal proceedings were deemed to have violated a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that set time limits for trials to be completed.
He was detained by Canada Border Services Agency upon his release and a deportation order was issued against him.
Thanabalasingam, who came to Canada as a refugee, originally appealed the deportation order but later changed his mind and asked to be sent back to Sri Lanka. - CTV

ADB approves $2 mn grant for flood, landslide relief
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $2 million grant to finance relief efforts in the country following the recent floods and landslides that claimed the lives of over 200 people and damaged the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more.
Considering the scope of the damage in Sri Lanka and the governments constrained resources, it is critical that we assist the people of Sri Lanka in this time of urgent need, said Sri Widowati, ADB Country Director in Sri Lanka.
The $2 million is being provided to the government as a grant under ADBs Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to purchase emergency relief materials and help restore community services.
ADB stands ready to assist in the long-term rehabilitation of the calamity-hit areas, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, as he offered his deepest condolences to the people and affected families in Sri Lanka.
On 25 and 26 May 2017, torrential rains caused widespread flooding and landslides in 15 of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka. The heavy rains caused several major reservoirs to overflow. Flood gates were fully opened to avoid a dam breach, causing flooding downstream and submerging entire villages.
Major landslides in several districts of the Sabaragamuwa province caused further havoc, damaging and burying homes in mudslides. Though the tropical storm passed over Sri Lanka, rain continued over the island as the normal southwest monsoon settled in, aggravating the already disastrous situation. Many of the affected people in rural areas were among the most vulnerable in the country and have lost their homes and livelihoods.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled $31.7 billion, including $14 billion in cofinancing.

Against all odds
She has been a well known face in the television and movie industry for more than three decades. Though she does not make an appearance often in the entertainment scene it is difficult to leave Vishaka Siriwardhana out of the celebrity circles. She is mostly known for her mature and negative roles at present but according to her husband, Dharma Siriwardhana, Vishaka possesses a soft and gentle nature. A few decades back, she has defined her family and married her childhood sweetheart even after he has met with a grave accident which has resulted in amputating his right leg.
In brief
One significant feature about Vishaka is that she is really dedicated to whatever she takes up. She gives her hundred percent to any project which she is a part of. She also makes time to see about my welfare. She has won the Best Supporting Actress award at the Sarasaviya Film Awards in 1985. I think that she is one of the best among the actresses who exist in the field today.
The wife
Though she is dedicated to her career Vishaka is also very much involved in house work. We do not keep any servants because we manage the household chores between us. She can cook very well. We never buy our meals from restaurants. She knows all my favourite dishes and matches them well so that we have delicious and balanced meals on the table every day. She is a good housewife.
First meeting
That is a long story which is many decades old. We met when Vishaka was still schooling. She was getting ready for her G C E Advanced Levels. She used to stop by my shop to practice typing on my typewriter. Learning to use a typewriter was a big deal those days. We started chatting and soon grew fond of each others company. This led to our love affair.
Our first date was me taking her to see the streets lit up with Vesak lanterns and dcor. This happened in 1978. Then I began going out with her by taking her to her classes or wherever she wanted to go in my jeep. Our relationship developed with time.
Breaking away from the industry
Vishaka did not act for 14 years after marriage. We lived in Katupotha in the Kurunegala district, maintaining a farm. We also had a salon, pharmacy and retail shop. Vijaya Kumaratunga was the chief guest for the opening ceremony of the shop.
She got many offers but it was only after we came to live in Kalagedihena that Vishaka decided to make a comeback. She started acting again especially because veterans like Malani Fonseka made requests for her come back into the industry and Sandamadala was a good project to associate with. She didnt want to let that opportunity go.
Favourite character
I love the character she played in Robin Fernandos Sura Duthiyo. She had to learn martial arts for that role. I met with the accident when shooting for that film was on. She won a special award at the Singins (OCIC) Awards for her performance.
Turning points in life
I was not keen on Vishaka becoming an actress. I was worried that she will abandon me after she becomes a star. She went for her film audition without informing me. After she was chosen to star in films I began to visit her sets and was among the crowd who had gathered to watch the shooting take place. Her mother accompanied her while she was engaged in shooting but she did not know that we were having a relationship. Then gradually as she became more established in the field my dislike of her being in the industry disappeared.
I met with an accident in 1985 which resulted with my leg being amputated. I was devastated. I told Vishaka many times to let me go because she can lead a better life without me. However she was determined to be with me. Her family got to know about our relationship and was thoroughly against it. She was not even allowed to visit me. She found a way to see me by seeking the help of a doctor and his wife who lived close by. Finally it was Vishaka who took the bold decision to marry me. We got married on September 22, 1986.
Fanatic fans
Vishaka got the opportunity to play evil characters in most of her recent works. Her role in the teledrama called Vasuda became quite popular with the fans. Once during a shooting session in Negombo she tried to take a baby from an onlooker. The mother made a fuss saying that Vishaka is evil. Finally Cletus Mendis had to intervene and save her from the mother of the child!
Other passions
Vishaka loves to sing. She is very good at singing too. She is also passionate about her salon work. She has a salon in Gampaha now. She will be shifting it to a new place in Thihariya soon.
Fears
Vishaka is scared of the dark. She is also scared of ghosts though she has yet to meet one!
Soul mates
I believe that Vishaka brought good luck into my life. She helped me ease the pain of losing my leg and has stood by me through thick and thin.
Other passions
Vishaka loves to sing. She is very good at singing too. She is also passionate about her salon work. She has a salon in Gampaha now. She will be shifting it to a new place in Thihariya soon.
Foodwise
I love rice and curry. Vishaka does too. My ideal meal would consist of green brinjal curry, chicken and banana flower fry. She loves Jak fruit curry, bread fruit curry and tender Jak fruit curry.
Holidaying
Vishaka has to travel a bit if the shooting is scheduled out of Colombo. I accompany her if we are able to travel in our van. We recently went to Nuwara Eliya for four days. Nuwara Eliya is our ideal holiday destination because of the beauty and the cool climate.
Irritations
I get irritated if Vishaka does not do what I request her to do immediatly. If it is something that I can do then I handle it by myself. I only request her to do so because it is something that I cannot manage. Vishaka also gets irritated when I become angry. We keep well away from each other for some time then. Finally one of us goes and speaks with the other and we reconcile. Once she is back on good terms with me she feeds me well! So this is how it goes  arguments result in no food and reconciliations result in delicious meals!
Celebrities engagedin dance reality shows
Vishaka likes to watch her fellow colleagues take part singing and dancing reality shows. Those are popular these days and she thinks that they bring diversity to the industry and how the public are able to perceive artistes from a different angle. Dancing is good to maintain good health too. It has a positive impact not only in maintaining a good figure but also on mental wellbeing. I think she would not hesitate to take part in one if they invite her to do so.
Most unforgettable experience
Thieves robbed our shop during the period of youth insurgency. The thief himself was well known to us and was expressing his sorrow at length before he was caught. It is not a rosy experience but it is one that we both would never forget in our lifetime.
Present projects
Vishaka has two films which are scheduled to be released soon. They are No Mister Mama Director by Keerthi Bandara and Kusum Chandra Gamages unnamed production.

Amna Takaful - the pioneer in the takaful way -  celebrates 18 years in insurance
Takaful is a concept of joint guarantee or mutuality, which simply means that any takaful (insurance) contract is transparent and participatory.
The participant is the takaful certificate holder and thereby an active party in the deal.
Together with the trustee (takaful provider), the risk is shared as opposed to the conventional practice where-in the risk is passed on.
Takaful is also an ethical form which does not underwrite activity associated with gambling, speculation or interest generation.
A distinguishing feature of takaful is the award of surplus. Simply put, the focal point is the general risk pool. Should there be a surplus at the end of an accounting period, the trustees will determine a proportionate award to non-claimant participants. The rest remains in the risk reserve.
This shariah compliant concept of takaful has endured since 1999. Amana Takaful (ATPLC) is the only fully fledged service provider holding aloft the takaful spirit in its pristine purity.
With just six employees way back in 1999, the company has grown consistently over the years, underwriting both life and non-life classes.
As of today the company has a multiethnic workforce of over 300, a well-represented geographic footprint of 27 branches countrywide. As of now, ATPLC has two subsidiaries in the insurance sphere.
In 2005, a small team of Amanites ventured to the Maldives and established an agency house for insurance which has now grown into a totally integrated takaful outfit, listed on the Maldives Stock Exchange, the only Shariah compliant entity to this date.
By regulation, the life segment of ATPLC was segregated into a new legal entity and listed in the CSE in August 2016.
ATPLCs products and services are open to all. Apart from the generic classes of takaful, the company has a string of branded products that are unmatched in the market.
Additionally branded products for personal lines in health, travel and housing, to name a few, can be picked off the shelf or customized accordingly.
The company has made good progress in understanding the needs and wants of the underserved segments within the financial services ecosystem.
A range of micro products have been introduced in the last two years encompassing benefits on life, health, loss of income and funeral expenses both for individuals and family units.
Given the very encouraging renewal rate, it has spurred us to enhance benefits and widen the scope of cover to the informal sector and ensure they are adequately protected.
In December 2016, following extensive research and focus group study, two groundbreaking products were launched to embrace the three wheeler community and motorcycle riders.
These competitively superior products namely Tuk Tuk Full and Smart Rider Cover were placed before the target audiences and supply chain intermediaries through a series of road shows islandwide. The responses to date are encouraging.
In April, yet another new product was introduced to include the dairy farming community. The Kiri Govi Sathkara cover aims to protect pastoral life and cattle in addition to a range of other benefits at an affordable price.
Despite the heavy claims payout in 2016, from the normal business compounded by the catastrophic flood, it is noteworthy that of 12 companies accounting for 75% of the market, ATPLC takes the top slot in the speed of recognition of and settlement of motor claims (source: Independent Actuary NMG Consulting).
"This gives credence to our ISO re-certification in terms of our internal processes, being the only player to achieve this feat in the insurance fraternity."
A consistent winner at the Sri Lanka Islamic Banking and Finance Industry awards fora  ATL has been recognised as the Islamic Finance entity of the Year, together with numerous products, and social upliftment awards.

In 2016, Meade from Des Miones, Iowa, became the first model with Down syndrome to front a beauty campaign. She hopes to redefine the definitions of beauty in the fashion field as Down syndrome and other disabilities, are absent from the industry most of the time.
As a child, she loved getting dressed up in pretty outfits and wearing lipstick. While she hoped to one day become a model, she did not think it was possible.
"Being born with Down Syndrome can cause many problems, both physical and mental," she is quoted as saying by the Metro. Meade also revealed she was bullied by other kids and would often be made fun of.
Despite her hardships, the determined lady became an athlete in the Special Olympics and competed in several sports like gymnastics and basketball, the Metro reported. Meade's dream of becoming a model became a reality when she landed a modelling contract with haircare range Beauty & Pin-ups in 2016.

A spectacular injury time try scored by Isipathana fly half Anjana Kulathilake, who found his way over the St. Anthonys try line from a close range scrum to edge out St. Anthonys College Kandy
by 29 points (5 tries, 2 conversions) to 28 ( 4 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, 1 Drop goal) in the inter schools Milo Presidents Trophy knock out quarter finals played at Sugathadasa Stadium In Colombo yesterday. Isipathana will meet St. Peters College Bambalapitiya on coming Sunday (June 18) in semis. Isipathana made a sensational come back from 25 points to 12 down to beat Antonians at the end.
The Green Shirts showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing second half rally.
Isipathana, put up an unthinkable effort to topple Antonians who led 15-12 at half time.
The winners dared to run the ball and gained in meters whenever a gap in the opponents defense was detected. Havelock Park lads were always sure of what to do, in contrast to their counterparts who only knew to run straight, often ramming into their opposite numbers. St. Anthonys opened scoring when second rower Daulagala touched down for a try, 5-nill. Fly half Samuel Maduwantha failed with the conversion.
Soon after Isipathana equaled scoring 5 all when flanker Umesh Jayamanna went over for a try with centre Manelka Ruberu missing the conversion. Within couple of minutes Isipathana went in to a 12-5 lead off winger Nadeesha Chamindas try, converted by Ruberu.
Antonians cut down the lead 12-10 through a try scored by winger Pramoditha Wickramaarachchi, but Maduwantha missed the conversion. Just before lemons Anthonys jumped into the lead 15-12 with a try scored by Dinesh Rodrigo. Maduwantha missed the conversion again. At half time St. Anthonys led 15 points to 12.
Soon after the breather St. Anthonys surged ahead 22-12 with a try by centre Jason Seelagama with Maduwantha slotted in the conversion. St. Anthonys went further ahead with a 35 metre penalty fired across by Maduwantha to read the score 25-12. Green shirts made a striking return to the game, in the second half just 12 minutes remaining, when Sudeera Gaynath broke away from a maul and went over for a try.
But Pathana hopes of winning seemed thrust under a dark cloud when the teams place kicker, Ruberu failed with the vital conversion but close the gap 25 points to 17.
St. Anthonys further increased their lead to 28 points to 17 with a nearly 50 metre drop goal fired across by Maduwantha. Antonians, who dominated the first half, lost the grip late into the second half as they seemed hampered by the Isipathana three quarter attacks.
However, luck beckoned at Isipathana in the second half when replacement centre Randy Silva gave the side the hope of winning by scoring a try, breaching the St. Anthonys defense off a three quarter move. Ruberu made amends for all the missed kicks by converting the try this time to cut down the lead to 28-24 in St. Anthonys favour.
The winners, who enjoyed the major share of possession from the set pieces, sealed the game in the penultimate minutes from the end when fly half Anjana found his way over the Anthonys try line from a close range scrum. Centre Ruberu missed the difficult conversion to take Isipathana College to a remarkable 29 points 28 victory in the end.
Surprisingly Referee Rohan Fernando had a miserable game with the whistle disallowing two tries scored by Isipathana.

Bear the cross  and have faith!
Sri Lanka is a multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-racial plural society. In this vein, national harmony is of paramount importance for her forward march. This aspect is frequently heard over the media emphasised not only by the chief prelates but also by the Head of the State. Even though the title of my writing originates from the Bible in a vastly Buddhist atmosphere its pertinence bears surgical accuracy, I opine
Sri Lanka in particular and the rest of the world, in general, are passing through one of the cataclysmic periods in the annals of history seemingly due to irrational human behaviour and natural catastrophes, the latter, quite inevitable. Yet, man is not left alone. He is facilitated by established religions in which he takes refuge and myriads of beliefs that mitigate his suffering.
Our mundane life is softened by them and there is always a way out from this vicious circle, but the flora and fauna and avifauna are at the mercy of nature and man. In all these happenings, there seems to be a hidden message to mankind, yet it is palpable to me that the signal is not heeded in the proper spirit as it is projected to him by the uncanny forces. The tragedy lies there to a certain extent. At random thinking, it came to the mind of the writer how to react to this gigantic task taken as a bounden duty as a journalist and a literary lover, above all a lover of the fellow beings, a philanthropist, in the most humble sense.
In the recent flood havoc, it was quite discernible that our motherland is blessed with umpteen melting hearts at the hour of need. The sacrificial dedication of our tri-forces and the helping hand extended to us by our brethren off the shores ought to be bowed with the nations salute.
Spiritual guidance
In my deep perusal into the ocean of literary writing by our pathfinders, I was able to find an everlasting panacea for similar situations such as this insurmountable calamity. The writer would like to share it and put into trial with the general public under the able guidance of the intelligentsia. Our motherland is gradually depriving of the intellectuals such as in the calibre of the late Professor Siri Gunasinghe who mastered the quintessence of oriental wisdom through Sanskrit to derive inspiration for finding spiritual guidance for our nations decadence, other than political refuge. May his tribe increase!
Maxim Gorkys AMMA Garshins RED ROSE and another penetrative penning by Russian writers gave the necessary impetus to the BOLSHESHVIK party to oust the land owning wicked Tsar regime when the proletariat took up the arms for their liberation struggle as they had nothing to lose and win a lot by struggle. ANTON CHEKOV tops the list in dealing with the human problems and THE SEAGULL provides us with a broad dimension to understand chaotic situations man is embroiled with.
In the array of the cast and credits of this play, there is a progressive character by the name NINA. In a very crucial dramatic situation, she does some mentoring on another character named TREPLIOVE to BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH. This biblical allusion reminds us how JESUS CHRIST collapsed on his way to Calvary to be crucified.
As a non-Christian the writer is subjected to be corrected by any authority if the reference is erroneous, he had collapsed fourteen times on the tortured journey for the final Crucifixion. Each time he collapsed, he was assaulted to the hilt. Yet, he stood on his feet and carried the cross to the hill. The words crusade and crusader gained currency among the sufferers around the world thereafter. In this sense, NELSON MANDELA, MAHATMA GANDHI and also LENIN, MAO, and many others could be reckoned with.
National harmony
Sri Lanka is a multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-racial plural society. In this vein, national harmony is of paramount importance for her forward march. This aspect is frequently heard over the media emphasised not only by the chief prelates but also by the Head of the State. Even though the title of my writing originates from the Bible in a vastly Buddhist atmosphere its pertinence bears surgical accuracy, I opine.
After the regime change in 2015, our country has been facing more than fourteen collapses. Most of them are natural calamities. Yet, some of them are poignantly man made and its traces are quite repugnant to tell the world as the printed word takes wings to far away corners in a blink. Meethotamulla tops the list.
This is the historical hour that reveals the calibre and the disposition of the leaders, I mean the president, the premier ant the legislators. Yet, the final responsibility rests on the head of the state. The playwright gives a slice of life in THE SEAGULL. It could be viewed as the head of the country ought to know the day to day life of the ordinary people who sleep on the mat these days giving priority to the innocent children whose future is bleak now. Some people are under the trees, in makeshift shelters, temples and schools.
The future of the people whose houses went under water double and treble of the height of their roofs is beyond our imagination. Everything they had saved for a rainy day was taken away by the torrential rains. If the illiterate rural people are to be required to fill computer forms or any other cumbersome bureaucratic paper loads to get a pittance from the government which was elected to power by themselves even though the government machinery does not seem to have a close rapport with them now, it would be like the funny tongue twister we recited to practise our mouth for mastering QUEENs LINGO
LONDON MATRICULATION IS A GREAT BOTHERATION TO KANDYAN NATION WHOSE CHIEF OCCUPATION IS PADDY CULTIVATION.
Solving this problem is not easy. Yet, the government ought to BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH till the country comes back to normal.
Romantic life of the marriageable age young generation was put into lurch by the sudden spate. Even a carrot thrown to them would take them an extra mile. Our country should have a strong posterity as two generations of the crme de la crme of the population were taken for guinea pig from the south and north by experimental revolutionaries. Under these circumstances, the young generation should be given a shot in the arm to do the needful. Yet, in my resource play, there were five bushels of love and all doomed because of unrequited love. Romantic planning by the state would be a brand new idea.
Dissatisfaction and frustration should be eliminated from the flood victims. Appealing counselling would catapult the nation to dizzy heights. They ought to be injected with new vigour. Childrens future should essentially be made certain. Hope and aspiration are to be renewed. Childrens potentials have to be fully tapped.
Nation building
New lifestyles have to be initiated. Quick resilience has to be invited. Emerging from the ashes should be made a collective effort irrespective of caste creed or faith. Plural harmony is to be boosted. The traumatic and loathsome aspects of life such as ageing, fear, illness, unseen future, present complexities and uncertainties and other psychological foibles have to be attended to by relevant experts. The intelligentsia is to be entrusted with the Himalayan task of nation building.
As Abraham Lincoln wrote to his sons teacher, this is a big order by the nation. People seem to be ready to march when the command is given to set and go. The rich and the privileged live in the city. The poor people who climbed the trees to hoist the flag were victimised by the wrath of the rain God. The innocent garment girls who add to the national income and the farmer who go down waist deep in the muddy field and also the women under the tea bushes are to be well compensated in national planning in the wake of the great deluge.
What our great playwright pointed out in THE SEAGULL and other basic themes of human significance could be translated into practice in our development strategies.
There is no any alternative at sight.
Whole nation,
BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH!
It is the` need of the hour. In this play, the above-mentioned character committed suicide. Continuous torment took his life. In the same light, in the wake of this great deluge, most of the flood victims will have to face an unimaginable problem. People in rural areas will have to be guided in the proper manner unless the number of committing would definitely increase as categorically pointed out by our universally acclaimed psychiatrist Dr ROOMI RUBAN in one of his recent publications. Psychological ailments couldnt be treated with politics.
The shock wave around the country should essentially be converted to energy as one of the former presidents of China told the nation at the demise of their pathfinder MAO TSETUNG.
Dear President, BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH!

Bolt shakes off nerves to win final race on Jamaican soil
Usain Bolt partied with his devoted fans in an emotional farewell at the National Stadium on Saturday as the world's fastest man ran his final race on Jamaican soil. Bolt wanted to go out in a blaze of glory as he won the 100 metre Salute to a Legend race in front of a raucous crowd of 30,000 on the same track where he launched his international career at the world juniors in 2002.
The 30-year-old Bolt leaped out of the blocks and cruised to victory in a time of 10.03, well below his world record time but good enough to beat a solid field.
I don't think I have ever been that nervous to run the 100 metres, said Bolt, who is retiring in August following the World Championships.
Just the atmosphere and the people. The support they came out and gave me, it was really nerve-wracking. After the race the Bolt took a victory lap then returned to the track and the No. 5 lane where he kissed the finish line before flashing his signature lightning-bolt pose for the final time at home.
There is no words, Bolt said. From world juniors to now I have always been getting great support from Jamaica.
I never thought I would ever reach this height in track and field. My only aim was to be a 200 metre Olympic champion.
Usain Bolt partying with Jamaicans. 
I have done all I have done. Being a legend now is something big. But I couldn't have done it without the support of my parents. The nine-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt did not run in the fastest 100 metre race of the evening, but his devoted fans didn't care.
He ran in front of a sea of green and yellow clad Jamaican fans who showed their pride by dancing, waving flags and blowing vuvuzela horns while fireworks lit the sky.
Bolt said the reception he received was larger and louder than he anticipated.
I never expected this. I knew it was going to be big but the stadium was jam-packed with people supporting me I appreciate that, he said.
To see everybody turn out shows that what I have done for the sport is a big deal to them. Since this was his first race of 2017, Bolt said his biggest concern was just putting on a good show.
The Jamaican speedster says his farewell season is more about saying thank you to his fans than trying to break his world records of 9.58 seconds in the 100 metres and 19.19 seconds in the 200 metres.
Bolt was honoured during a 20 minute ceremony on the infield which was attended by his coach Glen Mills and Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.
Coe thanked Bolt saying, Our words are modest but our thanks our mountainous. His contribution has been mammoth. A figure to all of us in his sport and I wish him the best of luck.
There is nowhere else I would rather be as president of IAAF than in this stadium with you tonight. He said he plans to run the 100m at the London World Championships but he still has a lot of work to do to get ready.
My execution was bad and my start was poor, he said of Saturday's race. It is my first race and I didn't expect anything spectacular.
I just wanted to come out here and put on a show for the crowd and thank them for the support. In other events, Jamaica's Yohan Blake won the first 100 metre race of the evening as he clocked a 9.97 to hold off South Africa's Akani Simbine, who finished in 10 seconds flat. Bolt's time would have placed him third in Blake's heat.
South African Wayde Van Niekerk won the men's 200m with a world-leading time of 19.84 seconds. American Olympic gold medal winner Allyson Felix captured the women's 400 metres by finishing in a time of 50.52.
British track star Mo Farah easily won the 3,000 metres running away from the pack to cross the finish line in a time of 7:41.20 while David Tarbei squeezed by fellow Kenyan and world record holder David Rudisha at the line to win the men's 800 metres in a time of 1:44.85. - AFP

Can mindfulness reduce fear of labour and postpartum depression
Many women feel anxious about giving birth. Fear of the unknown and over-sharing by others (I felt I was ripped apart, one mother told my antenatal group) can make labour daunting. Being frightened of childbirth can prolong labour  by an average of 47 minutes, but it feels longer  increase the need for pain relief, make a caesarean section more likely and raise the risk of postpartum depression. Last month, a small, randomised controlled trial added to the evidence that teaching mindfulness to pregnant women could reduce these risks.
Mindfulness is defined as paying attention to the present moment in a purposeful, non-judgmental way. This study, as with previous ones, was small. It included 30 women in the third trimester of pregnancy who were randomly assigned to either mindfulness training or traditional childbirth classes.
Mental health
The lead author, Dr Larissa Duncan, associate professor of human development and family studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that, given the fairly large body of research showing that mindfulness can reduce depression and anxiety, she hypothesised it would protect the mental health of mothers and fathers.
Working with experience
The trials weekend mindfulness programme, set up by midwife Nancy Bardacke, included forced mindfulness meditation  awareness of breathing, the body, walking meditation and yoga. Pregnant women were taught to keep their minds focused on the present moment, rather than worrying about the next contraction or recalling the previous one. Bardacke helped to make this practice real by intermittently giving participants ice cubes to hold, and alternating the experience of unpleasant sensation with calm moments.
This trains the mind to be less reactive to stress and pain. Duncan believes that the benefits extend beyond labour. By using mindfulness to work with the contractions of labour, noticing they are temporary and there are spaces of ease in between, expectant parents learn a skill they can use later in parenting  working with their experiences of the baby crying or later toddler tantrums, with the same present moment awareness, she said.
Lower scores
The study showed women in the mindfulness group had lower scores for postnatal depression and were less likely to use opiates during labour, although the evidence comes from small pilot studies. Certainly, mindfulness intuitively sounds helpful  the pain of labour is a means to an end  and building confidence to deal with it is likely to reduce anxiety. - The Guardian

Japan recommends basin-based Disaster Risk Reduction(DRR) strategy
Top-down earlywarning systemsfor disasterprone districts
The government will hold a donor meeting shortly with all stakeholders involved in disaster mitigation to establish protocols and systems for making response grants needed to build disaster resilience, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa told the Daily News yesterday.
The minister said the Japanese Disaster Relief Expert Team members that visited districts affected by landslides and flooding due to the recent rain-triggered disaster, has provided them with technical advice for responsive measures.
They have recommended in their final report the need to invest in a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) strategy based on river basins to prevent loss of livelihoods, assets and loss of lives, he said.
They have recommended that measures be taken to set up early warning systems and spotlighted promotion of resettlement away from potential risk prone areas in some cases, he explained .
Thanking Japan for its cooperation and closely working with the government, Yapa said the basin based Disaster Risk Reduction strategy and the recommended investment in it focuses on sustainable development.
We are going to call a donor meeting with the participation of all stakeholders in flood- and landslide prone districts, such as the government agents, the governors, district authorities, first of all for the identification of disaster reduction priorities in them for programming an action plan to address their vulnerabilities and exposure to disasters on a sustainable footing , he said.
The vulnerabilities are being assessed for this purpose by relevant regional authorities at present, he said.
Asked if the government had paid compensation to those disaster victims whose houses have been fully or partially damaged by the floods, Yapa said they are taking care of everything.
He said the damages have to be assessed before moneys can be granted in the case of houses that have been devastated.
There is no need to worry over rebuilding for we are doing it successfully. Most importantly the flood victims are being looked after by the government, they have been sheltered, food and water been given, medicinal needs taken care of at the time, he said.
Flood relief is going to them directly. Most importantly the challenge is that we have to put them in a better position when the next disaster strikes, he pointed out.In the meantime short-term recovery is being addressed, he said.
We are going to establish an early warning system which will have access even to villages as per recommendations of the Japanese Disaster Relief Expert Teams report as part of our strategy to address disaster vulnerabilities in the country on a national footing, he added.

DPLs First Light wins AREA award
The unique CSR initiative of Dipped Products PLCs First Light won the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship award at the recently concluded AREA awards in Singapore. This was in the Investing in People category.
The meaning of First Light is actually created to honour our rubber farmers who form the first link in the supply chain who have to wake up at the first light of the day and use their hands to tap the rubber which then goes through a long chain of value addition making a massive contribution to the Sri Lankan economy, said Dr. Mahesha Ranasoma, Managing Director of Dipped Products
Dipped Products is a manufacturer of latex based rubber gloves and with manufacturing facilities both in Sri Lanka and in Thailand. We have been successful in marketing our gloves now reaching 70 countries and as a Sri Lankan company, we all can be proud of this achieving such a significant global footprint.
At present, we have more than 3,000 small holder rubber farmer connected with us contributing daily to our efforts of making value added export products and it is this responsibility that led us to crafting the First Light small holder rubber farmer project in 2007 as our core CSR project.
We also wanted to create this project starting from the most difficult area and hence selected Moneragala to anchor the initiative.
Our key aims of the this project were to support the small holder rubber farmer community with productivity tools, training, capacity building in their villages, providing insurance, ensuring fair pricing and follow the principles of fair trade, ethical sourcing and sustainability practices.
We also aimed at co-ownership of this project by the farmer community hand in hand with DPL, he said.
The project started with 4 farmers in 2007. By 2008, the farmer base increased to 148 who accounted for 12% of the field latex supply to DPL. By 2016, the farmer base had grown more than 10 fold to 1,620 and their contribution to DPLs field latex requirement had grown to more than 45% of the total requirement.
These statistics clearly demonstrate the acceptance of the First Light project by the smallholder farmer and its sustainability, he added.
AREA, is Asias leading large scale and regional CSR programs, organized by Enterprise Asia, which saw over 300 CSR thought leaders, doers and practitioners from across Asia attending.

Eating red onions may help to fight cancer
The tasty vegetable, commonly used in Mediterranean cuisine, is full of powerful compounds that help to kill tumours. One type known as anthocyanins, which are responsible for its dark colouring, are believed in inhibit the spread of the disease.
While a flavonoid called quercetin has the same effects by shrinking the size of cancerous masses, experts say. But any type of onion, regardless of its colour, may help to destroy cancer, Canadian scientists claim.
'Onions are excellent at killing cancer'
Study author Abdulmonem Murayyan, of the University of Guelph, said: 'We found onions are excellent at killing cancer cells.
'Onions activate pathways that encourage cancer cells to undergo cell death. 'They promote an unfavourable environment for cancer cells and they disrupt communication between cancer cells, which inhibits growth. 'It makes sense that the red onions, which are darkest in colour, would have the most cancer-fighting power.' Previous research has suggested that consuming red onion, which is sweeter than the white variety, could also help to prevent heart disease.
Scientists in Hong Kong found that the vegetable works to remove bad cholesterol from the body, which can cause heart attacks and strokes.
At the same time red onions retain the body's good cholesterol, which help protect against heart disease, they said in 2010. Numerous studies, including one at Cornell University over a decade ago, have also shown a link between onions and cancer.
Some parts of the world where onion consumption is high have even been shown to have much lower cancer rates.
For the new study, the researchers placed colon cancer cells in direct contact with quercetin extracted from five different onion varieties.
The Ruby Ring onion was found to be the most potent, according to the findings in Food Research International. During recent studies, they also determined that onions are effective at killing breast cancer cells.
Commenting on the study, Dr Justine Alford, Cancer Research UK's senior science information officer, was wary of the findings.
She told MailOnline: 'The researchers found that extracts from certain types of onions could kill bowel cancer cells in a lab, but that doesnt mean the same would happen in a persons body which is much more complex.

Every bride is not a Bridezilla
By now, we should all know that no matter how much you crave the spotlight, when it comes to weddings, you let the happy couple have their moment in the sun.
There's a multitude of reasons for this, common decency probably being the top one. That's not to say, however, all brides are attention-starved harpies who will destroy anyone who dares not play second-fiddle to them.One bride in fact recently coordinated an amazing surprise for her best friend at her wedding, using the tossing of the bouquet as her perfect moment. Do you see where this is going yet
Yes, it's a big-hearted bride who gets together with her bridesmaid's partner to organise him proposing to her friend - and lets herself get upstaged in the process. The moment the bridesmaid was proposed to was captured on camera by professional photographer Ross Dance Photography.
"Leading up to the wedding Jessica's bridesmaid and best friend (also Jess) worked tirelessly to ensure the preparations and wedding day were perfect," he wrote.
"To show her appreciation, the bride decided to share her special day with her friend, coordinating the proposal with Jess' boyfriend.
"Instead of throwing the bouquet, the bride spun around and walked over to her best friend. Everything froze as she said 'Jess... turn around...'"

FCID to probe bus-permit malpractice

Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva said today that the National Transport Commission (NTC) has taken 2095 files to the FCID to investigate into various malpractices which had occurred when granting bus route permits during the previous regime.
The Minister noted that the regulation of the transport sector has become a major issue. 
It is a problem whether we can control it through legal, ethical or through means of good governance, he added.
A large number of people come to me every day for a route permit and I have to turn them back. I tell them, come to me only if you are prepared to adhere to the principles of good governance. I cannot grant permits in an illegal manner, said the Minister at a workshop on the strengthening of the national and provincial transport sector held at Waters Edge.
They also made the decision at the workshop to install CCTV cameras in bus stands to curb the issue of buses still being subjected to ransom demands. The NTC is to fund the initiative.
It was also noted that long distance buses were stopping at unnecessary places and thus the CCTV would also help put a stop to that.

FITIS launches INFOTEL 2017
On theme Towards a Digital Economy
The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka () has arranged to conduct their National ICT Exhibition - INFOTEL - this year under the theme Towards a Digital Economy, supported by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka.
As the biggest and most prestigious ICT exhibition in Sri Lanka and the whole of South Asia, INFOTEL 2017 will be held from November 2-4 at the BMICH in Colombo.
Inaugurated in 1992, FITIS and INFOTEL are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year. Benchmarking this historic occasion, FITIS will organise INFOTEL 2017 in a different way, going beyond the mode of a traditional exhibition.
Pledging government support for this national endeavour, Harin Fernando, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, chairs the Steering Committee of INFOTEL 2017. The official briefing to the stakeholders of this new move was held recently at the Hilton Colombo Residence.
Minister Fernando who was chief guest said the theme of INFOTEL 2017 exhibition Towards a Digital Economy is topical and absolutely relevant in an era where the entire world is swiftly going digital. The objective of the government is to provide digital facilities to every citizen of the country.
The government is making an indefatigable effort to develop digital infrastructure to make this vital facility easily accessible to the people across the country. I believe that achieving the goal of total digitalisation will translate into productive and viable development which will reflect positively on the lives of the masses. Hence, I kindly request all stakeholders to support this national endeavour in a possible way, he said. INFOTEL has been focused on the countrys national growth all throughout its history and it has been the platform to experience the latest trends and cutting edge technologies for Sri Lanka.
A significant turnout of around 100,000 visitors, including executive officers of local and foreign companies in the ICT sphere, eminent professionals, policy makers, entrepreneurs, educationists, school students, educational institutions and universities, teachers, lecturers and members of the public, are expected to visit this premier exhibition this year.
After taking over the mantle as FITIS Chairman this historic year where we are celebrating our 25th year, we mapped out a comprehensive action plan to bring the ICT industry to a greater level. We identified the INFOTEL National ICT Exhibition as the best platform in this scenario. Benchmarking this historic occasion, we invited all stakeholders in the industry to support us in this national endeavour as the onerous task of developing Sri Lankas ICT industry cannot be shouldered by the private sector alone. The support, assistance and guidance of the existing government and relevant state-run institutions are of utmost importance. In this backdrop, we made every endeavour to work with the government and state-owned institutions and it is a big achievement to bring these sectors into a common forum like this. The ideal opportunity has now arisen to overcome the challenges we face and emerge victorious. This is a historic occasion for Sri Lankas ICT industry, said Dr Kithsiri Manchanayakke, Chairman of FITIS.
Over the years, INFOTEL has earned a reputation as the pinnacle ICT event in the calendar of all those actively involved in the field. They consider it a must to visit this eagerly-awaited, innovative exhibition which, in itself, offers a refreshing experience, said Upul Dassanayake, Co-Chairman of INFOTEL 2017 and the President of the FITIS Education and Training Chapter. Extending an invitation to all Sri Lankans to visit the INFOTEL2017, Dassanayake assured those present that it will be a productive learning experience which will enrich their lives.

Amila Bandara, Co-Chairman of INFOTEL 2017 and Assistant Secretary of FITIS Education and Training Chapter said, INFOTEL National ICT Exhibition is one of the oldest and biggest ICT-related exhibitions in South Asia. It is due to the untiring efforts and profound commitment of the organising committee that it has been possible to host this prestigious exhibition annually and take it to new heights since its inception.

France election: Macron party set for big parliamentary win

The centrist party of French President Emmanuel Macron looks on course to win a landslide victory following the first round of parliamentary elections.
Projections show La Republique en Marche (Republic on the Move) and its MoDem ally set to win up to 445 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly.
The final outcome will be decided at a run-off next Sunday.
Macron's party was established just over a year ago and many candidates have little or no political experience.
With all the ballots counted, Macron's LREM and MoDem had won 32.3% of the vote.
The centre-right Republicans had just under 16%, while the Socialists, previously France's ruling party, had won just 7.4%.
The far-right National Front (FN) had 13.2%, followed by the far-left France Unbowed on just over 11%.
But turnout was sharply down, at 48.7% compared with 57.2% in the first round in 2012, which analysts say reflected a sense of resignation among Macron's opponents.
There can be no disputing the extraordinary achievement of Emmanuel Macron. Yes, he has certainly had luck but he has also foreseen with uncanny clarity how - with the right moves at the right places at the right times - the map of French politics was waiting to be redrawn.
If the projections from the first round are sustained, then the change that is about to happen to the National Assembly is as big as the one that occurred in 1958 when Charles de Gaulle brought in the Fifth Republic.
Scores, hundreds, of new MPs will be arriving who have never set foot in a debating chamber of any kind, let alone the country's legislature.
It is all liable to bring a rush of blood to the head, and the greatest danger right now for Macron and En Marche is hubris. The victory is no doubt spectacular but so far it has all been electoral.
Phase two of the Macron master plan - actual reform - is the next challenge. And bigger.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Macron on the "great success" of his party. It was a "vote for reforms",tweeted(in German) her spokesman, Steffen Seibert.
Macron, 39, defeated FN leader Marine Le Pen in the presidential run-off last month.
He needs a majority to push through the changes that he promised in his campaign.
He has already left an impression around the world, in particular for standing up to US leader Donald Trump on issues like climate change.
After the projections were announced, a government spokesman said voters had shown they wanted to move fast on major reforms.
But Franois Baroin, head of the Republicans, said the low turnout testified to the "deep divisions in French society" and was "extremely worrying".
Marine Le Pen blamed her party's poor performance on the low turnout, saying France's electoral system, which favours larger parties, needed to be reformed.
"This catastrophic abstention rate should raise the question of the voting rules which keep millions of our compatriots away from the polling stations," she said.
Socialist leader Jean-Christophe Cambadlis lost his seat in the first round.
He warned voters against giving LREM an absolute majority next Sunday, saying it would result in "virtually no real opposition and we will have a National Assembly without any real counterbalance, without a democratic debate and not worthy of that name".
Those standing for LREM come from all walks of life and include students, retired citizens and a bullfighter.
To win in the first round, candidates had to gain at least 50% of the vote.
The election took place amid heightened security after a series of devastating terror attacks in recent years.

Gnanasara Thera avoids court hearing citing death threats

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was absent in Court today for the hearing of the alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court case, citing that he has received death threats.
The Court of Appeal observed that Court will have to issue warrant against the accused if he failed to appear in Court on next inquiry date.
President's Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with Counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera told Court that their client was not appearing in Courts since he has gotten death threats.
However, at a previous occasion, counsel who appeared on behalf of Gnanasara Thera tendered a medical certificate to Court informing that Gnanasara Thera was being treated at a hospital for an illness.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appearing for the Attorney General moved Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of accused for not appearing in Court on several occasions citing various reasons.
The Court of Appeal Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Devika Tennakoonobserved that they would not issue a warrant against accused but Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on July 18, 19 and 20.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts Jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka commences housing project
As part of the Government of Indias commitment to construct 50,000 homes in Sri Lanka, the High Commission of India has launched a project to construct 4,000 homes for plantation workers in the Central and Uva Provinces.
1,134 of these homes will be constructed in the first phase of this project which was launched in 2016. Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka is one of four implementing agencies involved and will undertake the construction of 100 homes in Hellboda Estate, Pussellawa in the District of Kandy, Sri Lanka.
Habitat for Humanity will focus on constructing 100 homes for plantation workers in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, commonly referred to as the Estate Sector. This housing project will particularly benefit 100 families residing in Hellboda Estate. The beneficiary selection was conducted in consultation with the High Commission of India in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Hill Country, New Villages and Infrastructure and Community Development, local authorities, the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and the estate management. Houses will be constructed according to an innovative homeowner-driven model, wherein the Government of India, through its partners arranges technical support and financial assistance for the beneficiaries to undertake the construction of their homes themselves, encouraging homeowners to feel a sense of pride and ownership over their homes.
Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka, being an organization with more than 22 years experience in the housing construction industry in Sri Lanka, previously partnered with the Government of India to construct homes for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) following the war in the North and Eastern Provinces in 2012. This enabled HFH Sri Lanka to assist nearly 3,700 families to construct their homes in Batticaloa and Trincomalee.
An inauguration ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation of the 100 houses project, implemented by Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka was held on the 03rd of June in Pussellawa, Kandy. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Taranjit Singh Sandhu (High Commissioner of India in Sri Lanka); P. Thigambaram M.P., (Minister of Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure & Community Development) and V.S. Radhakrishnan, M.P., (State Minister of Education).
Commenting, on this endeavor, National Director of Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka, Dr. Dinesh Kanagaratnam, said We are proud to be associated with this project. One of the main strengths of Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka is its expertise in housing construction and community development. I believe our contribution to the Indian Housing Project will be key to providing the plantation community with safe and decent homes.

Hayleys Advantis projects bridges logistics gap for SLs energy growth
As a nation focused on development and in the midst of transitioning from a lower middle income country to an upper middle income country it is no surprise that Sri Lanka is facing a rise in demand for electricity.
With ambitious goals and recent economic developments, Sri Lanka has been experiencing a 4% annual increase in electricity consumption. This growth is led by the domestic and hotel sectors with domestic alone accounting for at least 40% of the electricity consumed  a steep contrast from developed nations that only witness 20% domestic consumption.
Rapid urbanization and a growing population with more disposable income have put a strain on the electrical grid that needs to be alleviated. This became evident in a series of islandwide power outages in early 2016.
If Sri Lanka is to achieve its long-term goals and take its place on the world stage, then it will need to resolve this critical issue by securing additional power sources. Sri Lankas electricity regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) said as much when they recommended the Power and Energy Ministry take urgent steps to purchase new power plants in order to avoid a power crisis.
However, a major hurdle in the construction of power plants in developing countries has been the installation of the large, heavy generators that produce the electricity in a power plant. The poor infrastructure within the country including narrow road network, low overhead wires, and weak bridges can make it difficult to transport oversized cargo.
Additionally, the lack of skills and logistical expertise in these regions have been a factor that made these projects problematict. Due to this reason, Sri Lanka has relied on foreign expertise to manage the transportation of such generators making it an added financial burden to the country.
However, today it is no longer the case thanks to a more experienced and mature local industry.
At the forefront of this industry is Advantis Projects (formally known as Logiventures Pvt Ltd.), a subsidiary of the Hayleys Group, who have the necessary expertise and the specialized equipment to manage such projects, providing an end-to-end logistics solution that caters to specific needs. With a wealth of knowledge and strategic partnerships across the region they are also able to draw upon the expertise of foreign consultants if the situation should call for it, while ensuring that costs are contained, through the local management of the project.
Their track record includes an array of projects that required bespoke solutions utilising specialised equipment  such as multi-axle trailers with the ability to transport cargo up to 300MT in weight  owned only by them, customs clearance, liaising with relevant organisations to ensure the smooth transportation of cargo, and marine logistics facilities such as vessel chartering and providing barges. All these features are supplemented with their inhouse logistics team which include master mariners. By using inhouse expertise and owning the specialised equipment needed to successfully accomplish these projects Advantis Projects is able to provide the fast end-to-end transfer of heavy cargo easily and safely.
Shadil Rizan, General Manager of Advantis Projects, said, We approach each project with a view of accomplishing it safely, on budget and on time. We are able to do this thanks to our wealth of knowledge in handling an array of different logistics projects over varying terrain using a myriad of solutions. We are a highly coordinated team that rely on precision planning to accomplish our tasks.
Advantis Projects movement of heavy cargo for the power and energy sector covers a vast array of projects including the handling of windmill cargo for the renewable energy sector which required ship-to-shore ground logistics in the North of Sri Lanka, for the successful installation of 16 wind turbines in Pallali. There was also the transportation of four 100-ton diesel engine generators from the Horana BOI zone to Lahore, Pakistan, which required a mix of ground and marine logistics solutions as well as liaising with all stakeholders.
It is logistics providers like this that will enable the growth of Sri Lankas energy sector and pave the way for the country to achieve its economic goals. Advantis Projects is the market leader in providing project logistics solutions to local and international contractors who are involved in large-scale infrastructure projects. The company brings over 16 years of experience and a proven delivery record that has been driven with technology innovation and adherence to industry best practices.

Average turnover levels meanwhile amounted to LKR 0.87bn during the holiday shortened week (+5% increase W-o-W) as market activity was pre-dominantly HNI & Institutional driven while retail investors remained on the sidelines.
Large parcels in Colombo Cold Stores (33% of the total turnover) and JKH (7% of the total turnover) helped extend the HNI and Institutional contribution to turnover and these transactions accounted for ~40% of the weeks total market turnover.
Foreign investors meanwhile, continued to remain net buyers for the 19th consecutive week (since Feb17), with foreign buying for the week rising 216% W-o-W to LKR 2.37bn in counters such as JKH,LFIN, EXPO resulting in net inflow position of LKR 0.68Bn.
YTD net inflows to the Bourse consequently add up to LKR19.61Bn cf. a net outflow of LKR 5.83Bn during the Jan-May16 last year. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum.
Financial flows
in Q1 reflect global EM appetite
Sri Lankas Trade Deficit in Q117 widened 35% Y-o-Y as the marginal improvement in Exports over March failed to offset higher Import expenses.
Despite Exports in March reversing the declining trend experienced over Jan and Feb, Import expenses rose +19.4% Y-o-Y on the back of increased fuel Imports (+51.4% Y-o-Y) amid higher demand for thermal and coal based power generation.
Tourist inflows over the quarter meanwhile, rose a marginal 3.4% Y-o-Y as March arrivals were impacted by the partial closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport.
Worker remittances however, declined 3.3% Y-o-Y over Q117 as adverse economic and geopolitical conditions continued to dominate in the Middle Eastern region.
Tracking the stronger global demand for EM/FM assets though, net inflows to the CSE rose a significant 767% Y-o-Y over the quarter while inflows to G-Securities rose ~551% Y-o-Y.
Although over a low base (inflows to CSE in Q117 was $83Mn cf. outflow of $13Mn in Q116 while foreign investment in T-bonds/bills was $282Mn cf. $43Mn in Q116), the increase reflects stronger risk appetite for EM/FM assets over Q117, which have experienced the strongest portfolio inflows since 20141.
Indeed, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) forecasts, that Non-resident capital inflows to EMs should reach $970 Bn in 2017, up 35% Y-o-Y as near-term threats of trade conflict have waned over the last 5 months.
The Group expects foreign portfolio inflows to rise to >$1 trillion in 2018 although at a net level, the IIF anticipates overall net capital outflows from EMs in 2017 due to resident capital outflows from China1.

Infinitely precious, wonderfully flawed
My father and I were walking in the Battarmulla town on our weekly shopping spree when a skinny young man walked up to us and asked for money to buy something to eat. My father handed him Rs. 150 and pointed to the restaurant close by where a packet of lunch with fish cost Rs. 140.
I thought the young man had tricked my father. I was certain he would walk to the nearest 'wine store' instead of the restaurant. When I voiced my doubts on our way home, my father simply said, Don't always see the bad in a person. Perhaps he really was hungry.
When we were once again in the town buying things on my mother's shopping list the young man approached us again. Yes, I thought to myself. He knows he can trick us into believing he is hungry again. But instead of asking for more money he thanked my father for the money he had given him and told us he is now employed as a security guard in a private company close by. He was on his way back to his lodgings after the night shift.
I felt ashamed of myself. Whereas my father had believed the young man, I had been skeptical. Why was I such a hard-boiled cynic
I don't know why. My only consolation is that everyone else's brains too are wired that way.
Negativity bias
Scientists say all of us have an intrinsic negativity bias", or tendency to focus on and give more weight to negative experiences or information instead of positive ones in our minds.
They cite a common example of the negativity bias by comparing it to our relationship with dogs. Almost all of us have had many great experiences with dogs throughout our lives. But if we were bitten or attacked by a dog, we are likely to be scared of them for the rest of our lives because we focus on the one negative experience instead of the many more pleasant ones. Likewise, we have all been wronged numerous times by our friends, colleagues and even total strangers. It is only natural then, that we find it hard to see the good in everyone around us.
To make things worse, it turns out that the negativity bias is so ingrained in our psychology that it has already developed and become measurable by the time we are seven months old!Clearly, seeing the positive attributes in others is an uphill battle.
Thats what humans do
A battle nevertheless less, that can be won. If you work hard, that is. If you work hard to make yourself realize there is not a single one of us who is perfect and that we all have our dark, twisty parts deep down inside. As Margaret Manning describes in her article,'How to be Happier by Learning to See the Good in Others' weve all done things we arent proud of and weve all hurt peoplesometimes unintentionally and sometimes absolutely on purpose out of spite, anger or jealousy. It happens because thats what humans do. You have to make a conscious choice not to get so bogged down in all the ugly parts that they start to control who you are in the world, says Manning. Choose, instead, to be a person of honor and character. Acknowledge that those parts of yourself exist and then work really hard to rise above the limitations they create for you. And when you do mess up, like we all do, dont beat yourself up over it.
As we all know, that is much easier said than done since we tend to be our own worst critics. But, Manning assures that something amazing happens when you can start to accept all the parts of yourself and truly realize you have good inside of you: You are able to find the good in other peopleeven people you are pretty certain have no redeeming qualities.
Reserving judgment
The best way to go about this is by stopping ourselves from labeling people based on too little information. If we hear someone yell, we start to think of him or her as an angry person. If a friend rejects an invitation or disagrees with our point of view, we may think that they dont like us. Even worse, once we form an opinion about someone, and label them it is difficult to change our mind and see them in a new light. Reserving judgment is difficult, yet it is a critical step on the path to positivity.
Manning also says that we must remember that all of us have a unique history and personal story. But at the same time, everyone is also more like us than we know. Like you and I, they too are infinitely precious and wonderfully flawed. We cannot know the thoughts of others, admits Manning. But, this is exactly why it is so important to give them the benefit of the doubt. Every interaction with another person is important. It is an opportunity to learn about someone who, like you, is trying to make the most of their life.
So, the next time you meet someone remember to do what Dolly Parton does. When I meet someone, I look at their eyes and their smile and seek out the good firstit's easy to find when you're looking for it, says Parton. You let a person shine with their own light and try to connect it to yours. As soon as I say hello, I go right to that light and I don't care who you are! I know we're all pieces of the same thingI go for that common light because I know it's in all of us.
Thus, have I learned, someone in need could truly use my help; that in seeking the good in others will bring out the good within me.
Audrey Hepburn was so right when she said, 'For beautiful eyes see the good in others, for beautiful lips speak only words of kindness.
How to see the good in people
1) See The Good In You.
Be honest. You're not always such an angel. At times, you couldn't care less about the world and its problems. At times, you even have a tendency to be rude to others. But you're not always selfish and you're hardly ever rude. In fact, you're actually quite charming and generous to your friends. So why can't other people be the same By looking at your own wonderful characteristics, you'll have an easier time spotting the same traits in other people.
2) Everyone Has Bad Days.
Have you ever had a bad day If your answer is yes, then you know just how difficult dealing with everything else can be. The next time someone is rude to you, think about his reasons for being disrespectful. Could it be that he had gotten into trouble at work Perhaps he had received a bit of bad news. Everyone has bad days. Understanding this helps you in seeing the good in people. Even the nicest of persons would probably slip up when he's bombarded with a boatload of problems.
3) Practise Positivity.
People who surround themselves with positivity have an easier time seeing the good in people. That's because they've already programmed such thoughts in their life. You too can follow in their footsteps. Start with being grateful for your life. Be thankful that you have a family and friends who you can laugh and cry with. Be grateful that you have another opportunity to live a good life and that you have the ability to see the good in others. Seeing the good in people is an admirable trait and something we should all aspire to have. Not only will it make your life more peaceful, it will also give you the power to influence how other people think and react.

Jaffna students  repair flood  hit Mapalagama school
Politicians who do not consider politics as a business should be elected to office by the people of this country, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said.
Civil society too should have a stake in the countrys forward march without washing its hands off by leaving everything in the hands of politicians, the former President said addressing a meeting at the Mapalagama Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Galle district.
The Mapalagama Vidyalaya damaged in the recent floods was repaired and refurbished by a visiting group of students from Vembadi Maha Vidyalaya and Mallika Maha Vidyalaya in Jaffna. The meeting was held to mark the handing over ceremony of the refurbished buildings and other equipment to the students and staff of Mapalagama MMV. Kumaratunga said Sinhalese as the majority community had its own rights but they should also respect and provide for the rights of other communities as well.
Describing war as a meaningless thing which did not benefit anyone Kumaratunga said eventhough people in the south faced many difficulties and vicissitudes on account of war those who suffered most from it were the Tamils. History showed that Sinhalese and Tamils had stood with each other in unity even during foreign invasions.
During the recent past we had created divisions as to South, North and East. Most governments since Independence in 1948 had given preference to the South in development work without giving an equal share to the North and East.
Minorities had been unfairly treated even in the case of university admissions. If such things did not happen we would never have faced a 30 year war,Kumaratunga said. She said a group of about 70 students from the North had set up camp in the South and helped to renovate and rehabilitate schools devastated by floods.
Northern Province Education Director Udayakumar also spoke. Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva, former Minister Piyasena Gamage and Provincial Minister U.D.G. Ariyatilleke were present.

Kavindus brilliant three tries in vain  as Navy edges out CR 21-17 in Cup finals
Sensational CR & FC winger cum Sri Lanka national player Kavindu Perera scored three breath taking tries to lead 17 points to 14 but all in vain as Navy A edged out unlucky CR & FC in the last move of the match scoring through Buddhima Piyaratne under the post, finally capping off a thrilling 21 points (3 tries, 3 conversions) to 17 (3 tries, 1 conversions) win in their Dialog A Division inter club rugby sevens cup final encounter played at Race Course international stadium in Colombo yesterday. Navy were holding on to a slender 14-12 lead at lemons.
For Navy, centre Mohamad Abzal, scrum half Samith Danajaya and winger Buddhima Piyaratne scored one try apiece while Thilina Weerasinghe converted all three tries.
Winger Kavindu Perera scored all three tries for the losing CR & FC while captain and srum half Kavindu De Costha slotted in a solitary conversion.
Incidentally CR & FC had not won an inter-club rugby sevens Cup final for the past 26 years, hence they had a tremendous chance yesterday under captain Kavindu De Costa and head coach M.J.M. Mushtaq to end their title drought, but were not lucky enough to do so.
The last time they got into a final was in 1996, where they became the unbeaten sevens Cup champions under former Isipathana hooker Viraj Prashanthas captaincy.

Lankan brands must breakthrough into global markets - Interbrand
Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India, recently in Colombo for the rebranding of HNB by global giant Interbrand and Sri Lankan brand consultancy MND, emphasized the need for Sri Lankan brands to breakthrough into global markets.
It is necessary for Asian brands outside of Japan and South Korea to view the brand as a strategic and long-term investment rather than a cost, said Mishra. Brands are assets that require long-term management and planning. When organizations develop a brand platform and brand architecture that lays the foundation for all marketing activities, they shape perceptions in a coordinated and consistent manner, and create greater impact and operational efficiencies at the same time.
Mishra also stated that with increasing globalization, Asia has many global brands as their primary competition in the domestic market. If Sri Lankan or Indian brands have to do well, they must win against the global brands operating in their markets. That success then needs to be replicated in outside markets.
Mishras comments came on the eve of the launch of Interbrands second Breakthrough Brands report in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Facebook and Ready Set Rocket which recognizes 40 next-generation, disruptive brands that define progress and the potential to grow. The report complements Interbrands annual Best Global Brands report  the most prestigious ranking of the 100 most valuable brands globally  by putting a spotlight on emerging brands that are affecting change and embodying growth.
After analyzing over 350 submissions from global influencers and open public submissions, 40 brands were selected as this years Breakthrough Brands, amongst which Indias start-up poster-brand Flipkart and technology-enabled logistics start-up Rivigo have been featured. Non-carbonated and energy drinks brand Paperboat marketed by Hector Beverages has also been mentioned as one of the worlds most innovative brands, prioritizing craftsmanship and personalization with an authentic and differentiated story that is appealing to the rising middle class consumer in APAC countries.

CMC will not compromise quality, safetyin Kataragama railway project - GM
Priyan de Silva
The China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) is a Chineses Government entity and will not compromise quality, safety or stake its reputation, Matara - Kataragama Railway Extension Project General Manager Tang Ming said.
Ming said this in response to allegations made by former team leader appointed by the project consultants, the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) at press conference recently. We are deeply concerned about the allegations he said.
The Ministry of Transport (MOT) awarded the designing and construction of phase one of the Matara  Kataragama railway extension to China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation while appointing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau as consultants. Phase one which is the 27km stretch from Matara to Beliatta will cost the Sri Lanka government US$ 278 million and is financed by Chinas Exim Bank.
CMC with a staff of over 2000 is experienced in the construction and upgrading of railway lines and has successfully completed the construction of the 158km Ankara - Istanbul high speed railway project in Turkey which commenced in 2006 at a cost of US$ 1.27 billion before engaging in the construction of phase one of the Matara - Kataragama railway extension project in 2010. CMC has also been awarded the locomotive and carriage and construction plants and component assembly project in Myanmar in 2013 at a cost of US$ 102 million and in 2015 was awarded the high speed upgrading of the 926 km Teheran - Mashhad railway project costing US$ 1.69 billion. All the above projects are on a design and build basis and are financed by China Exim Bank. In addition the company has supplied many Diesel locomotives and passenger carriages to Pakistan, Iran, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam,Turkmenistan, Brazil, Cuba and even Sri Lanka CMCs Project Manager in Sri Lanka Wu Fan Yu.
We have cast over 300 concrete girders for the southern railway extension project of which only less than 1% failed certification.
These girders have been discarded and the rest have been launched under the supervision of the CECB and Ministry of Transport. It is the CECB that has been appointed by the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to approve and monitor the design and construction of Phase one of the Matara - Kataragama Railway extension and engineers from CECB are expected to approve contract material submissions, contract methods and monitor every step of the construction process. It is only once they certify that we can proceed with the construction or move on to the next step explained Tang.
It is true that the project is behind schedule. There are many reasons for the delay including adverse weather conditions and also include delays caused by CECB as they lacked sufficient experienced personnel, failed to review documents within the stipulated time (21 days) and lacked construction practice and professional capacity to engage in a new railway construction project such as this one
It is the Ministry of Transport the client that appoints the Project Consultants and CMC is bound to comply with the consultants requirements and recommendations. We have no authority to hire or fire CECB personnel. In most probability the CECBs project consultant may have been replaced as he lacked professional experience and knowledge of new railway construction project, poor management of the CECB site team and impolite behavior for which he had been warned on more than one occasion by the MOT. If the allegations made by the former CECB team leader why didnt he reveal these incidents when they occurred and wait till he was replaced to tarnish CMCs reputation, Tang queried.

Question
Can I appoint the Public Trustee as the executor of my Last Will
Daily News readerAnswer
A person can appoint the Public Trustee as the executor of his last will, if he wishes so. A receipt is issued in acknowledgement of its safety to a person who places the last will in the custody of the Public Trustee and the person who submits that receipt after his death can have the last will opened. If the Public Trustee has been appointed as the executor then, he could intervene for the commencement of testamentary proceedings and if the Public Trustee has not been appointed as the executor, the last will is released to the executor mentioned therein for necessary action.
If you need to appoint the Public Trustee as the executor/trustee of your last will, all you have to do is to add the clause 'I do hereby appoint the Public Trustee of Sri Lanka as the executor of my last will' or if you wish to appoint him as the trustee as well, to add the clause 'appoint the Public Trustee of Sri Lanka as executor and trustee of my last will.'Obtaining lost document due to natural disaster

His Attorney-at-Law requested the court to refer this matter to the family counsel. We thought to settle down again for the sake of our child. We lived together for two weeks. In the meantime, I withdrew the maintenance case, but he started fighting with me again and we separated. Recently, I got to know that I am pregnant because of my husband. Now he says this is not his child. As the divorce case is still pending, what are the legal remedies available for me Will this situation make a favour on my husband to divorce me
Frustrated wife
Answer
As there is no settlement, you can proceed with the divorce case. You can file a fresh maintenance case against your husband and claim maintenance for you and your children. If he denies paternity, then you can ask for a DNA test. If the DNA test says that he is not the father of your child, then your and newly born child will not get maintenance. If he has filed the divorce case on the ground of adultery, the result of the DNA test will affect the divorce case. Ownership of a leased property
Question
I leased my apartment to a person 8 years ago. Every year I am renewing the Lease Agreement and he is living with his family for 8 years. He pays monthly rentals properly. However, I am scared whether he will claim the ownership of my apartment as he is living there continuously for 8 years. Please advise me
Manatunga, Panadura
Answer
As he is using your property under a valid lease agreement, he cant claim the ownership of the property and both parties are liable to follow the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement. If one part breaches the condition, then the other party can go to the District Court on breach of contract and seek legal remedies.

Longstanding literary relationship
The George Eliot of popular imagination is something of a contradiction  an honorary man upon whom the Victorians bestowed the status of literary greatness, even as they flinched at the illegitimacy of her marriage to George Henry Lewes. And while Eliots lofty status  combined with her living in sin  prevented her from maintaining close ties with some of the eras supposedly more respectable female writers, one author in particular went out of her way to befriend her.
Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of the anti-slavery novel Uncle Toms Cabin, was the literary celebrity of the age. Her book, a phenomenon in Britain as well as America, had inspired popular songs, unofficial porcelain figurines, and was cited by some as a cause of the American Civil War. Since each was then the most famous female author on their respective side of the Atlantic, it stands to reason that the two would have felt they had something special in common. Yet many biographers have written off the relationship as merely that of casual correspondents. As part of the research for our new book on female literary friendships, we decided to seek out the pairs letters to put this assumption to the test.
Published letters
Remarkably, a significant portion of Stowes correspondence to Eliot has never made it into print, remaining stored in a locked researchers room deep within the New York Public Library. But when pieced together with Eliots published letters, it reveals that, while the two never met, they established an epistolary bond that was not only deeply personal but historically significant.
Even in the greeting of her first letter to Eliot, dated April 1869, Stowe  then fifty-seven  addressed her recipient warmly as My Dear Friend. Suggesting that she already knew the forty-nine-year-old Eliot intimately through extensive readings of her books, Stowe wasted no time in giving the British writer a frank appraisal of her personality  which she characterized as thoroughly English  and even offered both praise and criticism of Eliots writing style. Stowe applauded the morality of Eliots writing while suggesting that her novels had not, as of yet, lived up to the best aspects of her shorter stories.
When Eliot received these pages several weeks later, she did not take offence. Indeed, she warmed to Stowes ebullient personality, delighting in the description of her winter home amid an orange grove in Florida.
Although she was more reserved by nature than Stowe, Eliot replied soon afterwards in strikingly candid fashion. She alluded to her own frequent bouts of depression and surprisingly for a modern audience aware of her legacy  to her lapses in confidence about her literary abilities. Stowes words, she said, had assured her that her own work had been worth doing. Stowes original letter to Eliot, while unexpected, had not come entirely unbidden. The women had a mutual friend in the American writer Annie Adams Fields and, through her, Eliot had sent a message to Stowe some time before. But rather than writing immediately, as she had originally intended, Stowe had left it many months before getting in touch.
What was her reason for making contact then Stowes new novel, Oldtown Folks, was about to be published, and, since she would send a copy to Eliot soon afterwards, it looks as if Stowe might have been hoping to engineer some kind of endorsement from her fellow author. It wasnt long before Stowe looked again to Eliot for help  and this time in a much more controversial matter.
Veil of silence
A decade-and-a-half before, during her first tour of Britain, Stowe had got to know Lady Anne Isabella Byron, the widow of the famous poet. At that time, Lady Byron had shared with Stowe the secret that her late husband had engaged in incest with his half-sister. Lady Byron was considering speaking out on the subject, but a shocked Stowe had counselled her friend to continue to keep her sacred veil of silence.
But in May 1869, with Lady Byron now deceased, Stowe had begun to rethink this advice. She had just discovered a new book about the poets life written by his final mistress, Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli, which depicted Lady Byron as a cold and unreasonable woman. Stowe was angered by this characterization of her late friend, who had already suffered much anguish and humiliation. Armed with the explosive rumour, Stowe set out to put the record straight in an essay published simultaneously in Americas Atlantic Monthly and Macmillans in Britain.
There may well have been some truth in Stowes claim. But critics on both sides of the ocean  appalled that such an unseemly allegation should have been aired in this way  poured scorn on her essay, The True Story of Lady Byrons Life. Stowe sent an advance copy of the article to Eliot, who shuddered at its contents. Rather than publicly support her new friend, as Stowe might have hoped, Eliot wrote to her privately to say she felt the Byron question should not have been brought before the public.
Though no doubt disappointed, Stowe found many other times when she and Eliot could come together. In their letters, they commiserated with each other on their various troubles and talked, largely with pleasure, about their domestic lives  Stowe sidestepping the awkward subject of Eliots unwed status by referring to Lewes as Eliots husband and choosing to think of Eliot as a married woman, like herself.
Eliot, for her part, turned to Stowe as a literary confidante. Given that, in Uncle Toms Cabin, Stowe had written about the engrained racial prejudices of white American society, it is perhaps unsurprising that Eliot should have been keen to discuss with her the treatment of Jewish people  a subject Eliot tackled in her final novel, Daniel Deronda. The American serialization of this as well as Middlemarch allowed Stowe to give her friend an ongoing and sometimes astonishingly frank critique of the works as they unfolded.
Today, these two writers are often regarded as polar opposites, with Eliot very much part of the literary canon, and Stowe derided as sentimental. But in their own time their differences would not have appeared as stark, either to the public or to each other.
Rare genius
Despite her criticism of Eliots writing, Stowe appreciated the British authors talents. More importantly perhaps, from a modern perspective, Eliot was a great admirer of Stowe.
Many years before they became personally acquainted, she had praised the creator of Uncle Toms Cabin as a writer of rare genius. In fact, the influence of that most famous of Stowes books, about the suffering of African American slaves at the hands of their masters, can be felt in Eliots Daniel Deronda. Yet, the pairs common interests did not prevent their differences from sometimes looming large. Eliot had, famously, given up her adherence to organized religion in her youth, whereas Stowe remained a devout Christian  which she combined with a passionate interest in spiritualism. Stowes letters to Eliot contain a number of pages devoted to descriptions of the work of spiritualist practitioners, her husbands visions of paranormal apparitions and the sances she herself attended. Sometimes Eliot wrote back politely, or simply made no comment on these outpourings. But at others, Stowes enthusiasm proved too much for the rational Eliot.
Enormously improbable
When Stowe wrote to describe a session during which, with the help of a medium, she had managed to contact the spirit of the late Charlotte Bront<U+0451>, Eliot responded in no uncertain terms. Whether rightly or not, she told her friend, the incident seemed to her enormously improbable. - Times Literary Supplement

Microsoft inspires women at inaugural gathering
Over 30 female business leaders participated
Microsoft introduced a worldwide community for professional women in Sri Lanka called Women Think Next, recently.
The inaugural event touched on changing workplace roles of women, revealed how digital transformation provides them opportunities in emerging job categories and emphasized the importance of women entering the technology field.
Over 30 female business leaders were there as part of the gathering; they listened to a panel of influential womenrepresentatives of the tech industrydiscuss integrating diversity and inclusion into the workplace to empower women to do and achieve more.
Chitranganie Mubarak, Chairperson at ICTA Sri Lanka gave the keynote address and shared some of her observations. By now, Ive grown accustomed to being one of the few women in the boardroom. Ive gone to meetups and networking events that at times felt more like a brotherhood than a gathering of like-minded tech enthusiasts. This has to change because the industry is losing out on the skills, passion, diligence and perseverance that women bring to the table.
In recent years, digital transformation has created a new category of jobs which has opened up more opportunities for women. And its encouraging to see young women increasingly enrolling in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) related fields. In spite of this, a mere 26 percent of STEM graduates are women and not all of them opt to remain in STEM. They need us and we need to act now. We have to encourage them to pursue careers in STEM and combat the unconscious bias. Engaging young women in ICT sector work is not only the right thing to do from the point of social justice, its also smart economics, Mubarak said.
Later, Michelle Simmons, Microsoft General Manager for Southeast Asia New Markets, led a panel that included: Kasturi Wilson, Managing Director for Hemas Pharmaceuticals and Hemas Logistics & Maritime Cluster; Lakmini Wijesundera, IronOne Technologies and BoardPAC Co-founding Director and CEO; Jayomi Lokuliyana, Co-founder and CEO for zMessenger; and Chandrima Rodrigo, Head of IT, Ceylon Biscuits; Helen de Fonseka, Head of IT, ACL Cables.
The panelists spoke about their experiences as leaders in the local tech industry and highlighted the importance for employers to encourage diversity in the industry, and help women to remain in the workforce.
Women need to define their goals without any influence or limitation imposed on them by society or tradition. We need to encourage them to set their goals high. After all, a woman's worth is no greater than her ambitions. At Microsoft, we recognise and value the role that women play in the industry. We believe that women are critical to innovation as they offer a different perspective, and an important part of innovation in technology is about identifying and incorporating diverse perspectives, Simmons said.
At the close of the event, panelists urged members of the audience to help young women embrace technology by instructing them on how to use and create technology to become drivers of innovation and growth within their communities.
The panel also encouraged women seeking upward mobility to leverage their networks by having a support system in place and to support their peers ambitions.
Microsoft has a long track record of taking an innovative approach to encourage and engage more girls in the exciting world of technology.

Microsoft will continue to drive a busy program which will introduce even more young women to coding through Hour of Code Projects. Sessions that provide an introduction to computer science and explain and show the importance of coding.

Mister Lytle: An Essay
When I was twenty years old, I became a kind of apprentice to a man named Andrew Lytle, whom pretty much no one apart from his negligibly less ancient sister, Polly, had addressed except as Mister Lytle in at least a decade. She called him Brother. Or BruthaI dont suppose either of them had ever voiced a terminal. His two grown daughters did call him Daddy. Certainly I never felt even the most obscure impulse to call him Andrew, or old man, or any other familiarism, though he frequently gave me to know it would be all right if I were to call him mon vieux. He, for his part, called me boy, and beloved, and once, in a letter, Breath of My Nostrils.
He was about to turn ninety-two when I moved into his basement, and he had not yet quite reached ninety-three when they buried him the next winter, in a coffin I had helped to makea cedar coffin, because it would smell good, he said. I wasnt that helpful.
Remembered life
I sat up a couple of nights in a freezing, starkly lit workshop rubbing beeswax into the boards. The other, older menwe were four altogetherabsorbedly sawed and planed. They chiseled dovetail joints. My experience in woodworking hadnt gone past feeding planks through a band saw for shop class, and thered be no time to redo anything I might botch, so I followed instructions and with rags cut from an undershirt worked coats of wax into the cedar until its ashen whorls glowed purple, as if with remembered life.
The man overseeing this vigil was a luthier named Roehm whose house stood back in the woods on the edge of the plateau. He was about six and a half feet tall with floppy bangs and a deep, grizzled mustache. He wore huge glasses. I believe I have never seen a person more tense than Roehm was during those few days. The cedar was greenit hadnt been properly cured. He groaned that it wouldnt behave. On some level he must have resented the haste.
Lytle had lain dying for weeks; he endured a series of disorienting pin strokes. By the end they were giving him less water than morphine. He kept saying, Time to go home, which at first meant he wanted us to take him back to his house, his real house, that he was tired of the terrible simulacrum wed smuggled him to, in his delirium. Later, as those fevers drew together into what seemed an unbearable clarity, like a blue flame behind the eyes, the phrase came to mean what one would assume.
Fundamental incredulity
He had a deathbed, in other words. He didnt go suddenly. Yet although his family and friends had known for years about his wish to lie in cedar, which required that a coffin be custom made, no one had so much as played with the question of who in those mountains could do such a thing or how much time the job would take. I dont hold it against themagainst usthe avoidance of duty, owing as it did to fundamental incredulity.
Lytles whole existence had for so long been essentially posthumous, hed never risk seeming so ridiculous as to go actually dying now. My grandfather had told me once that when hed been at Sewanee, in the thirties, people had looked at Lytle as something of an old man, a full sixty years before I met him.
And he nursed this impression, with his talk of coming to live in the sense of eternity, and of the world he grew up inMiddle Tennessee at the crack of the twentieth centuryhaving more in common with Europe in the Middle Ages than with the South he lived to see. - Paris Review

Nadal wins: record-breaking 10th French Open
Paris: Rafael Nadal coasted to a record 10th French Open title on Sunday, demolishing Stan Wawrinka in a brutally one-sided final which also earned the Spaniard a 15th Grand Slam crown.
Nadal, 31, triumphed 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 to become the first man in history to win the same major 10 times.
His collection of Slams now stands just three behind great rival Roger Federer, a staggering statistic coming just a year after he quit Roland Garros with a wrist injury.
Playing in his 22nd Grand Slam final, Nadal triumphed in Paris without dropping a set for a third time.
He also lost just 35 games in total and only six in the final, his most comprehensive victory since allowing Roger Federer four games in the 2008 final.
Its really incredible. To win La Decima is very, very special, said Nadal.
I am very emotional. The feeling I have is impossible to describe.
Its difficult to compare with other tournaments but the nerves and adrenaline I feel, its like no other place.
Once Hollywood A-lister Nicole Kidman had helped unbox the Coupe des Mousquetaires to a crowd already wilting in 30-degree heat, the final was underway.
It was the 22nd Slam finale for Nadal; just the fourth for Wawrinka, the oldest man in the championship match in 44 years. Sunday was also the first time since 1969 that the Roland Garros final had featured two men over 30. Despite having spent more than five hours on court getting to the final, 2015 champion Wawrinka had the first break point in the third game.
The 32-year-old couldnt take it and it proved to be the only break point he earned all afternoon.
From there, it was all downhill.
Nadal was unable to convert four break points in the fourth game.
No matter as he broke through for 4-2 and then went to set point in the eighth game after a relentless forehand barrage sapped the will out of Wawrinka.
A backhand which sailed long gave Nadal the first set with the Spaniard having crunched 10 winners to Wawrinkas four while committing half the unforced errors. Nadal forced Wawrinka into another forehand error to break for 2-0 in the second set before the Swiss halted a run of seven games lost with a hold for 1-3.
But the song remained the same, Nadal taking the set in the ninth game, just moments after Wawrinka, who knocked out world number one Andy Murray in the semis, had destroyed a racquet in utter frustration.
First game of the third set and Nadal broke again as the man who stunned him in the 2014 Australian Open final suffered further damage.
Nadal was soon a double break to the good for 4-1, held for 5-1 and then claimed a huge slice of history when Wawrinka limply dropped a backhand into the net. AFP

Nasdaq 100 hits another record high
The Nasdaq 100 index, which largely tracks large-cap tech stocks, rose to a new high on Thursday.
What's striking is just how un-unusual this now is. In fact, as of Thursday's close, the index has hit record highs in 9 of the past 11 sessions.
The Nasdaq 100 also has logged gains in 24 of the past 30 sessions, for an incredible 80 percent win rate.
"The market is suffering from an extreme case of 'FOMO'  this is a clear case of 'fear of missing out.' Everyone wants to be in, and nobody wants to miss out," Chantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez diagnosed Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation."
In other words, the string of positive sessions and the index's striking 21 percent gain this year have led more and more investors to jump in.
"People feel comfortable buying tech stocks, and ultimately that's what's leading this market higher," IITrader's chief market strategist, Bill Baruch, said Thursday on "Trading Nation." Investors "worry about selling out of good positions, so no one wants to sell, and people just keep buying higher."
"Once the market does start to correct, you will see a big fear, and that's going to overexaggerate a move to the downside," Baruch added. He says he wouldn't be surprised to see a 10 percent drop that brings the Nasdaq 100 back to its late March lows.

Negotiate best possible deal  for Htota Port - CB Governor
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy stressed the need to negotiate the best possible deal for the long-term lease of the Hambantota Port.
The Governor expressing his personal view about the Hambantota port development project noted that he didnt see the Hambantota Port as an isolated project. He was speaking at the 22nd convocation of The Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL) held at the BMICH, recently.
Leasing the port is only a piece in a much bigger picture. Since independence, we have been able to do very little for the people of Monaragala and Uva. People of Hambantota have some assets which are not working for them.
The China Merchants plan to develop the whole area in the Hambantota Port would create much-needed employment opportunities for the people in Hambantota as well as Monaragala. Similarly, Japan, India and Singapore plan to develop the Trincomalee area and would also create opportunities for the people of Rajarata as well, the Governor said.
In addition, South Korea and Andra Pradesh have shown keen interest in developing the Kurunegala and Kuliyapitiya areas while Japan is also supporting the Kandy development project.
According to Dr. Coomaraswamy, there is considerable support from the international partners to take forward major area development projects in Hambantota, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya and other areas in the country.
Noting that the proposed development plans were sound, the governor stressed that concerted efforts were needed to make sure that the plans were taken forward to realize the set economic targets. The Governor further noted that plans were also put in place to support the growth framework of the economy in the area of investment policy and promotion, trade policy and trade facilitation.
There are measures being undertaken for the effective improvements of all these areas, particularly to strengthen the growth framework going forward.
In addition, CBSL is introducing a flexible inflation targeting regime for monetary policy, which would enable the CBSL to have a much more forward looking, proactive monitory policy.

An open letter to President Maithripala Sirisena:  EXTINCT IS FOREVER
Dear Mr President,
I write as a concerned citizen of Sri Lanka. I have lived all my life in this country and truly appreciate the supremely beautiful flora and fauna that we are blessed with. My entire family emigrated to Australia, but it never entered my head to do the same and turn my back on my Motherland.
However, I am deeply saddened at the last few decades of wanton destruction of the environment. Sure, development must take place, but I personally know of many instances when environmental impact assessment reports are not carried out before undertaking major projects, in spite of vetos from the Central Environmental Authority and other environmentalists, who have done in-depth studies and research.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime created havoc in the Hambantota/Mattala/Colombo Port areas. Dont take my word for it -look for yourselves. Is this sustainable development Now that the damage is done and white elephants have been created, your government has no option but to make the best of it, inheriting enormous debts to the Chinese government and others.
But the point is: are you and your government going to make the same mistakes
I voted for you, along with many of my friends. I personally was delighted that in your Manifesto you included protection of animals. I believed you and had great expectations of a radically changed society (Yahapalanaya), where citizens live by the rule of law. I am Chairperson of The Animal Protection Trust and can tell you that your Ministers and other government officials continuously block our efforts to promote the Animal Welfare Bill and the setting up of an independent Animal Authority.
Only last week there was another tragedy on the Habarana Road, where a baby elephant was killed by a speeding bus. Its mother tried to resuscitate it, by which time a crowd of people had gathered. To the humans, this was a chance to take photographs and videos, but to the mother elephant, it was intense sadness and bereavement. Animals, especially elephants, are intelligent and family orientated. Eventually, the mother was shot dead by the Police, I am told. Where were the Wildlife officers Why could not the elephant have been tranquilised The driver of the bus was apparently remanded. I can bet my bottom dollar that some politico will intervene and the driver will go scott free, without a fine or jail sentence.
So, two more elephants lose their lives. Totally preventable deaths.
A well-known animal activist contacted the Provincial Councillor of the North Central Province, offering, at her own expense, to erect large luminous signboards and speed humps on roads where wildlife cross and are vulnerable.
This was in April of this year. She had no response whatsoever. There was no commission or money to be gained, so the authorities were just not interested. Money and Power -thats the name of the game!
Mr President, you and your government promote Buddhism and tolerance for all other religions, but the stark reality is that this country has a very bad track record relating to the protection of animals. The Buddha, who preached compassion to all living beings, must weep to see the misery and abuse that is taking place. You have the authority, given by us, the citizens of this country, to take action.
Live up to your noble traditions and take note before it is too late. Gather around you educated, sensible people to carry out your orders, not giving way to the ignorant, greedy, self-seeking officials, who have no love for the country. Take heed, or you will live to regret it.
In the final analysis, we should be true to ourselves. You are in a position to rule the land without fear or favour.
Do it!

OTP reaches out to flood victims
Despite the owners being overseas, it didnt take too long for the management and staff of the Owl and the Pussycat resort hotel (OTP) in Thalpe to hear the call of distress and lend a hand to the people in the neighbourhood who were badly affected by the floods.
Matara Walpola had families who had lost their homes and had taken shelter in the nearby temple. The GramaSevaka also rose to the call of need and helped the staff to identify the areas and the quickest way to get there.
The Sri Lanka Army, without whose help this exercise could not have been carried out, also joined hands with the hotel and rushed to their assistance. They helped transport the goods.
Members of the staff together with the kitchen brigade prepared meals for 200 displaced people. Whilst the meals were given personally to the people by the staff, dry rations were handed over to the temple authorities. Truckloads of water were also taken to the stricken areas.
Wading through the waters that had risen inundating the roads, the staff carried the provisions to those in need. Though this relief effort took place six days after the main flooding, families were still searching for their lost loved ones and even pets. A spokesperson commented that the water had receded and families were trying to get back to their homes.
Resident guests of the hotel have also pledged their contributions to this cause to help ease the burden of these suffering people.

Pakistan and Sri Lanka  set for Champions 'quarter-final'
CARDIFF: Pakistan and Sri Lanka head into their concluding group Champions Trophy group match knowing it's a virtual 'quarter-final' after producing two of the tournament's biggest upsets so far.
Monday's match in Cardiff has the look of a 'dead rubber' about it after Pakistan suffered a 124-run thrashing by arch-rivals and Champions Trophy title-holders India in their opening Group B match.
But now, in the words of Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, the final round of fixtures in this pool are a must-win game for all of us in the group. Sri Lanka too suffered an almost as heavy a loss in going down by 96 runs to South Africa first up in a tournament featuring the world's top eight one-day international teams. But Pakistan bounced back to beat top-ranked South Africa by 19 runs on Wednesday at Edgbaston -- the ground where they had succumbed so to India just days earlier.
And 24 hours later, Sri Lanka had a winning return at the Oval courtesy of a stunning seven-wicket success against India.
Having conceded 319 for three against India, Pakistan restricted South Africa to 219 for eight.
After the spinners did the initial damage, paceman Hasan Ali took three for 24 in eight overs.
Babar Azam and Shoaib Malik then got Pakistan ahead of their required run-rate to secure a 19-run win under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method when rain stopped play with their side 119 for three off 27 overs.
Trying to explain the turnaround in his team's fortunes, Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed said: We had a good bowling meeting.
We took wickets. If you take wickets, every good team feels under pressure.
Pakistan were also inspired by playing in front of a partisan crowd, something they have rarely enjoyed since a 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore led to them playing most of their major matches overseas.
That is a feeling we miss, not playing in Pakistan, said Sarfraz.
Maybe that was a difference, the crowd was supporting us and that's why the players were boosted.
 Sri Lanka too did not lack for support at the Oval as they turned the tables on India in dramatic fashion. Set 322 to win, Sri Lanka knocked off the runs with eight balls to spare thanks to contributions from Kusal Mendis (89), Danushka Gunathilaka (76) and all-rounder Mathews (52).
It's one of the top wins, to beat India, said Mathews.
The bowlers did brilliantly to restrict India to 321.
It was a very chaseable target.
Not many people expected us to win and that took a lot of pressure off us. Mondays match is the only Group B fixture taking place in Cardiff. Pakistan do have some recent knowledge of the ground beaten England there by four wickets in a one-day international last year.
Left-arm spinner Imad Wasim starred with both bat and ball in that Cardiff clash and he will hope for more success upon on his return 'home' -- he was born in the nearby town of Swansea.

Partnered in human  kindness
In 2016 in Istanbul, five coreresponsibilities were highlighted in the Agenda for Humanity presented by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. They were: (i) political leadership to prevent and end the conflict; (ii) upholding the norms that safeguard humanity; (iii) leaving no one behind; (iv) changing peoples lives by
moving from delivering aid to ending need; and (v) investing in humanity.
More than 150 representatives of national governments representing ministries of foreign affairs, national disaster management offices and military responders represented by national, regional and international civil society and non-governmental organisations, regional organisations, the private sector and academia met in Bangkok last week. Forum met first a decade ago, in the Republic of Korea. Since then, meetings have been held in Singapore, Indonesia, China and Thailand.
Agenda for Humanity
In 2016 in Istanbul, five core responsibilities were highlighted in the Agenda for Humanity presented by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
They were: (i) political leadership to prevent and end the conflict; (ii) upholding the norms that safeguard humanity; (iii) leaving no one behind; (iv) changing peoples lives by moving from delivering aid to ending need; and (v) investing in humanity. More than 20 global initiatives were launched in Istanbul. They include, among others, the Grand Bargain on Efficiency, The New Way of Working, The Global Partnership for Preparedness, and the Connecting Business Initiative.

The core commitments on natural disasters and climate change resonated, in particular, were supported by this region  including:
1. Reinforce national and local leadership and capacities in managing disaster and climate-related risks through strengthened preparedness and predictable response and recovery arrangements.
2. Improve the understanding, anticipation and preparedness for disaster and climate-related risks by investing in data, analysis and early warning, and developing evidence-based decision-making processes that result in early action.
3. Increase investment in building community resilience as a critical first line of response, with the full and effective participation of women, and
4. Ensure regional and global humanitarian assistance for natural disasters complements national and local efforts.
Regional adaptation of the agenda for humanity
First, implementation of the WHS commitments must reflect priorities of national governments that are likely to host international assistance to ensure that response provided is consistent with humanitarian principles and standards.
Second, discuss New Ways of Working in this region in practical and operational terms. The concept highlights the need to develop multi-year and multi-stakeholder planning and funding arrangements for coordinated emergency response, preparedness, and resilience.
Third, need to improve understanding of risks, and develop evidence-based decision-making processes that result in timely actions. This is particularly important in the context of slow-onset disasters, like those triggered by El Nio last year.
Fourth, we should discuss a set of more specific themes from the WHS with significant operational implications in this region, particularly those called for by the Grand Bargain, Supporting community engagement through two-way communications and reinforcing accountability mechanisms.
And finally, discuss the evolving humanitarian financing landscape in Asia and related opportunities and challenges.

Pathfinder Foundation engages in Blue Economy roundtable
The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation conducted a roundtable discussion on Bilateral Cooperation for promoting Blue Economy in collaboration with the Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF) based in New Delhi, recently.
The focus of discussion centered on the theme Sustainable Exploitation of Marine Resources. Three main areas were addressed during the two-day meeting, namely, sustainable exploitation of living resources such as fish and other life forms, exploitation of non-living resources such as hydrocarbons and sea bed minerals, and maritime security issues associated with the Blue Economy.
Discussions relating to these broad areas were based on Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the United Nations to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources.
The Pathfinder delegation was led by its Chairman, Bernard Goonetilleke, and comprised Admiral (Dr.) Jayanath Colombage, Director of the Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives, Tilak Dharmaratne, Vice Chancellor of the Ocean University, Dr. Muttukrishna Saravananthan, Principal Researcher of the Point Pedro Institute of Development and Ameera Arooz, Project Manager of the Pathfinder Foundation.
Representing the Indian side was General NC Vij, Director VIF, Vice Admiral (Rtd.) Anil Chopra, Dr. Shailesh Nayak, distinguished scientist, Dr. Vijay Sakhaja, Director National Maritime Foundation, Lieutenant General Ravi Sawhney, Dean, Center for Defence Studies-VIF, Commodore Gopal Suri, Senior Fellow, VIF and a host of other distinguished research fellows. A rich array of academic papers was presented by both sides, followed by discussions to derive the best possible outcome from the roundtable. In addition to the facets of the Blue Economy, strategic dimension of the Indian Ocean Region was also discussed.
Possible collaboration between the two countries for jointly studying the marine environment, digitalising the blue economy and sharing technical expertise were also discussed. The meeting observed that oceans, seas and coastal areas are the largest ecosystem in the world vital for livelihood and food security of billions of people as well as economic prosperity for many countries.
With the expected increase in the world population from seven to nine billion within the next 40 years, nations will look at seas as a source for feeding their increasing populations and extraction of mineral wealth lying at the bottom of the seabed.
It was also noted that apart from fisheries, major part of world shipping, whether container, bulk cargo or crude oil transportation is done by sea and they have also become major targets for exploration and production of crude oil and gas, essential for global industries. Given the importance of oceans for the survival of mankind, strong political vision is required to ensure collaboration in all areas of the Blue Economy, as there is a need for shared commitment to ensure sustainability of ocean-based development.
It was acknowledged that both living and non-living resources in the oceans are finite, humans are destroying the oceans and living entities by dumping plastics, garbage and other industrial pollutants and the oceans will not be able to cope up with such indiscriminate acts any longer.
The meeting agreed to prepare an outcome document incorporating the salient points brought up during the discussion and recommendations for cooperation between India and Sri Lanka, which would be helpful for policy makers and other stakeholders, who have an interest in this subject.

Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) yesterday demanded a 6.5 percent increase of private bus fare according to the annual bus fare revision.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said private bus fares should be increased by July 1 due to the unchanged prices of fuel, overhead costs for service and repair, salaries of the crew, tyres and tubes and other maintenance.
The annual bus fare revision would take place every year in July and bus fares are revised based on a special formula taking into account various factors such as the rate of inflation, the price of a litre of diesel, electricity charges, maintenance costs and the price of tyres and other spare parts, he added.
We are waiting for the National Transport Commissions decision on fare increase which is yet to be reached, he added.

Programme to combat childhood obesity
The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and Education Ministries are to implement a programme to increase physical activity among schoolchildren and promote healthy eating habits to combat the increasing trend of childhood obesity in the country.
The proposal which was approved by Cabinet last week seeks to implement the following in its programme:
Allocate a compulsory half an hour for physical activity per day in schools, ban sponsorship for school sports activities by those companies promoting unhealthy food, screen all food advertisements that specifically target children before telecast, establish physical activity promoting outdoor/play areas in all townships and housing projects to promote physical activity of children which can include the family, control selling of unhealthy food items within 100 metres from school premises, take policy decisions to limit the production of unhealthy food, labelling and stating nutritional value of the food items should be made compulsory, the upper sugar limit of the yellow colour code should at least be reduced to 6 percent from the present 11 percent, prevent school children from appearing in media advertisements which promote food items containing high levels of sugar, salt and oil, prohibit serving unhealthy food items in programmes in which school children are participating.
Around 59 percent of deaths in Sri Lankan are caused by Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and the majority of these deaths are under the age of 60. Out of the four main risk factors identified for development of NCDs; namely unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke or the effects of the harmful use of alcohol, the Ministry of Health has identified, Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity as the two risk factors commonly seen among adolescents in Sri Lanka.

Provincial Council elections  cannot be postponed - Deshapriya
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said when the official term of a provincial council ends; the date of election to appoint new members must be announced by the Commission within a week.
A provincial council election could be postponed only in the case of a tragedy like the one which occurred recently or by a popular mandate or court decision. A Minister or any other has no powers to postpone a provincial council election in accordance with the law he added.
The term of three provincial councils, namely Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa are slated to expire this September.
Deshapriya said this in response to questions raised by the media when he participated in a shramadana campaign jointly organised by officials of the Elections Department and the Ratnapura Municipal Council to collect and dispose plastic and other non degradable waste in the flood affected Ratnapura on Saturday.
Commenting on Pradesheeya Sabha or Municipal Council elections, Deshapriya said three factors had to be fullfilled to hold such polls. He said some of them have been already completed. The subject Minister is due to present the relevant Bill in Parliament shortly.After Parliament approves the Speaker will give his ascent to it and the Act will be effective after July 1. Earlier the Elections Commissioner had powers to act on his own. But now delays have occurred because there were three officers to take deciisions he added.
Deshapriya said postponement of elections was not a phenomenon peculiar to the last two years only. Earlier there were local bodies in the Batticaloa district where elections were not held for four years. Electoral Register revision applications are being received by the Elections Department in June as done customarily every year. In the case of flood and landslide affected districts revision work will be completed by the end of July or August this year.
Deshapriya said he is prepared to hold elections to Provincial Councils completing their office shortly including Sabaragamuwa .

Rathupaswala Shooting : The predicament prevails
A few metres from the Belummahara junction, on the main Kandy-Colombo road, lies Suresh Pereras grocery shop. He minds the shop while his boss is away and most of his days are spent weighing and selling basic groceries. In his spare time, he is the convener of the Siyane Environment Protection Movement (SEPM), the environmental organization which was central in fighting for the water rights of the residents of Ratuhpaswala and surrounding areas.
Over three and a half years after the brutal killings in Rathupaswala, the area which was once an intense battlefield between government forces and villagers who were demanding for clean drinking water; is quiet and yet, unsettled.
1Perera, last week, came to fisticuffs with one of his neighbours, He has read the book which recently came out about Rathupaswala. The book thanks my boss for his efforts in keeping the fight going. This man was on the side of the factory, so he was quite angry with that. The struggle split our village in two, said Perera.
A.U. AdhikariGamini WaragodaSuresh Perera. Pictures by Nirosh Batepola.
Almost 23 years after the Hayleys Group Dipped Product Venigros Factory first came into Nedungamuwa in the Gampaha District, it has left Nedungamuwa and the surrounding villages divided, the religious institutions shaken, its people sick and environment destroyed.
The fight is not yet over. The sludge from the factory still remains on the fields and other areas. As long as the sludge remains, the groundwater cannot completely recover, he said as he struggles to motivate the people to continue the fight for clean water.
The majority of those who followed him on to the streets of Welliweriya on August 1, 2013, however, are tired of the struggle today. People no longer track the pH of the water in their wells. They have got used to the pipe-borne water, said Perera, who has found, at times, to be fighting a long battle to keep the memory of the injustice alive in the minds of his people.
Waiting for water
The actions of the rubber glove factory had affected the groundwater of 28 Grama Niladhari divisions, but thus far, only 12 have been provided with pipe-borne water at a concessional rate of Rs. 3000this was done in 2014.
Those who are lucky to get water have to wake up at 1-2am to stock up on it. The water then stops at 4am. During the drought, there was hardly enough water and even the wells had dried up, said A.U. Adhikari, who lives less than a kilometre from the factory and a member of SEPM. Adhikari played a key role during the struggle; a well-to-do businessman with political clout in the area, he helped get bail for many villagers who were unjustly arrested by the Police.
When we complained to the Water Board, they said that there wasnt enough pressure to send water continuously here and that Kadawatha was not giving us an extra supply, he said.
Adhikari, along with many people who have to make do with a poor water supply or a lack of it, have gone back to their old wells for water. They stressed that their water quality had improved vastly ever since the factory shut down in 2013.
The pH in my well was at 2.8 at one time. When the water splashed on to our body, it used to burn and cause rashes. I used to travel to my wifes home in Ganemulla once a week to bring a van full of water for us to use. I could not wear trousers at one point. It is much better today, but we are still too scared to drink it, said Gamini Waragoda, a retired accountant and treasurer of the SEPM.
Waragoda added that while their water no longer burns, there were many wells in the surrounding areas which were still badly affected, We let those who have no water connections to come and take water from our well because they are quite desperate; they can no longer rely on their own wells and they dont have access to pipe borne water, he said.
Jude Perera, a resident of Uruwala in Nedungamuwa, was shot in the back during the protest in 2013. A three-wheeler driver by profession, he complained that he could no longer drive for long periods of time without taking regular breaks. He is among the several hundreds of villagers yet to receive pipe-borne water, We have gone back to drinking water from our wells now. What other choice do we have When we asked the water board for water, they said, you dont even have a pipeline, how can you apply for a connection said Perera as he explained that only the villages closest to the factory were given pipe-borne water in 2014 and since then, no new connections were built.
They have also not measured the recent pH levels of their water. We dont taste the difference anymore, but it is drinkable, he said.
Compensation
In April of this year, the government paid Rs 4.8 million in compensation for 33 people who were shot by the army in 2013. Jude Perera received Rs. 50,000 for his injury. I do not think I have been paid enough. I have spent more than that in hospitals and I still cannot fully bend. Those who cannot work at all got Rs. 500,000, but I think I should have got more as I can no longer earn as much as I used to, he said.
The government also paid Rs. 1 million each to the families of the three youths who were shot dead.
Suresh Perera, however, believed that the compensation was fair, I know many have complaints, but the government did the assessment based on their injuries, he said.
Justice
This year also marked a major breakthrough in the cases of shooting in Rathupaswalathe arrest of Brigadier Anura Deshapriya by the CID in May for having led the attack on the ground. In the villages in which the shootings took place, however, the reaction to the arrest was mixed.
There has been talk that perhaps we should let things go now that the factory is closed and people have got compensation. They do not like war heroes being arrested, said Suresh Perera, who was also a former member of the Navy and served in the Global Multi-National Forces from 1997-2005.
But Perera was of the strong belief that justice needed to be served, If we are really going to respect the title of war hero, we must apply the law to all those who use that name to fulfil their own political agendas. If the army is to regain their credibility, they need to take action against the wrongdoers of the army. When we are given a gun, we are also told when we can shoot, but we cannot shoot innocent civilians," he said.
As the villagers protested at the Weliweriya junction, Deshapriya had led an army contingent to attack unarmed protesters. On the night of August 1, 2013, the town of Weliweriya was under shutdown and according to the book Jana Aragalayaka Diya Salakuna Rathupaswela (The Rathupaswela Water Mark On a Peoples Revolt) published by Tharindu Jayawardena on the attack, the army pursued the protesters with their guns thereafter launched a campaign to erase all evidence of it. They washed the blood off the streets and cleared the bullets from the area, stated the book. Investigations into the incident were buried until 2015 when the new government came into power. In March, 2016, the investigation was handed over to the CID by former IGP N.K. Ilangakoon. The CID, by March, 2017, arrested three army personnel in connection with the shootings. Two years since the investigation, however, the CID is yet to resolve the question as to who really gave Brigadier Deshapriya the order to shoot.
Our government
Gampaha is an SLFP stronghold and we are all party supporters, but the problem was that our leaders did not look at the peoples problems, said Suresh Perera, having pondered as to how an environmental issue became the beginning of the end for the government in power at the time. This was not the North. We were all supporters of the government; I have been to May Day rallies. We initially thought that if we simply told our leaders of the problem, they would resolve it. We did not expect the government to attack us. When we cast our vote at the 2015 Presidential elections, it was a vote against the government, he said. Water is a fundamental right and our request was fair. Through this, I wanted to inform the politicians that the people are not the slaves of a government; the government is here to serve us, said the ex-serviceman turned activist.
His thoughts are echoed by Adhikari, who is a local organizer of the party who found out that he did not have much clout against the all-powerful factory.
"The factory bought over so many people. They shut down opposition from the local school through CSR projects. People who first found out about the connection between the water and the factory were given money to stay quiet. Even the local politicians did nothing," recalled Adhikari.
His biggest disappointment, however, lay with the local Buddhist temple (Sabhawe Pansala) coming under the influence of the factory where he was the main patron. I used to do a lot for this temple but after the water issue, the monk took the side of the factory and went against the people. The owners of the factory, together with the monk, even had a thovilaya to protect the factory. That was the first time the villagers attacked the temple, he said.
The Venigros factory now shut down. Picture by Nirosh Batepola.
Adhikari, together with the other villagers, had complained to the Mahanayakas regarding the corrupt practices of the monk, but instead of taking action against him, he was given a promotion. He further lamented that it was not only the water, but also the environment, which suffered due to the factory. This area used to be lush with cashew and jack fruit trees. But the factory got all the poor people to cut down their trees and sell it to the factory. We dont have cashew in this area anymore, he said.
The factory would, in many an instances, use profit as a powerful tool to influence many in the village over the years. Adhikari also noted that their sludge was given to farmers to be used as fertilizer while their unused chemicals were sold to villagers to make moonshin. Many paddy fields had to be abandoned as the farmers were getting rashes and fever because of the sludge. At the time, people thought it was rat fever. And the moonshine led to many losing their eyesight, he said.
A 20-year struggle
While many environmental movements struggle to see the light of day, the Rathupaswala struggle has been one of the few to achieve at least some success. The man who started it all was the founder of SEPM Sampath Samarakoon, who in 1997, wrote to his local government politicians and the CEA over the environmental pollution the factory was causing. He also sued the factory over it, My house was covered in some kind of dust. It was tested to be unburnt carbon. They also sprayed this strong chemical into the air making it difficult to breath for us, he said.
Samarakoon continued to write to authorities regularly and over the years, sent in many a petition. One time, he managed to convince over a hundred villagers to sign on to it, but the issue really caught hold of public when their water became no longer drinkable in 2013. People did not believe me at the start. When the people finally got their wells tested, the public health officer asked them not to drink the water, he said.
Still in denial
The CEA, however, is yet to admit that the factory was directly responsible for the contamination of the groundwater in the area. In February, 2016, the CEA informed the Court of Appeals that the release of contaminated water by Venigros factory in Rathupaswala had not caused an impact on the qualitative nature of underground water around the Rathupaswala area. They, however, added that the water samples in the area were not under ideal pH level recommended by Sri Lanka Standards (SLS) Institution.
If the factory had no connection to the pollution in the water, how is it that the water has been improving since the factory shut down said Samarakoon. His sentiments are similarly echoed by all SEPM members who have filed a writ petition against the CEA, the Board of Investment and Venigros (Pvt) Ltd, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
This report by the CEA also means that the residents of Rathupaswala cannot sue the factory for the damages caused to their water. This continued apathy on the part of government institutions has made Samarakoon a tired and disillusioned man. This struggle resulted in us losing our village temple. The village, today, is divided. Some have called me a traitor. People are quick to forget; those who fought against the injustices of the monk now go to the temple. I am not going to come forward if there is another environmental issue, he said.
Recently, people asked me if I wanted to join a campaign to resolve the garbage crisis, but I told them I was no longer interested, added Samarakoon.
He said he did not believe that true justice would be served to those in Rathupaswala as long as the system remained corrupt. The government, school, temple and even some of our supporters, succumbed to the power of money. And they turned our people against each other."
"I dont expect other factories to learn from this incident. Business will go on as usual, he added. However, we came this far because in the end, we all stood together regardless of our backgrounds and political beliefs.
It is ironic as reports stated that the factory only needed to spend Rs. 150,000 a month to send their waste to the Holcim Factory in Puttlam to be disposed of in a proper manner. If they had done that, we wouldnt have had all these issues, said Samarakoon. Adhikari, in the meantime, said, I think it would take at least 20 years for our water to be back to normal, but our people have short memories.

Rationalise vehicles through effective measures
According to news reports, the President has suspended the recent supplementary estimate for purchase of vehicles for politicians apparently to rectify the bad timing of the proposal in the face of the flood catastrophe. If it is only a postponement of the issue, we urge the policymakers to make use of the recess to install a transparent and an effective mechanism to rationalise the purchase and usage of vehicles for politicians and government officials in the long run.
The writer in his previous submissions has repeatedly drawn the attention of the authorities that with the advent of the decentralised Provincial Councils in 1987, the sole responsibilities of central government MPs should have been redefined in order to make them only lawmakers or legislators confined to the centre. Therefore, effective steps should be taken at least now to clearly redefine job roles of the central parliamentarians, provincial councillors and local government members.
Also, usage of pool vehicles in the ministries should be maximised to cater to demands from parliamentarians. These measures will no doubt reduce the official travel of central parliamentarians to the periphery using luxury vehicles.
It is pertinent to mention that the absence of clearly defined roles was quite evident in the recent school re-opening mess-up as well as in the seemingly lukewarm role played by the provincial and local government politicians during the flood disaster. The media culture on the other hand too needs to be changed to shift the limelight from the Central parliamentarians to their peripheral counterparts so that the public can assess and justify the presence and effectiveness of politicians in the periphery.
We still hold the hope that only a government committed to good governance can rationalise and institute cost-effective and productive political machinery in Sri Lanka and accelerate the developmental process of our country. Thus, we urge the civil society and concerned organisations to guide the Yahapalana government on the correct path.

Ruthless India cruise into semis
London: India swept into the Champions Trophy semi-finals and eliminated woeful South Africa as Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli inspired the holders eight-wicket victory on Sunday.
Kohlis side avoided the embarrassment of an early exit as they survived a do or die showdown to advance from Group B in style.
Having dismissed South Africa for 191, two-time champions India cruised home with 12 overs to spare at The Oval. In-form opener Dhawan was the key figure with 78 from 83 balls, including 12 fours, while captain Kohli weighed in with a typically elegant 76.
It was a nerveless performance from India, who had come under fire after failing to defend a total of 321 in their heavy defeat against Sri Lanka.
India join England and Bangladesh in the semi-finals, with the remaining place in the last four going to the winner of Mondays Group B meeting between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Kohlis men will face Group A runners-up Bangladesh in Birmingham on Thursday as they bid to make the final for the fourth time.
South Africa will need a far more determined effort to prosper when they face England in one-day and Test action shortly.
Quinton de Kocks 53 was the only score of any substance from the spineless South Africans, who had three men run out in a wretched performance. AB De Villiers was especially culpable as he threw away his wicket for the third time in a miserable tournament for the South Africa captain.
After the flurry of South African run outs, India were lucky not to follow suit at the start of their chase.
Dhawan called for a single that was never on and David Miller narrowly missed the stumps with Rohit Sharma not even close to making his ground. Sharma celebrated his escape by smashing a four and a six off successive balls from Kagiso Rabada.
Another aggressive shot from Sharma proved his downfall as a mistimed slog was caught behind by Quinton de Kock off Morne Morkel. Keen to avoid further costly mishaps, India went conservative and scored only 37 from the first 10 overs.
But Kohli gradually began to take more risks and his pull to fine leg narrowly evaded the diving Morkel. After driving Andile Phehlukwayo for a soaring six to reach 21, Kohli edged the same bowler towards Hashim Amla, but the slip fielder couldnt make a tough low catch.
Dhawan has been in fine form of late and he brought up his 29th ODI half century, and third in three matches, with a majestic four back down the ground.
As the partnership between Dhawan and Kohli went past 100, it was clear there would be no late fightback from South Africa. Kohli hardly had to break sweat as he reached his 68th ODI fifty.
By the time Dhawan was dismissed by Tahir, his side had reached 151 and the large Indian following in the capacity crowd were in party mood. Fittingly for such a one-sided affair, the winning blow was a huge six from Yuvraj Singh. AFP

The unwarranted delay in stationing adequate trained nursing staff and doctors to hospitals in North Central Province(NCP) has badly affected CKDu patients seeking dialysis treatment.
Accordings to the provincial health care reports,20 dialysis machines available at the Hingurakgoda, Medirigiriya, Kebithigollewa and Medawachchiya Government Hospitals are lying idle due to the dearth of trained staff.
Although there are 28 dialysis machines available at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital,it is impossible to operate at full capacity due to the lack of specialised staff.
According to Provincial Hospital sources, there are around 15,000 Kidney patients in the province and this number is increasing rapidly.

Stick to  your lane,  Police caution  motorists
The lane laws stipulated in the Motor Traffic Act will be strictly implemented in and around Colombo from today, the Police announced yesterday.
City Traffic Director SP Sumith Nissanka said the drivers who break the lane laws will either be fined or produced before courts or directed to attend awareness raising classes conducted by the Police.
Addressing a press conference yesterday at the Information Department, he said a special operation will be launched from today in Colombo and main roads that leads to Colombo to apprehend those who break the lane laws.
As of the Section 148 of Motor Traffic Act, changing lanes must be done in a manner that does not disturb the vehicular movement in other lanes. Most importantly, when there is queue of vehicles at traffic lights, the vehicles that come behind should not overtake them and park in a manner that blocks the vehicular movement of the opposite side. This is a common offense that we see today, he said.
When halting at the traffic lights, all the vehicles, including three wheelers and motorcycles, should not cross the demarcated line he added. He said special teams will be deployed on High Level road, Havelock Road, Galle Road, Castle Street, Rajagiriya, Baseline Road and Panchikawatte Road to strictly implement the lane laws. He said about 600 mobile patrols will also be used for the purpose.

The Susanthika drama
There is a lot of brouhaha these days surrounding Olympic Silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe, with certain quarters blaming the government for turning the back on the one time Asia's ace sprinter, which has forced her to auction her Medal for survival- or so she says. Being the loose cannon that she is it is not certain if Susanthika is serious about what she is saying. Controversy, though, is not alien to the black gazelle as she was known in the world athletics field for her phenomenal dash to breast the tape. On more than one occasion she has fallen foul with officialdom and had a famous spat with a onetime Sports Minster which kept the nation entertained. The Silver Medal is Susanthika's to do as she pleases but she cannot target the government in her bid to camouflage the fact that she is after the mega bucks that would invariably come her way by the sale of the Medal.
Some media even went onto lambaste the government which they claim was obliged to provide for the sustenance of the former athlete on the basis that she brought international fame to the motherland. These media which have recently taken to attacking the government with gusto even went so far as to unnecessarily dwell on the governments import of luxury vehicles for Ministers to place this starkly in contrast to the alleged plight of Susanthika, as if the government should cut down on all wasteful expenditure and divert these funds for the upkeep of the aging Olympian.
We are here not attempting to belittle the signal achievement of Susanthika Jayasinghe who placed Sri Lanka on the world map of athletics by winning a Silver Medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and for her subsequent feats on the Asian circuit. What is more, she deserves all the not inconsiderable largesse showered on her by the then government and the governments that followed. Susanthika was the recipient of a luxury flat, vehicles, monetary rewards, sponsorship packages and the spin offs, that placed her on easy street, perhaps for the rest of her life, if one considers the sum total of the wealth acquired, that was in the public domain.
Nobody in their right senses would begrudge the riches showered on her, for making Sri Lanka proud by her prowess on the track. On the contrary all Sri Lankans would have exulted in the rags to riches story of the lass who hailed from the outbacks of the country and was born into poverty. Her decision therefore to sell off the Olympic Silver Medal to overcome her straitened circumstances would no doubt have been received with shock and dismay by a majority of her countrymen and sportsmen and sportswomen who held her up as a model to be emulated. What is more, the announcement made by the Sports Minister that the government was prepared to purchase the medal in the event it was to be sold by Susanthika too would be perplexing to most. We say this because there is no guessing that the Medal, if indeed it is up for sale, would be bartered away by Susanthika for a considerable sum and the government will be spending public funds for the purpose, if the Minister is serious about the offer.
This, after the state investing millions of rupees for the training (which included training overseas) of the athlete and her other needs such as nutrition, accommodation etc. over a considerable period that eventually made her achieve the rare feat of an Olympic Medal for the country. Does the public now have to bear the additional expense to pay for the Medal won by Susanthika after forking out for her training and other expenses at the initial stages Are the public obliged for the permanent upkeep of Susanthika for winning an Olympic Medal Will not the public feel cheated, especially at a time when funds are sorely needed to tide over one of worst natural disasters to hit the country in recent times, uprooting tens of thousands of people from their homes
One is constrained to ask as to what became of the wealth amassed by Susanthika in the immediate aftermath of her Olympic success and what is her utter desperation to be driven to part with her prized possession One has to recall that Susanthika also contested the 2010 General Election from the Rajapaksa camp and could not have been in penury to face major a hustings that require considerable financial resources.
Be that as it may, Susanthika's insistence that the government has neglected her by failing to consider her bravura achievement smacks of an expectation that the state is obliged to look after and maintain achievers in the sporting field as an article of faith. There have been other achievers who had faded from picture unsung and unwept. World Amateur Snooker Champion M. J. M. Lafir died in penury, for his feat was accomplished in a different era when there were no sponsors or giant corporate interests to lend assistance to sportsmen and sportswomen. Susanthika indeed was fortunate on that score.
