Dian Gomes endorses Caf Mocha
Some know him as an affluent entrepreneur, some as a visionary leader and some others, as the Father of Modern Sri Lankan Boxing. What he is lesser known for, is for his true passions - art and a good cup of coffee. Dian Gomes is the mastermind behind the arty street of Stratford Avenue - with his very own Gandhara Emporium providing space to budding young artisans to display their wares. The art street also houses Cafe Mocha which in itself is a great compliment to the creative haven. Tne Gandhara promenade draws crowds of various groups - especially undergraduates varying from ages of 18 - 30 and businessmen who take meetings out of the boardroom. Cafe Mocha being one of the largest cafes in Sri Lanka plays a huge role as the ideal venue for group study sessions or business meetings.
Dian Gomes is currently the Chairman of Hela Clothing which functions in Kenya and Mexico apart from Sri Lanka with over 15,000 employees. He is also the President of the National Boxing Association and was a Sri Lanka Junior Flyweight champion boxer in his time. However, a little known fact is that Dian fell in love with art at a very young age. At the age of 9, one of my drawings was displayed at the Youth Art Festival in the Royal Albert Hall in London, reminisces Dian of an incredible feat.
Unfortunately, he was discouraged from pursuing these interests but is reliving it now as an art collector and through Gandhara and Stratford Avenue. Stratford Avenue has great potential, especially because of its tree line, cleanliness and especially, uniformity in terms of concept. You get specialist streets all over the world. Even in Sri Lanka, you get streets specializing in ceramics, and car retail shops. It is with this in mind and my passion for art that we began conceptualizing Stratford Avenue, he said.
From its inception, this concept has received tremendous response and granted a platform for many young entrepreneurs. Many inquire about exhibiting or retail space within the area, but the selection is done only in line with the concept, Dian added.
Cafe Mocha by Barista with walls adorned with old photographs and images of icons such as John Lennon, Che Guerra and Audrey Hepburn, has been at Stratford Avenue from the inception.Initially granted the space within the Gandhara compound, which was Dians colonial ancestral home converted into a lifestyle concept store Caf Mocha soon became overwhelmed with the footfall and moved to its present more exciting space with two floors. Cafe Mocha is a one-of-a-kind cafe that has created for itself, a fantastic image and name while keeping the price competitive thus helping it to prosper, says Dian of one of his favourite places in the city.
Set in a rustic themed building, Cafe Mochas unique ambience and atmosphere is its selling point. My favorite item on the Cafe Mocha menu is the cappuccinos. More than that, I love how the place, with its unflustered walls and historical touch gives a relaxing feel amongst the comfy leather couches and jazzy music. -NH

Disappearance bill to deal with future only
TIMELINE
December 10, 2015: Sri Lanka signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance
May 26, 2016: The Government ratified the international convention
February 9, 2017: The Government gazetted the Bill to give effect to the international convention
March 7, 2017: Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Bill to Parliament
July 5, 2017: The Bill was scheduled to be taken up in Parliament, but the Government announced that it would be moved at a future date
The proposed Bill for protection against enforced disappearances provides only for the future and it has nothing to do with the past incidents, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Samaraweera made this clarification issuing a media communique yesterday to counter the allegations against the proposed legislation.
The Government presented the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in Parliament on March 7.
The Bill was to be taken up for debate last week, but the Government at the last moment announced that it would be moved at a future date.
Samaraweera was the Foreign Minister when Sri Lanka signed International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance on December 10, 2015 ratified the same on May 26, 2016.
The Ministers strongly worded statement came in the wake of allegations mainly by the Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the proposed Bill was an attempt to betray the War Heroes.
The proposed legislation is to safe guard a fundamental human right of every citizen in a just, free and civilised society. The main intention of the Bill is to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction. All citizens must be happy about this progressive legislation that will put an end to while-van culture and the trend of enforced disappearances and abductions carried out with the connivance of the State, he noted.
The minister, hitting hard at the Joint Opposition led by Rajapaksa, said power-hungry politicians who were architects of the infamous white-van culture were deliberately trying to mislead the public. Samaraweera asked as to how anybody could speak against the proposed move to put an end to white-van culture in the country.
Rajapaksa loyalists, with their very claim that this Bill affects the War Heroes, admit before the world that the Security Forces during the period of their rule committed enforced disappearances, abductions and extra judicial killings. By saying so, arent they tagging the War Heroes as war criminals Samaraweera questioned.
According to the Draft Bill,any person who is found guilty of the offense of enforced disappearance can be imprisoned for a term not exceeding 20 years, and also be liable to pay a fine not exceeding Rs 1million and compensation not less than Rs 500,000 to a victim.
As of the Act, a superior who knows, or consciously disregards information which clearly indicated, that subordinates under him were committing or about to commit an act of enforced disappearance or fails to take reasonable measures to prevent or repress it or submit the matter to a law enforcement authority for investigation and prosecution is also guilty of the offense of enforced disappearance.

Economy takes a toll on confidence - LMD
Business sentiment dips amid fears over the national economy and high interest rates
A spate of natural disasters grabbed the headlines towards the tail end of May and early June, as heavy rainfall led to flooding and landslides in much of southwestern Sri Lanka, resulting in major losses to life and property.
The authorities it would seem were overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy  albeit that it could have been pre-empted and prepared for, given that a similar episode took place at around the same time last year. And as was the case in May 2016, the state entity tasked with disaster management stood as proof of a disaster in itself!
Notwithstanding the sorry state of affairs on the official front, citizens, relief organisations and the tri-forces came to the fore to assist those who were in desperate need.
It will take time to assess the real impact of this adverse weather-related catastrophe on the national economy, which was already reeling from drought-related vicissitudes. But for the time being at least, this could be one among many other reasons for the dampened corporate sentiment as reflected in the results of the latest Business Confidence Index (BCI) survey.
THE INDEX The BCI dropped to 115 in June compared to 119 in May. The index is also lower than its April score of 117 while both the 12-month and all-time averages in June (130) are 15 basis points higher. And a year ago, the confidence barometer registered 126 on the BCI scale.
Since January this year, business confidence has oscillated within a relatively narrow band of 15 points with all except one monthly movement recording six points or less  stagnation it seems is the overriding theme.
This drop was expected with inflation showing no signs of slowing down, and the floods in May severely impacting day-to-day life and business in many parts of the island, says Nielsens Managing Director Sharang Pant.
He points out that the availing of GSP+ in May was welcome news but it might take time for the impact to be known in terms of growth in business orders or employment  Interest rates and the currency however, need to be managed as a priority to improve the ease of doing business and attract investment.
THE ECONOMY A majority (45%) of respondents continue to feel that the economy will struggle in the coming 12 months and these concerns have only grown as time has passed.
With instability in the economy and poor decision-making by our government, it is hard to say where the economy as well as our business will stand in the coming months, a corporate executive laments.
A more cautiously optimistic businessperson notes: Many of our investment plans are on hold due to the low value of the rupee as well as the state of the economy at present. But we are hopeful that the economy will pick up in the future.
BIZ PROSPECTS Possibly due to expectations of investments being driven by GSP+, 43 percent of respondents feel that business will improve over the next 12 months. At the same time, nearly three-in-10 of those surveyed feel that the present quarter would be good for business.
Both these numbers have increased compared to the previous month.
INVESTMENT
The investment climate in the country is good or better, according to nearly a fifth (versus 15% in May) of Nielsens survey sample.
However, a slim majority of 41 percent hold a negative view on prevailing investment conditions.
This corresponds with the views of one respondent who explains that with interest rates steadily on the rise and a lack of confidence in the government, the investment climate does not seem to be too good  no one is willing to take the risk and invest.
WORKFORCE
In terms of plans for the workforce over the coming six months, nearly three-quarters (up from 66% in the previous month) of business people who spoke to the pollsters say they will maintain current staff levels.
A further 19 percent of corporates say they plan to increase their staff numbers while seven percent reveal that theyre likely to consider retrenchment.
SENSITIVITIES
The cost of credit, the rupee value and raw material prices feature among the main concerns of members of the business community.
Our company is in need of credit facilities to start new projects; however, these have been pushed back due to high interest rates, a respondent reveals. Another businessperson laments that with the increasing cost of raw material imports as well as the depreciating rupee, our business has been negatively impacted.
PROJECTIONS In the previous edition of LMD, we stated that the outlook for business confidence may seem brighter than it has been for some time, on the back of largely positive signs for corporate earnings as well as a somewhat bullish stock market and tapering inflation.
But while the index has by and large stood its ground in recent months, the latest survey results paint a less than pretty picture of what may be in store for Sri Lanka Inc.
With the majority of business people pointing to a deterioration of the economy and investment climate, the outlook for the BCI is subdued. Not even the recent cabinet reshuffle it would seem has helped buoy business confidence.  LMD

Epic Lions, All Blacks series ends in sensational draw
AUCKLAND, Saturday - Owen Farrell scored a long-range penalty three minutes from time as the British and Irish Lions drew 15-15 with the All Blacks to tie a series for only the second time in their history on Saturday.
New Zealand, who haven't lost at Eden Park for 23 years, were aggrieved when a last-minute penalty for offside within kicking range was overruled after a video review.
All Blacks fullback Jordie Barrett, in his first Test start, set up one try and scored another in the opening half, in what were to be the third and final Test's only tries.
It was 12-12 with 20 minutes left before a Beauden Barrett penalty restored the All Blacks lead -- only for Farrell to knock one over from 48 metres to make it 15-15 on 77 minutes.
Farrell finished the night with 12 points from four penalty kicks, while Elliott Daly also booted a huge effort from his own half for the Lions just after half-time.
Warren Gatland's Lions, who were given no chance against the world champions early in their tour, can feel vindicated with the series result, although neither side was entirely happy.
In 129 years of touring, it was the Lions first drawn series against New Zealand, and only the second in their history after they finished 2-2 against South Africa in 1955.
It's come down to the wire and we've ended up with one hand on the trophy each which is a bit like kissing your sister, said All Blacks coach Steve Hansen. As little kids we are told to take the good with the bad and we have to do that, he added, referring to the late penalty reversal.
It's a decision the ref has made and we will live with it. Lions captain Sam Warburton, who lifted the trophy with his opposite number Kieran Read, said: I'm not sure what to make of that really -- I was getting ready for extra time.
The All Blacks bossed the first half and they led 12-6 at the break, but the Lions struck back with two penalties from Daly and Farrell to level the scores at 12-12. In a frantic final 20 minutes, the All Blacks regained the lead after Wyatt Crockett forced a scrum collapse, allowing Beauden Barrett to put them ahead 15-12 with the penalty.
But their slim lead evaporated on 77 minutes when Farrell, also the Lions hero in last week's 24-21 victory when he kicked the winning points, landed another crucial penalty.
The All Blacks, 30-15 winners in the first Test, were clearly stung by losing the second Test last week in Wellington, and they began the match at a furious pace.
After a helter-skelter opening 10 minutes, Daly beat Israel Dagg in the air to take the Lions up to the New Zealand line, only for the two rookie All Blacks to turn defence into points. An intercept by Jordie Barrett set Laumape racing 80 metres before he was cut down from behind by Jonathan Davies. From a resulting scrum, Beauden Barrett kicked across field for his brother Jordie to leap high and instinctively palm the ball back to Laumape for the opening try.
The Lions replied with a penalty to Farrell, but their time in All Blacks territory was limited and it was only poor handling by the New Zealanders that eased the pressure on the tourists.- AFP

## Title: Export earnings up by 11.9%

Export earnings up by 11.9%
Sri Lankas external sector displayed a mixed performance in April 2017. Although export earnings increased in April 2017, the higher growth in import expenditure resulted in an expansion of the trade deficit.
Despite the increase in tourist earnings in April 2017, the decline in workers remittances together with the expanded trade deficit moderated the performance of the external current account.
However, the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) was supported by continued foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the government securities market in April 2017.
Earnings from exports at USS 795 million in April 2017 increased for the second consecutive month, registering a year-on-year growth of 11.9 per cent. This high growth was mainly driven by the low base effect which registered US$ 710 million in April 2016, the lowest monthly export value since April 2013.
Earnings from industrial exports, which represent about 75 per cent of total exports, grew by 8.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 595 million in April 2017 mainly due to higher exports of transport equipment, petroleum products and textiles and garments.
Earnings from transport equipment increased by nearly five-fold to US$ 27 million during the month, as a result of the export of a general cargo vessel worth US$ 23 million.
Earnings from exports of petroleum products increased by 62.5 per cent (year-on-year) in April 2017 reflecting greater volumes and higher prices for bunker and aviation fuel.
Textile and garment exports at US$ 351 million in April 2017 registered a moderate increase of 3.0 per cent (year-on-year), although in comparison to the previous month, earnings from textile and garment exports reduced reflecting seasonal patterns.
Earnings from agricultural exports grew by 22.7 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 196 million in April 2017 led by tea, spices and seafood exports.
Earnings from tea exports increased by 17.1 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 109 million due to higher average prices, despite the decline in volume exported.
In addition, earnings from seafood exports increased by 59.7 per cent (year-on-year) in April 2017 due to a 251 per cent growth recorded in seafood exports to the EU, following the removal of the ban on fisheries products. However, earnings from coconut and rubber exports declined in April 2017.
Expenditure on imports increased by 9.8 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 1,604 million in April 2017. The largest contribution to overall growth caused from intermediate goods (74.7 per cent), followed by consumer goods (20.2 per cent) and investment goods (5.7 per cent).
Expenditure on import of intermediate goods increased by 13.7 per cent (year-on-year) to US$ 886 million in April 2017, largely due to higher expenditure on fuel and base metal imports.
Expenditure on fuel increased by 62.1 per cent (year-on-year) during the month, reflecting higher import volumes of oil and coal for power generation and elevated import prices in the global market. The import price of crude oil increased to US$ 56.48 per barrel in April 2017 from US$ 44.05 per barrel in April 2016.
Expenditure on consumer goods imports increased by 9.1 per cent (year-on-year)to US dollars 345millionin April2017driven by higher imports of non-food consumer goods such as clothing and accessories, household furniture items and home appliances amidst a decline in imports of vehicles and telecommunication devices.
Rice imports increased to US dollars 10million in April2017 from US dollars 1 million in April 2016 due to measures taken by the government to encourage rice imports to meet the shortage in the domestic market. Expenditure on investment goods imports grew in April2017 by 2.3per cent to US dollars 372 million (year-on-year) led by higher imports of building materials and transport equipment. Import expenditure on building materials increased owing to iron and steel and cement imports in April 2017 while imports of transport equipment increased mainly due to higher imports of commercial vehicles.
India, China, the UAE, Singapore and Japan were the main import origins during the first four months of 2017, accounting for about 59 per cent of total imports.
Tourist arrivals at 160,249 in April 2017 increased by 17.5 per cent (year-on-year), following a decline in arrivals for two consecutive months. Earnings from tourism1 increased to US dollars 274.9 million during April 2017 in comparison to US dollars 234.0 million in April 2016.
Foreign investments in the CSE during the first four months of the year recorded a net inflow of US dollars 154.5 million, including a net inflow of US dollars 106.3 million to the secondary market and an inflow of US dollars 48.2 million to the primary market. Continuing the reversal of the trend observed in the previous month, foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a net inflow of US dollars 45 million during April 2017. However, on a cumulative basis, the government securities market experienced a net outflow of US dollars 360.4 million during the first four months of 2017.
Long term loans to the government recorded a net inflow of US dollars 60.3 million during the first four months of 2017, compared to a net inflow of US dollars 7.6 million during the corresponding period of 2016.
Further, foreign direct investments including foreign loans to BOI companies, which are reported on a quarterly basis, remained moderate with a net inflow of US dollars 146.5 million during the first quarter of 2017. This included disinvestments as a consequence of share buybacks initiated by several companies listed in the CSE.
During the first four months of 2017, the overall BOP is estimated to have recorded a deficit of US dollars 344.4 million in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 958.1 million recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.

Fall in love with your garden!
We are well aware that gardening is wonderful for our physical health, but the magic of this outdoor activity is that it greatly benefits our mental health, wellbeing and sense of calm to an equal measure.
Mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression and OCD, affect one in four people at some point during their lives. But, fortunately, something as simple as gardening can have a healing effect as it not only lowers levels of fatigue, depression, tension and anger, it also heightens self-esteem, mood and sense of worth.
Stress relief
One of the key aspects of gardening is that it's stress relieving. The exercise involved in gardening leads to an increase in the chemicals serotonin and dopamine in our brain, which boosts our happiness. Levels of cortisol, a hormone which makes us stressed, are also lowered.
Digging soil, raking the leaves and cutting back bushes will also allow you to vent frustration and relieving stress. At the same time, the peacefulness of the garden will allow you to feel relaxed and let go. As a result, you are less likely to display signs of unhappiness or depression.
A study, conducted by the University of Westminster and University of Essex, found that just 30 minutes a week in the garden can have a positive effect on your mental health.
Wellbeing boost
The fresh air, contact with nature, vitamin D and sweet-smelling flowers all contribute to a feeling of relaxation and calm. It has been proven that being immersed in the natural world can boost your wellbeing. This activity also provides a purpose and something for the mind to focus on - a distraction from worries or negative thoughts. There's a real sense of achievement from what's produced in the garden.
Therapy
'Horticultural therapy' has already been implemented for some hospital patients, particularly those who have had strokes or are recovering from a physical trauma. It is also used to calm prisoners in jail.
In fact, some argue that horticultural therapy should be prescribed on the NHS. It is believed that substantial savings could be made to the UK economy if gardening were more widely used as a treatment, particularly for mental illness, loneliness and obesity.

G20: Trump hails talks as success despite divisions
US President Donald Trump has declared the G20 summit in Germany a "wonderful success", despite his country's isolated position on climate change.
In a joint statement, the leaders of 18 nations and the EU recognised the US decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.
However, they also said other G20 members remained committed to the "irreversible" accord.
Deadlock over the issue had held up the last day of talks in Hamburg.
A final agreement was eventually reached and the joint summit statement was officially released on Saturday.
The statement also said the US would seek "to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently".
The Paris accord sets targets for greenhouse gas emissions aimed at curbing global temperature increases.
In her closing news conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted the summit in Hamburg, said she still deplored Trump's position but that she was "gratified" the other 19 nations opposed its renegotiation. (BBC)

Garbage bags on the ramp
Two top fashion designers set out Sunday to prove the saying that a stylish woman can look good even in a bin bag. Belgium husband and wife team Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst turned black plastic bin liners and dry cleaning sheaths into skirts and elaborate embroidered ball gowns in their debut Paris haute couture show.
Haute couture is the very pinnacle of the fashion world, with only an elite band of designers allowed to show their luxurious handmade creations in the French capital, some of which cost tens of thousands of euros (dollars).
The pair - collectively called A.F. Vandevorst - set out to challenge that aesthetic with a punkish cavalier show which also featured rubbish bag veils.
Rather than demure debutantes in puff balls of taffeta and silk, their models had the air of runaway nightclubbing nuns. Others wore dashing hussar jackets and trousers matched with thigh-high boots and skin-tight PVC trousers. An Vandevorst told AFP the show was an ode to the joy of dressing up with anything you can find to hand.
Its about total freedom and creativity, and a women who lives out of her suitcase... transforming old stuff into new, she said, adding, She takes things that she finds like a bin bag and embroiders it.
She is so creative that the material doesnt matter. She is so chic and so sophisticated she can turn anything with her natural flair - poof! - into something great.
A handbag is thus transformed into a hat, and whole line of wardrobe staples - leggings, jackets and tops - into head dresses and wimples. Asian Age

Gardening can encourage your child to eat healthy
With childhood and adolescent obesity touching alarming levels across the globe, experts are warning about the health complications that accompany this ailment. Obesity leads to a number of other problems, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, among others. While maintaining an active lifestyle and eating a healthy, balanced diet are important, a new study has revealed that growing plants reduces childhood obesity.
The logic behind this, say experts, is that spending time outdoors will not only teach your child how to garden but also have a positive impact on their mental health, which, in turn, will promote healthy eating. The study said that overweight children, who take up gardening, are more likely to lose weight in just one year.
Senior bariatric and metabolic surgeon, Dr Ramen Goel, explains, "This is a very interesting study. It links cognitive functions with the health of an individual. The numbers are really small but this is an exciting concept nonetheless. This can be easily replicated and verified in the Indian scenario. Considering the galloping obesity epidemic we are currently facing, any non-interventional preventive approach is welcome."
Another study has revealed that kids who regularly eat veggies score better in writing and spelling tests. This is because vegetables are packed with antioxidants that maintain DNA  excellent for the brain. -Time of India

GMOA to strike if Prof. Carlo not retained
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will commence an indefinite strike if the Health Minister appoints someone else other than Prof. Carlo Fonseka to the position of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President, GMOA Secretray Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo last evening, he said that if the Health Minister appoints someone else to the SLMC presidents position, it is a violation of the Sri Lanka Medical Ordinance.
According to the Ordinance the Health Minister has power to make the appointment but he does not have the power to remove the SLMC president.
According to the Ordinance, the position falls vacant only due to the resignation of the President, through a proposal approved by the council or if the President pass away. Non of those had happened when it comes to Prof. Carlo Fonseka, he said.
The GMOA received information that the Health Minister will appoint a person who is pro-SAITM and holding a position in an Ayurvedic Productions Company. This is purely a violation of the Ordinance. The entire country has been demanding the Minister to appoint Prof. Fonseka to the position and Prof. Fonseka had given his consent to the appointment. The President, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal and Mahanayaka Theras of three chapters had been informed about the issue, he added.
Professor Carlo Fonsekas term of service came to an end on June 30 after serving for five and half years.The Professors official tenure was supposed to end on December 31, 2016, as a SLMC Presidents tenure is generally valid for a period of five years. However, the Ministry of Health took steps to extend his tenure by 6 more months.
Speaking to the media after his term came to an end, Prof. Fonseka said that no request had been made by the government for an extension of his service.

Gulf states settle in for long-haul
QATAR: More than a month since the start of the diplomatic crisis gripping the Gulf, hopes of a swift resolution seem as remote as a summer downpour in the desert.
Both sides -- the group of Saudi-led allies against Qatar -- seem as entrenched in their positions as ever and as unlikely to find a face-saving solution for all as at any time since the conflict erupted on June 5.
I think that this crisis has a way to go still, said Kristian Ulrichsen, a Gulf analyst with the Baker Institute at the US-based Rice University.
He is not alone.
A weary US State Department this week signalled its belief that the row -- which has seen Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt sever ties with Qatar over claims it supports Islamist extremists -- will rumble on, at best, for some time.
We believe that this could potentially drag on for weeks. It could drag on for months, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on July 6.
The first days of July had offered a tiny, hopeful glimpse of a resolution as the region awaited Qatars response to the list of 13 onerous demands placed on Doha by the Saudi-led bloc. But a defiant Qatar, which denies the charges of supporting extremism, then called the demands -- such as closing broadcaster Al-Jazeera and the Turkish military base in Doha -- unrealistic.
In return, Saudi and its allies threatened further sanctions, while Qatar hit back, labelling the four Arab states siege countries.
There will be no lifting of the sanctions any time soon, I cant see that happening, said Andreas Krieg of the Defence Studies Department at Kings College London.
The crisis seems to be in deadlock.
It appears that Saudi Arabia and the UAE underestimated Qatars ability to very quickly bring on board major regional powers such as Turkey and Iran, Christopher Davidson, an expert on Middle East politics at Britains Durham University, told AFP.
In this context, pushing forward with any form of cross-border intervention seems unlikely, with instead a long drawn out slow-bleed of Qatars economy probably being the preferred Saudi-UAE strategy. So what happens next On the diplomatic front, the push is coming from the West with the visit of British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson to the region this weekend, followed by the scheduled arrival of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in regional mediator Kuwait on July 10.
In Nauerts statement she also warned the conflict could possibly even intensify.
This could manifest itself in two ways.
On the sanctions front, attention appears to be turning to regional political organisations and, more tentatively, trade.
There has been much speculation that Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain will seek to push Qatar out of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council either through suspension or expulsion.
Reports in the Saudi media have suggested this could be the next step in Qatars isolation though it is unclear if there would be enough votes to carry this through.
Krieg speculated that Saudi Arabia instead might manoeuvre to penalise Qatar through its membership of the Arab League.
On trade there has been suggestions that Saudi Arabia and the UAE may present international companies with a choice of doing business with them or Qatar, not both.
That though is far from a risk-free strategy, Ulrichsen said. Such a move may rebound on Riyadh and Abu Dhabi if it calls into question the vulnerability of commercial decisions to political interference, he said. - AFP

Hayleys Plantations 25th anniversary celebrated
Hayleys Plantations regional plantation companies, KVPL, TTEL and Horana, recently celebrated the 25-year presence in the country with it workforce of over 23,000 estate employees.
Each employee received lunch on the day to mark the gratitude towards their immeasurable contribution to Hayleys and the Sri Lankan tea industry.
A special meal was served to children and babies at the Hayleys Plantation crches.
A birthday cake was also cut by the Managing Director - Hayleys Plantations, Roshan Rajadurai, to mark the event.
The celebration also focused on the tea industrys 150th anniversary and its deep-rooted and rich history, which placed Sri Lanka on the world map.
All employees were appreciated for being at the heart of the tea industry. This kind of celebration with deep recognition to the entire workforce is a first in the history of the tea industry.
Managing Director Roshan Rajadurai said, This year marks 150 glorious and illustrious years of the tea industry in our island and a quarter century for Hayleys Plantations. We believe that our longevity and success pivots on our workforce of over 23,000. And that is why our focus is consistently on uplifting their lives, while enabling and harnessing productivity. In recognition of these efforts the company has been awarded the 'Asia Pacific HR Excellence Award and 'Global HR Excellence Award' for leading HR practices in quality work-life.
K. Sarojini, an employee of the Moon Plains Division of Pedro Estate said, We are really happy that the management and the company recognized us and celebrated with us on this special day.
S. Janagi, Mahagastotte Lower Division of Pedro Estate added, It means a lot to us that our company celebrated together with us and gave us recognition. We greatly value this.
Hayleys Plantations' ethos is based on uplifting its valued workforce which forms the lifeblood of the sector. The company focuses heavily on giving back to the community and enriching the lives of the workers as well as the dependents which number close to 140,000.
In order to do achieve this, in 2006 the plantation companies, KVPL and TTEL launched A Home for Every Plantation Worker which is a unique and multi-dimensional community initiative targeted at uplifting the living standards of employees and the estate community. The project is structured around the four focus areas aimed at uplifting the socioeconomic status of estate families in the Groups plantations.

The Living Environment pillar engages communities in multiple initiatives including the improvement of housing, water, sanitation, recreation and learning facilities.
The Health and Nutrition project focus covers a range of comprehensive health and nutrition initiatives including preventive healthcare through immunisation, antenatal and postnatal care, and guidance on nutrition, early childhood development support and auxiliary medical services.
Youth empowerment includes working in collaboration with government institutes and reputed NGOs and providing vocational training on a range of subjects for estate community youth. These training initiatives are also inclusive of scholarships for tertiary education, based on merit and talent.
Community capacity building initiatives are done in collaboration with the Estate Worker Housing Cooperative Society and include disbursement of microfinancing loans, dental clinics, scholarships, eye clinics and other donations.
In addition, they also conduct awareness training programmes on an array of subjects including dengue prevention, waste management, and prevention of use of drugs and alcohol, among others.
The success of the initiative is underpinned on its ability to bring about significant improvements in the quality of life estate community families. During last year, the sector invested over Rs. 110.5 million in a wide array of initiatives and activities under the four pillars described above.
Hayleys Plantations also won at the National HR Excellence Gold Award, National Business Excellence Award (three Gold and four Silver) and also the CSR Gold Award from JASTECA for 'A Home for Every Plantation Worker' programme.

Home for the homelss
Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, is celebrating its centenary year and the calendar is dotted with many events in commemoration and celebration of the journey of a hundred years.
One of the most significant undertakings was by the Senior Prefects Guild to build a house for a homeless family who had lost their breadwinner to forces of nature.
Thirty four-year-old Thamara Priyanka Kumari was expecting her third daughter and was living with her husband in Hemmathagama, Mawanella. In a cruel turn of fate, she lost her husband on June 21, 2014. She battled her sorrows and continued to live in a ramshackle hut atop of a rock, while bearing her unborn child. Her older daughter Chanchala Kumari was 14 years old and the second daughter Paboda Kumari was seven years old.
Seventy one-year-old Ranso Hami came to know of her widowed daughters plight. Amidst disapproval from her married sons and daughters families occupying Ranso Hamis dilapidated and crowded house, she took Thamara and her two the daughters into her humble home. She had nothing to offer but her immense love and blessings to her distressed child.
Thamara had nothing to call her own. Existence was on a Samurdhi payment of Rs 3,000 a month. Mawanella AGA Priyangani Pethangoda was their only pillar of strength.
It was the Senior Prefects Guild that brought a ray of hope to their meager existence which was well below the poverty line. With the blessings and guidance of their Principal Sandamali Aviruppola and Deputy Principal Kalani Suriyapperuma, the Prefects rallied around this family to shine a beam of light.
They worked tirelessly to raise funds, find sponsors and donors and finance this community service project. They travelled to Hemmathagama to lay the foundation stone on March 15. There they saw the dire needs of the three girls and accelerated the programme.
Within three months, the house was completed. This was made possible by the West Security Forces Commander Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe, along with the Commander 583 Brigade Brigadier Nihal Amarasekara and the war heroes who contributed tirelessly to build this dream home, brick by brick.
The kindness of the prefects did not end there. The beautifully tiled and completed home was fully furnished by them giving these needy children everything to make their home.
These children, who slept on a rock, now have comfortable beds with blankets, sheets and soft pillows to sleep on. They have carved wooden chairs to watch TV or listen to their music on their own radio.
There is also a beautiful, fully-equipped pantry to cook their meals on a gas cooker with all the utensils they would need. They have a modern attached toilet and a traditional one with pipe-borne water and three-phase electricity. They can now study on tables with all the stationary, learning aids and a shelf full of books to excel in their academics. All these are gifted with smiles and hearts full of compassion, hoping they will end the poverty cycle and reach higher echelons to serve our motherland in the near future.

Hope in reform
In the nineteenth century especially as knowledge and understanding continued to advance and develop, people have been driven and impelled to move more vigorously to search for truth and meaning of life and it has been accompanied by a thirst for justice, freedom, equality and peace. Thus human beings continue to search anew for the meaning and purpose of life, each one making of it a personal growing and learning process and discovery.
Religious communities help in this learning process. Though religion, mainly among which are world religions, may be the source that sheds light on the issues that human beings and human communities face, there are many issues of life and many ideologies and points of view from the political, economic, financial, demographic, cultural and philosophical world, that continually call for mans attention. World religions which cannot be self-centred, connects the individual to others. Which of the world religions connect people to all humanity
With the passing of time, in decades and centuries, the adherents of religions have tended to stray from the pristine path and even add to the original message due to inorganic developments and various contingencies, cultural elements inconsonant to and foreign to its spirit. Therefore, there comes a time for recovery, revival and reform, by going back to the roots, the original spring, the unmixed teaching, bringing about an improvement thus revitalising anew the lives of adherents more consistently.
Reform comes when there are wrongs to be corrected when what ought to be is restored. There is a process of death and rebirth in religions by which what is out of date and incompatible today is put aside and what is timely and suitable in keeping with truth and the process of enlightenment and progress, what is best for solidarity with humanity is adopted and assimilated.
On to the intellectual and spiritual growth process in the life of a mature adult, nothing can be imposed or enforced forcibly; the adult should be left free to enquire and choose for himself that which appeals to his conscience. Religions also could awaken the conscience of human beings to adhere to truth, justice and fairness, to what is honest, gracious, courteous, peaceable and good for all.
Religions could be of mutual help in this discarding of the obsolete and accepting and taking on the new, thereby opening to the light of knowledge and dispelling the darkness of ignorance, opting graciousness to hostility, cooperation to rivalry, preferring truth to error, discerning true values from false ones and embracing a spirit of service to fellowmen rather than being enclosed and isolated in self-preservation and narcissist pre-occupation. In any case, no religion should lend itself to the degeneration and destruction of any part or the whole of humanity. Rather religions together should enlighten, build, uplift, ennoble and be of service to humanity according to its capacity and not bring on ignorance, darkness, destruction and annihilation to people.
LEADERS FEEL THREATENED
While religious leaders may be attempting to summon humanity to a more enlightened and sustaining way of life, secular leaders may be directing themselves and their peoples in a tangential direction if not an opposite one. (It should also be noted that there have been occasions in history when perceptive secular leaders urged religious leaders to be true to the obligations of their calling!) While religious leaders may be engaged in confidence-building and forging bonds of friendship, simultaneously there are secular political leaders who with their nations feel threatened both from within and outside. They try to find security and trust in armaments; their manufacture, the skill and training needed to handle them, the replacement, advancement and their maintenance cost so dear that development of other fields of human activity are underrated or neglected and whole segments of the population are unjustly left poor with their basic means of livelihood uncared for. This is quite in contrast to the teachings of the main world religions which of course they ignore.
FUNDAMENTAL OPTION
While some find life a riddle or a puzzle difficult to solve, some others find it meaningless and absurd. There are also those who, even without thinking about it deeply enough, presume life should be lived, protected, taken care of and they wish to enjoy life as long as it lasts.
In the world of today with rapidly accessible global communications, the presence of a variety of religions make themselves felt and call for our attention. There is almost a half of humanity who have no enlightenment from a religion while the other half has found a clarifying light falling on life from a religious teaching they have inherited or from a tradition that has been there. Most of them may not have intently searched or investigated what they have inherited from family background and community tradition into which they were born. Yet most have without question or with little questioning accepted what they have inherited. Only a few reject outright what they inherit and make a fundamental option or a choice of their own after examining also the assertions and claims of other persuasions.
FREEDOM FOR UNBELIEF
It is indeed very reasonable to let everyone be free even though there are persons and groups, in some religious traditions also in Sri Lanka, who resent any individual, personal search and choice. This resentment in some religious communities even becomes an ostracism and exclusion from the community or even death for apostasy or infidelity. However such drastic reactions are contrary to the laws of civilised nations and are also in opposition to the charter of human rights of the United Nations and are frowned upon by educated people.
In any case, the search for truth in religious belief should be in keeping with mans inherent human dignity of which he becomes conscious as he grows and matures and when he assesses himself with all that is found in the world into which he is born. Vetoing such freedom to search for truth or questioning for clarification and elucidation in probing for truth, are not in keeping with human dignity, freedom and autonomy. Acceptance and embracing of a system of belief or non-acceptance and rejection of such a system or any belief are within a human beings right and all need to respect it.
SHARING, MUTUAL ENRICHMENT
For any religion to be of significance to all humanity on this earthly home, the teachings, norms, services and traditions of religions should be of relevance to human beings and be possible of universal application. On the part of adherents of religions, there should be a devotion to truth, to freedom, to justice, human solidarity and peace. And overcoming of envy, jealousy, hatred, revenge, wickedness, violent rivalry and cruelty are considered concomitant with religious adherence and doctrines of most religions. There is also the desire for mutual acquaintance with others and a desire to give and receive love on a footing of equality. Religions also hold out a hopeful vision of realities beyond sense experience, that is to be had in an existence beyond the present life. Hope is the substance of things unseen.
Before religious leaders sit down for inter-religious dialogue and fraternal discussion, for the sake of inter-community harmony and world peace, they should recover from the resources of their religions those riches of serenity, tranquillity, peace and sharing that they can share with others for mutual enrichment. It is only then that they would be able to share their common sentiments and particular beliefs with all.
JOY IN REALITIES BEYOND
Religion means that people could be persuaded by reason and the attraction and the force of the truth of what is presented. And all these could be promoted to be spontaneously accepted or accepted after serious consideration without subjecting anyone to any kind of compulsion against ones will. Religions by their nature should be raising and leading people to a higher level and quality of liberty, of thinking and living. Religion is to help human beings to be integrated within oneself free of interior or exterior fault or blemish.
Religions should be sources of promise and hope and not distrust and despair.
Religions ennoble human beings and bring about good order in their community life and do not lead them to confusion, perversity, degeneration and anarchical conduct. Religions cannot be preserved and promoted by means and forces opposed to the assumptions and notions of behaviour respectful of the dignity and rights of human beings. Religions that hold out a vision of a glorious liberation, joy in realities yet unseen, beyond sense experience also need to present a tangible belief and a felt pledge of what is to come.
It is challenging for religious leaders to exercise only persuasion and the force of truth and reason and the strong witness of ones life to uphold, maintain and promote ones religion and leave people free to accept or reject what is proposed.
POLITICAL DESPOTS
Totalitarian governments force people under their control in many ways to adopt atheism as a belief in contravention of the principles of democracy and the United Nations charter of human rights which is an acknowledgement of the dignity and rights of human beings that have been there in human society from time immemorial. Leaders of such autocratic governments who have not investigated the basic questions of life are insecure and lack the confidence to face fundamental questions that human beings need to face. Atheistic political despots cannot face the challenges of the truth, freedom, equality and justice in their depth and ramifications affecting human life. They resort to harassment and aggression to intimidate those who stand up for human dignity, human rights, democracy and justice turning their Courts of Law to kangaroo courts of summary justice which are courts of injustice.
Religious leaders of various world religions should stand together in solidarity to oppose illegal and anti-social measures of undemocratic despotic totalitarian governments who have usurped democracy and the rights of people in the name of a socialist liberation which has turned out to be mass imprisonment and a captivity within national and ideological boundaries.
EARTH - A BETTER HOME
In the face of such eventualities it is challenging for religious leaders to keep to high levels of human dignity, human rights, autonomy, freedom and justice and exercise only persuasion and the force of truth and reason, altruistic human solidarity, compassion and love to uphold, maintain and promote ones religion and leave people free to accept or reject what is proposed. Others criticism of our religion from their point of view could be helpful in self-criticism and presenting to others a better awareness of our understanding of our religion and its principles.
It also needs to be asked as to what extent the revival, reform and inter-religious dialogue would have furthered mutual understanding, raised the level of fraternity among people and improved their lives, especially in its humanitarian and spiritual dimensions and promoted and stabilized peace and made the earth a better home for all to live in. To the extent that is achieved, to that extent the religions would have contributed a worthy and dutiful share of their own.

Huckleberries on hot summer days
Despite Thoreaus achievements as a writer, environmentalist and social activist (he was, among other things, a passionate abolitionist and supporter of John Brown), many of his contemporaries considered him little more than a crank, a self-involved Pied Piper for the children of Concord, MA, whom he led in search of huckleberries on hot summer days.
As Lauren Dassow Walls makes clear in her excellent Henry David Thoreau: A Life, he was a man of obsessively high principles, self-contained, a stickler for details who insisted on his own way of seeing the world, however quirky. Nathaniel Hawthorne, who would become a good friend, referred to him as a singular character . . . ugly as sin, long-nosed, queer-mouthed, and with uncouth and somewhat rustic, although courteous manners. Walls quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson to good effect in a letter introducing him to Henry James, Sr, assuring James that once he got past the younger mans village pedantry and tediousness of facts, he would discover a profound mind and a person of true magnanimity.
Rich crop
Walls is following in the footsteps of Thoreau biographers from Henry Seidel Canby (1939), Walter Harding (1965), Robert D. Richardson (1988) and Michael Sims (2014). And these books represent only the cream of a rich crop about this beloved author, whose many sides will never be contained in a single volume.
But Walls earns her keep, digging into Thoreaus aphoristic letters and journals, finding acute reflections by his contemporaries, and drawing a wonderfully brisk and satisfying portrait while paying special attention to his passion for science and engineering, a vein of inquiry that Robert M. Thorson goes on to deepen in The Boatman.
Thoreaus contact with nature was always more observational than Emersons, even though the latters Nature (1836) remained for him a fundamental text, a primer of Transcendentalist thought.
As Walls puts it: Thoreau knew a truth few others fully understand: human beings are not separate from nature but fully involved in natural cycles, agents who trigger change and are vulnerable to the changes they trigger. This awareness of human activity within nature (which would influence the deep ecology movement in our time) followed from Thoreaus work as a surveyor; indeed, he made a significant part of his income from this profession, which he regarded as self-defining. As Walls notes, he paraded around the village with a surveyors chain and a set of ten chaining pines, a measuring tape, drafting paper, tools . . . and, most glorious of all, a top-of-the-line fifteen-inch compass made of lacquered brass with a silvered five-inch dial.
Wood auction
Walls does not miss the irony that Thoreaus profession made him complicit in destroying the forest he loved. In 1850, for instance, he walked over land he had surveyed the year before, which the owner had clear-cut and subdivided into fifty-two house lots. Not surprisingly, he expresses guilt over this work in his journal: Today I was aware that I walked in a pitch pine wood which erelong, perchance, I may survey and lot off for a wood auction and see the choppers at their work. In 1851, he completed a substantial commissioned survey of Concords boundaries and recalled that the task had left him feeling as if he had committed suicide. He says darkly: Trade curses everything it handles. Thorsons The Boatman can be read profitably beside Wallss biography as a detailed (even excessively detailed) extension of his interest in river geology. Thorson suggests that Thoreau held complicated and occasionally selfish views of the natural watershed he knew so well, that river triumvirate in his backyard: the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord. Contrary to what one might expect, Thoreau allied with the industrialists of Massachusetts, not the local farmers, preferring the high water levels produced by dam releases to the low levels that were good for haymaking. In short, writes Thorson, upstream water releases from reservoirs great and small during the summer improved both his life as a naturalist and the cash flow of factory workers.
The Boatman presents the wetter side of Thoreau as he surveyed and boated on the three blue highways of navigable water flanked by open bays, lush meadows, and rocky cliffs that were part of his native habitat. Because of the overwhelming success of Walden, one commonly thinks of him sitting by a pond in the woods, even though he was as much a lover of rivers as woodlands. Quite rightly, Thorson dismisses A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849), the first of Thoreaus two book-length publications, as a scattered anthology of transcendental musings mixed with bits of poetry and natural description that never really add up to anything. He concludes: Henrys unheralded river book is his journal.
Essential artistry
It would be difficult to underestimate Thoreaus achievement in the journal he kept from 1837 to 1862 (when he died, aged only forty-four, from tuberculosis). The earliest entries functioned as a kind of quarry for ideas, where he would forage to find poems and prose passages. But on November 8, 1850, he suddenly treated the day and the date as essential to his artistry, Wells suggests. What he could find to write about on any given day became the goal of each new entry, a work of art in itself.
Thoreau simply stopped using his Journal as the means to the real work of art somewhere else, says Walls, and started treating the Journal itself as the work of art, with all the integrity that art demands. This new approach demanded focus and discipline. And it meant, in many ways, that his writing life went underground. Instead of, like most writers, producing book after book, Thoreau drove himself inward, disdaining public recognition.
Few readers will have pushed systematically through the immense thicket of Thoreaus Journal, the first edition of which, from 1906, amounts to fourteen volumes. And perhaps it is best enjoyed in excerpts.
Invisible moon
In this pursuit, one could do worse than read slowly through the entries culled by Richard Higgins in The Language of Trees, which are focused on the authors meticulous observations of trees, as in this entry from January 7, 1852: Last evening, walked to Lincoln to lecture in a driving snow storm, but the invisible moon gave light through the thickest of it. I observed how richly the snow lay on the cedars. Thoreau regards nature as a symbol of spirit, and his natural observations endlessly seek to connect inner and outer worlds.

Human or doll
At first glance, youd be forgiven for thinking Duckie Thot was a life-sized Barbie doll. The South Sudanese-Australian models smooth skin, silky hair, and slender frame is causing a commotion on Instagram  but her road to stardom hasnt exactly been lined with Dream Houses.
When Nyadak (Duckie) Thot was just 17, she was a frontrunner on the 2013 season of Australias Next Top Model.
Though it sounds like an empowering experience, Duckie later opened up about the constant torment she faced on social media regarding her natural hair, skin colour, and weight, including being called cauliflower head by former US Top Model contestant Winnie Harlow. I took quite a few blows as a 17-year-old girl  and it was hard to understand why, she told Teen Vogue in an emotional 2016 interview.
She found a mentor in Top Model judge and fellow cyberbullying victim Charlotte Dawson, and though Dawson tragically committed suicide in 2014, Duckie still lives by her advice to this day. That was really my driving force post-show.
After taking a couple years off to regain her strength, Duckie came back with the thunder.
Now 21 years old, shes got almost 300 thousand followers on Instagram, and is carving out icon status on her own terms. Oh, and shes happily accepted the Barbie title given by her fans.

JICA to provide Rs. 42,307 MN for Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project
A concessionary loan agreement for JPY 31,810 million (Rs. 42,307 million) was signed on July 7 between the Government of Sri Lanka and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project.
The agreement was signed by Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga and JICA Chief Representative of Sri Lanka Office Fusato Tanaka. The project is implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry.
The project will improve access to safe water and water supply efficiency in the southern area of Western Province by expanding Kalu Ganga water supply facilities and restructuring water distribution networks.The Western Province is the center of Sri Lankas political and economic activities, as around 42 percent of GDP and 28.5 percent of the population is concentrated in this area.
The province has been leading economic development with industrial complexes, export processing zones, and the largest international airport in the country.
Although the infrastructure is relatively advanced and the water supply coverage is 62.7 percent, higher than the national average of 45.9 percent, communities without water supply systems remain in the province outside of the Colombo district.
It is predicted that urbanisation will further progress and that the water demand will grow, making an expansion to the water supply services necessary in the province. Deterioration of the water distribution pipes has resulted in high non-revenue water rates of 30 to 40 percent caused by leaks, illegal connections, and uninstalled metres. To address the rising demand for water, it is essential that the non-revenue water rates are reduced for a more efficient water supply.
The project will construct water supply systems, expand the water treatment plants by another 140,000m3/day capacity, and install intake facilities, transmission and storage facilities among others.
It will launch a pilot project for reducing non-revenue water and contribute to strengthening the water supply capacity in the southern areas in Western Province for a safe, stable water supply.

Lanka under pressure as Zimbabwe eye rare series win
HAMBANTOTA: Initially it was the fielding and now it is poor bowling that is letting Sri Lanka down as they face a challenging task of trying to win the five-match One-Day International series against Zimbabwe in the fifth and final game to be played at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium here in Sooriyawewa today.
After running up a total of 300-6, Sri Lanka looked capable of defending it and winning the fourth ODI played here on Saturday which would have given them a winning 3-1 lead in the series but instead they now face the task of having to beat Zimbabwe in todays contest to secure the series that is vital for their rankings.
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer and coach Heath Streak are within one win away from creating history for their country. - AFP
The intervention of rain that arrived quite unexpectedly coupled with sub standard bowling saw Zimbabwe win under the Duckworth/Lewis rain rule and level the series 2-all going into todays match.
We actually didnt know that the rain will come in. It was dry and we expected the wicket to turn as the day went on. We saw in the last game also that the ball started turning after 20 overs in the second session. So we thought that if we bat first and bat well we had the batters to do the job. Dick batted really well and Danushka gave us a good platform, but the bowling was once again very disappointing, said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
How many times can you lose a game after scoring 300 runs. We had enough runs on the board, unfortunately the rain intervened but we still had the attack to defend it. The first ten overs we gave away too many runs and then rain intervened and after the rain we didnt bowl well we were well off the mark.
The bowlers poor efforts on the field overshadowed the brilliant batting of openers Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka who became the first opening pair in ODI cricket to share successive double century partnerships. Following the defeat Mathews said that his team was now under pressure to win the final match and the series.
I am under pressure as captain. We batted well but the bowling has been disappointing in both games we lost. Our fielding too has been disappointing. We should have played better. If we cant defend 300 theres something wrong, said Mathews.
We are sloppy with our fielding and the consistency is not there. In bowling also there are huge problems. Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep are both unwell. Why we lost was because our bowling was weak.
We dont whether it was through sheer frustration that Mathews made the remark, I dont know whether I will be captain till 2019.
Sri Lanka Cricket has made him captain till the 2019 World Cup but the way things are panning out Mathews must be one of the most dissatisfied captains in the world when his team is not performing to expectations. Meanwhile Zimbabwe has given themselves an outside chance to win their first ODI series against Sri Lanka.
We have had a few good games but nothing like this. A series win would be excellent for us. To beat a top team like Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka will be huge for us, said Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer.
I think weve achieved more than expected. Sri Lanka is a tough place to tour. Its hard to win against Sri Lanka who play so well at home. I would say its unexpected. They are a very hard team to beat at home but credit to our guys for sticking with it in a tough series.
They probably didnt expect this. We believe that we could achieve. I assume the pressure is more on them because they were expected to beat us. We wont take any pressure into the final match. We will take the confidence from this game. The confidence is pretty high for us, he said. - ST

LOST IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE
The other day, the taxpayers or the general public who pay our legislators their salaries and sponsor other perks witnessed another very brilliant parliamentary session on which way the people who voted them to power should get intoxicated. In speaking for the well-being of the people, not a single honourable member of the parliament seemed to play second fiddle to anyone of his colleagues and it is a single honour to the people of this paradise island. Yet, in the golden age of the parliament when we were craning to learn some good English, the veteran speakers in their numerous parliamentary debates, they spoke in English. The die is cast. The present generation is deprived of the golden opportunity of gathering some good words, proverbs, special terms and idioms into their vocabulary from the Hansard. Therefore, very often I teach the children who come to learn some good English from its back numbers.
The current parliament is a debacle in many a sense, a flop. Again, the die is cast. The latest debate on how to intoxicate the public in a mild manner was very interesting to me. The proposed drinks were beer and wine. An excellent idea! But where DUTCH COURAGE is concerned, there are things to ponder, the writer opines.
Yapalanaya or good governance
When the debate was going on, my copy of the COLLECTED OF SHAKESPEARE was lying on the stool in my parlour smiling at me. As I am blindly an anglophile, I always refer to Shakespeare oeuvre for inspiration. A critical perusal of the parliamentary life or the last five-year yapalanaya or good governance prompts me to give vent to my ideas from a literary angle. I once again remind our dear president to BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH. I bow my head with great respect to our great bard and playwright WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE [1564-1616]. May his tribe increase! For leaving us great sayings for any situation in the human society.
The famous COULDRON SCENE comes in the 1st scene of the 4th act in MACBETH. In my random thinking, I have always thought that the yahapalanaya has come to the boiling level. It was a brand new idea of a government for me when I heard it for the first time. I discussed among our circle of friends and I myself made a separate study of it and got onto the yahapalanaya bandwagon for a change. Now it is discernible not only to me, but also to most of the people that there is no much difference between the old chinthanaya and yahapalanaya. Apata puthe magak nethe.
The cauldron in Macbeth by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was a large round container for cooking, usually supported by a fire, and used especially in the past. After murdering the righteous King Duncan, Macbeth, his general, became king, but he had to live in constant fear. The period was full of superstitious beliefs and he relied on them. In order to face THE SLAIN KING Duncans sons Donaldbain and Malcolm he left no stone unturned and at last met the witches who prophesied his kingship. Macbeth was a man with the human milk of kindness.
It is evident in the play that he was made a villain by his queen. In the same way, in almost all the democracies ministers are made villains by their wives that for them to be ministers wives and for their children to be future ministers. That is the name of this game. It was reported in the national press and the electronic media that in an undeveloped region in Si Lanka something similar to the cauldron method is practised even today.
Blind beliefs and ignorance
In V. VIJAYATUNGAS GRASS FOR MY FEET, this method of getting things done by supernatural powers is called BLACK ARTS. I wonder whether it was successful or not, but it had wide publicity. The huge number of pages in the national newspapers full of black arts deeds advertisements performed by kattazias and Buddhist monks without the knowledge of the chief prelates bear ample testimony to the blind beliefs and the ignorance of the general public. In these nefarious activities, innocent young girls are raped by cupids and most of them end in prison cells. This trend has to be arrested for the good of the country.
My aim of this article is to make the public aware of the status quo of the Cabinet behaviour in the light of the ancient black arts deeds of England. At the helm of the political crisis, Macbeth declared that he would fight as a bear tied to a stake. In the Elizabethan England, the hounds were used to kill a bear tied to a stake. This cruelty to the animal was enjoyed by the people. On the political landscape in our country today, the situation seems the same. The Yahapalanaya cauldron is getting more and more heated because the ministers around the president from time to time put so many dreadful things into the cauldron, the latest to be beer and wine by the minister concerned. Into witches cauldron, the following things were put.
While the cauldron is boiling at great heat the witches go round it singing as given in the play.
ROUND ABOUT THE CAULDRON GO;IN THE POISONED ENTRAILS THROWThe following things were thrownToad under cold stone, Swelterd venomFillet of a fenny snakeEye of newt and toe of frogWool of bat and tongue of dogAdders fork and blindworms stingLizards leg and howlers wing
When all these things are added, the cauldron boils to the desired level. This is done according to the play
For a charm of powerful troubleLike a hell-broth boil and bubble.
In the same way, our Cabinet ministers from time to time throw what in their minds have into the Yahapalanaya cauldron. The latest is a few drops of beer and wine and it has started to boiling.
Adverse repercussions
The writer spent several nights in the vicinity of certain liquor bars to garner authentic details for this opinion writing like CHARLES DICKENS spent a lot of nights under the bridge of Thames to write about the gravity of prostitution. Our great poet WILLIAM BLAKE did the same thing to see how the women in the wake of the industrial revolution selling their body to earn a living. Even though the ministers do not know, because of their high living, beer is not matching to the addicted body system of the workers. The situation is pathetic. If the government increases the price of hot drinks like ordinary arrack and indirectly force them to drink beer and wine, it may have adverse repercussions.
The average labourer after his days work has a skinful at the liquor bar. He is ignorant about the harmful after effects. The situation is pathetic. If his addicted hot drink is not available to him at his price, he will go to the moonshine. Illicit liquor sale will soar. Wine and beer are labelled as womens drinks. The hardcore tipplers are in an inescapable vicious circle. In order to boost beer and wine business with hidden agendas, the government should never translate these suggestions into action. Even the modern teachers who are regarded as angels of morality prefer to have hot drinks with a high percentage of alcohol to have a kick. Most of the public and private sector employees go home on all fours almost daily. In THE VILLAGE BY THE SEA the award-winning writer ANITA DESAI discusses this problem in detail. She explains in her peculiar literary parlance how a little village was ruined by liquor. I humbly think that the legislators should step into their parliamentary library at least once a week and read some good books regarding these subjects.
The writer with his little understanding of the ground reality would like to propose the government to give more and more educational opportunities to the children of the selected hardcore drunkards with the long-term objective of making them able to swim in the upward mobility in the society. It is discernible that most of the parents give up the habit of drinking liquor when their off rings become responsible citizens of the country.
A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.

Mannar identified for major tourism development
The Ministry of Tourism Development has identified Mannar District for major tourism infrastructure development projects. Already over Rs. 40 million has been spent on making the beach areas tourist friendly and many other projects are being planned in order to make the district the main hub for tourism in the region.
During a discussion between Minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga and Minister of Commerce and Industry and Member of Parliament for Mannar District, Rishad Bathiudeen at the Tourism Ministry recently, it was decided to position Mannar as the main hub for visiting key attractions in the region.
The main attractions include the famed Madhu Church Shrine, Wilpattu National Park and a host of other sites which have been identified as having considerable tourism potential.
These include the Thanthirimale historic temple, ancient Thiruketheeswaram Kovil where it is believed rituals have been performed without a break for the past 2,000 years, the Dutch period lighthouse, historic pier and fishing harbour, the Portuguese/Dutch Fort, and Adams Bridge which is a constellation of small islands stretched out over a 50 km sand strip connecting mainland India that spawned the famous legends of Hanuman, Rama and Ravana.
Among the other attractions in the district are the famous 700 year old Baobab Tree which is also called elephant tree for the sheer size of its girth, Doric House at Arippu which at the time it was built as the official residence of British Governor Frederick North in the 1800s was described as the most beautiful house in Ceylon, and Yoda Wewa or Giants Tank built by King Dathusena in the 5th century which interestingly is the main point for the seasonal Siberian bird migration.
Minister Amaratunga said that plans have already been drawn by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to develop home-stay villages around the tank in order to offer an authentic experience to tourists visiting the district.
Meanwhile a beachfront area of around 300 acres will be identified as a resort area for accommodation purposes. This area will be developed on a fast track basis with all facilities for tourists while priority will be given for eco-tourism projects.
Based on a request by Minister Bathiudeen, it was decided to set-up a hotel school for the youth of the district to learn basic hospitality skills. Minister Amaratunga instructed officials of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management to set up a satellite school in the Mannar town area offering basic training for entry level positions in the hotel trade.

Microsoft commends Guru.lk for smart schools project in SL
Sri Lankas successful transformation of 65 schools into smart schools capable of deploying digital learning protocols, is to be showcased in the Asia Pacific region by Microsoft.
The global technology giant recently invited Guru.lk, the company that coordinated the countrys single largest deployed smart schools project, to present a case study on the initiative in Singapore to Microsoft country representatives from the Asia Pacific region, Microsoft education partners and officials from Microsofts head office in Redmond, USA.
Guru.lk collaborated with Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Microsoft Sri Lanka and the Western Province Education Ministry over a six month period to complete the transformation of the 65 schools, including training and helping more than 1,000 teachers in the use of the hardware and software required for digital format education.
Presenting the case study on the project, Hasitha Dela, CEO of Headstart the company that owns Guru.lk, pointed out that it was completed in record time despite Sri Lankas digital literacy rate being 26 percentwhich is lower than middle income countries in the South East Asia region such as Malaysia and Thailand.
It was also noted that the transformation encompassed schools of varying sizes, standards and locations.
Sri Lankan teachers have earned more than 12,000 Microsoft badges, one of highest figures for countries in the Asia Pacific region.
These badges signify the interaction of teachers with technology for teaching and learning. Many of the teachers trained by Guru.lk for Sri Lankas smart schools programme are now capable of creating digital content themselves for the purpose of teaching their students, Dela said.
Commenting on the success of the smart schools project in Sri Lanka, the Director of Education Partners at Microsoft for the Asia Pacific Region Dr Rani Burchmore said: Headstart has created something awesome that empowers some of the most important people in education  the teachers. It is through partners such as Headstart that Microsoft aims to help deliver such solutions on a large scale, to truly make a difference in global education.
As one of the partners in the smart schools project, Microsoft Sri Lanka provided free Office 365 licences for the participating schools and also invested on teacher training for the project.
Guru.lk provided the student Learning Management System free of charge, provided content, conducted teacher training and coordinated the implementation of the project.
Headstart has been developing content for the ICTA/Ministry of Education on school curricula since 2009. The company was a tech start-up with a project named Vidunena under which the GCE A/L Science curriculum was provided to schools in an E Learning format, through an ICTA grant. The company also provides E Learning content and platform solutions to corporates, institutions, the government sector and the general public under the brand name Guru.lk.

Nadars most treasured mementos
The book, the size of a large photo album, has been disassembled, its two hundred-odd pages cut out and placed each in its own transparent protective sheath. Detached, the leather-bound front cover, with Flix Nadars flamboyant signature stamped in the center in gold leaf, lies in a cardboard box looking scuffed and forlorn, like exiled royalty.
The album is a livre dor, one of several guest books or autograph albums he kept in successive studios. If you came to sit for a portrait (or a caricature, in the early days on the rue Saint-Lazare), and if you were an artist or a celebrity or preferably both, he would pester you to sign and leave a memento: a quip, a sketch, a poem, a few bars of music. Most sitters complied. Many signed and left only a brief remark, if any; others spent hours over a drawing or a watercolor, leaving on the page work of impressive quality. Flix was very proud of his collection of autographs, each one a token of friendship or a link with an eminent individual.
Periodic bouts
This particular livre dor, an astonishing record of the rich cultural life of Paris during the Second Empire, is stored in a rare-book library in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia Suffering from one of his periodic bouts of acute insolvency, Flix sold the album at auction in the early 1890s. It was bought by Thomas W. Evans, an American expatriate living in Paris whod grown rich and respected as the dentist to Napolon III.
When Evans died in 1897, he left his considerable fortune to endow the Thomas W. Evans Museum and Dental Institute; the livre dor and his collection of art and antiques were shipped across the Atlantic and housed in the Evans Building, an imposing Tudor Revival edifice erected on the site of his ancestral home, in what is now the middle of the University of Pennsylvania campus. After languishing for decades in the Dental Medicine Library, the Nadar album was transferred in 1985 to the universitys rare books and manuscripts collection. About ten years ago it was taken apart and led away in fourteen cardboard storage boxes.
Few people know it exists; fewer ask to see it. Yet even disbound it evokes the busy ferment of Nadars world in the decade after Louis-Napolons coup dtatthe decade in which Flix attempted to create a panorama of his illustrious contemporaries. The pages of the livre dor echo with the voices of talented men (only a handful of women signed the album, mostly opera singers, actresses, and ballerinas), and these voices make many different sounds: friendly greeting; mutual admiration; facetious commentary; and political harangue (mostly socialist).
Self-conscious musings and private jokes abound, and always in the background is the buzz of artistic ego, sometimes muted, sometimes not. Its clear that an element of competition was involved: anybody about to sign would flip through to see what had been done before and by whom. Then there was the delicate business of choosing a page. With whom would you like to be associated
Primitive method
Nadars photographs show us what the cultural elite of his day looked like, the images preserved by the modern miracle of the wet-plate collodion process. A livre dor makes use of an older, more primitive method to offer a different perspective: the traces it preserves are marks on plain paper left by the individuals own hand.
On the first page, a pair of writers pop up, Lon Gozlan and Fabrice Labrousse. Each left a sentence and a signature, one on top of the other, like lines of dialogue. The two men were almost exact contemporaries, and both wrote for the theater; they must have known each other but probably visited Nadars studio on different daysa pause in the dialogue.
A close associate of Balzac, and like Balzac wildly prolific, Gozlan scrawled in his neat but impulsive hand a pronouncement Flix would have endorsed enthusiastically: Nothing is more immoral than boredom. Labrousses rejoinderNothing is more moral than distractionwould also have appealed. The rest of the page is blank, as though there were nothing more to say.
Sketches of Flix were left by Alexandre Laemlein, Jean Gigoux, Prince Alexis Soltykoff, Alcide Joseph Lorentz, and Charles Amde de No (better known as the cartoonist Cham).
A Bavarian-born history painter, Laemlein was admitted to the cole des Beaux-Arts at age sixteen to study with a neoclassical painter, Jean-Baptiste Regnault, who promptly died, and then another, Franois-douard Picotthe same Picot who taught Flixs brother, Adrien.
Eye for color
In his review of the Salon of 1846, Baudelaire paused to mention a painting by Laemlein, Universal Charity:
[A] charming woman holds by the hand and carries at her breast kids from every climate, white, yellow black, etc.  Certainly Mr. Laemlein has an eye for color; but theres a major flaw in this painting, which is that the little Chinese boy is so pretty, and his robe makes such an agreeable effect that it almost monopolizes the eye of the spectator. The little mandarin is still trotting along in ones memory.
Somber, handsome, ambitious, Laemleins monochrome ink and watercolor portrait of Flix strains with some success for the psychological acuity of a Nadar photograph.
Gigoux tries less hard and does better. His rapid sketch, focused on the eyes, gives the impression of vitalitythe quality so many of his friends remarked on. Flix looks as though hes just noticed something interesting and is about to jump up and investigate.
A talented and versatile painter, Gigoux is today remembered for having been the lover of Balzacs widow, the Polish noblewoman Ewelina Hanska. In 1851, a year after Balzacs death, Hanska hired Gigoux to paint a portrait of her daughter Anna; the widow and the artist lived together for the next thirty years.
Second career
Prince Soltykoff was an aristocratic Russian diplomat who retired to Paris in 1840 (age thirty-four) and embarked on an unusual second career: over the next six years, he made two long voyages to the Indian subcontinent, traveling from the Himalayas to Sri Lanka and sketching the wonders he beheld. His written account of his exotic adventures and the dramatic lithographs based on his drawings caused a sensation and earned him the nickname the Indian. - Paris Review

Nanomaterial Research consortium at Jaffna Uni envisaged
The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences on Friday signed a collaboration agreement with the University of Jaffna on capacity building and establishing of a research consortium in nanomaterials for clean energy in the presence of Norwegian Ambassador Thorbjrn Gaustadsther.
Under the agreement, the Norwegian Embassy will provide 6.2 million Norwegian Kroners (112 mn LKR) over a period of three years for the programme.
I hope this partnership on clean energy technology brings new ideas and advances in sustainable energy solutions for Sri Lanka, Ambassador Gaustadsther said.
Part of the funding will be used to upgrade the laboratory facilities and for technical assistance and capacity building at the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Technology at the Kilinochchi campus and at the Faculty of Science at the Jaffna campus of the University of Jaffna.
Establishing a consortium on clean energy technologies, which includes the partners and private enterprises in Sri Lanka and Norway is a main objective of the programme. Clean energy technology is a priority sector for Norway. Therefore, promoting the technologies and building linkages between research and business is encouraged leading to further investments in innovation.
Enterprises in Norway and in Sri Lanka will contribute to the project by providing technical assistance, placements for the students, involvement in research projects, and offering mentors and external supervisors for the research projects. They will offer opportunities for visits and exchange of knowledge through discussions as well.
The Norwegian Embassy through this collaboration is further strengthening the support of 4,7 million Norwegian Kroners (85mn LKR) received from NORPART (Norwegian Partnership Programme for Global Academic Cooperation) for the period starting from 2017 to 2021.
In March of this year, the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences and the University of Jaffna signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on educational and research cooperation at Masters and PhD level.
Under the NORPART programme, the two institutions collaborate on higher education and research in nanomaterials for clean energy technologies (HRCNET). The University of Bergen and the University of Agder from Norway, the University of Peradeniya from Sri Lanka, and the Coimbatore Institute of Technology from India are included as partners in the project.

National Maritime and  Logistics Policy soon
A National Maritime and Logistics Policy will be formulated within three months and it will be an inclusive approach where all stakeholders involvement will be sought, said Ports Authority Chairman Dr Parakrama Dissanayake, addressing the 36th AGM of Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLAFFA), held in Colombo last Thursday, as the guest of honour. Jagath Pathirane was appointed as the Chairman of SLAFFA for the period 2017/2018.
Elaborating further, Dr Dissanayake said it will go beyond maritime limits and encompass road and rail transport. He said they have also embarked on a port master plan to look at medium and long term needs of the nation.
The Chairman said as a small nation Sri Lanka has done exceptionally well. We have a port which is handling almost six million containers per year.
All ports in India put together handle about 11 million containers per year. So as a small nation with a small population we have done well, he said.
Sri Lanka has a port which is among the largest 25 ports in the world he said, continuing that another important area that they have embarked on already was the modernization of the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT). We will be modernizing the JCT 4 by embarking on a JCT 5 as well where we can handle two deep craft earth ships at once, he said.
The Chairman said CICT cannot work three large vessels at once because the key length is 1,200 metres and only two 400-metre vessels can be worked on. Dr. Dissanayake said there was a shortage of deep draft berths which was posing a huge challenge to the Port of Colombo and that issue needed to be addressed by policymakers. He said the Minister was very keen on operationalising the East Container Terminal as earlier as possible.
The Chairman said they also had a plan to establish a cargo distribution centre at Bloemendhal and create a logistics corridor in consultation with the Western Region Megapolis Project and if the Minister agrees, to work on these two projects as a public-private partnership.
Dr Dissanayake said that there was also a detailed study of a port on the North side of the existing Port of Colombo and the ADB will provide funds to carry out that study.
He said that shortly they would be calling for an Expression of Interest to launch a yacht marina and a ship repair and service providing centre in the Port of Galle.
The Chairman said in Trincomalee they plan to develop the entire area of 5,000 hectares of land with the Ashroff Jetty expansion plan and they will lengthen the Ashroff Key to accommodate larger vessels in Trincomalee and also have a rail connection between the China Bay and the Ashroff Jetty. The key of Kankesanthurai (KKS) would also be lengthened, he noted.

## Title: Never provoke mental folks with sick jokes!

Never provoke mental folks with sick jokes!
Never laugh at a person with a mental disorder. That is because it is an illness. And illnesses of any kind are not a laughing matter. To be sure, you can joke with them, laugh with them but never laugh at them.
Mental problems
Throughout history, people afflicted with mental illness have often been stigmatised and ostracised. Worse still is the truism that psychological maladies have long been assailed with confusion, misunderstanding and mistreatment, And worse still is the horrifying prospect of incarceration, persecution and torture such sufferers have undergone.
But while society has come a long way in the progressive treatment afforded to the mentally ill, we still have a long way to go. We still make jokes and laugh at them. Why One reason is because despite the progress we live in a society that is still deeply confused about mental illness. Also in general, people tend to fear or dislike what they do not know because they view it as a threat.
Many are unaware that one in ten people suffer from some type of mental illness or trauma in Sri Lanka, according to reports by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The startling figure has been the result of studies done by the World Health Organization.
The study had found that the causes for mental illness in Sri Lanka were both varied and complex, though most professionals believe that the 30-year secessionist conflict and the 2004 tsunami were among the more significant events that had been the primary causes for increasing mental health issues in the country. According to national mental health data, two in every 100 Sri Lankans experience a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. However mental problems can be treated so that people can recover from them in full and hopefully lead normal lives. Nearly 80 percent of these patients, once treated, would go on to make a full recovery and lead normal lives, according to officials.
But they concede that social stigma has been one of the biggest barriers faced by such persons. The stigma faced by mental patients can make it awfully difficult for them to motivate themselves to get better. Everyone has a role to play to end discrimination against mentally ill people, they say.
Horrifyingly insensitive
Psychiatrists will confirm that many of those who are mentally ill are victims of torture by their own minds. And of course it is made a great deal worse by the unsympathetic and sicker minds which find their actions hilarious. It is even more traumatic for family and friends who love the afflicted sufferers causing them considerable pain as they watch the transformation from who they were to the tortured souls they become. For too long we have swept the problems of mental illness under the carpet with the hope that they would go away. Fat hope and wishful thinking, no less.
The bottom line is this: People become biased towards the mentally ill because they do not understand mental illness. Many place the blame of such inconsiderate disinformation squarely on the shoulders of the media, particularly TV and film-makers. While some outlets treat mental illness with honesty and sensitivity, most popular media treats the mentally ill as frightening, funny, or both. Many people do not seem to give it a second thought. But for people whose loved ones suffer from ongoing mental illness, such portrayals are hurtful and hard to ignore. Just turn on the TV any day of the week and you should be able to find at least one show that either reinforces terror of the mentally ill, or makes light their illness for a cheap laugh. Misinformation, as well as entertainment that pokes fun at people with mental illness and in some cases encourages laughter at the idea of their mistreatment can be totally damaging to such sufferers.
What it actually does accomplish is horrifyingly insensitive to boot. For one, It further marginalises and dehumanises people with mental illness by treating them as caricatures. Oh yes, it is quite easy to laugh if we forget that we laughing at real people suffering from real illnesses.
Also it encourages persecution and mistreatment. And it discourages people from seeking help for mental illness. In an environment that vacillates between mockery and horror and with the new media reaching out to millions, such degrading portrayals will only serve to further stigmatise the mentally ill.
Extreme cases
What many of us fail to realise is that these people experience a range of emotions, from depression and shame to guilt and loneliness. Their self-esteem plunges and they are overcome by a sense of hopelessness. In extreme cases, the stigma attached to their condition leads them to commit suicide. Everyone should spare a thought for sufferers and become dedicated to bringing awareness to mental health. Too many people suffer in silence and go as far as taking their own life because they are ashamed of who they are and too afraid to speak up. We must pay attention to this crucial question and stop and listen to the quiet cries for help.
Serious mental illness has mythological status in our culture. No wonder so many people have no idea how to relate to a real person who acknowledges or displays a mental illness. That is why this general societal misunderstanding of mental illness affects all of us.
Where do we draw the line Are we so insensitive to people with mental illness that we enjoy seeing their struggles What if that person on the news was your mother, brother or child Would you think it was funny then Always remember, its only funny if the other person is laughing with you.
They say that the dividing line between sanity and mental illness is a tiny thin thread. Which inspires me to conjure up a great counter one-liner for those who persistently debase and make derogatory jokes about the suffering sick.
In my estimation I want to point out that the same perilous dividing line appears to have been drawn in the wrong place. (See box on this page on how you can contribute to help the cause of abandoned women cured of mental illness.)

New Constitutional reforms ensure prime place for Buddhism: Sajith
No threats of any kind would affect Buddhism under the proposed new constitution the contents of which are yet in deliberating stages. Instead, the foremost place of Buddhism would be lawfully well-preserved and precisely upheld, Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa said.
The minister said so at the public gathering that followed the inauguration of Suramayagama, the 33rd housing project launched under the revived Village Awakening Model programme. The new housing project established at Mahakurunda, Miriswatte in Bentota, Galle, is the first such village-awakening scheme launched in Galle district.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Galle District parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Bandulalal Bandarigoda also participated.
Some critics with ulterior moves baselessly alleged that the Buddhism is threatened under the new constitution. We assure that nothing adverse would be caused to Buddhism. However, the proposed new constitution would be a big threat to power-craving politicians who aspire to retain the Executive Presidency and to take hold of the power again and continue their usual exploitation of national wealth through blatant abuse of power and mega corruptions. The new constitution would really be a betrayal to those who abused power and unleashed all sorts of corruption and frauds, the minister added.
The proposed constitutional changes will not let down Buddhism. Instead, it will assure the foremost position of it. Could the former President who claims to be the so called savior of religion build at least a single stupa during his long rule My father, who created model villages throughout the country, erected a dagaba at each of such villages established under his village-awakening programme. It was my father, late President Ranasinghe Premadsa, who reconstructed and raised the Maligawila standing Buddha statue which had been broken into pieces when it was first found. So are we to ruin Buddhism he said.
It was during the past regime that car races were held in front of sacred Temple of Tooth premises with no care to Maha Sanghas repeated objections against those unholy maneuvers launched using the services our valiant war heroes who saved our motherland from the clutches of terrorists. Were those profane practices aimed at protecting Buddhism The former President, who did nothing for the well-being of Buddhism during his tenor, at present, issues deceitful statements in the name of Buddhism. He could not stop his son from doing disgraceful acts at a sacred religious place of highest Buddhist veneration he further pointed out, he added.
The proposed constitutional reforms are aimed at the empowerment of people safeguarding the countrys territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. They also encourage the reinforcement of Independent Commissions in respect of vital social sectors, while media freedom already ensured will be further fortified, guaranteeing transparency in all sectors of administration. Scientific devolution of power will be a threat to dictatorship. Hence, the new constitution will be a boon for the public, while the same will a betrayal for past rulers who advocated autocracy, Minister Premadasa added.
Subsequent to the 2010 Presidential election, the former rulers introduced the 18th Amendment to the Constitution in place of the 17th Amendment. They wanted to be in power for ever. At that time, no one objected or talk against such oppressive moves. Many who raise their voices against the Good Governance Government making use of freedoms ensured by the present administration were quite cowardly silent over such tyrannical moves of the previous regime, he added.
He said, the crown of war victory was secured by our heroic members of Tri-forces and Police. However, it adorned some other people. Those who existed on the glory of the war heroes did not at least think over their grave problems such as providing a decent shelter for them and their families. There are 3,650 homeless war hero families. It shows their gratefulness towards our war heroes.
The minister said, Today I open the 33rd model village. My work alone is a good answer for those who question about present governments development process since its inception. During the past administration, a large number of houses belonged to the ministry were freely distributed among the family members of previous government.
Nevertheless, the assets which were then shared among family circles at present are fairly distributed among the public who deserve such offer. Before the end of the year, we will complete the work on 500 model villages. My ministry has formed a special task force to overview the progress of all newly-established model villages. I invite all political opponents who query our development work to come with me around the country to witness our development projects, he added.

No laughing matter!
He is a man who wears many hats: comedian, presenter and actor. However in personal life he is very much a family man at heart. A personality who spreads love and laughter wherever he goes Ronnie Leitch achieved fame through his song Thattaya for which he has also built up an image. He and his wife, Yvette, have been married for 31 years. Here she talks about what makes her robust husband tick.
In private life
Ronnie is a jovial person at home as well. He is very much like his public image. He makes us laugh loads. However there are times when he displays his temper when he gets annoyed. However on the whole he is a fun-loving person.
The family man
Ronnie loves spending time with his family. He has given our daughter, Keshiya, a lot of support in her acting career before she got married. She did a lot of dramas while she was at Bishops College. Our son, Keshan, is doing his MBA in business management at a private university in .
Since Ronnie and the children are out most of the day we usually have our dinner together. That is a special time of togetherness for us. We also attend church together. I am a Catholic and Ronnie is an Anglican but we attend each others church functions without any issues.
Ronnie is also very much into helping me around the house. He is the one who does the marketing in the house. He is very skilled at making great choices and bringing the best items home at a reasonable price. I am quite lost in that aspect!
The first meeting
Our meeting was way back in 1974. I was schooling at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya, then. We used to live close to Ronnies place in Bellanvila and I had to pass his home on my way to school. I have seen him standing there. Though we had seen each other he was not interested to peruse me then because I was still schooling and he was busy with his work. He was not a well known personality at that time.
One day my cousin and I went to watch the Bellanvila perehara. Since the perehara passed that way we stood close to his house. He too came out and I met him there and then we began chatting a bit. We became fast friends. My father was thorough about me finishing my schooling, so Ronnie waited patiently till I am done with it. He came to our home after that a spoke to my father. He has taken me out a few times. We watched a film together once.
Wedding dates
We got married on June 7, 1986. Keshiya got married this year on June 8. She was aiming for the same date but there were problems with getting the band together. Therefore she had to shift to June 8 so that they too could be included in the event.
Most shocking moment
Ronnie was not in when Keshiya was born. He worked for the Defense Ministry in for six years. I was in but he visited once a year.
The Gypsies had been touring and they had met Ronnie there and requested him to come back to . Their band member, Piyal, had promised to write a good song for him. Ronnie had agreed but he did not know that he had to sacrifice his hair for the deed. The song was titled Thattaya and became an instant hit in 1991. Ronnie became a part of the Gypsies Show too.
One day Ronnie went out and when he returned it was late night and he turned up without his hair! I was really shocked and outraged.
The bald head is a popular trend now but it was not so then. I was so upset that I didnt even speak to him for a few days.
Ronnie could not grow his hair back because he had to perform to the song at every show. He had to keep up to the image as the Thattaya. I got used to it later. Now I feel that he looks much better bald.
Her favourite song fromhis collection
I really like Thattaya because that was the one which rocketed him to fame. I also love Kauda Bole Alice.
Most romantic gesture
Ronnie has done a lot of things for my benefit and all that he does, he does from the heart. So everything he does is special for me.
Birthday celebrations
He usually gives me a lot of gifts for my birthday. The birthday cards he gives are especially prominent because they are huge. He purchases them from a shop close by. For almost every birthday he has given me gold jewellery items.
Favourite cuisine
I do all the cooking in the house. Ronnie loves traditional village food like jak, bread fruit, and tender jackfruit. He is suffering from a kidney problem so some types of food are not good for him. He is a fan of fried sprats. He also loves fish curry. I am not fussy about my meals but eat anything that I come across on my plate.
Animal lovers
We had two dogs. Champ passed away recently. Sheeba is still with us. Ronnie is not that much into animals. He treats them kindly, but he is not keen to touch them. I am a dog lover. Keshan too is really into dogs. Keshan got the dogs as gifts from Ronnies parents.
Christmas celebrations
Our whole family gets together for Christmas celebrations. Christmas 2016 was a sad affair for us because it will be the final Christmas that Keshiya would be with us. She will be moving to soon to be with her husband. Ronnie is especially close to her because she is our first born.
Temper wise
When Ronnie gets angry, he really gets angry. He expresses his anger by shouting at us, but luckily he cools down fast. I actually handle such situations by scolding back! After that drama his anger melts away. If I have an issue, especially about the children, I speak about it with Ronnie. He finds solutions to problems quickly.
Travelling
Ronnie goes on tours to take part in musical shows but I do not accompany him on tours. We have been to and for vacation. We are hoping to go to next. Vacations abroad are not an annual event. We splurge on one when we feel the need to have a break.
Popularity
Fans come up to talk to him whenever we are out. At times it does get in the way of our privacy but I have accepted the fact that it is part and parcel of his profession by now. I have not had any bad experiences with his fans so far. Ronnie has faced quite a number of experiences though. Once some girls have come up to say Hi to him and a few minutes after they had left he had found that they had pasted some chewing gum on his head.
An alternative profession
If Ronnie had not become a musician I think he would have gone for a normal office job. However right throughout his school days and afterwards he has been passionate about music and presenting. He did not have second thoughts about the career he wants to be in. He is close friends with Sunil and Piyal of the Gypsies. He is popular due to their efforts. He has always been a fan of yesteryear hits.

NWP prohibits tuition classes on Sundays, Poya days
The North Western Provincial Council (NWP) has decided to take legal steps against private tuition class owners and teachers who conduct classes in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts on Sundays and Poya days.
A special Gazette notification was issued prohibiting private tuition classes in 2015 by the then Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara on Sundays and poya days as schoolchildren are deprived of gaining religious knowledge and spiritual guidance from Sunday dhamma schools and places of worships.
The private tuition class owners are openly violating the rule now and therefore, the NWP Human Resources Development Authority decided to conduct raids in the province to nab errant tuition teachers and file cases against them in courts.
The offenders are liable to undergo one year jail term and a Rs. 50,000 fine if they are found guilty by the law in this regard, NWP Human Resources Development Authority General Manager B.M.L.C. Balasooriya said.

Proteas end India's winning start at Women's World Cup
LONDON, Saturday  South Africa captain Dane van Niekerk starred with both bat and ball as the Proteas ended India's unbeaten start to the Women's World Cup in England on Saturday with a crushing 115-run win.
Van Niekerk made 57 in a total of 273 for nine that featured Lizelle Lee's dashing 92.
India, who had won all four of their previous group matches, then slumped to 158 all out with van Niekerk taking four for 22 -- including dismissing opposing skipper Mithali Raj for the first golden duck of the India star's one-day international career.
I just stuck to my plans and today it came off. We said we wanted it, and we did that, said van Niekerk after her side's third win in five matches.
Everyone chipped in and it was a brilliant team performance, she added after a victory that took South Africa into the top four of the eight-team tournament -- with the leading four sides going into the semi-finals after the all-play-all group phase.
Lee's remarkable innings saw her score 82 runs in boundaries.
Raj, who won the toss, said: When we decided to field it was because of the history of the ground.
Weve had people saying that most of the matches that are won here are chasing. She added: We did realise that Lee's wicket was very important.
I give full credit to her batting, she played one of the best innings I have seen in the World Cup against us.
Meanwhile New Zealand, whose only loss so far this tournament has come against reigning champions Australia, inflicted winless Pakistan's fifth defeat in as many matches.
Hannah Rowe took three for 22 on her World Cup debut as Pakistan were skittled out for 144.
Sophie Devine then smashed nine sixes -- the most in a women's ODI innings -- while scoring 93 from just 41 balls as New Zealand moved closer to a semi-final place with an eight-wicket success at Taunton.
The sixes record will be nice to look back on, but the most important thing was the win and the points - winning clinically was a bonus, said Devine. We know how important run-rate is going to be in this tournament, its so tight in those top five or six teams.
SCORES:
* At Leicester: South Africa 273-9, 50 overs (L Lee 92; D van Niekerk 57; S Pandey 3-40;) v India 158, 46 overs (D Sharma 60; D van Niekerk 4-22)
South Africa beat India by 115 runs
* At Taunton: Pakistan 144, 46.5 overs (Sana Mir 50; H Rowe 3-22) v New Zealand 147-2, 15 overs (S Devine 93) -

Rabada heartbroken over Test ban
LONDON, Saturday  Kagiso Rabada is heartbroken at being banned from next week's second Test against England at Trent Bridge, according to South Africa team-mate Temba Bavuma.
Rabada was suspended after picking up a fourth demerit point for swearing at England's Ben Stokes after he dismissed the all-rounder on the first day of this four-match series at Lord's on Thursday. The fast bowler, one of world cricket's rising stars, was previously given three demerit points for a shove on Sri Lanka's Niroshan Dickwella in a one-day international in Cape Town in February.
KG (Kagiso) is an emotional character -- he didn't purposely act like that, but he was fully aware of the consequences, Bavuma told reporters after stumps on Saturday. He is quite heartbroken, because he feels he has let down the team. But we fully understand it happened in the heat of the moment, added Bavuma.
England ended the third day of the first Test well-placed at 119 for one in their second innings -- a lead of 216 runs. The diminutive Bavuma, one of several Proteas batsmen to make fifty without going in a first innings total of 361, said he had been sledged (subjected to verbal abuse) on the cricket field since he was a schoolboy.
You don't want it to be completely taken away but you still want the respect of the game to be there, he added. A balance needs to be achieved. - AFP

Reconsidering Venice, crumbling city
Ive never forgotten that feeling of first approaching Venice from the lagoon. She smacked me in the face and then she floored me, and I will admit to being enthralled, and not a little love-struck. It was the vast, shimmering splendor of the city that captured me at first; but then, once Id stepped off the boat, I was captivated on a more intimate levelas she enticed me into her spooky, shadowy lair and never released me.
Its a sensation that most visitors share, for who doesnt love Veniceeven with her crowds of bewildered selfie-stick tourists; her I-saw-you-coming prices in the restaurants; or even the occasional, drain-like pong in a side alley She is one of the most visited cities in the world with good reason. People travel there for romantic weekends, for the opera, the palaces, the churches and museums.
Maze of alleys
For cocktails at Harrys Bar, for drifting along peaceful canals in a gondola, or for getting lost in the maze of alleys that fiendishly weave their way across the city. Its a place of film festivals, art festivals, or where Hollywood stars go to get married. Its mysterious, historic and famously sinking into the sea. Theres really nowhere else like it on earth.
But as intimately as travel can acquaint one with Venice, the city is perhaps just as well-known from novels, art and film. From these sources, we have come to accept that Venice is a place of carnivals and courtesans; of Stygian fogs and dark twisting backstreets where something sinful or criminal is sure to lurk. Pick up any novel thats set in Venice and certain words will leap at you from the blurb: Decadence, seduction, mystery, forbidden love, corruption, excess.
And then there is the word that appears with such regularity that it could constitute its own literary sub-genrecrumbling. Crumbling Venice could be anything from moldering palaces and peeling piazzas through to the disintegration of the characters themselves. It seems that Venice is fixed in our imaginations as a place of decay. Its not only gothic in its architectureits gothic in its nature.
When did this love for crumbling Venice begin, and why has it taken hold with such tenacity By the time Victorian historian and art critic John Ruskin encountered the city in the 1840s, he thought Venice was so neglected that she might melt into the lagoon like a lump of sugar in hot tea. Its true that Ruskin feared any further deterioration, but what appalled him to an even greater extent was any attempt to modernize the city. He wanted a Venice that was set in aspic, a time-capsule for posterity.

Renewed calls for GPS tracking collars for endangered tuskers
Environmentalists have renewed their call for GPS tracking collars to protect the endangered elephant population in the country with the wild the number of jumbo deaths on the rise.
The latest call comes in the wake of Deega Danthu, the famous tusker being injured and found lying by the bank of Kala Wewa after several days.
Highlighting the importance for a proper monitoring system to protect these tuskers, environmentalist Supun Jayaweera says the Department of Wildlife, which is the legally authorised guardian of these animals, should take necessary steps to introduce GPS tracking collars to these animals.
The Tusker of Kala Wewa, a rarest of the 1% tusker community in Sri Lanka injured due to human activity was found yesterday (08) near Kala Wewa.
The Department of Wildlife is providing the tusker with the necessary medical treatment and Jayaweera said hopefully,the tusker will survive his injuries.
According to Jayaweera, the tusker is suffering from an injury sustained by a gun shot to one of its front legs, above the ankle.
The injury seems to have been caused by a trap gun, he said.
There is no life threatening situation for Deega Danthu at present. Even though the injury seem less serious, when tuskers like these fall it is not easy to get them back on their feet. Deega Danthu is unable to carry his weight with the injured leg at the moment, Jayaweera explained.
As Deega Danthu lie fighting for life, Jayaweera points out that lack of proper monitoring of these tuskers has put their lives at stake. He observes that Mahasen, an equally rare tusker who roams the banks of the Minneriya reservoir and the sacred grounds of Somawathiya has suffered from numerous gunshot injuries. The continuation of the line of tuskers in Sri Lanka depends on these tuskers.Therefore,their security is something that should be taken very seriously, Jayaweera said.
Deega Danthu was found after several days after it was initially injured. Unless someone reports that a tusker is injured or if the Wildlife officers look for a tusker noticing its absence, there is no method to find out if a tusker is in danger or not, Jayaweera further said.
Jayaweera also said the umbrella protection provided to national parks is insufficient forthese tuskers who have a behavior pattern of migrating from one wilderness to another continuously.
Environmentalist Shashikalana Ratwatte speaking to the Daily News says wildlife conservation policies regarding these tuskers and wildlife at large must undergo drastic changes.
Ratwatte described the present wildlife conservation policy adopted by the Wildlife Department to be out dated and emphasised the importance of upgrading it up to that of international standards like in African countries.
These countries use sophisticated high tech programmes to protect tuskers and other endangered animals. These programmes consist of extensive procedures from locating a wounded animal to relocating it after treatment. Sri Lanka too should adopt an similar methods, Ratwatte explained.
Ratwatte also points out that the unavailability of correct data on tuskers and elephants in Sri Lanka is yet another serious limitation.
According to the data collected by the last official survey conducted in 2012, there were 6,000 elephants in Sri Lanka. I personally do not agree with this data. There is only a 14% forest area of Sri Lankas land area. It is impossible for 6,000 elephants to live in such a area, Ratwatte said.
Ratwatte also said according to authorities, there are 240 tuskers in Sri Lanka whereas according to their sources, there are only 120 tuskers roaming the wilderness of Sri Lanka.
Ratwatte further said measures should be taken to connect all national parks creating a safe route for migrating tuskers and stop human activities near traditional Alimankada.
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring environment eutrophication in forests in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Sustainability and Wildlife Ministry Secretary R.M.D.B. Meegasmulla says the Department of Wildlife has already begun to reintroduce GPS tracking collars for tuskers. He said that such tracking collars were used sometimes back by the Wildlife Department. There were some allegations that a tusker died due to a tracking collar which temporarily halted its use, Meegasmulla explained.
Meegasmulla further said they are also to establish an elephant holding ground in Lunugamwehera, one similar to that in Horowpatana. He also said the Wildlife Department is all set to conduct a survey of elephants on coming September, 2017.

## Title: Resolving garbage issue
## Supertitle:

Resolving garbage issue
The good news is that Colombo has been cleared of all its festering garbage mounds as of yesterday. Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, who has been tasked with the responsibility of garbage management by the Cabinet of Ministers disclosed that at least 3,000 tons of garbage has been cleared by Saturday.
In Minister Ranawaka, the Cabinet has settled on someone who has a proven track record in this field. In his previous turn as Environment Minister, he introduced the concept of garbage separation (as glass, plastic, food waste, paper) and recycling. This programme, which went on for some time, naturally fell by the wayside as time moved on and things were back to square one. We hope that this time, Minister Ranawaka will have a more successful turn.
The garbage mounds strewn all over the City were no doubt an eyesore, not to mention the unbearable stench emanating from them. Stray dogs foraging through the trash made the problem worse. The garbage dumps also act as breeding sites for flies, maggots and mosquitoes. The latter is especially significant given the extent of the dengue epidemic, though the dengue vector mosquito is generally known to prefer clear water as a breeding site.
Colombos garbage crisis was precipitated by the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump which resulted in several deaths. This brought to the fore the magnitude of the garbage problem  that nearly 800 tons of garbage is collected daily in Colombo alone. Angered and scared by what they saw, residents in many other areas oppose any plans to dump garbage in their own areas. However, given the lack of an immediate alternative garbage handling mechanism, this will be inevitable at least for a few months.
While claiming that the streets of Colombo are back to their previous cleanliness, the Minister also warned of strict action against those dumping garbage in an improper manner. In fact over 1,500 people have been nabbed by the Police for dumping trash indiscriminately within the city. This is a welcome move.
All the institutions involved in this exercise deserve plaudits, including the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Private organisations, the Police Environment Division and the Sri Lanka Army. The Government has made it clear that the Army will not be engaged in garbage collection but will be playing a more technical and technological role since it has the necessary manpower and technical expertise to deal with such phenomena.
Minister Ranawaka has also made it clear that the programme is a temporary solution to the growing garbage problem. According to the Minister, the Government has commenced several waste to energy projects which will be completed soon. This was long overdue for Colombo, since several urban and municipal councils in the country already have some sort of garbage recycling programme  Balangoda has the most well known initiative.
Garbage is now becoming a fuel itself  most countries use trash to make solid recovered fuel and a type of diesel fuel. These plants cost a lot to build, but the benefits accrued in the long run far outweigh the initial cost. We should look at garbage recycling programmes in other countries and select an appropriate model that can accommodate local requirements.
Like everything else in this country, the garbage issue too has been politicized with accusations and counter accusations flying about. However, this is too big an issue for petty politics. It is a national issue that calls for a collective effort by all those concerned, including politicians representing all hues and members of the public. In short, the Government alone cannot handle the garbage problem without the cooperation and understanding of everyone.
In fact, all individuals have a responsibility to ensure that garbage is kept to minimum in the first place. For example, if a household only makes the quantity of food needed for a given meal, there will be little or no leftovers to throw away. If you take your lunch to office in a box instead of wrapping it in a lunch sheet and then a piece of paper, the citys wastefills will have one less lunch sheet to worry about every day. These are small steps that can have a major impact a few years down the road.
This will complement the efforts of authorities who are now working towards introducing new policies for better waste management. In case any member of the public needs Government support or seeks to complain about any aspect of garbage handling, the Government will improve the public complaints hotline of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. There will also be enhanced support and resources for Local Government authorities to combat the growing garbage issue.
We should think of garbage as a resource for generating energy and making various other goods through recycling. There should be a holistic approach to garbage management, spurred by a debate on the issue from garbage generation to disposal. Emotional outbursts will not get us anywhere.

Amount sold across the world falls by 2.6bn litres in just two years as consumers opt for healthier lifestyles Whether you are on a beach holiday, sitting at home in the garden or even at a fancy restaurant, ice cream has always been the go-to treat for many.
But global ice cream sales have recently seen a large drop  and its all down to healthy eating habits.
A new report has revealed that sales across the world totalled 13 billion litres last year compared to 15.6 billion litres in 2015.
Market experts have explained that the trend is due to consumers being more aware of their sugar intake, and a movement towards higher-quality products.
Alex Beckett, global food and drink analyst at Mintel  the company which compiled the research - said: More people are aware of the sugar content of food they are eating now. They are going into the ice cream chiller with their diet in mind.
While the industry is very competitive, prices have also had to go up due to cost hikes. People are eating less ice cream but when they do buy it, they want the good stuff  for example gelatos or Magnums.
Its a treat so it will always appeal, but people are opting for quality over buying a litre tub. Premium yoghurts are also becoming a more acceptable dessert.
The report also revealed that although China is the biggest ice cream market, with sales estimated at 4.3 billion litres in 2016, Norwegians are actually the biggest ice cream eaters. Customers in the chilly Scandinavian country, where temperatures plunge to -6C (21F) in winter, ate 9.8 litres per person last year  around the equivalent of a family-sized tub each month.
Although Italy is famed for its ice cream and gelato, the research shows that 29 per cent of Italians are looking to cut down on their dairy consumption.
Despite sales being dominated by Western markets in recent years, rising popularity in the dessert is rippling throughout the East. India, Indonesia and Vietnam are among the worlds fastest growing markets, with India expected to overtake the UK in sales next year.
On the other hand, volume sales in Switzerland, Denmark and the US have decreased slightly over the past five years. Western consumers are increasingly looking to try ice cream products with more Eastern inspired flavours.
Japanese mochi ice cream  a treat of frozen rice dough around an ice cream filling  is gaining popularity, as well as Thai-style rolled ice cream.

Sharp focus on Alzheimer's may help target drugs
Abnormal deposits that build up in the brain during Alzheimer's have been pictured in unprecedented detail by UK scientists.
The team at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology says its findings "open up a whole new era" in neurodegenerative disease.
Their work should make it easier to design drugs to stop brain cells dying.
The researchers used brain tissue from a 74-year-old woman who died after having Alzheimer's disease.
The form of dementia leads to tangles of a protein called tau spreading throughout the brain. The more tau tangles there are, the worse the symptoms tend to be.
Doctors have known this has happened for decades but what has been missing is a detailed understanding of what the tangles look like.
The team took advantage of the "resolution revolution" in microscopy to take thousands of highly detailed images of the tau inside the woman's brain tissues.
And using computer software, they figured out the tangles look like this:
A tangle of tauImage copyrightLMB
It is pretty meaningless to an untrained eye, but to scientists this could be one of the most important recent discoveries in tackling dementia.
Attempts to develop a drug to slow the pace of dementia have been met by repeated failure. But it is hard to come up with a drug when you do not know the precise chemical structure of what you are targeting.
Dr Sjors Scheres, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "It's like shooting in the dark - you can still hit something but you are much more likely to hit if you know what the structure is.
"We are excited - it opens up a whole new era in this field, it really does."
Rules of memory 'beautifully' rewritten
Experts excited by brain 'wonder-drug'
Similar dysfunctional proteins are found in many brain diseases. Alzheimer's also has beta amyloid while Parkinson's has alpha synuclein. The structure of tau, published in the journal Nature, is the first to be determined in such detail.
Fellow researcher Dr Michel Goedert told the BBC: "This is a big step forward as far as tau goes but it is bigger than that.
"This is the first time anybody has determined the high-resolution structure [from human brain samples] for any of these diseases.
"The next step is to use this information to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration."
Dr Tara Spires-Jones, from the centre for cognitive and neural systems at the University of Edinburgh, said the findings "substantially advance what we know".
She added: "These results will be useful for developing molecules to detect tau tangles in patients and potentially for developing treatments." -BBC

Sing-a-Long: Is just the remedy for charity
In our government-run mental hospitals several patients seem doomed to life within these institutions walls, either because they have no family to return to or have been abandoned. The lack of enough rehabilitation programs and reluctance of families to accept a cured patient has put an additional burden on government-run hospitals.
This is the unhappy lot of 40 such female residents at Ward One of the Mulleriyawa Hospital whose families have abandoned them. It's not that they are suffering from any mental ailment any more. They have been cured and are fit to be discharged from the hospital. They have nowhere to go. No one comes calling and no one is willing to take them back. For years some of them have been languishing in Ward One of the hospital which needs extensive renovation.
Now the Lay Missionary Association of Our Lady of Fatima, Deans Road, Colombo 10 has decided to throw a lifeline to salvage the dignity of these hapless residents and make their lives more comfortable. And what better way to do it than with a sing-a-long fundraiser that bonds and connects a community together in the most delightful way imaginable. Sohan and the Xperiment will be in attendance at the BMICH Banquet Hall on July 15 dishing out an eclectic repertoire of irresistible toe-tapping melodies to unite with the audience in the best tradition of audience participation.
The songfest will feature some of the nations greatest legends in show biz including Mignonne Fernando of Jetliner fame in the guest spot. Together you can change the world for these unfortunate residents and have a heck of a good time in the process. Tickets are available from the following contacts: 0716313781, 0776274872, 0773687782 and 0778835557.

SL Tourism to develop 300 acres for Eastern Tourism
The Ministry of Tourism Development has identified Mannar District for major tourism infrastructure development projects. Already over Rs. 40 million has been spent on making the beach areas tourist friendly and many other projects are being planned in order to make the district the main hub for tourism in the region.
During a discussion between Minister of Tourism Development John Amaratunga and Minister of Commerce and Industry and Member of Parliament for Mannar District, Rishad Bathiudeen at the Tourism Ministry yesterday, it was decided to position Mannar as the main hub for visiting key attractions in the region.
The identified main attractions include the famed Madhu Church Shrine, Wilpattu National Park and a host of other sites which have been identified as having considerable tourism potential.
These include the Thanthirimale historic temple, ancient Thiruketheeswaram Kovil where it is believed rituals have been performed without a break for the past 2000 years, the Dutch period lighthouse, historic pier and fishing harbour, the Portuguese/Dutch Fort, and Adams Bridge which is a constellation of small islands stretched out over a 50 km sand strip connecting mainland India that spawned the famous legends of Hanuman, Rama and Ravana.
Among the other attractions in the district are the famous 700 year old Baobab Tree which is also called elephant tree for the sheer size of its girth, Doric House at Arippu which at the time it was built as the official residence of British Governor Frederick North in the 1800s was described as the most beautiful house in Ceylon, and Yoda Wewa or Giants Tank built by King Dathusena in the 5th century which interestingly is the main point for the seasonal Siberian bird migration.
Minister Amaratunga said that plans have already been drawn by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to develop homestay villages around the tank in order to offer an authentic experience to tourists visiting the district.
Meanwhile a beachfront area of around 300 acres will be identified as a resort area for accommodation purposes. This area will be developed on a fast track basis with all facilities for tourists while priority will be given for eco-tourism projects.
Meanwhile based on a request by Minister Bathiudeen, it was decided to set-up a hotel school for the youth of the district to learn basic hospitality skills. Minister Amaratunga instructed officials of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management to set up a satellite school in the Mannar town area offering basic training for entry level positions in the hotel trade.

SOM winner of the Port City Design Idea Competition
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), one of the worlds largest architecture, interior design, engineering and urban planning firms, which was judged the winner of the International Conceptual Urban Design Idea Competition for the Financial District and Marina of the Colombo Port City received the award at a ceremony recently held at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo.
The competition which was supported by the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA) and sanctioned by the International Union of Architects (UIA)was conducted as per UIA guidelines.
Three top international names pitted their skills against one another over a period of four months at the end of which the winner was announced. Nikken Sekkei of Japan, Gensler headquartered in San Francisco and SOM which also hails from the USA, were the participants whose names remained anonymous until the final announcement was made, in accordance with the rules of the competition.
The objective of the ideas competition was to inspire the best design and plan concepts for the financial district and the marina of the Colombo Port City.
Eng. N.Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development who was chief guest at the event said that bringing in some of the world's best designers for this competition is a boost to the country's image as well as the Megapolis. Unlike anytime in the history of our country where our cities have taken centuries to grow organically, today we have a planned city which will be completed in 25 years. We will have to look at the demands and preferences of the future citizens of this city and that is why we need to have the best designers contributing their ideas to the master plan."
Lim Kian Siew, Director of Planning and Development of CHEC Port City Colombo, said that whilst the competition was an important milestone for the entire project, there was a specific reason why it was contained to the financial district and the marina.
It is because these areas are common to the whole of Colombo Port City and more importantly they are directly connected and related to the existing Fort area.
The panel of top international jurors who judged the competition were Dr. Deborah Dearing, District Commissioner of Greater Sydney Commission with over 30 years international experience in urban design and strategic land-use planning, Prof. David Dernie, Chartered Architect, Pro Vice Chancellor and Dean of Faculty of Architecture and Built Environment, University of Westminster, UK, Calvin Tsao, acclaimed practitioner with a leading voice and a representative of contemporary architecture from New York and Prof. Harris Trevor Gordon Stuart representing UIA, the co-founder of Harris - Kjisik Architects, Finland. Pali Wijeratne, a highly qualified Sri Lankan architect and town planner with over 50 years experience in conservation was also on the panel, representing the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects.
Guest of Honour at the ceremony, Archt. D.H. Wijewardene, President of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, is of the view that, competitions such as this should be made a practice for all landmark projects.

Sri Lankas first ever heart transplant completed
Sri Lankas first ever heart transplant have been completed successfully at the Kandy Teaching Hospital according to hospital sources. The complex surgery was carried out by an expert team of three heart surgeons, a transplant surgeon, a cardiologist, Transplant Coordinators, Anaesthesiologists and other supportive staff.
The surgery which took place on July 7 has now been declared as a success.
According to the the Director of the Kandy Teaching Hospital Dr. R.M.S.K Ratnayake the recipient has recovered fast and is being monitored closely.
The patients progress will be closely montitored during the possible rejection period he said, adding that the transplanted heart is functioning as normal post surgery.
The surgery had commenced at 7 pm on the day with the heart being harvested by Dr.Anil Abeywickrama, the Consultant Cardiac Surgeon of Teaching Hospital, Kandy while the transplant was conducted by Cardiac surgeons Muditha Lansakara and Dr. K. Gnanakanthan.
Cardiologist Dr. Sunethra Irugalbandara had been in charge of organ care while Dr. Jagathi Perera provided anaesthesia for the pioneering operation. It had taken the medical team eight hours to complete the surgery.
According to hospital sources,the transplanted heart had begun to beat as normal three hours after the surgery was performed.
The heart was harvested from a 25-year-old youth who was declared brain dead due to a serious head injury following a road traffic accident. The parents of the donor had agreed to donate the heart of the the youth along with his liver and kidneys.
The heart was received by a female patient in her mid thirties from Anuradhapura.
According to Dr.Ratnayake the patient was suffering from cardiomyopathy.
The condition would have eventually resulted in her death, he said adding that however she has now been given a lease on life as the donor heart had been an ideal match for the recipient.
The recipients of the other organs too are doing well Dr.Ratnayake confirmed. Meanwhile, Dr.Ratnayake said that a special unit will be established at the Kandy hospital in the future for deceased-donor transplant surgeries.
The Transplant Surgical Team had included Consultant Cardiothoracic Anaesthetist Dr. Jagathi Perera, Consultant Cardiac Surgeon Dr. Anil Abeywickrama, Cardiac surgeons Dr. Muditha Lansakara and Dr.K.Gnanakanthan, Cardiologist Dr.Sunethra Irugalbandara and Transplant Surgeon Dr.P.K.Harischandra.

Striking out strikes
Protesters took to the streets across the country over the last few months for several reasons. The protests took different forms and at some, violence broke out, while several others engaged in non-violent protests. Here are views expressed by professionals from different fields regarding the recent protests and their response to whether these protests depict a breakdown of discipline in the country.
Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform Chairman Lal Wijenayake
The protests, walks etc., taking place in the country at the moment cannot be recognised as a breakdown of discipline in the country. This is the only way the people are enjoying the freedom they won on January 8, 2015. In a sense, we can say that this is a counter-revolution and we have to defeat it. I am sure we will defeat it easily. I do not have any doubt about that.
We went through a period where the people feared to walk out of their homes and offices to protest. Sometimes those who did so went missing. Some were abducted. No one spoke against corruption. The media was silent. Murders such as the Welikada Prison killing, Lasantha Wickramathunga murder etc., took place but no one spoke against them. In January, 2015, what the people asked for was freedom and democracy. Now the people respect law and order of the country more than before. Today judges are free to give judgements. The Police is doing their duty properly sans political pressure.
Elements are trying to bring back the previous regime use this freedom to get their task done because now they are in a 'do or die situation.'
They have to bring back the previous regime within a year or two or they will go to jail. There are very serious murder charges, corruption charges etc., against them. They bring people into the roads. Sometimes they say they are farmers, but they do not look like farmers. They look like paid thugs.
SP Governor Hema Kumara Nanayakkara
There is a severe breakdown of discipline in the country and many unwanted protests. The general breakdown of the law and order in the country is, in a way, politically motivated. Some political groups want to dislodge the government, but they cannot do it through mob violence. The government exercises democracy with the people's mandate. Politicians who promote protests have sent their children abroad for studies in foreign universities. I appeal to the students to not just believe and accept what their leaders say without thinking twice and double-checking. Going into a state ministry and damaging public property is practicing freedom of the wild ass. The government should be blamed for not taking action. The students should be rehabilitated because their minds have been poisoned.
Whenever a teacher is transferred, schoolchildren and parents come onto the streets demanding him/her back. The very person who received the transfer motivates people to do this. They are being guided to beat at their chests and shout. The parents are insulting their own children. Transferring teachers is a duty bestowed on the Education Department and Education Ministry.
The parents can seek to resolve their issues with the education authorities, MPs, Ministers etc. The media also should be responsible because some media go to villages and encourage people to come onto the streets.
People go on strikes even for the slightest thing. This is a bad habit. First, they should sit and discuss with the officials. If it fails, they should discuss with the Ministry Secretary and then with the Minister. Only if all efforts fail, should they resort to a strike. Strikes are there to win rights and not to put the public in trouble.
The roads in Colombo are blocked almost every day now.
As children, we have never seen doctors go on strike. There were problems for doctors at that time too. SAITM is a big problem, but it should be solved through discussions. The protesters are taking revenge from the innocent people and not from the politicians. The GMOA should not be a politically motivated organisation. It should be there to win doctors' rights. Politicians go to private hospitals or abroad and get treatment. At least 60 percent of doctors are from poor families. They punish their own class.
If politicians have done something wrong, the doctors should punish them and not the public. The government should solve the SAITM issue. It should not soft-peddle when someone breaks the law. Law and order should be maintained. The judiciary should not be interfered with; the judiciary is supreme. Even garbage collection is an important job. Law and order of the country should be strictly implemented; it is the responsibility of the government. Future generations which are going to take over the country should be well-disciplined.
Sri Lanka Bar Association President U. R. de Silva
Staging a protest is not a solution to the problem. The protesters against SAITM are doing an improper thing. Last week also, when the case was brought up in Court, the students held a silent protest outside. But there was also an application to intervene and that is the best way if they wish to do something. The GMOA has gone before Courts and mentioned that the order was in favour. That is the correct procedure. We informed the Court as well that it is a sensitive matter and an order should be given for the final. What they are doing now is an insult to Courts.
I think the students are innocent; they need justice and now the responsibility is with the Supreme Court. The lawyers should be given proper instructions by the necessary authorities. Whether if it is in favour of or not, you have to accept the order. Until the order is given, no one can go around the country and stage protests as the matter is in Courts. When one party was not in favour of the decision, they went to the Supreme Court, which was the correct procedure. The matter will be solved within a few months. Till such time, it is not ethical to stage protests in front of the Courts. The students need to concentrate on their studies as well.
Another recent problem was with regard to the Constitution. The objections raised are very premature. A committee appointed by the government has prepared a draft Constitution, but thats not the final draft.
Anybody can go through that document. There can be pros and cons in the Constitution drafted, but the public still have time to submit their suggestions. Parliament has also appointed various committees. The final decision is to be taken by the people.
The government clearly mentioned it. This is not the right time to oppose. Very progressive suggestions were made regarding the Courts and judiciary. All these suggestions are being considered. Without organizing protests, they could organise seminars to create awareness among people.
The other big problem was the disposal of garbage. The people who have suffered had lodged a petition to the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice has asked for a report and a survey map of the areas in which the government is intending to dump garbage. These issues need to be carefully handled. The problem was that they just started dumping garbage without any assessment being done. That needs to be stopped.
The government is also slow to act; they should take immediate and proper action. People cannot wait so long. The garbage issue was in Courts even before the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed, but Government authorities deliberately prolonged the cases. They gave a lot of excuses which should have been curtailed.
Court also has the responsibility to solve these matters as soon as possible. The people tend to take the law into their hands when cases get delayed. People stage protests because they feel that there is no point in going to Courts. There are various issues pertaining to Court procedures as well, which lead to this and one of them is the lack of judges. Measures are being taken to increase the quota but that should be done immediately.
Colombo University Senior Professor and Police Commission Chairman Prof. Siri Hettige
People protest when institutions become ineffective. The protests that are being held cannot be generalised, but people tend to protest or show their displeasure when the authorities fail to perform their duties correctly. When the government goes for a project with a wide range of implications, the institution should manage it in an effective manner. There is a technical side to any project; therefore, the relevant authority should make sure that all these aspects are very well handled.
Politicians should come at the last stage, once all technical aspects of the project have been fixed. If the project is not economically and technically viable and if is not going to benefit the people around, the authorities should not take it up.
On the other hand, even if you do all the procedures systematically, there are so many people who will object to the project. These are people who want to protest even for smaller things, but that is a different thing.
However, the government can eliminate the possibilities of the protests by following due process. We have taken many decisions without adhering to proper standards.
The decisions were politically motivated. The best way to address this issue of protests is to ask the person who is taking the decision on what basis they are doing so. SAITM was not something that was initiated last year.
There are many issues that need to be addressed with regard to private and public education.
It would be more appropriate to say that there is a governance problem in this country than breakdown of discipline. It is fundamental and it goes back to several decades.
The governance problem did become intolerable in this country at many instances. We have not been able to establish governance standards in this country.
Now good governance has become a laughing factor for many people. Some think that Sri Lanka does not need good governance; unfortunately, we have come to that situation. The decisions taken should demand for good governance, but that is not happening at present.
At times, public protests are deep-rooted. It is the responsibility of the government to look into the problem and take immediate measures to solve it. There are problems with our economy and the education system. Therefore, the youth do not see a future for them.
These issues should not be taken at face value, but need better management and governance.
Attorney-at-Law and Senior Lecturer of the University of Colombo Dr. Prathibha Mahanamahewa
We cannot blame only politicians with regard to this issue. Violence today is not only in the country, but its in society as well as in our homes. One of the main reasons behind the breakdown in discipline in the country is unnecessary competition in the examination system starting from grade five scholarship to university level.
Teachers have no time to explain the values and morals of society to children as before due to the lengthy syllabus they have to cover. Another factor which is contributing a decline in social value is students not having time to participate in Sunday school and religious activities on Poya days because of tuition classes.
Considering this, the government must take policy decisions in future to address these issues.
Though the right to strike is a fundamental human right, the 1978 Sri Lanka Constitution has not recognised this right as a fundamental human right. According to the 1939 Trade Union Ordinance, reasonable strikes are recognised.
On the other hand, right to education is a fundamental human right too; therefore, any strike against or which restrict or attempt to restrict right to education is not reasonable or justified. Hence, the States responsibility is to protect the right to education and save millions of rupees in Sri Lanka which is grabbed by other medical colleges in the region.
Today, Sri Lanka needs many more medical doctors to save the nation and a strike against such cannot be condoned, it is also the States responsibility to expand the accessibility to right to quality medical education in this country.

## Title: Subfertility, IUI, and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)

Subfertility, IUI, and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
Gone are the days when nature, clinical disability or gender based social misconceptions ruled a couples inability to rear offspring. The advancement in global medical technology and evolving processes in the field of fertility have proven that a conception is possible even for a mother who has had numerous failed attempts at getting pregnant. Here Dr. Madara Ralapanawe  Clinical Embryologist/ Head of Fertility Centre of Lanka Hospitals and Dr. Nishendra Karunaratne  Consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist talks in detail about IVF.
Q: What is IVF and when and why would a couple opt for IVF
Dr. Madara: In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a laboratory controlled clinical process that helps a couple have a child of their own when the natural process of conception fails. The failure in the natural process can be due to subfertility in the couple.
Q: What is sub-fertility
Dr. Nishendra: Sub- fertility in a female is the failure to conceive after 6 months to 1 year of unprotected sexual intercourse. This can be due various reasons including conditions such as irregular cycles due to anovulation, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, etc. Sub- fertility in males is largely to do with sperm quality, motility, morphology of the sperm and the sperm count at ejaculation.
Q: What causes subfertility
Dr. Nishendra: About one third of subfertility can be attributed to male factor, and about one third to female factor. The remaining one third can be due to a combination of issues concerning both partners and in about 20 percent of such cases the condition is unexplained.
Q: Please explain the process of natural conception.
Dr. Nishendra: Fertility period of a young female is between 12th and 16th days of regular menstrual cycle. Intercourse ejaculates millions of sperm into the vagina. In natural conception most of the good live sperm will swim up the cervix into the womb, from the womb, sperms swim through the fallopian tube.
A sperm fertilizes the egg in the fallopian tube if ovulation takes place during this time and an egg is released from the ovary. A couple has the option of seeking fertility treatment if the female partner do not conceive within a year through this natural process.
Q: Is IVF the only solution for subfertility between couples
Dr. Madara: Intra uterine insemination (IUI) is one of the first line treatment choices in case of mild male factor infertility or women with cervical factor and unexplained subfertility.
Its a interventional process that involves the placing of sperm inside a woman's uterus to facilitate fertilization. Though the sperm could be deposited, even with the development of follicles or release of the egg the female partner might not yet conceive through IUI. Thus failed fertilization or failed development could yet happen as one cannot see what takes place within the fallopian tubes. But by then - especially for the female - who has gone through numerous hormone interventions by then, her hormone levels might be too high for even IVF to commence affecting quality of the eggs. More patients are seen idling themselves engaging in other procedures such as IUI; sometimes 15  20 IUIs, by going to as many IUI centres as possible for years.
Q: What is the process of IVF
Dr. Madara: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is an assisted reproductive technique (ART) in which the egg and the sperm are united in the laboratory (In vitro). There are 2 methods in IVF called Standard and ICSI (Intra Cyto-Plastic Sperm Injection).
Following the extraction of matured eggs from the mothers ovaries, In standard IVF, 2 to 3 eggs are inseminated with 80,000 to 100,000 sperms & will be kept in an incubator which mimics similar ambience of a fallopian tube - at 370 C  similar to body temperature, with 6% carbon dioxide & 5% Oxygen.
Even the culture media used is similar to content in the fallopian tube. Here, the sperm has to penetrate itself in the natural way.
In ICSI, or (Intra Cyto-Plastic Sperm Injection) where sperms are directly injected to mature eggs the sperms entering of the egg can be confirmed in a lab setting. Similar to the natural process the sperm will go in & the egg will be fertilized becoming two pronuclear or a zygote & subsequently, further division of cells takes place. The success rate of fertilization is higher in ICSI as the sperms are being directly injected to the egg & fertilization is as same as that occurs in the natural process.

Tomorrow is World Population Day : Population matters
Eleventh of July every year is the World Population Day. Celebrations to mark the event commenced in 1987, when the five billionth child was born on this earth, and it has been remembered continuously for 20 years now. The theme for this year is Family Planning: Empowering People, Developing Nations.
In a larger sense, Family Planning is the concept of maintaining the good health of, primarily, the mother, thereby strengthening the hands of the father for his all-round well-being, while promoting the sustained growth of the children - all aimed at the empowerment to build up a strong family and a lovable home, culminating with the development of a healthy community of people.
It is to the credit of the Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health and the organisations like The Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka, with a history of over 60 years now, that a large majority of Sri Lankas population resort to scientific processes of family planning to enjoy the sound status of family health. Studies have shown that the most effective method to achieve and sustain family health is by sincerely following the concepts advocated through family planning.
Lifes challenges and changes
Family Health is not simply the state free from disease, but also the capacity of family members to adapt to, respond to, or control lifes challenges and changes. Family health, in its simplest definition, is the well-being of the father, the mother and their children in all aspects of their life, be it hygienically, economically, socially, environmentally or otherwise, and most significantly in the context of a familys close positive relationships. The health factor relates to enhancing awareness on health issues such as sexual and reproductive health rights, sexually transmitted infections and abortion, and the promotion of easy accessibility to available services like conception and contraception to help couples to decide their family size. Thereby people are empowered to lead a healthy life, which ends up with the creation of a healthy nation.
Family planning supports the growth of the children by protecting their health and enabling parental care and affection for them, due to sufficient gaps between any two children, irrespective of the number of children that a couple wishes to bear. Family planning never limits the number of children for any family but advocates at least two years space between birth of any two children.
Thus, the growth of the children is vehemently supported by the decisions of the father and the mother to allow adequate time between normal pregnancies and to reduce high-risk pregnancies for the mother. Such decisions are all the more important, especially for the mother, the live-wire of the family, by all means, never ever to think of the dangerous concept of abortion.
Adequate spacing of pregnancies is healthily possible by way of safe-sex, which in other words is avoiding unwanted conception, for which, the knowledge and services necessary are embodied in the concept of family planning. It is, indeed, a part of sexuality education, which fortunately has entered the curricula of school education in Sri Lanka now.
Family planning
In any country, there is a sizeable percentage of families without children. Family planning readily helps them through research, advocacy and services to have babies in the family. Thus, helping childless couples to have a child is also an important segment of family planning. Information, counselling and accessibility to a volume of health-related knowledge and services provided through family planning, help a woman to be away from the need for an abortion.
Other than cases of rape or incest, a large number of abortions in Sri Lanka take place due to the neglect of a couple to have ignored scientific family planning, thus leaving the female partner to suffer and face a great deal of hardship, including even loss of life, not forgetting the distress for the male partner and an unexpected burden on the family at large. That again is hampering the status of family health, which damage could be totally eliminated through processes advocated through family planning.

Tribute
Rev. Fr. Selvaratnam
Exceptional personage
Achieving a milestone is possible only to those whose minds and hearts are open as well as endowed with strong cognitive powers such as critical thinking, resilient power in critical situations and a strong will to be faithful to their commitments, come what may. People who know Fr. Selvaratnam OMI call him Selvam,in Tamil, it means wealth.
He is endowed with such mind treasures and has reached many milestones in his life, especially this year; the 75th year after his birth, 50 years of priesthood and 57 years of committed religious life in the Congregation of Oblates of Mary Immaculate.
While the festive melodies swim in the air for Selvam, the milestones he reached in 2017 provide him an enviable opportunity, like that of Greek god Janus, to look both, backward and forward from these positions. Backward reviews award him to gauge his achievements and shortcomings, while forward perception permits him to get a deeper and wide insight to plan out his service with sobriety and tranquility for the future.
Selvam is the second son of the three, born to a devout Catholic couple in Vathiri, a hamlet in the village of Karaveddy in the Northern part of Sri Lanka.
He received his primary education from Sacred Heart College, Karaveddy and the secondary, from St. Peters College, Colombo; the latter, he did while he was in the Juniorate at Kohuwala, Nuguegoda. Having completed the G.C.E. O/L, he pursued and successfully finished his clerical studies in the National Seminary in Ampitiya, Kandy and was ordained a priest by the then Rt. Rev. Dr. Jerome Emilianuspillai OMI at St. Marys Cathedral, Jaffna on December 21, 1966.
His sense of self-confidence, discipline and generous application of himself to projects he undertook, had made his superiors to decide in favour of him to continue his higher studies.
Having completed his B.A in Chennai, he further moved to Lyon, where he did dip-in AV education, and in New York Masters in Telecommunications. Being fully fledged in the knowledge of his chosen field, consequently, on his return to the country, he launched Tamil Catholic programme called New World, broadcasted by SLBC, sharing thus, his know-how, moral, spiritual and psychological insights.
A number of his thought-provoking articles written to Tamil Dailies, those are justifiable, yet irritable to many in power sector and other, brought him great fans as well as controversial thinking figures, all of whom knew him as Selvam. He himself took pride in his name Selvam. He learnt to use every opportunity as golden and keep his eyes on the prizehis and not anybody elses.
What were remarkable and the distinguishing factors were his traits of perseverance, and persistence and despite all obstacles, discouragement and impossibilities, he was able to maintain a sense of fortitude in his endeavour.
Due to mounting pressures from various factors against his free thinking expressions, he had to go on exile; however, his resilient nature and open mindedness enabled him to catch every opportunity that came across at each flickering moment.
Given this fact, he further qualified and managed to bag the following higher degrees: M.S. in Psychology in Baltimore, Doctorate in Pastoral Psychology, Counseling from Boston University and Certified full clinical Supervisor with NACC/ACPE, USA. Selvam believed in the axiom of Barnard Shaw, namely, Life is not only about finding oneself, but life is also about creating oneself.
On his return to his motherland, he was engaged in training formators, refounded Shanthiyahama counseling center for people who were marked with painful mental scars caused by the civil war.
As an internationally-sought, widely-travelled figure, he conducted many seminars and chapters, in Asian, African and European countries. As he celebrates his platinum, and golden jubilees, I quote him from I am gratefula booklet authored by him and in which he quite clearly displays his learning process and growth in spirituality; Religion is a means to an end, the end being wholeness and oneness.
We have made the means to an end. Even religions can become an object of consumerism in the sense of people crave for more religion, rituals, vocal prayers, celebrations, elaborate ceremonies, decorations, statutes, holy pictures, pilgrimages; but underneath all there is shallowness that is never addressed even by the majority of Religious leaders. It is all because they are trying to fill something in the depth with externals that cannot meet thirst in the depth. Such pep, truthful, as well as critical thinking, would certainly challenge the authorities to take an honest inward journey that would not be so palatable.
As we wish triple blessings on his triple celebrations we are convinced of Robert Frosts poetic lines that come to be applicable to him where, Two roads diverged in a wood and I take the one less travelled by and that has made all the difference.
Perhaps Selvam takes pride in Tagores quote:
I slept and dreamt that life was nothing but joy;
I woke and found that life was nothing but service;
I served and realized that service is joy Rev. Sr. M.Concelia Mariampillai HC

UK manufacturing output falls and trade deficit widens
The pound has fallen after disappointing manufacturing, trade and construction data suggested the UK economy is failing to gain momentum. Output in both the manufacturing and construction sectors fell in May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Separate data from the ONS showed that the UK's trade deficit widened in May.
Sterling fell 0.7% against the dollar as analysts suggested an early interest rate rise was now less likely. Recent weeks have seen speculation that the Bank of England could raise rates later this year. This followed a surprisingly close vote on interest rate levels at the Bank's last meeting, when three members of the Monetary Policy Committee backed a rate rise. In addition, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said last week it needed "look seriously" at the possibility of raising interest rates to counter the recent pick-up in inflation.
However, reacting to the latest economic figures, Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, said: "It's all building up a pattern here that says the economy is clearly losing momentum. "It's not pointing to a particularly dynamic second quarter. Under those circumstances, the timing of the hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a rate hike doesn't look great."
The ONS figures showed that manufacturing output fell by 0.2% compared with April, whereas analysts had expected it to rise.
The sector was hit by a 4.4% drop in car production - the biggest fall since February last year. The wider measure of industrial output fell 0.1% following a 0.2% rise in April. Construction output was also worse than expected. It fell by 1.2% in May from April, and was also down 1.2% in the three months to May - the sharpest such drop since October 2015.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said: "The construction sector now is feeling acutely the adverse impact of Brexit uncertainty on the willingness of households and firms to make long-term financial commitments. BBC News

All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever. 77,222 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported between January and June 2017 compared to 55,150 cases reported for the year 2016. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, the report says.
Meanwhile several hoteliers and stakeholders of the industry in Sri Lanka also stated that there were many inquiries and also a few cancellations due to dengue.
They also say that the Sri Lanka Tourism should address this issue more professionally and state that dengue is not spread all over the country. They should identify the areas that are not affected and act accordingly.

The Falcons made it two wins from two in this season's T20 Blast as they defended 165-8 to secure a three-run victory against Yorkshire at Edgbaston.
Adam Lyth scored 68 from 53 balls as Yorkshire started strongly, but leg-spinner Imran Tahir took 3-18 from his three overs to keep the innings in check.
Yorkshire needed 18 off the last over, but captain Tim Bresnan (24) was caught at cover off the final ball by Luis Reece as they finished on 162-7.
Wayne Madsen had earlier hit 42 from 28 balls with Daryn Smit adding a rapid, undefeated 30.

America's Bethanie Mattek-Sands suffered a horror injury which left her screaming in pain in the middle of the court. The 32-year-old collapsed to the ground after damaging her right knee as she approached the net in the first game of the deciding set against Romania's Sorana Cirstea on Court 17. Please help me, please, please, screamed the 32-year-old in scenes so distressing that television cameras panned away from the stricken player. Cirstea said her friend's knee was out... and in a very weird position. I freaked out. It was like something you see only in the movies. I tried to comfort her but I panicked. I felt useless. All she kept saying was Sorana, help me, help me.

Kei makes racquet in defeat
Japanese star Kei Nishikori admitted he's just not a very good grass-court player after suffering a seventh first week exit in nine visits to Wimbledon. The 27-year-old world number nine slumped to a 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 3-6, 6-3 loss to Spanish 18th seed Roberto Bautista Agut. His frustration led to him throwing his racquet into the back wall of Court Three while he also earned himself a time violation.

Sam Querrey needed fewer than five minutes to reach the last 16 when he won the one game he required to see off Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 1-6, 7-5 after their tie had been suspended at 6-5 in the decider due to darkness on Friday evening. It's really the most anti-climactic way to finish a match. It's a little bit of a bummer, said American Querrey, who famously defeated Novak Djokovic at the same stage at last year's Wimbledon. - AFP

Wonders of winged bean
The Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) also known as Dambala is vegetable which is highly valued as a source of protein. Garden Talk speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor, K.N.K. Jayathilaka
If one is to grow Dambala in ones home garden, it will take care of the daily nutritional need of the family. One vine can satisfy the daily needs of the family. This vine is mainly grown on a fence (with the help of supports) and thus does not take up too much space in the garden. It is very important to grow this in a home garden, said Jayathilaka
In the Dambala plant the pods, leaves, flowers, yam and seeds can be eaten/consumed.
After the plant matures, a yam forms beneath the soil at the roots. The excess food within the leaves moved down to the roots and collects there. And then a yam is formed at the roots. This too can be eaten, stated Jayathilaka.
Dambala can be grown in both Yala and Maha seasons. It can be grown in the Wet Zone and Dry Zone as well.
To grow Dambala there should be a good drainage system and there should be Sandy-loam soil. Those are the two most important requirements to cultivate. The flowers are whitish light blue. It is also important to add compost to the Sandy-loam soil, pointed out Jayathilaka.
There are many varieties of Dambala grown  SLS 44 (Plant is greenish and seeds are whitish), SLS 40 (Plant is Greenish and seeds are brownish), UPS 122 (plant is purple and seeds are brownish)
It is cultivated through seeds. The hole dug must be 30cm x 30cm x 30cm and the spacing between two plants should be 60cm  75cm, stated Jayathilaka
When growing on fences there should be supports. And the supports take the form of a wooden pyramid shape (an inverted V Shape). The holes will be positioned on either side and the vine will grow along the supports and grow along the fence.
The supports need to be 2 meters high. And there will be an entire line of these supports. This is on a commercial scale. In a home garden there is no need for such preparation, a few supports will do, said Jayathilaka
It takes around three or four months for flowers and pods to appear. For around two to three years the plant will give a harvest and the harvest can be reaped every three to four days.
One hectare will yield 15 tons. It is a plant with no pest or diseases problems. Now and then you will need to prune the plants. It also needs sunlight so growing them in spaces that get sunlight is important, summed up Jayathilaka

Zimbabwe fined for slow over-rate
Zimbabwe has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate against Sri Lanka during the fourth One-Day International in Hambantota on Saturday.
Chris Broad of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Graeme Cremers side was ruled to be one over short of its target when time allowances were taken into consideration.
In accordance with Article 2.5.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.
As such, Cremer has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee, while his players have received 10 per cent fines. If Zimbabwe commits another minor over-rate breach in an ODI within 12 months of this offence with Cremer as captain, it will be deemed a second offence by Cremer and he will face a suspension.
Cremer pleaded guilty to the offence and accepted the proposed sanction, so there was no need for a formal hearing.

Zimbabwe restrict Sri Lanka to 203-8

Off-spinner Sikandar Raza claimed three wickets to help Zimbabwe restrict Sri Lanka to 203 for eight in the fifth and deciding one-day international on Monday.
Put into bat, Sri Lanka suffered from a lack of partnerships but opener Danushka Gunathilaka (52) and Asela Gunaratne (59 not out) hit gritty half-centuries to steady the home side in Hambantota.
The Angelo Mathews-led side slipped to 153-8 in the 42nd over before Gunaratne and Dushmantha Chameera (18 not out) put on an unbeaten 50-run stand for the ninth wicket.
Paceman Tendai Chatara drew first blood after getting opener Niroshan Dickwella -- who came into the match with two successive centuries caught behind for three.
The wicket also pulled the brakes on Sri Lanka's rampaging opening starts in the previous one-day internationals against the visiting African side.
Dickwella and Gunathilaka made ODI history in delivering back-to-back double century partnerships in the previous two contests against Zimbabwe.
Raza (3-21), who opened the bowling for the visiting side, rattled Sri Lanka's top order with two wickets including left-handed batsman Upul Tharanga for one.
The Pakistan-born Raza was complemented by skipper Graeme Cremer, who took two wickets with his wily leg-spin, notably the prized scalp of his opposite number Mathews (24).

Zimbabwe wins the toss, chooses to bowl

Zimbabwe won the toss and chose to bowl first in the deciding ODI, at Hambantota. The previous four matches in the series have been won by chasing sides.
Sri Lanka made two changes to the attack that failed to defend 219 off 31 overs on Saturday, swapping out the expensive Lakshan Sandakan and inexperienced Asitha Fernando, for Akila Dananjaya - the offspinner - and seam bowler Nuwan Kulasekara.
Dananjaya had played the first match but had been out of the XI since. Kulasekara is a late addition to the squad, having been added only after Nuwan Pradeep picked up a thigh strain. The batting order remains intact.
Zimbabwe, chasing their first series win away since 2009, made no changes to their winning XI, leaving seamer Chris Mpofu in the attack, and batsman Tarisai Musakanda in the top order.
The weather is expected to remain fine through the day, with temperatures in the low thirties.

People who visit the Biso-ella at Wilegoda that supplies drinking water to the Eheliyagoda town and several nearby villages are largely polluting it.
Illicit gem mining along the water source is also evident.
Former Eheliyagoda PS members Tilak Jayawickrama and R.Dhanaratna said drunk youngsters behaving rudely along the Biso Ella is common during the holidays.
They said no action was taken to rectify the situation to date even though the matter was discussed at the PS meeting several times.
Eheliyagoda Water Board OIC Anura Senanaike said a fence was erected to prevent the visitors from entering the water storage tank area but scattering waste continues.
We do not have enough resources to guard the upper stream area, he said.
Sri Lankan ancient king Mayadunne took refuge in the Maligatenna hill area close to Eheliyagoda to prepare for enemy attacks at the time.

UN Vesak celebrations in SL a raving success
Sri Lanka achieved unprecedented international recognition by holding UN Vesak celebrations in the country in a highly successful manner, All-Nepal Bhikku Association President Ven. Maitri Mahathera (Shakya) Thera, who was in Sri Lanka, recently, said.
Shakya Thera, who is also the Chairman and Chief Abbot of the Ananda Kuti Vihar International Buddhist Society in Lumbini, Nepal and Spiritual Advisor of the Lumbini Development Trust, noted that Sri Lanka, where the Buddha visited on three occasions, was the best place to hold the United Nations International Vesak Festival. He also said that Sri Lanka was the most noteworthy contributor to International Vesak Day. Prof. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera initiated and inspired a meeting of global Buddhists in 1950 in Sri Lanka, resulting in the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) on May 25, 1950, at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy. This meeting was attended by 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries in Asia, Europe and America, Shakya Thera added.
At this meeting, the Buddhist Flag was formally accepted and Ven. Piyarathana Thera recommended that Vesak Day should be accepted globally as a Buddhist celebration; a proposal which was accepted and followed by the Global Buddhist fraternity. Buddhism during its existence over two millennia had developed into three schools; Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayna; all disciples and believers of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Prof. G.P. Malalasekera was able to unite all three schools of Buddhism within the World Fellowship of Buddhism and became the first president of WFB from 1950 to 1958, he said.
Lakshman Kadirgamar too, was a pioneer in making Vesak Day as an optional holiday at the United Nations for the first time under its resolution 69/250/ at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1999, requesting for the adaptation of 'Vesak Day' on September 23, 1999 and at the 79th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1999, he added. In 1968, Ven. Maitri Thera was ordained in Sri Lanka under the theme of ordaination of 10 Shakyas.

Ali sends South Africa spinning to first Test defeat
London: Moeen Ali took six wickets as England beat South Africa by 211 runs to win the first Test at Lords with more than a day to spare on Sunday.
The Proteas, set 331 to win, collapsed to 119 all out inside 37 overs.
The result meant Joe Root, who made 190 in the hosts first innings 458, enjoyed a resounding victory in his first Test as England captain, with his side now 1-0 up in this four-match series.
Off-spinner Ali, the man-of-the-match, finished with Test-best figures of six for 53 in 15 overs -- including a burst of five for 20 in 25 balls -- on a pitch offering sharp turn.
No South Africa batsman made more in the innings than Temba Bavumas 21.
- England collapse -
The day started well for South Africa as England, who resumed on 119 for one in their second innings, lost seven wickets before lunch in a dramatic collapse.
But in the midst of the clatter of wickets, Vernon Philander dropped a routine catch at long-off when Jonny Bairstow, mistiming a drive off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, was on seven.
Bairstow punished the Proteas by making 51 before he was last man out in a total of 233, stumped by opposing wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock off Maharaj.
The scale of South Africas task could be seen from the fact that only once, when the West Indies posted 344 for one against England in 1984, had a side made more than 300 in the fourth innings to win a Lords Test.
Bairstow, the son of late former England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, has often been criticised for the quality of his glovework.
But he held a brilliant one-handed catch, diving low down the legside, to give England their first wicket Sunday when Test debutant Heino Kuhn (one) glanced James Anderson.
South Africas 12 for one became 12 for two when stand-in skipper Dean Elgar (two) drilled a return catch to Ali.
JP Duminy then hammered a pull off Wood and Ali held a good catch at midwicket to leave South Africa 25 for three on the stroke of tea.
If the Proteas were to now pull off an improbable win they needed a major innings from Hashim Amla.
But the star batsman fell for his interval score of 11 when, beaten on the outside edged by an excellent delivery from left-arm spinner Liam Dawson he was lbw.
There was a brief pause before Ali transformed South Africas 61 for four into 82 for eight.
De Kock (18) and Bavuma were both bowled aiming across the line, with Theunis de Bruyn, Keshav Maharaj and Kagiso Rabada also falling to Worcestershires Ali.
Maharajs exit gave Ali a 10th wicket of a match where he had earlier completed the all-rounders Test double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets and made 87 in Englands first innings.
Dawson ended the match when Morne Morkel holed out to South Africa-born Keaton Jennings in the deep.
Former England captain Alastair Cook was 59 not out overnight and Gary Ballance unbeaten on 34.
The pair found runs hard to come by against a South Africa attack now back to full strength with Philander returning having been unable to bowl Saturday having been hit on the hand while batting.
When Rabada had Ben Stokes plumb lbw he jokingly put a finger to his lips -- a reference to his ban from Fridays second Test at Trent Bridge for swearing at the all-rounder after dismissing him in Englands first innings.
But it was England who had the last laugh on a remarkable day at Lords that saw 19 wickets fall in total. AFP

She was a sincere mother
Its three months since you passed away suddenly left us in sorrow. You were sincere, generous and compassionate and you never complained about anything.
You were concerned about others, especially your sisters and their children. It was wonderful to know that you had given up all your worldly possessions such as jewellery and all other items of value.
As a teacher, your commitment towards your students was exemplary. In your silent and humble way, you were so dedicated towards their education and helped them in many ways. You never forgot to wish your friends and relations on their birthdays.
Though you were bedridden and found it difficult to talk, your mind remained razor sharp and you could recall any incident with accuracy. Though born and bred to a Buddhist family, you never forgot to attend church on a special day, such as on Christmas and listen to Christmas carols. You observed sil every poya day until it was difficult to walk about.
You have completed your race on earth and you have fulfilled your obligations. So thank you, our elder sister, for all that you have done for us.
We take comfort in Rabindranaths Tagores words, Death is not extinguishing the light. It is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.
Your sisters, friends and family members.

He was a loving father to his children
It is with profound sorrow that I write these few words of appreciation on my father Kurukulasooriya Joseph Mervyn Perera, who passed away 30 years ago on April 24, 1987.
He was born on April 19, 1931 and hailed from a very respectable Catholic family in Moratuwa.
His sudden heart-attack at a comparative young age of 56 was a blow to all of us.
He was the eldest in a family of three children. My father, who had his education at St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, qualified in the senior school certificate examination (English) in 1948 with good results. My father attended St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, from 1937  1948. After his school career, he joined the Colombo Port Commission as a clerk in 1950 and became the time-keeping officer in the PHI division in 1970.
He was the senior TKC at the time of his death in 1987 and completed 36 years of service at this institution, which he considered to be his second home.
He married my mother Rita on January 15, 1959. They lived an exemplary and happy wedded life. My mother was always behind my father and looked after him well until his end.
He was a loving father to me and my three brothers late Ranjan, late Andrew and Sharmal, and only sister Anne and also our spouses.
My father was also a great lover of music and every evening he played the mouth organ and enjoyed singing his favourite songs. Music also his life and forte. My father was kind to all, hated none and was like a little child even in his old age.
He had great faith in God with whose blessing he led a happy life until his end. He attended to his own matters up to his last day and we can only be happy that his end was peaceful.
He celebrated is 56th birthday on April 19, 1987 and just five days later, said good bye to all of us to be with the Lord.
My fathers passing away 30 years ago was so sudden and unexpected and saddened our hearts. But we rejoice as we are certain that he is with Our Lord Almighty. Even though he is no more, he will always remain in our hearts forever. I thank Jesus for giving us such a kind and loving father like him.
I thank him for all what he had done for the five of us and for our families.
May the soul of my dear father rest in peace!

Baldwin Kuruppu
A noble teacher to his students
I came to know Baldwin Kuruppu in the mid-1950s when I was in the SSC class at Ananda College, Colombo. He was not only my class master, but also the Sinhala subject teacher for A Level. I became a student of his once again in a Human Resource Management course at NIBM when he functioned as the Course Director.
The nobleness that was intrinsic to teaching was definitely epitomized by him. After leaving Ananda College, he served in varies executive capacities in several organizations in Sri Lanka before migrating to Australia in 1991.
He authored over fifty booksoriginals, translations and biographies. He was a repository of knowledge and wisdom, sharing his vast knowledge and experience expecting nothing in return.
He also belonged to a class of people who made the word a better place by having lived here, passed this way with the fragrance of their lives. Their live evade the skills of a biographer. They cannot be assessed, there are no windows to their lives. Such was the life of Baldwin Kuruppu.
He was never conspicuous with his emotions, but his immense love for near and dear family was always in plain view.
He gave them the space to express themselves to pursue their adventures and ambitions to become strong and independent, but was always there when they needed his wisdom, strength and love. His uninhibited affection for them would reveal the great tenderness that lay beneath that cool reserve.
Had strong ethics and principles which he never compromised. He was able to bend the world to his will, not with brashness or aggression, but with quiet poise, dignity and his own distinctive brand of compassion.
Throughout his life, he displayed humanism, gentleness and other good traits which are now fast disappearing.
His exemplary ethical conduct, integrity and moral values left and indelible mark on those who came into contact with him. There was no vestige of superciliousness or assumption in him. He was never overbearing and self-opinionated, but unpretentious, always keeping a low profile. In the evening of his life, he developed a mental serenity and tranquility that enabled him to remain calm and unruffled and face life with equanimity.
He lived for 89 years. His demise reminds us of the Buddhist teaching of impermanence. Material form, feelings, perceptions, formations and conciousness are all impermanent
May he attain the supreme bliss of nibbana!

## Title: Beauty of Boredom

Beauty of Boredom
It was last weekend when I was chatting with him on Facebook that my friend in Australia told me its OK to be bored. When I had told him the argument we were having over the last chapter in Wuthering Heights (he thought it was a flop), has to be continued later as my eight-year -old was complaining of being bored and I had to find something for her to do, that he said it. In fact, he said, boredom could even be a good thing.
After suggesting several options to my daughter that would keep her busy, all of which she refused, I let her play a game on my phone and returned to my computer to find out if boredom could really be a good thing.
No sooner than I typed the words on to the search engine I found about 16,600,000 links that presumably said children should be bored.
busy parents
The first article I read was by Dr. Vanesssa Lapointe who in her essay Why you should do nothing when your child says Im Bored asked, What does your gut do when you hear the two words every parent dreads Im bored. As if she had been watching the scene in my living room Dr. Lapointe went on to add Maybe it is because of the incredible guilt that a lot of todays busy parents carry around with them, or maybe because in the grand scheme it feels like the path of least resistance, but many of us are tempted to respond to those dreaded two words with a running list of options. Best case scenario is the child grabs onto one of your ideas. Worst case, you frustratingly give in to another 30 minutes of screen time just to get them out of your hair.
She suggests the next time your child says, Im bored, you should just smile at them and say, I love bored. Not only might that be incredibly freeing for you, but it also is actually really good for your childs development. Why Children need to sit in their own boredom for the world to become quiet enough that they can hear themselves. It is only when we are surrounded by nothing that something comes alive on the inside, says Dr. Lapointe.
over-scheduling children
So, if you have been planning to entertain your kids with art school, piano classes, or tennis lessons during the August holidays just around the corner, think again. It is true that these activities fill childrens time and supply much-needed childcare when kids are out of school. But psychologists and child development experts suggest that over-scheduling children during the school holidays is unnecessary and could ultimately keep kids from discovering what truly interests them.
Your role as a parent is to prepare children to take their place in society. Being an adult means occupying yourself and filling up your leisure time in a way that will make you happy, says Lyn Fry, a child psychologist in London with a focus on education. If parents spend all their time filling up their childs spare time, then the childs never going to learn to do this for themselves.
Fry is not the only one to point out the benefits of boredom. Dr. Teresa Belton, visiting fellow at the University of East Anglia with a focus on the connection between boredom and imagination, told the BBC recently that boredom is crucial for developing internal stimulus, which then allows true creativity.
Unstructured time
It is said that unstructured time also challenges children to explore their own passions. If we keep them busy with lessons and structured activity, or they fill their time with screen entertainment, they never learn to respond to the stirrings of their own hearts, which might lead them to build a playhouse in the back yard, make a monster from clay, write a short story or song, organize themselves into making a drama, or simply study the bugs on the lawn (as Einstein reportedly did for hours). These calls from our heart are what lead us to those passions that make life meaningful, and they are available to us beginning in childhood - but only when children are given free rein to explore and pursue where their interests lead them.
As Nancy H. Blakey said, It is possible for boredom to deliver us to our best selves, the ones that long for risk and illumination and unspeakable beauty. If we sit still long enough, we may hear the call behind boredom. With practice, we may have the imagination to rise up from the emptiness and answer.
Try it and you will realize that most children given unstructured time will rise to the occasion (after some minor complaining) and find something interesting to do with it. Experts say kids are always happiest in self-directed play. Thats because play is childrens work. Its how they work out emotions and experiences theyve had. Watch any group of children playing (outside, when screens are not an option) and they will organize themselves into an activity of some sort, whether thats making a dam for a stream made by an open tap, playing pretend or seeing who can jump farthest.
While there is a good chance children might mope around for a while and be bored, its important to realize that this isnt wasted time.
Theres no problem with being bored, says Fry. Its not a sin, is it I think children need to learn how to be bored in order to motivate themselves to get things done. Being bored is a way to make children self-reliant.
Value of boredom
This same theory was put forward in 1930 by philosopher Bertrand Russell, who devoted a chapter of his book The Conquest of Happiness to the potential value of boredom. Imagination and capacity to cope with boredom must be learned as a child, he wrote: A child develops best when, like a young plant, he is left undisturbed in the same soil. Too much travel, too much variety of impressions, are not good for the young, and cause them as they grow up to become incapable of enduring fruitful monotony.
Surely its high time we changed our antipathy towards boredom. Boredom is the elixir of creativity and passion. Boredom is the pathway to drive and ambition. Boredom is magical.
Tips to encourage free time
* Leave openings for open-ended unplanned time if possible, at least once a week. If that is not possible, plan for once a month. This could be during a long car ride, a walk, or time at home on a rainy day. Try not to jump in to plan an activity but give your child time to think of what shed like to do and then join her in that activity.
* Have open-ended materials available for times when boredom might arise. A cupboard at your childs level filled with art supplies, a bin of recycled cardboard boxes or dress-up materials, or a space outside where your child can dig or plant or create; offer the conditions for creativity to grow from boredom.
* Participate in Screenbreak, a week in the school holidays where your family watches no television or other screens for seven days. This gives families an opportunity to see what happens when screens are off for an extended time period.
* There are many expectations on childrens time that are out of our control; but look for the parts you can impact. Look at boredom as an opportunity to try something different which may be beneficial in your childs life. The next time your child says Im bored, welcome the opportunity. Give open-ended time a try to see what happens. It might be good for you too.

Bottas beats Vettel in Austria, Hamilton fourth
Spielberg: Valtteri Bottas roared to the second victory of his career on Sunday when he won the Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes ahead of championship leader Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari.
The Finn, in his first season with Mercedes after replacing 2016 champion Nico Rosberg, came home 0.658 seconds clear of Vettel who increased his lead over Lewis Hamilton in the drivers championship to 20 points.
Hamilton, in the second Mercedes, did his utmost to grab a podium finish after starting from eighth on the grid, but had to settle for fourth behind Australian Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull.
I had a bit of dj vu in the end to what happened in Russia when he was right behind me, said Bottas, who is now 19 points behind Hamilton in third.
In the last stint, I had a massive blister on the rear left tyre, so that made it quite tricky. And I think it was the start of my life! I was just really on it today.
Vettel said: I was struggling a bit in the first part and much happier in the second stint. The last laps were very close  I think I needed one more lap because he was struggling to get up the hill.
For Ricciardo, on his teams home Red Bull Ring circuit, it was a fifth consecutive podium finish and the 22nd of his career.
The Australian smiled: It was a fun race with some decisive moments at the start and then defending Lewis in the last laps. It got pretty close!
Vettel now leads the drivers championship with 171 points ahead of Hamilton on 151 and Bottas on 136, while in the constructors title race Mercedes lead with 287 ahead of Ferrari on 254. AFP

KANDYS HEARTBREAKING AMBULANCES
Recently for two consecutive weeks, I happened to be in Kandy on some work and stayed on Mahamaya Mawatha, above the Kandy Garden Club, at a Guest House for three successive weekdays each time. Each morning between 6.30 and 8 a.m. one could hear the roar and the horns of the traffic below on the Lake bund road.
What was most distressing was the wail of sirens of many an ambulance heading to and from Kandy General Hospital. Today everyone is very concerned about the Dengue epidemic and they are further concerned about the dumping of garbage and pollution of the environment, quite rightly.
Similarly, dont we have a heart for those who could be terminally ill and needing emergency treatment at the Kandy General Hospital The time saved going directly to hospital past the Dalada Maligawa could save many lives, I am sure. I appeal to the Most Venerable Mahanayakas of Malwatta and Asgiriya together with the authorities concerned to consider opening up the road by the Dalada Maligawa and save lives, by permitting at least the travel of ambulances carrying patients, which could be security checked before the Maligawa and Queens Hotel.
They should be allowed to pass through without stopping (preferably with only lights flashing), preserving the sanctity of the Dalada Maligawa.

Combatting dengue
Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are four closely related but antigenically different serotypes of the virus that can cause dengue (DEN1, DEN 2, DEN 3, DEN 4).Dengue has a wide spectrum of infection outcome (asymptomatic to symptomatic). Symptomatic illness can vary from undifferentiated fever (viral syndrome), dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue with unusual manifestations. DF and DHF comprise the bulk of symptomatic illness while unusual dengue is a rare entity (usually <1%).
* Dengue Fever (DF) - marked by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and pain in muscles and joints. Some may also have a rash and varying degree of bleeding from various parts of the body (including nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising).
* Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) - is a more severe form, seen only in a small proportion of those infected. DHF is a stereotypic illness characterized by 3 phases; febrile phase with high continuous fever usually lasting for less than 7 days; critical phase (plasma leaking) lasting 1-2 days usually apparent when fever comes down, leading to shock if not detected and treated early; convalescence phase lasting 2-5 days with improvement of appetite, bradycardia (slow heart rate), convalescent rash (white patches in red background), often accompanied by generalized itching (more intense in palms and soles), and diuresis (increase urine output).
Patients should seek medical advice in the presence of following features particularly when fever settles:
* Severe vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Increase thrust
* Drowsiness and excessive sleepiness
* Refusing to eat or drink
* Abnormal bleeding manifestations - eg: heavy menstrual bleeding or menstruation starting earlier than usual
If the following features are present seek medical attention immediately:
* Cold clammy skin and extremities
* Restless and irritability
* Skin mottling
* Decreased/no urine output
* Behaviour changes - confusion or using foul language
Early detection of Dengue illness
Early identification and management of Dengue illness can minimize morbidity and mortality. In the present hyper-endemic setting in Sri Lanka, Dengue illness (Dengue Fever - DF /Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever - DHF) is considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute onset of fever with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash (diffuse, erythematous, macular), haemorrhagic manifestation (petechiae, positive tourniquet test), Leukopenia (<5000/mm3), Platelet count =150,000/mm3 and rising Haematocrit of 5-10%.
Sometimes Dengue patients may present with atypical manifestations like respiratory symptoms such as cough, rhinitis or Injected pharynx and gastro-intestinal symptoms such as constipation, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhoea or vomiting without the classical clinical presentation described above.
If a patient with high fever is seen with flushed face/extremities (diffuse blanching erythema in adults) and a positive tourniquet test (even with a normal platelet count) with leukopenia (WBC <5000 /mm3) without any focus of infection, it is very likely that the patient is having Dengue illness.
In any patient who presents with shock (particularly afebrile at presentation with cold extremities and tachycardia with low volume pulse and hypotension) consider Dengue Shock as a likely diagnosis.
Detection of NS1 antigen from blood is novel laboratory diagnostic test for dengue during early febrile phase. However, NS1 only implies that the person is having dengue illness and it does not help in differentiating DF from DHF.
Therefore, NS1 test may be useful in situations where early clinical diagnosis is doubtful.
Value of Full Blood Count (FBC/CBC)
OPD level:
* FBC is mandatory on all fever patients - from day 3 onwards
* Special patient categories - FBC on day 1 or first day of visit/contact (Pregnancy, Infancy, elderly, those with co-morbidities, etc.)
* FBC daily from day 3 if platelet (plt) count =150,000/ mm3
* FBC twice daily when plt count =150,000/ mm3 (admission to hospital based on clinical judgment, warning signs and social reasons)
* Admit all patients with platelet count =100,000/ mm3
Inward level
* For any patient admitted to hospital on or before day 3 of illness same criteria of performing FBC as in OPD level is applicable unless and otherwise more frequent counts are requested by the clinician.
Important Advice for Ambulatory Care Patients (OPD level):
* First contact doctors should ensure adequate oral fluid intake.
* In adults around 2500 ml for 24 hours (if the body weight is less than 50kg fluids given as 50ml/kg for 24hours or 2ml/kg/hr) is recommended during Febrile Phase (before admission to hospital).
In children calculation of maintenance fluid is as follows:
M (Maintenance)=100ml/kg for first 10 kg
+50ml/kg for next 10 kg
+20ml/kg for balance weight
Patients/parents should be asked to return immediately for review if any of the following occur on/beyond day three:
* Clinical deterioration with settling of fever
* Inability to tolerate oral fluid
* Severe abdominal pain
* Cold and clammy extremities
* Lethargy or irritability/restlessness
* Bleeding tendency including inter-menstrual bleeding or menorrhagia
* Not passing urine for more than 6 hours.

Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 0.48% W-o-W (or LKR 14.56Bn) to LKR 3,055.79Bn cf. LKR 3,041.23Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 43.13% (or LKR 1.50Bn) of market turnover. Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Richard Peiris & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 85.94% of the sectors total turnover. The Bev Food Tobacco Sector meanwhile accounted for 14.01% (or LKR 0.49Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Lion Brewery, Ceylon Beverage & Cold Stores which accounted for 86.79% of the sector turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 18.26% (or LKR 0.64Bn) to the market driven by HNB & Commercial Bank which accounted for 44.01% of the sector turnover.

Point of view
Equities ended in the red this week as the benchmark price index slipped by ~10 points to end at 6,737.50 points.
The ASPI which slipped from an 18M high on Monday (losing 14 points) fell a further ~23 points by Wednesday before it managed to wipe-off some losses on Thursday & Friday as it recovered by ~28 points.
The tabling of the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament contributed towards thin volumes as investors continued to remain watchful ahead of the parliaments decision on the new bill.
The daily average turnover level was consequently lower than that of last week, falling ~40% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.70Bn, ~20% lower than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.92Bn.
Crossings over the week meanwhile, accounted for ~28% of total market turnover, amid strong interest in JKH(20% of crossings), Lion Brewery (15% of crossings) and Ceylon Beverages (14% of crossings).
Foreign investors however continued to be net buyers over the week, to end at LKR 0.55bn this week (~48% lower than last week), helping push the Y-T-D net inflow position to the Colombo bourse to over LKR 22Bn. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for clarity from the proposed new inland revenue act.
Higher revenue supports Q117 fiscal deficit
In its mid-year assessment of the countrys fiscal position, the Ministry of Finance noted that both tax and non-tax revenue rose over the 1st four months of 2017, helping the budget deficit remain at a sustainable level of Rs. 233.2Bn (cf. Rs. 233.4Bn in Jan-Apr 16).
Total revenue over the period rose 24.6% Y-o-Y (Rs. 589.0Bn cf. Rs.472.7Bn) as tax revenue rose 25.6% Y-o-Y and non-tax revenue rose 10.3% Y-o-Y.
Tax revenue rose on the back of higher indirect tax receipts as domestic consumption based tax rose +32.3% Y-o-Y and import-based tax rose +22.5% Y-o-Y as revenue collection from VAT rose over the period. Direct tax receipts also rose 30.2% Y-o-Y with personal and corporate income tax rising 13.3% Y-o-Y between Jan-Apr17 particularly from the Banking and Financial services, Wholesale trade and Manufacturing sectors. Non-tax revenue over the Jan-Apr 17 period meanwhile rose 10.3% Y-o-Y as most sources of non-tax revenue (sales and charges, social security contribution and rent income) increased.
The profit and dividend contribution from State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) however, declined 44.1% Y-o-Y as overall performance of the SOBE has been mixed.
Major SOBEs such as CEB and CPC for instance incurred losses over Jan-Apr17 as drought conditions along with higher global oil prices impacted performance.
The ROI from the SOBEs over the period consequently declined to Rs. 4.4 Bn cf. Rs. 7.9Bn in the comparable period last year.

Customs seize foreign currency worth Rs 2.4m from Thai businessman
Foreign currency valued at Rs 2.4 million was seized from a Thailand bound businessman by Sri Lanka Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday. The seized currencies were in US Dollars and Swiss Francs.
Sri Lanka Customs spokesman and Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratna said the notes of the contraband currencies were detected from the businessmans baggage in the wee hours.
