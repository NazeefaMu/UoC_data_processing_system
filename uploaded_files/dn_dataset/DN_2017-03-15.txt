BEAUTIES OF WILDERNESS
According to Bible, the Lord then said to Noah: Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
The world at the very inception was filled with more the animals than people. The world was a thick green carpet with forests, rivers, mountain ranges and animals. Our great ancestors survived with the produce of the trees and catching their prey in different styles.
Wildlife plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological equilibrium of nature.
The presence of wildlife affects the character of its habitat by continually supporting the evolutionary adaptations of everything in its environment.
The animals colours, size, variety change from near the equator up to the Northern/Southern Pole. Thereby you find snow white coloured animals in the Northern Pole and near the equator dark coloured animals. Even from continent to continent the habits and appearances differ.
As the world population is increasing and introduction to the modern era of development and technology, most of the jungles have been destroyed to put up buildings and improvise difficulties for the wildlife.
In countries like South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia, Tanzania and Botswana have introduced wildlife safaris, for the people to watch and study their behavior. Even in Sri Lanka we have sanctuaries where wild beasts are allowed to gaze and move about freely.

Behind the green lines
The value of an artist is none other than the value of what he bestowed on the humankind. What benefit can a society expect form anyone who is poor in art
Praise and tokens of appreciations from society would bring pleasure to an artist, yet nor shall he be disheartened by any absence of them, a true artist as befitan ardent lover would have abundance to give away with no desire of anything in return.
We sincerely believe that this brief prologue might serve righteously in honouring the iconic Sri Lankan photographer, late Nihal Fernando. In fact we consider ourselves privileged having offered this opportunity to write a few words about this phenomenal artist.
It is beyond question that his collection of work, portraying Sri Lankas environment, history, culture and community deserves the esteem of apriceless National Resource. I do assume that nowhere else in the world should be such a rich collection of photographs in possession of a single artist. It amounts to a lifetime of constant heard work and commitment that should have been recognized and patronized by a government or an international organization such as UNESCO.
Owing much to the early technology of negative photography, Mr Nihal Fernandos collection of work is lavish with magnificent black and white and colour photographs. Their composition and colour combination always depict remarkable elegance.
20 years ago I met Mr.Nihal Fernando for the first time, though I had been acquainted with his work long before. He was examining some photographs form his collection when I presented him with a question that had been there in my mind for quite some time.
Dont you think that you didnt enjoy the full benefit of such a rich collection
Someone may enjoy it someday was his humble answer.
He embraced his work as his soul satisfaction without any expectation personal benefit or fame. His words touched my heart strongly.
At that moment I had in my hand one of his photographs; a wide landscape of a paddy field bordered by the beautiful KothmaleOya, captured in an elevated angle. The meadow was so wide that part of it showedripe golden paddy ready for harvesting, half mature yellow colour paddy and another terrace covered with lush green young paddy. Miniature shapes of farmers scattered here and there decorating the picture.
The inspiration that wrapped me with the sight of this picture was re-born as a poem the dawn next day.
A pauperClimbs up the peekViews the plain belowGrain grown greenWho planted the seedsWho is going to harvestOne will plough the fieldsAnother will harvest the gainLooks gold platedBut golden by birthAt this hourRainy flash is goldenTears are also goldenSmudgy landscapesGolden huedA rainbowHas been createdBy the same goldsmithAt the edge of the plainA shimmer over the dark waterFar awayAnd nearWater dropsOn the flower petalsTiny rainbowsIn every dropUnable to bareThat wonderThe Lord of the wealthDescends downWiping the tearsIn a gentle smile
He starts to work before the dawn, before the first sunbeam catches the ground. He is at his location when the first fresh ray of light touches the tip of the crown of trees. His first shooting session ends at 9.00 am (the time when some photographers start their work) his second shooting session starts at 4.00 pm and the camera remains in his hand till the nightfall.
An early morning drop of light, with its fugitive essences, paints a magnificent design on the SandakadaPahana (The Moon Stone) Nihal Fernando does not let this beauty fade off. If SandakadaPahana is ever to be seen in its apex of beauty, one either has to be there right on that time, or one should simply have seenMr Nihal Fernandos picture.
Nihal Fernando was a silent character, yet a ready listener. He would say one or two words about his photographs only when he was asked.
He captures the footprints of a solitary deer reaching slowly towards water on a new sand dune formed by the tide just the night before. Eligible to be recognised as a landmark in wild life photography, this image seems to portray the feelings of a thirsty deer. Not one out of so many modern photographers fully equipped with digital gear could bring back such an excellent work of art.
Sebastio Salgado, the greatest photographer of our era gets an invitation to address an audience in New York. He exhibits his pictures, yet his speech was all about his country, environment and humanity. (His talk is available on Youtube). The reason for siting Sebastio Salgado in this letter is simple as to our hero being in the same calibre.
Only a few are informed that Nihal Fernando was a champion in the Public Interest Litigation movement triggered by the Eppawala Phosphate mine. He has also published a guide book emphasising the value of bio-fertilizers including instructions to compose them.
Nihal Fernandos capture of the first ray of sun arising, at the East edge of the mountain creating a wonderful painting of the tree tops at the West edge, inspires us to write the poem The master artist of the East
The Master Artist of the EastWhat a deceiverIs this master artistNever completingThis vast canvasLeaving spaceAn excuse to comeAgain and againIs it a good thing to touchThe tender green bodiesWith your brush storksIn shameless silenceThey also acceptEvery day he goes downFrom the westIn order to grasp the viewOf the fleshy shapely hipsBehind the green linesHereafter please goFor your restOnly from the EastWithout betraying your taste

Ben Affleck has completed treatment for alcohol addiction to be 'best father I can be'

Actor Ben Affleck said on Tuesday he had completed treatment for alcohol addiction, saying he wanted to "be the best father I can be."
Affleck, 44, said on his Facebook page that his treatment was the "first of many steps" toward his recovery and specifically thanked his "co-parent," wifeJennifer Garner, whom he separated from in 2015.
"I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront," the "Batman" actor wrote.
"I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step," he added.
Affleck had previously entered rehab for alcohol addiction in 2001.
Hollywood A-list couple Affleck and Garner, who have three children together,announced plans to divorce in July 2015 after 10 years of marriage.
Affleck, who has won two Oscars for his writing and producing work,has stepped away from directing "The Batman"after almost a year in the job. He'll still star in the film as the titular crusader.
The actor made his debut as the superhero for the studio last summer in "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," and he had been attached to write and direct the Batman standalone movie for about a year.

CEB assures no power interruption despite token strike
As employees of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) launch a token strike by calling in sick today, the Ministry of Power and Energy yesterday assured that the people would not suffer a power cut.
The National Electricity Workers Association (NEWA) had threatened to go on a 24 hour strike which would cause serious power outages in the country today in protest of a recent salary increase given to CEB engineers.
They allege that the engineers salaries were increased by 70-120 percent with effect from 1 January 2015 with no corresponding increase to other workers at the CEB. The strike is supported by the unions of electrical superintendents, executives, technological service, accountants, clerks, drivers, security and minor employees.
Director (Development) and the Media Spokesperson of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena speaking to the Daily News said the engineers would report to work as usual and that work would go ahead as normal.
We have taken all necessary steps to ensure that there would be no power outages, he said.
He explained that the CEB had decided to go for a unified service grade for all employees in the CEB and thus different grades were identified with specific salary scales. The Technical and Financial grades have had their salary scales decided on but others grades are yet to do so.
The Engineers grades were approved and when they were submitted to the CEB board, the board asked that the other grades too be finalized. So a committee was appointed to look into and review all categories and we are expecting their report to be submitted to the board soon, said Jayawardena.
The Unions in the meantime allege that the CEB would have to spend close to Rs.600 million on the salary hike for engineers and they have complained to the CID, FCID and CIABOC in 2015 against what they call an illegal increase. The cases are still pending in the Supreme Courts and Court of Appeal.
NEWA General Secretary Ranjan Jeyalal was not available for comment despite several attempts made to contact him.

CIDA wants to stay at Wijerama Mawatha
An attempt is being made to force the only construction industry regulating body, CIDA to vacate the current office premises at Sausiripaya Building at Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 7.
This is based on an ending of a 30 year lease agreement with the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation. Currently both organisations are functioning at the building sharing adequate space for each other's needs.
The Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) is the apex regulatory organisation in construction industry regulating and standardising the industry with capacity building of the industry stakeholders attributed as a key function.
Rewarding and recognition of quality outputs of construction, preparation of standard documentation for contract administration and project management practices, monitoring and registering the contractors as per the requirement of NPA, are some functions while the Construction Industry Development Act (CID Act) No 33 of 2014 entrusted more functions to streamline the sector.
Nevertheless the Construction Industry contributes in about 10% to the Gross Domestic Production of Sri Lanka, and the contribution of the Construction Industry to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation of the Country is about 60%.
Established in 1981, the Construction Industry Training Project (CITP) converted into Institute for Construction Training & Development (ICTAD) in 1986, which undertook the central registration of Construction Contractors in addition to its training of craftsmen and technicians for the industry. It was during that era World Bank granted funds to construct the Savsiripaya building to house the ICTAD, on a land belonged to the Tower Hall Theatre Foundation (THTF), intended by then Minister of Housing who was also the then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The location selected by the then Prime Minister, was in proximity of all professional bodies of the construction industry and many other training institutions. The Former Prime Minister intended both parties to function in the Savsiripaya premises by directing to sign a long term Lease Agreement (30 years) with provisions to extent the period. In the Lease Agreement, parties agreed to have structures in the building to perform the functions of both parties, as desired by former Prime Minister (Auditorium, Seminar Rooms, Library and Conference Room for CITP and Admin Office and Music Hall for THTF).
ICTAD to CIDA conversion came into effect in 2014, with the enactment of the CID Act, and CIDA is currently paying all Rates, Taxes and payments for all consumptions such as water electricity etc, and allows THTF the use of all the facilities such as Auditorium, free of charge, in addition to the attending to all the repairs, renovations and maintenance to the Savsiripaya building, from the inception at its cost.
CIDA has given sufficient notice to THTF three months prior to the expiration of the Lease Agreement, of its intension to extend the Lease Agreement, as per the provisions of the Lease Agreement, which fell into the deaf ears of the present authority. The Savsiripaya premises, which is the Head Office of CIDA is not a mere administrative office, but constructed specially to carry out functions for the development of the construction industry. CIDA Head Office cannot be shifted, as alleged by THTF, to Construction Equipment Training Center (CETRAC) or Center for Housing, Planning and Building (CHPB), both at Pelawatta, Battaramulla , since these training centers are specifically designed and equipped to carry out specific functions for the uplifting of construction industry.
At this juncture the Government should take a favourable initiative to safeguard the only regulating authority of the Construction Industry, without jeopardising the interests of both THTF and CIDA, and allow it to continue to function in the Savsiripaya premises by extending the Lease Agreement by another 30 years. There are around 5000 CIDA registered contractors in the country at present. The contractors find it convenient to come to Savsiripaya for registration purposes since CIDA's strategic location could be reached within about 10 minutes from the Colombo city. CIDA's location in close proximity of all professional bodies of the construction industry is also advantageous.

Refugee nightmare for the USA
The 43rd President of the USA (George W Bush Jnr) launched wars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), which caused hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties opening up the floodgates of refugees to inundate certain countries of Europe. The wars he launched were fake, to use the favourite word of President Trump. The Arab Spring and the search for WMD were all concocted lies by the US, to upset the equilibrium in the mid-east. Bush saw to it that 2.5 million US military personnel were involved since 2001. Of these, 6,896 were killed in action, and more than 50,000 injured, according to data released by the Defence Department.
After the debacle in Afghanistan and Iraq, the USA interfered in Syria (having laid low Egypt and Libya) supporting anti-government groups calling them freedom fighters, thereby getting involved in a three cornered war which included the ISIS as well. The ISIS also came into being because the US brought down like nine pins, the strong dictators of the mid-east, who somehow kept the peace in the region. The citizens of these countries now believe that they were much safer and happier under the dictators, rather than the political mess they are in today, which has triggered an exodus of refugees to Europe, bringing them untold grief and unexpected anxiety to the host countries.
The USA is at the bottom of this huge problem of devastation, death, carnage, the ISIS and the refugees. Therefore the burden of taking care of the refugees (those unfortunates displaced by never ending wars) is squarely on the USA. It is one thing for President Trump to stop the inflow of illegal immigrants to the US; he is correct to guard the borders of his country from criminals and unwanted people from other countries who want a piece of the pie, as it were.
But the hoards of refugees of wars covertly or overtly backed by the USA, must be taken in by the USA, to compensate them for the loss of property, identity and peace of mind.
The USA made the bed, so it had better lie on it.

## Title: Conflict of Interest in issuance of primary dealer license to Perpetual Treasuries in 2013

Conflict of Interest in issuance of primary dealer license to Perpetual Treasuries in 2013
There had been a conflict of interest in respective of the issuance of a primary dealer license to the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited in 2013, the Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond issue yesterday observed.
Referring to a question posed by former MP Rosy Senanayake at the COPE inquiries on the bond issue, the Commission asked former SPD D.Nanayakkara whether he was aware that former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraals sister was a board member of the Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Limited.
It was brought to light by Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardane that former CBSL Governor Cabraal had successfully dodged Rosy Senanayakes question with a reply No it was not a Primary Dealer and this is where you have missed the point.
It was also observed that the Public Debt Department has not been concerned about the track record of the full shareholder of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited when issuing Primary Dealerss license to it.The Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Limited, which is the full shareholder, has recorded a net loss of 2.8 billion as to March 31, 2012. The Commission also questioned former SPD Nanayakkara on what guarantee the PDD issued the newly established company which only fulfilled the minimum requirement of Rs.300 million deposited in a current account Nanayakkara replied the PDD was only concerned about the Capital 3 billion. The Commission also observed that one Renuka Group to which all the unquoted shares of the Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Limited belongs, is famously owned by former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivad Cabrals family.
Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Limited, the main holding company of the Perpetual Group of Companies owned by Jeffory Alosiyus and Arjun Alosiyus, is the mother company of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited. The Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited has applied for a Primary Dealers license in 2013, when Nanayakkara was the Superintendent of the Public Debt Department.
These observations were triggered by a statement made by former SPD of the PDD Nanayakkara when he stated, according to his personal belief, when a director of a Primary Dealer company is a close relative of a CBSL top ranking official, it creates a conflict of interest. He also pointed out it clearly is stated in the Code of Conduct to the Primary Dealers, in the wake of such a conflict of interest, the PDD can withhold or cancel the license of a Primary Dealer. Asked if he knew if Arjun Alosiyus was a close relative to former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran, Nanayakkara said he did not, until the occurrences in the recent past.
The Commission then asked Nanayakkara if he knew that former CBSL Governor Ajit Nivad Cabraals brother-in-law, niece and two cousins were managerial level officers in DFCC, HNB and Bank of Ceylon, respectively ,when Cabraal was holding office as the CBSL Governor.Nanayakkara denied knowing such information.
Asked if it was a case of conflict of interest, Nanayakkara replied with an affirmative.
The Commission ordered Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited to handover their balance sheets, annual reports and other relevant document for scrutiny.
Meanwhile the legal representative of the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited, pointed out to the Commission it would be better to scrutinize the other Primary Dealers as well, to which the Commission said their mandate does not allow it. However, if there are discrepancies, all may come to light subsequent to the current probing, The Presidential Commission to investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds pointed out.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake and Senior State Counsel Dr. Avanti Perera led the evidence.

Dr. Udagama has informed that an article titled Womens Rights: Still to go a long way published by the Daily News has given a very distorted and wrong impression to the reader and it has received very negative public feedback. She has noted that the position she articulated was that on the matter of personal laws, the HRCSL takes the view that Constitution should be supreme. There cannot be any other law above the Constitution.
She notes that her position was that the Constitution as the supreme law should take a principled position on all these matters rather than entertain exceptions.
Regarding consultation with communities she pointed out that community consultation is encouraged as a strategic means to ensure that community has a say over matters that affect them.

Dettol launches Clean Hands,  Clean Nation programme
Dettol, a household name for over 55 years, has extended its hygiene promise with the launch of the Clean Hands, Clean Nation programme.
An initiative meant to raise awareness on the societal need for improved understanding and responsibility in waste disposal and management.
The Clean Hands, Clean Nation programme is built on the premise that most people in Sri Lanka are conscientious of hand hygiene, as experienced by the brand over multiple generations.
However, inappropriate waste disposal and management techniques have led to an unsightly buildup of garbage near a number of popular public and unoccupied spaces.
Jude Martino, Head of Marketing and Trade Marketing for Reckitt Benckiser said, According to a report last year, Sri Lanka generates more than 5 million kilograms of plastic waste per day, and that one-third of the waste is mismanaged; ending up on the side of our roads, drains and waterways ultimately, leading out to the sea. Dettols hygiene message has always focused on the family and its immediate living spaces. But now there is an urgent need to extend that message to cover all the places we occupy and enjoy.
Dettol launched its Clean Hands, Clean Nation program at the summit of Adams peak in January 2017. And the brand hopes to take its message across Sri Lanka during the year. On the scope of the project, Harsha Rathnayake Product Group Manager for Reckitt Benckiser said, We have already mapped out a plan for the year to increase awareness on responsible waste disposal and management techniques. We hope to reduce the incidence of waste mismanaged during the year by educating people that we need a clean nation to truly have clean hands.
Adams Peak, a sanctuary for many religious beliefs, attracts a large body of tourists and pilgrims each year. The mountain, often scaled from December to May, has seen an increase in plastic waste besetting the historical site. Dettol will continue to place waste bins and plastic collection points along popular routes to the summit. The brand will also hold regular clean-ups and educational programs throughout the year.

A digital Sri Lanka consumers can trust
As we celebrate Consumer Rights Day today, we need to understand that over the past few decades, consumers had faced a new challenge, and that is the digital economy. The global economy is changing rapidly towards a digital economy, and all stakeholders throughout the globe are working towards building a digital world consumers can trust.
Consumers International has declared the 2017 Consumer Rights Day to have the theme of Consumer Rights in the Digital Age, considering its contemporary significance for developing, as well as developed countries in the world.
Over three billion, or 40 percent of the worlds population is online now, compared with just one percent in 1995, and all projections suggest that this number will continue to rise. Although this still leaves many consumers who are struggling to access these technologies, rapid growth of the internet and its usage becomes a vital trend of e-marketing. The proportional increase of smartphone usage and other digital devices has also created opportunities as well as challenges for millions of consumers around the world.
Currently, Sri Lanka has six million internet users, making up 29 percent of the total population. Internet has changed the lifestyle of people, and people have shifted to the internet to look for entertainment rather than watching television or listening to the radio. According to ITU statistics, Sri Lanka has relatively high mobile penetration, which is above the regional average and these users fall between the age groups of 25 to 34 years. They account for the highest number of users with 35 to 44 and 18 to 24 age groups, falling in second and third places respectively.
The internet has also penetrated into rural Sri Lanka, and mobile dominance and high demand for local language content are the key reasons for this trend. Sri Lanka, thus, will experience a new user category of the internet: those who have never touched a desktop or laptop computer in their lives, but are spending around five hours per day browsing Facebook on their mobile phones. They have no knowledge of their own privacy on the internet, and at times, show little respect for the privacy of others. This brings us to the need to have responsible use of social media becoming one of the major concerns of our age.
Even though consumers undoubtedly benefit from increased access, choice, and convenience that these technologies deliver, questions remain on how to improve the quality of services which provide trustworthy and cost-effective services via online servers. Concerns over what happens to the data they share online, and what consumers rights and inherited consumer ethics that relate to digital products will affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, consumer awareness and empowerment plays a vital role in promoting the use of digital technology in an effective manner.
In order to harness the benefit of digital revolution for the economic and social development of Sri Lanka, all stakeholders have a collective responsibility to place consumers in the central point in implementing all projects.
National Conference and Workshop
In line with World Consumer Rights Day 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, jointly with the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), have organized the National Conference and Workshop under the theme A Digital Sri Lanka Consumers Can Trust.
The national conference will take place at Nelum Pokuna Auditorium on March 15, and this will be followed by the workshop to be held on March 16, at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
In order to promote the theme, the CAA has planned to launch a social media campaign, video competition, creative article competition, and Twitter competition, parallel to the national conference and workshop.
The objective of this event is to build a dialogue among key stakeholders on the theme, and to facilitate policy recommendations required to strengthen the digital rights of consumers.
A Digital Sri Lanka Consumers can Trust campaign will promote access, participation, and innovation which will benefit consumers, industry, economy, and society in large. World Consumer Rights Day 2017 is an excellent opportunity which gathers all stakeholders in one forum in order to ascertain new initiatives required to promote digital economy in Sri Lanka.
Representatives of all stakeholders such as government officials, industry partners, schoolchildren, university students, academia, researchers, consumer groups and activists, media, and special interest groups will be invited for the Conference. Themes such as Digital Sri Lanka, Consumer Rights in Digital Age-Sri Lankan Context, Regional and Global Consumer Trends, Issues and Developments in Digital Age, E-Commerce and Online Services-Opportunities and Challenges, Strategies to make Sri Lanka a Digitally Inclusive Country, etc. will be focused at the conference. The winners of the video, creative article, and Twitter competitions will be awarded at the conference. Furthermore, the organizers are planning to launch a social media management platform for the CAA.
The main objective of the workshop scheduled on March 16 is to critically evaluate and understand the existing situation of the Sri Lankan digital consumer to draft policy recommendations and a road map to strengthen consumer rights in the digital era. This forum will consist of intellectuals, industry partners, researchers, academics, sector regulators, policymakers, and consumer activists.
All stakeholders concerns and views will be reviewed in the workshop under consumer, industry, policymaking, and regulatory perspectives. Sri Lankan Digital Consumer in todays context, key consumer issues of Sri Lankan digital consumers and their expectations, rights and responsibilities of digital consumer in Sri Lanka, and legal framework for safe digital consumer will be given due consideration under the consumer perspective. A review of current regulation related to digital industry etc. will be discussed and reviewed under the industrys perspective on expansion of e-commerce in Sri Lanka. Insights generated in the workshop will contribute to prepare the policy document on a road map to promote and strengthen the campaign on A Digital Sri Lanka Consumers can Trust.

Double Olympic champion Rowsell-Shand retires
LONDON: Double Olympic cycling track gold medallist Joanna Rowsell-Shand brought the curtain down on her stellar career on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old -- who stood out from her team-mates because of the loss of her hair through alopecia -- won team pursuit gold both in the London Games in 2012 and in Rio last year.
Having been part of the GB Cycling Team for over 10 years, travelling around the world racing my bike, today I am announcing my retirement from international cycling competition, she said in a statement on her website, joannarowsell.com.
Rowsell-Shand -- who was also a five-time world champion, four in the team pursuit and one individual pursuit crown -- also gave some much-needed praise to British Cycling, the subject of adverse headlines for the past year over sexism and bullying allegations.
I want to thank the amazing team at British Cycling, said Rowsell-Shand.
From the world class team behind the team who work tirelessly to ensure we have the best preparation for events, to the very first youth coaches who talent spotted me back when I was 15. AFP

The 2017 karting season got off to a great start for young Eshan Pieris with second place in Round 1 of the 2017 Rotax Max Asia Championships held in Sepang Malaysia. Under very warm conditions, Eshan finished the Time Trials in 4th, just mere tenths behind Indonesias Senna Noor and Prassetyo Hardja, who took the lead.
In both the Pre-finals and final, Eshan came in second behind Prassetyo Hardja and ahead of Senna Noor who has been the reigning Asia Max Champion for the past two consecutive years.
Eshan who is just starting his second year at Monash University Malaysia, drives for the RL Karting Team in Malaysia using the Birel Art chassis powered by IAME X30 Engine. A happy Eshan was quick to thank, my absolutely amazing team RL Karting led by Aaron Lim, as well as Raj Raj for ensuring a great chassis and engine all throughout the weekend. I would also like to thank Monash University for all their support and encouragement which enables me to juggle academics with my racing and of course my parents for all they do to help me excel at the sport.
He went on to say that this was a great start to a hectic race calendar which includes five more Asia Championship races, another five races at the X30 Asian Championships as well as four European tours and maybe the World Final at the end of the year.

EU, Govt. gives priority to its full implementation
The full implementation of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Resolution of October 2015 has been declared as a priority by both the European Union and the Sri Lankan government delegation headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The above was communicated through a communique released by the EU delegation yesterday after the second meeting of the Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights under the European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission held in Colombo on March 13-14, 2017. The Prime Minister as well as Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera had at the meeting reaffirmed their political commitment to move forward on reforms in sectors covered by the Working Group.Both sides reaffirmed their joint commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights domestically and globally and to collaborate on the effective implementation of international human rights instruments, stated the communique while it stressed that the EU did recognised the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka in various areas, including the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the passing of the Right to Information Act, legislation on the Office on Missing Persons and symbolic steps taken to advance reconciliation.
Constitutional reforms too were taken up for discussion along with the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in keeping with international standards.
In the meantime, the EU promised to continue supporting the Government in its reforms, including with financial assistance.
The parties also discussed Sri Lankas application under the EUs Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) which is currently under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council.
The two institutions have until mid-May to discuss the European Commissions assessment and adopt their position. Therefore, the EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labour rights and environmental protection, according to the statement.

Ex-Judges in politics
Controversy continues to dog former Chief Justice Sarath Nanada Silva, perhaps, a carryover from the days when he was lord and master of all he surveyed, on the Supreme Court Bench. Following a decent interval, where he was relatively silent, appearing in a political event organised by the Joint Opposition, Silva, on Monday, once again acted true to form, venturing out into a political diatribe, this time targeting Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera. His bone of contention, like all the speakers at the event, including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, was that Samaraweera was pursing with the joint UNHRC resolution with gusto, in Geneva, to prosecute the countrys war heroes, while this is no longer an issue, with even the US, under Donald trump, what with those who championed such a course of action, such as Samantha Power and Navy Pillai, no longer in the equation.
However, Sarath Silva, as is his wont, deviated from the script and took aim at Samaraweera, on a personal level, insisting among other things that Samaraweera would not have a breath left in him today to enjoy his customary drink, if not for the efforts of the valiant soldiers, who ensured peace and security in the country, so that the likes of Samaraweera could give full play to their indulgences.
Sarath Silva, no doubt, invites controversy, whenever he opens his mouth. This proclivity of his was seen even during his reign on the Bench, where, his judgements, according to many, were tainted by politics and his brash and abrasive manner intimidated counsel who appeared before his Bench. It was this self same Sarath Nanda Silva who made one of the most controversial statements when, in the run up to the last Presidential Election, he in fact did a Mea Culpa, begging forbearance from the public for not sending Mahinda Rajapaksa to gaol, for the latters involvement in the Helping Hambantota saga, where Tsunami relief was siphoned off into private accounts. Sarath Silva also made another controversial statement, this time absolving Yoshitha Rajapaksa of money laundering, while investigations in this regard were proceeding, on how Rs. 240 million was obtained by the latter to set up the Carlton Sports Network. On that occasion, Silva made yet another controversial statement that a particular TV channel was set up using LTTE funds and so why accuse only Yoshitha.
The Television channel concerned, replayed the footage of Sarath Silvas remarks on Helping Hambantota continuously, even dramatising it. It is ironic, to say the least, that the selfsame TV channel gave full play to Sarath Silvas remarks at Mondays Joint Opposition political event, clearly demonstrating that self interest had taken priority with this channel at the expense of true dissemination of news. The former Chief Justice, who now speaks of the valiant contribution of the soldiers, who made it possible for the likes of Mangala Smaraweera to enjoy a tot, due to the changed security situation in the country, it must be said, cared little for security, at a time, when the threat of Tiger suicide bombings was highest in the city, ordering, as he did, from his perch on the Supreme Court Bench, to bring back all inmates of lodgings who were evicted by the forces and taken to a detention centre in Vavunia. He was also not overly concerned about security when he chided the military for stopping office vans during their routine checks on vehicles.
Be that as it may, Minister Samaraweera, it must said, should be commended for the onerous task his is performing to rid the country of the stigma, it was under, during the Rajapaksa years. The US notwithstanding, the country has to honour its international obligations and covenants, to which it is a signatory. It is the rejection of such protocol that brought the country into the sorry pass during the Rajapaksa era that saw even a British Prime Minister censure our rulers while in the country as a guest. Are Gotabhaya and Sarath Silva insisting that Sri Lanka ditches the UN, and go our own way, just because the US has washed its hands off Sri Lanka. The President and Prime Minister have already ruled out foreign judges in the country. Besides, Sri Lanka has been granted two more years of leeway, to honour its obligations, by the UNHRC. Hence what Gotabhaya, Sarath Silva and their ilk are attempting is a political show to paint the government as the villain.
This column has made this point before and we repeat. Firm measures are called for to ban retired judges, and certainly, former members of the Supreme Court, entering the political arena upon their retirement. It is unbecoming of the dignity and majesty in which the Supreme Court is held for one of its former members to descend to the depths of plunging himself into the cesspit of politics, which today is being scorned and reviled by the public. When a former Chief Justice, no less, becomes a willing tool of crafty politicians, what the judiciary will be reduced to is best left unsaid.

Five obstacles facing Bangladesh for Test glory
Bangladesh will play their 100th Test match when they take on Sri Lanka at Colombos P. Sara Oval on Wednesday, 17 years after joining international crickets elite club. Since their first Test against India at Dhaka in November 2000, Bangladesh have had a miserable record, losing 76 of out 99 matches.
But with a recent win over England and some impressive results in ODI cricket raising hopes, AFP looks at some of the obstacles to Bangladesh becoming a force to be reckoned with.
Lack of matches
While crickets big guns such as India and England sometimes play close to 20 Tests a year, Bangladesh have managed an average of six since making their bow. Current skipper Mushfiqur Rahim actually made his debut a year before outgoing England captain Alastair Cook but while Mushfiqur still only has 53 caps, Cook has 140. Last months Test in Hyderabad was their first in India while their only tour of Australia was back in 2003. Besides bottom-ranked Zimbabwe, the last team to play a three-match series against Bangladesh was Sri Lanka in 2007. Mushfiqur insists the only way to improve performances is to play more matches. But with crickets international schedule now more packed than ever, Bangladesh have to convince sides they are competitive.
Security headache
Englands eventual agreement to tour Bangladesh late last year despite fears over their safety was a huge relief. Arguably Bangladeshs biggest fear is of enduring the same fate as Pakistan which has been a virtual no-go zone for international teams since Islamist gunmen attacked a touring Sri Lanka side in 2009. Australia shelved a tour to Bangladesh in 2015, citing security concerns. The West Indies under-19 team cut short a 2013 tour when two bombs exploded outside their hotel. Englands tour was called into question by an attack on a Dhaka cafe last July in which 22 people were killed, including 18 foreigners. The tour passed off peacefully after a huge security operation but other teams will be reluctant to follow their example in the event of fresh attacks.
Shrinking space
With around 160 million people living in a space of a little over 55,000 square miles, Bangladesh is one of the worlds most densely-populated nations and open spaces are becoming increasingly scarce. In the capital Dhaka, where land prices have sky-rocketed amid a massive population growth, playing grounds are disappearing at an alarming rate to make way for high-rise apartment blocks. The impact is already being felt on the Test team with pace bowler Taskin Ahmed the only player in the current squad from Dhaka, a city of around 15 million people.
First-class, second-rate
While few doubt Bangladesh has the talent, its poor first-class structure means the step-up to international cricket is sometimes simply too great for many players. Bangladesh has two four-day competitions but they lack a fixed place in the calendar and matches are often one-sided affairs, treated by internationals as little more than a glorified net. Batsmen have frequently scored double centuries only to find themselves bowled out cheaply the next week in a Test match. Crowds are next to non-existent while standards of umpiring are often dubious.
Off the pace
Bangladesh has had its share of quality spinners, with current internationals Shakib Al Hasan and the young Mehedi Hasan keeping up a proud tradition. But to win Tests, teams need pace -- something which Bangladesh have lacked. There were high hopes for Mashrafe Mortaza after he burst onto the scene in 2001 but he faded after a series of knee injuries. Fans now fear history is repeating itself with the latest starlets Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed enduring long spells on the sidelines.
Mustafizur has been able to play just three Tests since his debut in 2015 and fitness concerns prevented Taskin from making his debut until the recent tour to New Zealand. The board has in recent years appointed ex-Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak and West Indies great Courtney Walsh to nurture quickies, but their efforts are yet to bear fruit. AFP

Further trial into case against Gammanpila fixed for March 16
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday denied the claims and suggestions made by defence that he was giving false evidence in Court.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were yesterday present before Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 20 million, following his alleged fraudulent share transaction that had taken place in 2000.
On one occasion, the witness accepted a suggestion made by defence counsel Savindra Fernando PC that he never came to Sri Lanka between 1992 and 2015 in fear of his life, following information he received from Gammanpila that the son of Sydney Jayasinghe was conspiring to kill him. However, the defence tabled in Court a document to prove the fact that Australian businessman Shaddick had come to Sri Lanka in 1996 to sign as an attesting witness of the wedding of Muditha Jayasinghe, a son of Sydney Jayasinghe.
Witness Shaddick further said yesterday that he never had signed a document executing a Power-of-Attorney to Udaya Gammanpila. Meanwhile, the defence counsel Jayantha Weerasing PC informed Court that his client Gammanpila was not having in his possession the original Power-of-Attorney in question. Further trial was fixed for March 16.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera. The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent Power-of-Attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick.
The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail. Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC and Senior Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for MP Gammanpila.

Sage Valluvar Priest of thy lowly clan, No tongue repeats, No speech reveals thy Name
Yet,all things changing dieth not thy fame, For thou art band of Universal man.
This tribute by the Rev. Dr.G.U.Pope D.D one of the best known English born Tamil scholars, was written more than a hundred years ago. Valluvar, is more popularly known as Thiruvalluvar. But very little is known about him. His immortal work the Kural-more popularly called the Thirukkural does not reveal anything about the author or when it was written. The date of the work is uncertain. But it is believed it was written in the 1st century A.D.
Valluvar was not his name but it was the name of the priest of the lowly castle. The kural is not the name of the book. Kural in Tamil means a short poem composed in a very difficult meter. Thiru means holy. No other work has been written by Valluvar.
The Kural is a master piece and an exquisite composition and has survived unchanged for nearly 2000 years. The work itself is in three parts and contain 133 chapters. Each chapter has ten two line verses. Together making 1330 verses. The first part deals with virtue and apart from an introduction it deals with domestic virtue.
The 1st part opens with the words A leads letters, ancient Lord, leads and lords the ensure world.
The Thirukkural is not a religious work but essentially an ethical work. It seeks to teach mankind how to lead a good life. The second part is entitled wealth and deals with royalty, state, cabinet, politics, alliance and other miscellaneous matters. The third part is entitled Love, and deals with secret marriage life.
It is not possible to reproduce in a short article some of the poets exquisite verses, but a selection is reproduced below but it is neither comprehensive nor is it a judicious selection.
So little is known about Thiruvalluvars life and work that legends have grown that legends have grown around him. Not all of them are acceptable. Valluvar was married to Vasuki. It was a happy marriage. Vasuki obeyed her husband, and fulfilled his slightest wish.
It is told that a venerable person came to Valluvars house and asked which is better. A married life or the life of a lonely hermit. The sage made no reply, but invited the visitor to stay with him. The visitor during his stay, was able to see for himself how Vasuki looked after the house and her husband.
The visitor concluded. If such a wife can be had it is wise to marry; if not the monastic state is better. So without the sage answering the visitors question the visitor had been enlightened.
Thiruvalluvar was a weaver by profession and he bought his thread from a merchant Elelasingan, who became a faithful disciple of Valluvar. It is claimed that this Elelasingan was the 6th generation descendent of the one the famed Tamil Kings.

Green grass of NZ delights South Africa
Wellington: After four days of rain the covers were peeled off the Basin Reserve wicket on Tuesday and to South Africa's delight it was green ahead of the second Test against New Zealand.
The greener the better in Wellington has been New Zealand's mantra in the past.
But their tone has been softened for the second Test starting Thursday, given the ruthlessness of South Africa's pace trio Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel.
New Zealand's situation is not helped by the loss of batsman Ross Taylor and injury concerns surrounding fast bowler Trent Boult who has until Wednesday evening to prove his fitness.
"I don't think ideally we want to play South Africa on a seamer friendly surface," said coach Mike Hesson, who was satisfied with the efforts of his twin-spin attack in the first Test where New Zealand had a chance until rain ensured a frustrating draw on the final day. South African captain Faf du Plessis, however, could barely contain his excitement at the state of the wicket and New Zealand's injury woes.
"We've been surprised. New Zealand conditions have changed since we were last here," he said, with South Africa confirming they were bringing in an exta spinner -- Dane Piedt -- for the third Test in Hamilton next week.
But with the Basin Reserve having it's traditional green cover, du Plessis said his seamers were looking forward to the second Test. The loss of Taylor means captain Kane Williamson is New Zealand's sole batting figurehead and "if we get through him we can put some real pressure on their batters".
"So there's excitement for our seamers and they will enjoy that, but so will New Zealand, they've got a good seam attack depending on Boult's fitness," added the South African skipper.
- Inexperienced line-up -
The captain who wins the toss is expected to bowl which puts the odds in South Africa's favour after they called correctly in all five one-day internationals and the first Test. New Zealand have replaced the injured Taylor with 33-year-old Neil Broom who did not have the happiest time in the one-day series against South Africa. In three innings he had scores of two, two, and a duck and was caught around the wicket at square leg, point and in the slips.
But, although Broom has yet to play a Test, Hesson believes he has enough experience to make the grade.
"We have quite an inexperienced batting line up, so we were keen to have somebody who had plenty of playing experience, somebody who played pace well and obviously Neil has the advantage of seeing a bit of South Africa earlier on," he said. Tim Southee is expected to return after being sidelined to make way for an extra spinner in the opening Test at Dunedin, and Matt Henry has been added to the squad and is likely to play if Boult is ruled out. Fine weather is forecast throughout the second Test apart from Saturday when strong southerly winds and some rain are expected. AFP

To heal the world
Our people congregate in religious shrines. They are instructed, taught, advised, exhorted and counseled by religious leaders. The people listen to them, heed their advice and follow their guidance. The religious leaders who are most listened to are those who relate to people, have a sympathetic ear, who give just and unbiased advice appropriate to the person and/or the situation.
As their wise counsels are invariably followed they are also influential and most respected. They bring about tranquility and serenity into an atmosphere that could turn out to be problematic and confusing. Instead their calm intervention diffuses deep sorrow, brings about community reconciliation, peace and unity in diversity. It is indeed their mission; they have given themselves to an obligation of living with equanimity and bringing good order and serenity to the community as a natural outcome of their own way of life. Religious leaders are able to promote reconciliation, unity and peace in the present day Sri Lankan society; they are indeed in a very advantageous position to do so.
Failure of religions or religious leaders
Unfortunately some religious leaders abdicate and forfeit their exalted position. That is because they themselves, given over to weaker tendencies and contrary to the tenor of their religious status, get entangled in a web of conflicting loyalties. Their sense of truth and justice and the need to uphold genuine respect for the dignity and respect due to all the people of the land and of the world and connect to them all fraternally as elder fellow members of the human family irrespective of their ethnicity, caste, creed and gender, are not strongly grounded in them.
This is also because of their non adherence to their fundamental religious convictions. Their human proclivities are compounded by partisan political propensities and personal loyalties in such a manner as to overpower and subdue their spiritual inclinations. They create confusion. In the place or situation where there should be enlightenment, a darkness comes to prevail due to misunderstanding. This is the reason why at the national level, the number of religious leaders of an impeccable and strong character are few.
It is a sad fact that during the past six decades, in Sri Lanka, religious leaders have tended to be wanting in upholding the very tenets they were expected to defend. The failure of religious leaders was interpreted as a failure of religions rather than their leaders not fulfilling their due role in society.
As a result religious leaders have not only been disregarded, they are held in veiled contempt by the people who do not at times hesitate to show in various ways their dissonance with such religious leaders or demonstrate even their contempt of them openly in various ways. They have lost their credibility.
It should never be so. The experience of Sri Lanka since Independence, the problems she has encountered which the secular leaders have badly handled, the traumas the people have gone through as a result, the sufferings they have endured, the tragedies they have faced, the losses to life and property they have suffered, should have made the religious leaders socially sensitive, anxious and spiritually wiser than the rest of those in public life.
Building mutual trust
The people always live in an actual socio-economic, religio-cultural, political situation. In social and political reality the people were in  the creation of myopic, greedy and self-absorbed politicians  the Religious Leaders themselves lost clarity of vision, failed to correctly understand the social confusion created by politicians implementing their contradictory political ideologies. They did not have the courage to call them to sanity or insist on appropriate solutions.
Today the various circumstances seem to have compelled the Religious Leaders to meet one another and come to a better understanding than before. As recent events have shown, they are ready and able to come together, exchange views and engage in dialogue. They are able to acknowledge the right of independent existence and identity of the different ethnic and religious communities and accord to each other mutual respect.
There is a growing concern among them for the marginalized, the voiceless and the poor of whatever community they belong to. They wish to ensure that there is freedom and space for human solidarity and fraternity to grow. And all are concerned about the social relationships and human rights that should animate the national community. If they were to come together more often and open themselves to one another frankly and sincerely, their mutual comprehension will be beneficial to all the people of Sri Lanka.
It is a great blessing that courageous Religious Leaders who speak for all the people are not altogether absent in our Land. Their coming together will certainly build up mutual trust and respect. The more they renounce their sense of self and adhere to the noblest principles of religion, they become embodiments of reason and wisdom and examples of virtuous living. They will be able to summon other leaders in society to work together for the well being and common good of all.
They could challenge them to integrity, candor and transparency of life, never to usurp political power to trample on the human dignity of any of the citizens of this Country and never to amass wealth by anti-social means to the detriment of the people the majority of whom are humble workers and wage earners.
If the religious leaders transcend partisan political affiliations and work for truth, justice and uphold human dignity, honour, autonomy, fraternity and solidarity, they would make an enormous contribution to bring about a highly acceptable level of social harmony and community bonding in Sri Lanka. It is necessary to transform peoples lives from a chaotic, miserable and meaningless one to a contented, happy and meaningful one. This is the aspiration of all the people and the Religious Leaders should be able to fulfill them.

## Title: Historic day for Bangladesh cricket

Historic day for Bangladesh cricket
Playing 100 Test matches for any country is a milestone achievement and Bangladesh the youngest Test playing nation having gained full member entry into the ICC in 1999 will mark that occasion when they play Sri Lanka in the second Test starting at the historic venue  the P Sara Oval today.
It is coincidence that such an important Test match is taking place at a venue which has a history from time immemorial. It was at the P Sara Oval that Sri Lanka played their inaugural Test against England in February 1982 and three years later recorded their maiden Test win over India.
Bangladesh already 0-1 down in the two-match series will have an uphill task trying to beat a Sri Lankan team which has bounced back from their heavy defeats in South Africa.
There were doubts before the start of the Galle Test how the Lankan team would recover from their 0-3 beating in South Africa where they were totally outplayed in all departments. But they have managed to get their act together and hit the winning trail again with their comprehensive win at Galle.
The biggest mental factor is winning for a team and this team has it, said Sri Lankas acting skipper Rangana Herath.
We have won against Australia and now Bangladesh at home that is the mental feeling we have. In a team even if a player doesnt contribute much if he exudes confidence in himself and of his team mates we can keep going forward.
I am so happy that everybody contributed, the confidence level is high I am sure the boys will come back with the same mind set for this Test also.
Asked whether Sri Lanka would spoil Bangladeshs 100th Test match party, Herath responded by saying, From our side this is just another Test match. We are planning to have a good winning mindset and a good Test match. Its a good milestone for the Bangladesh players. I dont think they will be under much pressure if they play their brand of cricket.
As a member of the Tamil Union club Herath has first hand information on the behavior of the Oval pitch. Historically at the Oval there is a bit of bounce for the fast bowlers.
I dont know whether this wicket will live upto that. I have played here a lot and my experience with the wicket is that towards the fourth and fifth days it will take spin, said Herath.
Sri Lanka who were successfully playing five specialist bowlers at Galle have not finalized their 11 yet according to Herath and if one goes by the old dictum you dont change a winning combination. Whether Sri Lanka will stick to that is a matter of conjecture. Even for Bangladesh they will also have some firsthand information on the pitch as their coach Chandika Hathurusingha began and ended his first-class cricket career at Tamil Union.
The wicket looks pretty good. Here traditionally there is something for the quicks early on, but after that there will probably plenty of help for the spinners also, said Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim.
The wicket looks pretty dry as well so hopefully the spinners will come into play. We have spinners and quicks in our squad, so whatever we decide I think we need to bowl in the right areas more often than not, then the results will come.
We couldnt even play to half of our ability in Galle, which was very disappointing. We have to try to get the result in our favour in Colombo. We have to take every chance that comes our way. We werent sticking to the basics, so we must improve on those things. We now have some idea about the Sri Lankan bowling attack, so we just have to improve our basics, he said.
Commenting on his countrys 100th Test match Mushfiqur said, This is a historic moment for Bangladesh cricket, and a big moment for me as the captain. I was in Class 7 in BKSP (Bangladesh Institute of Sports) when we played our inaugural Test match in 2000. I have memories of that game. From that point, the dream began to grow about hoping to play Test one day.
We may not have achieved as much in the last 16 years, but to be honest we have progressed and improved in the last two and a half years. We dont get to play a lot of Tests each year; sometimes we go through months of break. We are hoping that this year will be better for us despite not starting well.
Mushfiqur was happy that in Bangladesh now there is expectation for them to win every Test, ODI or T20I.
There are expectations about every Test. Bangladesh cricket is in such a stage that they are expected to win a Test, ODI or T20. This itself is a big achievement, which inspires the players to give their best in the field. We didnt fulfill our expectations in the last game but we will give our best in the next game. Our main target will be to play consistently, Mushfiqur said.
The bottom line is the fickle weather could play a crucial part in deciding the fate of Bangladeshs 100th Test.

How to be like Ernest Hemingway
The American novelist Ernest Hemingway is considered as the greatest writer of the 20th century. Hemingway explored universal themes such as life, love and death. His name was a synonym for an approach to life characterized by action, courage, physical prowess, stamina, violence, independence, and above all "grace under pressure (Yalom & Yalom, 1971). Hemingway brought a revolution in style and was a keen observer of the contemporary world and human nature (Dieguez, 2010). With his influential work Ernest Hemingway became the the archetypal American writer. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.
Hemingway stated that his stories emerged out of lived experiences. According to Dieguez (2010) most of his writings have a quasi-autobiographical quality, which allowed many commentators to draw comparisons between his personality and his art. Hemingways life was on constant move and adventure.
During the World War One Hemingway served as an ambulance driver and wounded in 1918. He witnessed the gruesome realities of combat in the World War One. In addition He worked as a war correspondent during the Spanish civil war. His War experiences inspired him to write his great novel A Farewell to Arms. His other works The Sun Also Rises"(1926), "For Whom the Bell Tolls" (1940) and "The Old Man and the Sea"(1952) became greatest novels of all time.
Throughout his career, Hemingway pinpoints the importance of witnessing and experiencing war on a writer. As described by Putnam no American writer is more associated with writing about war in the early 20th century than Ernest Hemingway. He experienced it firsthand, wrote dispatches from innumerable front lines, and used war as a backdrop for many of his most memorable works. In Ernest Hemingways short story, Soldiers Home he narrates a total alienation experienced by a soldier.
Hemingway's first novel, The Sun Also Rises became an an iconic modernist novel. It was about a lost generation  a group of disillusioned American expatriate writers live a dissolute, hedonistic lifestyle. The Sun Also Rises contained autobiographical elements from Hemingway's own life and it became the testimony of the postwar disillusionment of his generation. The term Lost Generation reflects the disillusioned, hopeless attitude the war generated.
A Farewell to Arms was based on his war experiences. In this classic novel Hemingway concludes: The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.
Perhaps one of the most interesting descriptions of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was that presented in the short story Soldiers Home, which was written by Ernest Hemingway following his return to the United States after serving in the Italian army during World War I. This short story can be read as an effort to identify, attest to, organize, and communicate the experience of a traumatized soldier which, on the evidence, is what Hemingway himself was. War experiences transformed the great writer. In later years a number of PTSD related symptoms could be identified from Hemingway.
Hemingway was fascinated, preoccupied, and obsessed with war, murder, big-game hunting, bullfighting, death, and suicide (Craig, 1995). In 1925, Ernest Hemingway wrote to F. Scott Fitzgerald that the reason you are so sore you missed the war is because the war is the best subject of all. It groups the maximum of material and speeds up the action and brings out all sorts of stuff that normally you have to wait a lifetime to get (Vernon, 2016). According to the Psychiatrist and the Psychoanalyst Lawrence Kubie Hemingway's works contained two types of males, a destructive male and a kind father-figure who symbolically represents the threat of passive homosexuality. The latter figure inspires both love and hate. The main struggle, then, is against both homosexual seduction and fear of father through castration.

How will Bangladesh fare : Only three nations have won their 100th Test
Bangladesh still the youngest Test playing nation and the last to gain full ICC membership 18 years ago will celebrate their 100th Test match when they take on Sri Lanka in the second Test at the P Sara Oval from today.
Not many countries have been successful at winning their 100th Test match and whether Bangladesh can fall into that exclusive category will be known over the next five days.
Of the ten Test playing nations only three have won their 100th Test match  Australia, West Indies and Pakistan whereas five countries have lost  England, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. New Zealand is the only country to draw their 100th Test.
ENGLAND
Wasim Akram (Pakistan)
England was the first country to get to the 100th Test match mark when they played Australia in the Ashes Test of 1909 at Headingley, Leeds. In a low scoring Test Australia finished victorious by 126 runs after three days. Australia were dismissed for 188 with slow left-armer Wilfred Rhodes taking 4 wickets for 38 and England finished the first day strongly placed at 88-2. The next day England advanced to 137-2 following a 106-run liaison between John Tyldesley (55) and John Sharp (61) but Charles Macartney with his slow left-arm bowling accounted for seven wickets as England collapsed to 182 handing Australia an unlikely lead of six runs. In their second essay Australia managed 207 recovering from 127-7 with strong batting by the tail. This left England with the task of making 214 for victory, but Macartney in the company of his new ball partner Tibby Cotter ran through the England second innings for 87 which remains their lowest total in a Headingley Test. Macartney achieved his best innings and match analysis in Test matches. England suffered a setback when their most attacking batsman Gilbert Jessop strained his back on the first day and was unable to bat in either innings.
Scores: Australia 188 (SE Gregory 46, VS Ransford 45, W Bardsley 30, W Rhodes 4/38) and 207 (MA Noble 31, WW Armstrong 45, H Carter 30, SF Barnes 6/63) beat England 182 (JT Tyldesley 55, J Sharp 61, CG Macartney 7/58) and 87 (JB Hobbs 30, A Cotter 5/38, CG Macartney 4/27) by 126 runs.
AUSTRALIA
Australias 100th Test was made memorable by right-arm leg-break bowler Jimmy Matthews creating a unique Test record by taking a hat-trick in each innings  both instances being on the second day as they crushed South Africa by an innings and 88 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester in 1912. The Test was part of the Triangular tournament which also involved England. Boosted by centuries from Charles Kelleway (114) and Warren Bardsley (121) who figured in a third wicket stand of 202 Australia amassed 448 batting first. South Africa replied with 265 recovering from 54-4 largely to an unbeaten century from George Faulkner. Forced to follow-on South Africa crumbled in a heap to be shot out for 95 with Kelleway following his century with a five-wicket innings haul. Tom Ward the South African wicket-keeper and no. 11 bagged a king pair being the third victim of both hat-tricks by Matthews.
Scores: Australia 448 (CB Jennings 32, C Kelleway 114, W Bardsley 121, SE Gregory 37, TJ Matthews 49 n.o., WJ Whitty 33, SJ Pegler 6/105, RO Shwartz 3/142) beat South Africa 265 (GA Faulkner 122 n.o., R Beaumont 31, WJ Whitty 5/55, TJ Matthews 3/16) and 95 (C Kelleway 5/33, TJ Matthews 3/38) by an inns & 88 runs.
SOUTH AFRICA
South Africas 100th Test was highlighted by a successful run chase by England who won with just one minute of play remaining at Port Elizabeth in 1949. Set 172 runs to win in 85 minutes England got off to a pulsating start with Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook setting the tone with 58 in 27 minutes. The England 100 arrived in 53 minutes but wickets fell rapidly before Jack Crapp won the match by taking 10 runs off three successive balls in Tufty Manns final over. Earlier wicket-keeper Billy Wade (South Africa) and England captain George Mann (England) had completed their only Test centuries of their careers. Opener Bruce Mitchell who played in 42 consecutive Tests for South Africa ended his career scoring 99 and 56.
Scores: South Africa 379 (B Mitchell 99, AD Nourse 73, WW Wade 125, AV Bedser 4/61, C Gladwin 3/70, RO Jenkins 3/53) and 187-3 decl (Mitchell 56, EAB Rowan 37, AD Nourse 30 n.o., Wade 34 n.o.) lost to England 395 (L Hutton 46, C Washbrook 36, DCS Compton 49, FG Mann 136 n.o., AV Bedser 33, AMB Rowan 5/167, NBF Mann 3/95) and 174-7 (Hutton 32, Washbrook 40, Compton 42, Rowan 3/65, Mann 4/65) by 3 wickets.
WEST INDIES
West Indies first home win against Australia (which later led them to win the first rubber against them) was achieved in their 100th Test played at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica in 1965. Captaining West Indies for the first time Sir Garfield Sobers took his 100th Test wicket when he dismissed Peter Philpott and became the first player to complete a double of 4000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests.
Scores: West Indies 239 (CC Hunte 41, BF Butcher 39, G St A Sobers 30, AA White 57 n.o., LC Mayne 4/43) and 373 (Hunte 81, Butcher 71, JS Solomon 76, JL Hendricks 30, Mayne 4/56, PI Philpott 4/109) beat Australia 217 (NC ONeill 40, NJN Hawke 45 n.o., WW Hall 5/60) and 216 (BC Booth 56, Hawke 33, Hall 4/45) by 179 runs.
INDIA
England make a clean sweep of the series 3-0 when they beat India playing their 100th Test by 132 runs at Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1967, The Test came to an end on the third day after 20 wickets had fallen on the second day.
Scores: England 298 (C Milburn 40, KF Barrington 75, JT Murray 77, BS Chandrasekhar 3/94, EAS Prasanna 3/51) and 203 (DL Amiss 45, DB Close 47, Chandrasekhar 3/43, Prasanna 4/60) beat India 92 (DJ Brown 3/17, RNS Hobbs 3/25) and 277 (BK Kunderan 33, AL Wadekar 70, Nawab of Pataudi jnr 47, R Illingworth 4/92, DB Close 4/68) by 132 runs.
NEW ZEALAND
The only low innings of this high scoring Test match played at Bridgetown, Barbados in 1972 which happened to be New Zealands 100th was in West Indies first innings when they were shot out for 133 with all-rounder Bruce Taylor returning career best figure of 7 for 74. New Zealand boosted by a fourth wicket partnership of 175 between Bevan Congdon (175) and Brian Hastings (105) went onto score 422. West Indies lost half their side for 171 and New Zealand smelt a historic victory but magnificent sixth wicket stand of 254 in 363 minutes by Charlie Davis (183) and Sir Garfield Sobers (142) saved West Indies from defeat.
Scores: West Indies 133 (G St A Sobers35, TM Findlay 44 n.o., BR Taylor 7/74) and 564-8 (MC Carew 45, LG Rowe 51, CA Davis 183, Sobers 142, DAJ Holford 50) drew with New Zealand 422 (BE Congdon 126, BF Hastings 105, GE Vivian 38, VA Holder 3/91, G St A Sobers 4/64)
PAKISTAN
Pakistan celebrated their 100th Test with a most improbable win with fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz producing one of the greatest spells of bowling Test cricket seven wickets for one run in 33 balls. Australia needed 71 runs to win with seven wickets in hand but Sarfraz had other ideas as he grabbed all those wickets in a sensational spell that saw him return figures of 9 for 86 and bowl Pakistan to a71 runs win at Melbourne in 1979. Sarfraz became the first bowler to take nine wickets in an innings for Pakistan.
Scores: Pakistan 196 (Mushtaq Mohammad 36, Imran Khan 33, Sarfraz Nawaz 35, RM Hogg 4/49, AG Hurst 3/55) and 353-9 decl (Majid Khan 108, Zaheer Abbas 59, Asif Iqbal 44, Hogg 3/75, Hurst 3/115) beat Australia 168 (DF Whatmore 43, Imran Khan 4/26) and 310 (AMJ Hilditch 62, AR Border 105, KJ Hughes 84, Sarfraz Nawaz 9/86) by 71 runs.
SRI LANKA
Wasim Akram ruined Sri Lankas 100th Test with an outstanding all-round display at the SSC grounds in 2001 where Pakistan won by five wickets. Before his match-winning spell Wasim figured in a last wicket stand of 90 off 95 balls with Arshad Khan (9 n.o.) to lift Pakistan from 176-9 to 266 in reply to Sri Lankas first innings of 273. Wasims contribution was a hard hit 78. In the Lankan second innings Wasim destroyed the batting for 123 with a five-wicket haul that left Pakistan with a moderate target of 131 to chase which they did successfully. Arjuna Ranatunga became the only player in history to appear both in his countrys inaugural and 100th Tests.
Scores: Sri Lanka 273 (MS Atapattu 73, PA de Silva 30, DPM Jayawardene 77, Waqar Younis 3/50, Arshad Khan 4/62) and 123 (Atapattu 40, Wasim Akram 5/45, Arshad 3/30) lost to Pakistan 266 (Saeed Anwar 56, Moin Khan 47, Wasim Akram 78, M Muralitharan 5/115) and 131-5 (Mohammad Wasim 30, Younis Khan 32 n.o., Muralitharan 3/53) by 5 wickets.
ZIMBABWE
Graeme Cremer the Zimbabwe captain stuck it out for 175 balls and 121 dot balls to give his team hopes of saving their 100th Test played at Harare in 2016 but Sri Lanka dug deep into their reserves to secure a hard earned victory by 225 runs with 45 balls to spare. Cremers contribution in the Test was a maiden hundred and 43, while Sri Lanka who were dominant had three centurions Kusal Perera, Upul Tharanga and Dimuth Karunaratne.
Scores: Sri Lanka 537 (FDM Karunaratne 56, JK Silva 94, MDKJ Perera 110, BKG Mendis 34, WU Tharanga 110, DAS Gunaratne 54, AG Cremer 4-142) and 247 for 6 dec. (Karunaratne 110, DM de Silva 64, CT Mumba 4/50) beat Zimbabwe 373 (TMK Mawayo 45, H Masakadza 33, PJ Moor 79, AG Cremer 102, DT Tiripano 46, RAS Lakmal 3/69, HMRKB Herath 3/97) and 186 (Mawayo 37, SC Williams 40, Cremer 43, MDK Perera 3/34, Herath 3/38) by 225 runs.

## Title: Imaginary Walls

Imaginary Walls
The walls are everywhere. There are walls around our houses. Along the roads, around the religious places, in the cities, between countries, and at almost all the places where human habitations are walls stand. Another aspect is that people seem to have spent a great deal of their hard earned money on these structures. There is a mad rat race in the society to build walls. People are in an unending competition to build the tallest, most beautiful, most expensive, most modern wall around their properties. The story does not end there, their annual expenditure to colourwash them and keep them neat and tidy goes to thousands, if not millions of rupees.
The primary function of a wall is to enclose, divide, separate or protect something. Any philosopher, a religious leader, a great thinker, a scientist or any poet or dramatist has never recommended walls. If walls had been a need in the world for the existence of man, God would have created them with other creations. This preamble on walls compels me to think that walls are of no need to man. All the religious leaders expect us to coexist. The walls pose an insurmountable obstacle against such a mode of living. Thus, the pith of the matter is that it is high time for all the rulers, economists politicians and world leaders to pay their urgent attention to devote some time on this hitherto unexplored aspect. A wall-less world would be the panacea for most of our ills. Our national coffers would not go empty, but the construction industry would affect. Thousands of engineers would lose their careers. The contractors would come to the roads. They will trace the writer and make him maimed, in their wrath.
In order to save my skin, I take a U-turn and would like to draw the attention of the rational minded readers towards another kind of walls existing in the world. They are imaginary walls. No one can see or touch them, they are the ugliest walls I can ever imagine. All the spiritual leaders, saints and wise men have condemned them. They are the meanest. Yet, the unfathomable bitter truth is that almost all the people in every faith are adhered to them. Their cruel heart and mind dont allow them to escape from them. Once you are entangled to them it is inescapable. People are sentenced to life time imprisonment inside their own walls. But they are responsible for the crimes they do under this cover at the reckoning. The pink gate is ever closed to them.
These imaginary walls are
The wall between the rich and the poor. The caste system Religions Ethnicity Political parties So called social status  different social milieu Cultures Skin colour or complexion Language Culture
The above array is only a rough picture of walls that keep people separated. It is crystal clear that all these walls do irreparable damage to the dignity of man. In fact, it is infra dig for sensible peoples to uphold the oddities and foibles forever in the human society. It seems that man is devoid of sense and sensibility. Man has great expectations but his inner disposition does not trigger him to look forward.
Man is always mending these walls. He doesnt seem to have an earnest desire to be devoid of these ignoble character traits. The reader may find this as a diatribe by a frustrated character, but the writer is backed substantial evidence from the tapestry of literature. Robert Frost, the twentieth century best American poet, was at the forefront who advocated this aspect of social inquiry-May his tribe increase!
His crusade was to initiate a global village where there are no walls, I mean a wall-less world in which every member who belongs to specific castes, religions, culture, skin colours, political parties, languages, etc, this iconic piece of poetry composed by the aforementioned poet of universal acclaim .His poetic theory is A poem should begin with delight and end in wisdom The celebrated first line of this poem titled MENDING WALL is as follows,
Something there is that doesnt like a wall
Nature is this something. Man makes walls anywhere and everywhere as he wants, he does it in an arbitrary manner. He seems to think that nature is his own property. But according to the Red Indian chief Seattle, man is only one thread of nature. Man is not the sole owner of nature. Nature belongs to flora and fauna, avifauna and all the other infinitesimal creatures. Man proposes and God disposes. Nature topples the man-made walls by sending huge roots beneath the walls. Liquid formation and the swelling process of the roots complete the breaking down process of the walls. When these walls are broken in that way at the ground level, the sunlight heats the upper part of the wall. The huge stones of the upper part fall to the ground. In addition to this physical process, the hunters speed up the breaking process. Huge gaps of the wall invite animals and people who need easy access and the gaps become wide. Mending becomes a necessity. In this light, people also mend their imaginary walls of miscellaneous nature through ignorance. The irony is that, in agricultural communities they mend their walls in a particular season, but man mends his imaginary walls of separation all the time. Communal riots, ethnic crises, religious forays, language issues, cultural disturbances, and fanning racial flames are some of the tips of the iceberg of the consequences of having imaginary walls. Unimaginable tragedy is that the iconic literary figures, young politicians, world acclaimed intellectuals of high caliber take the vanguard in such national calamities. They fuel any kind of unrest in the country to reach their short-sighted nefarious ends.

India-Australia resume bitter battle in Ranchi
Ranchi: Bitter rivals India and Australia resume their battle for Test supremacy Thursday in Ranchi at the start of the third match in a series that has already dragged relations close to breaking point. India won the second Test in Bangalore to leave the series tantalisingly poised at 1-1 but simmering tensions boiled over when the hosts' captain accused his opposite number of abusing the decision review system (DRS).
The International Cricket Council, which decided not to punish either Virat Kohli or Steve Smith over the flare-up, has called the two skippers together for clear-the-air talks ahead of the match. But former players on both sides have again been stirring things up ahead of Ranchi, a match in which India must avoid defeat if they want to win back the Border-Gavaskar trophy. Australia's hopes suffered a double blow last week when allrounder Mitchell Marsh and pace spearhead Mitchell Starc were ruled out of the last two Test with injuries. India's concerns are centred on the form of Kohli who has totalled just 40 runs in the series after scoring double centuries in the last four Test series. The meeting between Smith and Kohli was agreed to by their respective boards amid warnings the series risked degenerating into anarchy.
India were furious when Smith was spotted looking up at his dressing-room for guidance on whether to seek a review of the umpire's decision after being given out lbw -- a clear breach of the DRS rules. While Smith called it a one-off "brain fade", Kohli said it was not an isolated incident -- a claim the Australia board branded "outrageous". Former Australian skipper Ian Chappell has been among the critics of the ICC's softly-softly approach, saying things had been allowed to fester.
"It's been allowed to escalate over the years, and nobody is stepping in to stop it. It's going to cause a huge problem one day on the field," he wrote on the website of Australia's Channel Nine network. - AFP

Inside the entrepreneurial illuminati
Kishu Gomes wants to make a difference in this country. He wants all 21 million Sri Lankans to understand the value he is creating for this country. Outstanding Personalities features Kishu Gomes, a business leader who makes bridges and lights up the hearts of men and women. He leads by example and instills self -belief.
That concept of following role models should be eradicated from the world, Gomes insists, for everyone has a lesson to offer. I learn from beggars and people who sell vegetables in the market. Everyone has that which is inherent. There are things you cannot copy at all, Gomes elaborates.
Q. What does it take to make a great leader What does it take to make success
A. You have to be able to understand people. A leader is someone who will work with people. So one fundamental need or a requirement for a leader to be able to be successful, is his or her ability to be able to understand people. While it sounds very simple, a lot of people get this wrong. When you go to provide the leadership to people, without really understanding them, things can go wrong.
Q. How old were you when you became a force to be reckoned within the business world
A. I was known at the age of 19, when I was doing special events and sales promotions for Coca Cola. I joined Coca Cola at the age of 19 and in a few months time, I managed to make an impression through hard work and nothing else. And then that gave me the opportunity to head the Special Events and Sales Promotion Unit, which was to do with sponsorships and corporate communications at a very young age.
Of course today there are so many organizations but at that time you only had a handful of companies like Unilever, Coca Cola and Ceylon Tobacco. To be able to get to that level at a relatively young age was a big thing. So when you become the man for sponsorships especially working for a company like Coca Cola, you get to associate with all the top leaders in the country.
I remember even working with President Ranasinghe Premadasa in connection with Gam Udawa. He was a hands-on man. He used to know each and everyone who was involved in that operation. At that time I was a lovable character, very simple and could attract anyones attention. I had that kind of personality. So I was known. At that time although TV was there, it wasnt big business. But I used to be in the papers literally every other day with top people such as sports ministers, other ministers and the President himself. Big cricketers like Muralidharan received best school boy cricketer of the year, through the program I sponsored for Coca Cola. So I still have photos taken and then there was Marvan Attapattu. Those big guys were all part of my society. So I was known.
My decision to leave Coke and join Caltex was a big move and it was not a rational decision I made. It was an emotional decision because I only looked at a couple of things. And my wife said  why dont you give it a try So it was a decision of that nature.
I became the CEO/ Managing Director at the age of 35 years to become the youngest to head two truly multinational operations in Sri Lanka.
Chevron is a company that operates in 180 countries in the world, and this company was headed by expatriates before me. So I was only 35 and they decided to try me in that position. That was the big turning point, but I have always had that respect, fame and recognition from the society I was a part of. Chevron is a multinational company based in the US and is one of the largest energy companies in the world. During good times that company makes over 20 billion US dollars.
Q. How did you build your empire Chevron Lubricants
A. Chevron Lubricants PLC is a company in which public has 49 percent shareholdings. We are a publicly listed company. 59 percent is owned by Chevron Corporation US. We are into manufacturing and marketing of lubricants in Sri Lanka but we also send products to a few countries. We have an export model as well. Bangladesh and Maldives come under the purview of local operations. Apart from that we send products to a few other countries as well on and off.
But my role goes much beyond just the Sri Lankan operations, we have two companies. One is the company we talked about. Other than that, we have Chevron Ceylon Limited. I head both companies. Apart from that I have a leadership role to play for the entire Asian Pacific region. So I happen to be a leadership team member for the entire Asian Pacific region. I have another role within lubricants as an extended leadership team member.
I built the empire through good strategy and aggressive strategy execution and working with my capable people. I have always been very keen to get the best people from the market and I work with them and train them and coach and mentor them to get the best out of them. And then we pool in all the individual brilliance we build in people. That way you take the company forward.
Q. Who are the leaders you admire in history Why do you admire them and what lessons have you learnt from them
A. I learn from not only leaders. I learn from every single human being. I dont believe in looking at successful people and just copying them. Just because someone is successful dont think that you can be the same by copying that person or you can achieve the same level of success. The concept of following role models should be eradicated from the world. I learn from beggars and people who sell vegetables in the market. Everyone has that which is inherent. There are things you cannot copy at all. Every single individual has a mix of skills and talents. It is humanly impossible to copy. It is good to learn from successful people but not to copy them as an individual. Also learn from every single human being you interact with and learn from every situation. Be authentic, unique and create your own profile.
Q. How did your school influence your life Did you display leadership qualities back then too
A. I was the National Hurdles Champion and Colombo district hurdles champion for five consecutive years. I was a star even then. It gave me a lot of leadership skills. I received a lot of recognition for all my achievements. When you start enjoying such recognition, you get to a point where you cannot be without that feeling. And that is a feeling you want to keep maintaining. So you have to keep working very hard. You have to do things differently and you have to change and develop commitment and dedication. So these attributes I was able to develop in me, made me the man I am. Today I work for recognition and nothing else. And that is what I tell people. Because if you work for recognition, the rest will fall in place.
Q. What is your message to any young boy or girl
A. Get your plan in place. Use your head more than your body. Mind before your body. Not body before your mind. It is all about getting the right strategy in place. And then supporting your strategy with your body which is the execution part of it. And that will give you the results you want. Most Sri Lankans, without spending enough time strategizing or brain storming or coming out with the right action plan, without having the right plan in place, just start executing. You will have an outcome but that outcome is not aligned with what you want to achieve. Because you have not got the plan in place.
Q. What do you count as your achievements What are the milestones in your life
A. Your success is measured through the value you create for your stakeholders. It is the value that you as an individual or as an organization being able to deliver to your stakeholders. It is not what you achieve for yourself. So that is what I see as being your delivery or your achievements. As a business, we have a business model in which it creates immense value to the country.
Unlike in other multinational organizations, it is only Sri Lankans who work here. I dont have a single expatriate working here. Probably the only multinational company that does not have a single expatriate. And I am very pleased about it. When an expatriate CEO comes to Sri Lanka from outside, he or she will take anything between 5 million to 10 million rupees a month. And I dont think that is helping the countrys economy.
We export housewives, carpenters, plummers, drivers and unskilled labor and each one will bring in just Rs. 40,000  50,000. So from that perspective as a multinational company employing only Sri Lankans, is a big thing for the country. Not only does it give economic value, it also sends the right signals to the rest of the business world to say you can do very well with just Sri Lankans.
As I told you before we are exporting products to countries. As and when we get orders we supply as well. We bring in foreign currency. We contribute over three billion rupees to the government coffers on an annual basis. We also create indirect employment. In every sense we create value to the country. We touch the hearts and minds of the fisher-folk and farmers. Sri Lanka Railways and Sri Lanka Transport Board are among our biggest customers.

'Joint Male Lanka promotion need of the day'
Veteran travel agent, Ravi Jasingha who had been promoting both Sri Lanka and Maldives for the past three decades from Italy said that today a joint Male Lanka promotion would be more successful.
The two neighboring countries having good political and economic ties for over 100 years and now a joint tourism marketing campaign would be more effective rather than both countries doing it alone.
The two countries are separated by just 50 minutes of flying time and there are nearly 20 flights per day between the two destinations. He said that from a point of view of a traveler he or she would get more value for money if the sandy white calm beaches of the Maldives are offered to them for few nights and then the rich bio diversity and culture and adventure of Sri Lanka offered to them later. The best package that can be offered is to fly to Maldives and then fly out from Colombo. He said that a veteran hotelier Paddy Withana is now heading Sri Lanka Tourism and this is a great asset to the industry.
He can see the industry as well as the government prospective and this is great. He said that he had been promoting Universal Resorts in the Maldives and the response they get from the Maldivian government is very encouraging. ss

The Two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena directed the parties in the petition to file written submission in Court before April 5.
The Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that there is no evidence even up to now to prove that Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe has abandoned her Switzerland citizenship.
Deputy Solicitor General Janak de Silva appearing for the Attorney General informed Court that in terms of the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship.
The Deputy Solicitor General made this submission, when the writ petition filed by five residents of Galle district challenging the constitutionality of electing popular actress Geetha Kumarasinghe as a Member of Parliament, since she holds duel citizenship, was taken up for inquiry. The petitioners had sought an order of writ of Quo Warranto declaring that MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioners N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L.

Ranasinghe Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, Prof. Vishwa Warnapala the secretary of UPFA, Dhammika Dasanayake the Secretary General of Parliament as respondents.

The relevant provision stated that a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country shall not be qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament or to sit and vote in Parliament.

Lanka PropertyWeb.com, a leading property website in Sri Lanka recently celebrated its 10th anniversary by orchestrating the most successful property focused show in Sri Lanka to-date.
The show was held at Hilton Residences on February 17 and 18.

The event was launched under the patronage of Ministers Ravi Karunanayake, Patali Champika Ranwaka and Susil Premajayanth.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka commended the efforts of Lanka Property Web for organizing this venture with plans of promoting the property development and real estate market in the country in his speech and stated that more than 30% of the countrys economy comprises of the revenue from the real estate sector.
Calls for better regulation of agents and developers by Chairmen and CEOs from leading real estate companies were the highlight during one of the panel discussions held. The novel idea of having panel discussions and seminars during a property show in Sri Lanka showed that theres a big demand to gain knowledge about the industry by the public, with the discussions being oversubscribed and many having to be unfortunately turned away.
The two-day event saw industry experts gather to discuss about the future of the residential and commercial property market and also discuss about the latest status of mega development projects such as Port City and Megapolis.
Managing Director of Lanka Property Web thanked the Ministers for attending the opening despite their busy schedule and said that this was a big encouragement for the property industry of the county to see 3 ministers attending such a function.
He further stated that during the ten years of its formation the website has become the no.1 property website in the country in terms of ads and visits and they will be true to their founding vision in the years to come  to be the easiest and fastest place to find, sell and rent property in Sri Lanka.

The long song
A multi-talented performer, Harry Belafonte was born on March 1, 1927, in New York City. As a youth, he struggled with poverty and a turbulent family life. Belafonte's career took off with the film Carmen Jones (1954). Soon after, he had several hits"The Banana Boat Song (Day-O)" and "Jamaica Farewell." In addition to his acting and singing career, Belafonte worked as a champion for many social and political causes.
Early Years
The oldest son of Caribbean immigrants, Harry Belafonte spent his early years in New York City. . As a young child, Belafonte's parents divorced. As a boy, Belafonte was sent to Jamaica, his mother's native country, to live with relatives. There, he saw firsthand the oppression of blacks by the English authorities, which left a lasting impression on him.
Belafonte returned to New York City's Harlem neighborhood in 1939 to live with his mother. They struggled in poverty, and Belafonte was often cared for by others while his mother worked.
Career Beginnings
Belafonte decided that he wanted to become an actor. He studied drama at the Dramatic Workshop run by Erwin Piscator. His classmates included Marlon Brando, Walter Matthau and Rod Steiger. Belafonte appeared in numerous American Negro Theater productions, but he caught his first big break, singing for a class project. He impressed Monte Kay, who offered Belafonte the opportunity to perform at a jazz club called the Royal Roost. Backed by such talented musicians as Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, Belafonte became a popular act at the club. In 1949, he landed his first recording deal.
First Successes
By 1950, Belafonte had switched his musical style, dropping popular music from his repertoire in favor of folk. He became an avid student of traditional folk songs from around the world, and started appearing in such New York City folk clubs as the Village Vanguard.
The success of Carmen Jones made Belafonte a star, and soon he became a music sensation. After signing with RCA Victor Records, he released Calypso (1956), an album featuring his take on traditional Caribbean folk music. "The Banana Boat Song (Day-O)" proved to be a huge hit. More than just a popular tune, it also had a special meaning for Belafonte. "That song is a way of life," Belafonte later told The New York Times. "It's a song about my father, my mother, my uncles, the men and women who toil in the banana fields, the cane fields of Jamaica."
Calypso introduced America to a new genre of music, and became the first album to sell more than one million copies. Belafonte also worked with other folk artists, including Bob Dylan and the legendary Odetta. The pair sang their version of the traditional children's song "There's a Hole in My Bucket." In 1961, Belafonte had another big hit with "Jump in the Line."
Later Career
By the mid-1970s, Belafonte was no longer hitting the charts. On the big screen, Belafonte had some success with his collaborations with longtime friend Sidney Poitier, including 1972's Buck and the Preacher and 1974's Uptown Saturday Night. But despite this success, Belafonte decided to take a break from movie-making. He made numerous television appearances in the 1970s and 1980s, including a guest spot on The Muppet Show, on which he sang several of his most popular songs. Belafonte also worked with Marlo Thomas on the 1974 children's special Free To Be. . .You and Me.
Social Activism
Always outspoken, Belafonte found inspiration for his activism from such figures as singer Paul Robeson; writer and activist W. E. B. Du Bois; and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. In the 1950s, Belafonte met Martin Luther King, Jr. The pair became good friends, and Belafonte emerged as a strong voice for the civil rights movement. He provided financial backing for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Council and participated in numerous rallies and protests. Belafonte was with King when the civil rights leader gave his famous "I Have A Dream" speech in Washington, D.C., and visited with him days before King was assassinated in 1968.
During the mid-1960s, Belafonte also began supporting new African artists. He first met exiled South-African artist Miriam Makeba, known as Mama Africa, in London in 1958 and together they won Grammy for Best Folk Recording in 1966. He helped introduce her to international and to American audiences, as well as call attention to life under apartheid in South Africa. Belafonte extended his voice as an activist for civil rights at home in America and abroad.
In the 1980s, Belafonte led an effort to help people in Africa. He came up the idea of recording a song with other celebrities, which would be sold to raise funds to provide famine relief in Ethiopia. Written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie, "We Are the World" featured vocals by such music greats as Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen and Smokey Robinson. The song was released in 1985, raising millions of dollars and becoming an international hit.
Over the years, Belafonte has supported many other causes as well. In addition to his role as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF, he has campaigned to end the practice of apartheid in South Africa, and has spoken out against U.S. military actions in Iraq.
Belafonte was a great friend of the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. A film was made in Cuba named Sometimes I look into my life in honor of Belafontes service to mankind.
Influence in Sri Lanka
The influence of his songs are felt not merely among an English speaking audience. Sinhala Baila singer late M.S. Fernando composed a song Pol-Pol which is a kind of Sinhala parody of Coconut woman. Every calypso band in Sri Lanka includes Belafontes songs in their repertoire
The Guitar Association of Sri Lanka is working to stage a concert  A Tribute to Harry Belafonte on March 25 at Russian Centre, Colombo in recognition of this great entertainers contribution to music and to wish him happy and long life ahead. Many leading singers in Sri Lanka will participate in this event.

Lycamobile owned by a Sri Lankan first made an offer to buy the local company last year.
While the deal was about to the inked Sri Lanka Telecom Mobile came forward with an offer which was US$ 8 million more than the quoted price of Lycamobile. This offer was hotly challenged by the some of the board members saying it was not realistic.
This controversy led to one of the Mobitel board members resigning as well.Subsequently the deal was stalled.

Make life less difficult
The four broad dimensions in the world of Dr M Scott Peck, titled as The Road Less Travelled go as follows: discipline, love, growth and religion, grace. In these dimensions, Dr Scott Peck, a practising clinical psychologist and pyschotherapist has drawn material from his observations, readings, research, notes, clinical diagnosis and teachings over a period of four decades.
At the outset, Dr Scott Peck states that through psychotherapy it is possible to trace the etiology and development of a neurosis in exactitude and precision that is seldom matched elsewhere in medical sciences. The work is subtitled as the new psychology of love, traditional values, and spiritual growth.
According to Dr Scott Peck, it is possible to come to know exactly and precisely when and where and why an individual develops particular neurotic ions as laid down by the symptom or behaviour pattern. It is also possible to know with equal exactitude and precision, how, when and where and why a particular neurosis can be cured or has been healed. From a synoptic point of view the book titled as The Road Less Travelled is an many ways and a readable narrative on the human existence.
Subsequently each of the dimensions embody the interpretations as laid down by the writer cum psychologist M Scott Peck. As he notes in the preface, the ideas and interpretations as laid down herein presented stem for the most part, from his day to day clinical work with patients as they struggled to avoid or to gain ever great levels of maturity as a result the work embraces portions of actual case histories, confidential notes and dialogues that ensued between the patient and the doctor.
In many ways, the reader of my calibre will gain insights into creative modes of psychotherapy, which is noted not as a brief process, but an ongoing medico-theatric treatment. The work too resembles socio spiritual interpretations to individual social behaviour.
At the outset two assumptions according to the writer underlie the book. One is that the writer makes no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and achieving mental growth. They are one at the same. The other assumption is that the process is a complex, arduous and lifelong task. The work as a whole is not meant to be a pedagogical function for a special group of readers.
It is meant for the general reader who wishes to know of himself and how he exists in a social group. As such, the moving pages bring to light quite a number of human experiences of varying types that could be browsed as sensitive narratives resembling narrative poems, parables and dictums. At times reference is made to poems of Khalil Gibran and to evangelical hymns of America. They go to express the ways of living of human groups and the way the individuals, facial struggles to overcome barriers both mental and physical.
In the very first opening chapter the learned writer refers to the first of the four noble truths which the Buddha taught as life is suffering. The writer sets forth with a short sentence, life is difficult, and interpret it as a great truth. Then he states that it is a great truth because once we see the truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult and once we truly understand and accept it, then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is a difficult no longer matters.
In the introductory chapter, facts and situations pertaining to such matters as gratification, repertoire, escape from freedom, dedication to reality, openness to challenge, facts pertaining to depression, problem-solving processes, nature of neurosis and chamber disorders are brought to the forefront. They are further analysed and interpreted in the social dimension titled as love. This embraces topics such as love defined, falling in love, the myth of romantic love, ego boundaries, dependency, self sacrifice, is love a mere feeling, love as a discipline mystery of love etc. With a lot of human interest stories, the writer utilizes examples drawn from his case studies of young lovers as well as married ones who have faced issues pertaining to the subject.
As a writer, he seems to be fascinated by source material drawn from religious sources. For example clarifying the concept of the nature of power, the writer says:
It is a much misunderstood subject. One reason for the misunderstanding is that there are two kinds of power  political and spiritual religious mythology takes pains to draw the distinction between the two. Prior to the birth of the Buddha, for instance, the soothsayers informed his father that the Buddha would grow up to become the most powerful king in the land or else a poor man who would be the greatest spiritual leader the world ever known.
Either or, but not both.
Three significant case studies pertaining to the subject of psychotherapy are the case of Kathy, the case of Marcia and the case of Theodore. These case studies revolve round varying types of mental disorders caused as a result of varying circumstantial problems. Having laid down the solutions, the writer says that as human being grow in discipline and love and life experience their understanding of the world and their place in it naturally grows apace. Conversely, as people fail to grow in discipline, love and experience, so does their understanding fail to grow.
The writer emphasised that the understanding could be deemed as our religion. Since everyone has some understanding  some world view  no matter how limited or primitive or inaccurate  everyone has a religion of his or her own. This fact, not widely recognized, is of the utmost importance, as everyone has a religion.
The writer cum psychiatrist takes us form the mundane plane of living to a superior state of thinking on the various aspects of living. This view reaches a climax in the last dimension titled as grace. He attempts to introduce the aspect of the miracle of health. The miracle of the unconscious, the miracle of serendipity, the miracle of evolution in the light of new discoveries in traditional social values and its impact on spiritual growth valid in a new social order.
The writer attempts to interpret some of the salient aspects of mental illnesses via the age old Greek and Indian myths. One such example is drawn from the Greek source of the myth of Orestes and the Fairies giving reference to many a verse as laid down in Edith Hamiltons Mythology. The factor of the god-given punishment for a crime is interpreted via new discoveries in human behaviour patterns.
The closing lines of the learned writer go as follows:
The best therapist for one person may not be the best for another. Each person, therapist and patient is unique, and you must rely on your own unique intuitive judgment. Because there is some rush involved, I wish you luck!

Mangala takes on Mahinda: Shame on you, Mahinda, shame!
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has taken on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a strongly worded letter, accusing him of hypocricy and double standards:
'My initial inclination, when confronted with statements as inaccurate, inflammatory and erroneous as those contained in the media release issued by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, is to simply ignore them, as they would serve as the best self-indictment,' the Foreign Minister wrote. 'However, when a former head of state seeks to deliberately cause division in Sri Lankan society by misleading the public, especially after years of conflict in which all communities have suffered, I felt that it is a serious matter that deserves a comprehensive response.'
The full statement issued by the Foreign Minister is reproduced below:
On 13 March 2017 the former President of our country, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, issued a media release titled Constitutional and legal reforms to destroy the nation.
My initial inclination, when confronted with statements as inaccurate, inflammatory and erroneous as those contained in the media release issued by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, is to simply ignore them, as they would serve as the best self-indictment. However, when a former head of state seeks to deliberately cause division in Sri Lankan society by misleading the public, especially after years of conflict in which all communities have suffered, I felt that it is a serious matter that deserves a comprehensive response.
At the outset, it must be stressed that this first-ever National Unity Government in Sri Lankan history makes no apology for its noble attempts to take all possible action to bring Sri Lankans of all communities together. We make no apology for listening to all in our country, including our political opponents, and for engaging them in debate and discussion, rather than intimidating, isolating and persecuting them. We make no apology for restoring our countrys good name on the international stage to foster trade and prosperity for all in our country, rather than antagonizing our existing and potential partners. We make no apology for our policy of taking steps to combat corruption and root out the decay that has devoured precious state resources for far too long. We make no apology for considering a reform agenda to contribute to long-term peace and stability, because we know that Sri Lankans of all backgrounds desire reform, and yearn for durable peace, prosperity and stability.
I now turn to the erroneous claims made by the former President, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his media release. His entire argument hinges on the selective quotation and misreading of five key documents. So let me clarify what each of these documents represents:
(1) The UN Human Rights Council resolution of October 2015, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka:
The decision to co-sponsor resolution 30/1 was not imposed on us, and we will co-sponsor an extension of the timeline of this resolution by two years during the present 34th session of the Human Rights Council.
Why do we choose to do this Because we believe in enhancing, not restricting, the fundamental rights of all our citizens. We believe that we will overcome a painful past by examining it, not by hiding it. We are convinced that we need to put a stop to the cycles of recurring violence that have hitherto hindered our progress as a proud, united country and a united people. We know that truth, reparation and justice are essential, and further, that international jurisdiction over serious crimes only applies when national jurisdiction fails. We are declaring our vision in a resolution before the world to demonstrate that, as an independent, sovereign, and responsible nation, we are fully able to pursue accountability, with our national capacities, and in cooperation with our friends and partners in the international community, thus restoring credibility to our judicial processes and building capacity.
Let me be very clear: the transitional justice mechanisms to be implemented will not benefit one group or community above others, and will certainly not single out and target the armed forces. The former President manipulates the respect that the Sri Lankan people have for the armed forces to hide his own responsibilities. This is opportunistic, and especially ironic, coming from the person who imprisoned the commander who led the armed forces to victory.
Everyone paid a heavy price during the conflict, including our soldiers, with patriotic devotion. It is fitting that all of us Sri Lankans enjoy the benefits of reconciliation including the families of more than 5000 missing military personnel, and the families of missing policemen whose whereabouts will be sought by the Office on Missing Persons.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, especially as a lawyer, is very well aware that the issue of foreign judges is mere exaggeration on his part, and he does this on purpose to mislead the public. Let us not forget that it was under his leadership that multiple transitional justice processes were initiated, and international prosecutors were engaged. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) established by him engaged foreigners invited by him, and also nominated by Australia, Canada, the European Commission, UK, Japan, the Netherlands, USA, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and a Cypriot nominated by the Government of Sri Lanka. International prosecutors were also engaged in connection with the Paranagama Commission. Moreover, implementation of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution was for the first time made into an international pledge under his leadership through the much touted victory resolution S-11/1 sponsored by Sri Lanka and adopted on 27th May 2009 by the UN Human Rights Council. The resolution welcomed the reassurance given by the President of Sri Lanka that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution, as well as his commitment to a political solution with implementation of the thirteenth amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
The former President, driven by his arrogance and neglect of duties and responsibilities towards our citizens, dragged our country into the first ever external investigation of a situation, through the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL). President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, guided by wisdom, managed to regain trust and regain charge as an independent, sovereign and responsible nation, of the pursuit of reconciliation and accountability by national processes, shifting all action to the domestic front.
The former President chooses to hide these facts, and instead, interpret resolution 30/1 in a wildly unreasonable and illogical manner in order to drive fear into peoples minds and divide Sri Lankans in an attempt, as he mentioned to the Foreign Correspondents Association in December last year (2016), to realise his dream of returning to power.
(2) The reports of the six subcommittees appointed by the Steering Committee of the Constituent Assembly published in November 2016:
These reports are the result of deliberations in which all political parties have participated. Making these reports available to the public is a fundamental gesture of transparency and consultation unlike the action taken by the former President when he initiated the 18th amendment in hiding and in haste, causing serious damage to our countrys fundamental democratic credentials.
Many issues indicated in the subcommittee reports and beyond still remain to be discussed and resolved, and the reports certainly contain recommendations that may be supported by some, while being perceived as undesirable by others. Discussing these sensitive issues in the open, in a peaceful, calm, dignified and responsible manner, with a view to evolving a constitution required by a modern nation as stated by President Sirisena in Parliament on 9 January 2016, in a manner that all communities can support, is an endeavour that the National Unity Government is honoured to lead.
The people of Sri Lanka will ultimately judge the final proposals on their merits. They have that right guaranteed to them in the constitution which states that In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable.
Our pledge is to explain all proposals with clarity and honesty without distorting facts or perceptions with divisive rhetoric as Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa attempts to do.
(3) The Final Report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) published in January 2017:
The 11 civil society members of the CTF were appointed by the Prime Minister in January 2016, to seek the views of all Sri Lankans on the proposed reconciliation mechanisms, namely Truth-seeking mechanisms - an office on missing persons and a truth commission; a reparations system; and a judicial mechanism with a special prosecutor. The CTF is a fully Sri Lankan process, which received 7,306 submissions from all regions of the country, including citizens who in the recent past would have feared to express their opinions in public. The highest number of submissions was received from Batticaloa, Ampara and the Southern Province respectively.
We commend the CTF effort as a comprehensive and well-documented consultation process and report that incorporates views from all over Sri Lanka. The CTF process itself is a success in our view. It represents a departure from reconciliation mechanisms under Mr. Rajapaksas administration that lacked comprehensive public consultation and, as a result, lost effectiveness. This does not mean in any way that all the recommendations that have been made by the CTF will, or can be accommodated. What it does mean is that the views of our citizens from all communities and all geographic locations have been listened to, and have been heard, and that these views merit reflection and consideration. To pick and choose recommendations that may appear controversial to some, and use them to drive fear and create divisions among the public as Mr. Rajapaksa has done, is indeed diabolical.
(4) The European Union GSP+ process:
The National Unity Government, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is determined to recover the favourable trade status Sri Lanka enjoyed before the government led by President Rajapaksa squandered it.
Like any entity considering a partnership, the EU requires countries to fulfil certain requirements pertaining to the fundamental rights of their respective citizens. This is how the EU seeks to convince its corporations and 500 million consumers to establish a privileged trade alliance with Sri Lanka, investing in our prosperity. The elements that the EU considers are consistent with human rights, the rule of law and good governance are also those desired by the people of this country. The Sri Lankan people deserve to enjoy the highest standards of human rights. How can anyone in his or her right mind deny the citizens of our country, the right to enjoy the highest standards of fundamental rights and freedoms as recognised by the conventions to which we are a party Dont our citizens have a right to enjoy the rights that other human beings in the world enjoy Are our citizens less worthy or lesser humans As a responsible and caring Government, we are committed to creating the trade and economic conditions required to improve the lives of all Sri Lankans, and also establishing a positive and fruitful relationship with the EU that will help us to achieve that goal on behalf of all our citizens.
I would like to state here that, in recognition of the conducive conditions that prevail in Sri Lanka at present, including the restoration of the rule of law, the EU has decided to resume the Annual Investment Dialogue with Sri Lanka from this year.
(5) The replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) by a new counter terrorism law:
The PTA is an anachronistic piece of legislation from a conflict plagued past, which was misused by some to commit abuses for narrow political advantages. To suggest that replacing it with a modern law is unpatriotic is baseless. The security of all Sri Lankans including those who criticise the Government is something that the Government takes seriously.
A new Act will ensure that Sri Lankas security forces and intelligence officials can protect the State and the Public while respecting the physical and mental integrity of each citizen. If the former President wishes to imply that stopping the practice of torture is treasonous, we respectfully disagree. Torture has no place in modern, democratic Sri Lanka.
The National Unity Government will not govern by fear and lies. The National Unity Government makes no apologies for choosing the path of transparency, truth, justice, and reconciliation, upholding the dignity of all citizens. The future of our great nation will not have walls of fear and doubt that separate communities. Rather, it will be a bright, open and inclusive path that invites all to walk together side-by-side as equal citizens.
In conclusion, all I want to say to my old friend, Cabinet colleague and for a brief time BOSS is Shame on you, Mahinda, Shame!!!.

Milton Mallawarachchi: The voice of a thousand love letters
Victor Ratnayakes signature, some contend, come out most potently in his love songs. I am unfortunately not a musicologist, only a listener, but to my untrained ear, those love songs of his stand out powerfully from the sixties to the eighties. And its not just his voice or his songs: even in his film scores, you sense at once how powerfully romantic his vision of the world is.
The opening passages in Deno Dahak Atharin, Neela Bingu Kala, and Bambarindu Bambarindu and the music in Rajagedara Parawiyo and Sarungale build up not in gushes, but with a flow, so much so that his melodies moves along gracefully. Unlike Amaradeva, he isnt constrained by the raghadari tradition. Unlike Khemadasa, he doesnt let the liberatory thrust of the Western melody take over.
Of his songs, I consider Deno Dahak Atharin and Piyasalana Lihinayaku Se as defining that romantic vision of the world the man imbibed. With these two songs, you can infer how intense that vision was: so intense, in fact, that he has to be subtle about it to reveal his feelings. Deno Dahak Atharin is played out in a sequence from Sunil Ariyaratnes Vajira, with Nadeeka Gunasekaras character crying for her lover to return. Piyasalana Lihinayaku Se, on the other hand, is richer because it doesnt accompany a set of images.
Deno Dahak got Victor working with Nanda Malini. Piyasalana got him working with Milton Mallawarachchi. With the former, he was working with an established voice. With the latter, he was working with an as yet unrecognised star. For Milton, shunned as he was for being unmusical, had to cross some hard yards to get to where he stands today. This weeks star being Milton, this is hence a tribute to the man, his voice, and his life. He was born on April 7, 1944 and was educated at Ananda Shasthralaya in Kotte. While he hadnt aspired much for the music industry as a child, after leaving school he wound up with two groups. The first, called the Sakyans, was short-lived, while the second, Les Ceylonians, not only got him to sing two hits (Daha Duke Vidyahala and Mal Ravamal) but got the attention of Patrick Corea. One thing led to another, Corea got him to sing under the Exvee record label, and in 1969, he recorded his first original hit, Oruwaka Pawena, in turn accompanied by three other singles: Ran Kooduwak Oba Sadu, Sansare Sewanalle and Mangale Neth Mangale.
When I met Victor last year, I put to him that given his unmusical voice, Milton would have found it difficult adjusting to the demands of his composers. Victor vehemently disagreed and pointed out that even Jothipala, with his pavement (bajavu) voice, was accommodative and could adjust. Victor had the credentials to say what he did there, because when Milton was up and coming, he took him, nurtured him, moulded him, and released him.
Like Kapuge and Jothipala, he probably would have ruffled some feathers with his voice today. But what he lacked in vocal range and texture, he made up for with his articulation. Put simply, he made you understand and know that he was sincere about what he sang. For the rest of his career, that is what sustained him.
What happened after the sixties He got to work with Patrick Denipitiya (Ma Nisa Oba), Clarence Wijewardena (Mata Men Ohutada), Khemadasa (Sakwala Rathwana), and Melroy Dharmaratne (Mal Gaha Yata). He was a film playback singer as well, making his debut with Poojithayo in 1971 and winning a Sarasaviya Award with Kandan Yannam (from Athin Athata) in 1984. He got an entire live concert to himself courtesy of the Ceylon Tobacco Company and Mahajana Sampatha. The Super Golden Chimes featured him in their concerts, through an invitation extended by Clarence himself.
In the end, after all those hits, awards, accolades, and packed crowds, he passed away on March 10, 1998.
He was 53. Had he lived, he would have 72. What else can we say That he continues to be sung everywhere: on bus rides, at Big Matches, at birthday parties, and at get-togethers. He had a voice which was made for the guitar, so for that reason both children and adults celebrate him. He spoke and articulated the wishes, hopes, and dreams of a thousand lovers. He had a life and he had a family, both of which no doubt shaped his dukbara, romantic view of the world.
Added to all these, moreover, he had sincerity. Theres no doubt, after all, that Eda Rae is reminiscent of the best poetry of Thomas Hardy, in how it features the fissure between love and rejection and between embracement and separation that makes up the best love songs. It needed Milton to reinforce that. He did just that.
And what he did for that song, we can hence conclude, he did for every other song. The way he wanted, the way we wanted. Simple as that.

MRIA, a hive of activity
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), which was once described as the worlds emptiest airport, has become active again due to the temporary closure of Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) due to the re-laying of its runaway.
Sri Lankan-Indonesian (Sri Vijaya) and Fly Dubai, have been the airlines which have operated most flights to Mattala.
According to officials, 139 flights have landed at the airport during January and February. At least 14 airlines are now using Mattala due to the ongoing repairs at BIA.
During the period, Mattala has recorded 7,704 in-bound passengers and 2,558 out-bound passengers. Fly Dubai flights use Mattala airport every Sunday and Tuesday. It is considered the airline with the highest number of flights.
Authorities are operating a special bus service to transport passengers from Mattala to Katunayake.

Navy awaits GPS footings
The Sri Lanka Navy is awaiting for the GPS footings of the Indian fishing boat, which was said to be attacked recently by an unidentified group when fishing in the Sri Lankan waters.
Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne said it is vital to have the GPS recordings of the Indian boat, to conduct the investigations into the attack further.
The Navy has requested the Indian authorities to supply the recordings of the GPS unit fixed to the Indian fishing boat.
The route of a vessel is recorded with the GPS unit fixed in the vessel. Once the GPS recordings received, the Navy can trace the location of the attack, he said.
He said Sri Lanka Navy as a professional force, never attacks a vessel without having an approval of the Navy Commander. The approval of the Navy Commander is needed even to fire a warning shot at a vessel.
Wijegunaratne said investigations revealed that 400 to 500 Indian trawlers were in Sri Lankan waters on the day.

Author: Michael Lewis

Michael Lewis could spin gold out of any topic he chose ... his best work ... vivid, original and hard to forget Tim Harford, Financial Times
From Michael Lewis, No.1 bestselling author of The Big Short and Flash Boys, this is the extraordinary story of the two men whose ideas changed the world.
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky met in war-torn 1960s Israel. Both were gifted young psychology professors: Kahneman a rootless son of holocaust survivors who saw the world as a problem to be solved; Tversky a voluble, instinctual blur of energy. In this breathtaking new book, Michael Lewis tells the extraordinary story of a relationship that became a shared mind: one which created the field of behavioural economics, revolutionising everything from Big Data to medicine, from how we are governed to how we spend, from high finance to football. Kahneman and Tversky, shows Michael Lewis, helped shape the world in which we now live - and may well have changed, for good, humankinds view of its own mind.
A new book by Michael Lewis promises an absorbing story, dazzling ideas, journalistic flair and originality. He achieves this with extraordinary consistency. In The Undoing Project he has achieved it again Daniel Finkelstein, The Times

Title: FACINGTHE TALIBAN
Author: AnojaWijeyesekera

It is the night of 11th September 2001 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Anoja is frantically gathering her things for an evacuation. In the background, the falling bombs shake the foundations of the house, but her thoughts are far away, she can only think of her brother, Srinath, who is trapped in the debris of the Twin Towers in New York. In a cruel twist of fate, two siblings find themselves as bystanders on opposite sides of what would soon become a cruel and painful conflict. This dramatic opening to Anojas autobiographical account is just a small window into the fascinating and tumultuous tale of an aid-worker, mother and woman who finds herself in a place that would soon become a focal point of global politics. Amidst the heart-wrenching tales, there are instances of humour. The Talibans obsessions with their weird rules from the length of a mans beard and the covering of a womans face are some humorous nuggets amid a bleak environment. Anojas encounters give a rare insight into the working of the Taliban government.
Through her stories, we witness how sometimes the Taliban themselves were bewildered by the absurdities of their own rules. The book ends with the culmination of Taliban edicts going haywire and leading to the destruction of the Bamyan Buddha statues, the two gigantic and iconic structures of the ancient world, akin in a symbolic way to the attack on the Twin Towers of New York which is the starting point of the book. Anojas reminiscences provide a unique picture of a country at the brink of a bloody chapter. Through disenfranchisement and Taliban Edicts emerges a moving picture of a compassionate and kind people who are victims and prisoners of a fate which has spiralled beyond their control.

Pakistan suspends Mohammad Irfan in spot-fixing case
Karachi: Pakistan's Cricket Board on Tuesday suspended and charged tall fast bowler Mohammad Irfan over his alleged involvement in spot-fixing during a recently held Twenty20 league.
"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in furtherance to its investigation issued a Notice of Charge and provisionally suspended Irfan under the PCB Anti-Corruption Code," it said in a statement.
It added: "Irfan has been charged with two violations of the anti-corruption code and now has 14 days to respond to the Notice of Charge," without giving further details.
"He has also been provisionally suspended with immediate effect from participating in all forms of cricket."
Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif, also members of the Islamabad United team that took part in the Pakistan Super League, were also provisionally suspended and charged last month over meeting a man suspected of being linked to an international betting syndicate. Another former Pakistan opener Nasir Jamshed was also provisionally suspended on charges of being a "go between" in the spot-fixing incident. Jamshed and another unnamed person were arrested in UK last month but were bailed until April.The PCB, which has formed a three-member tribunal under retired judge Asghar Haider, said the investigation would continue.
Irfan, 34, appeared before the anti-corruption unit of the PCB on Monday and confessed to being approached by a bookmaker about fixing matches in the past six months.
He admitted he failed to report the incidents because of the death of his father in September followed by his mother's passing in January.
Irfan was initially dropped from one match in the PSL but was later cleared to play all remaining eight games.
Irfan made headlines for his extraordinary height -- seven feet and one inch -- when he entered international cricket in 2010 and stands as the tallest-ever player to feature in international cricket.
He has so far played four Tests, 60 one-day and 20 Twenty20 internationals. - AFP

Pan Asia Banking Corporation announced the completion of its rights issue to raise up to Rs.2.06 billion placing the bank on a much stronger footing to pursue a higher wave of growth in 2017 and beyond.
The Bank in December 2016 announced to issue 147.5 million shares at one new share for every two shares held at an issue price of Rs.14 to fund its future growth while maintaining a strong capital base.
The Banks share issue carried further significance given the fact that this was the first rights issue in the Colombo Stock Exchange for 2017 which would certainly have led to enhanced investor sentiments about the capital market in Sri Lanka.
Banks acting Chief Executive Officer, Lalith Jayakody attributed the success to the strong investor confidence placed on the banks current and future strategies by its shareholders.
When we announced this rights issue we had the full confidence in our shareholders that they would be behind us.They knew that we have chosen a growth path which is both steadfast and sustainable.
So, I believe this was the reason behind our successfully raising over two billion rupees and close the issue on a high note, Jayakody said.
Pan Asia Bank is the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka with its assets growing by over 20 percent to be slightly below Rs.130 billion as of end of 2016.
The bank also increased its profit after tax by 20 percent to Rs.1.25 billion, recording the highest ever after tax profit earned by the bank in its 21 years history.
The rights issue also places Pan Asia Bank well above the minimum core capital requirement of Rs.7.5 billion which needs to be met by March 31, 2017 as the bank now has a core capital base of Rs.8.67 billion.

Parliament can only be dissolved with two third's majority: Senaratne
According to the provisions of the 19th Amendment, even the President cannot dissolve the Parliament. A two third's majority is required to dissolve Parliament, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters and degree certificates for 336 dispensers and 150 midwives during a ceremony held in Colombo, recently.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the government has received a mandate from the people to run until 2020.
The trade unions should act without becoming the mallets of various political projects, he added.
He said, present day politicians engage in politics using trade unions, but the benefits are short-term. Some trade unions try to bring the persons who destroyed the country's economy back into power.
Officials of the Health Ministry and other institutions were also present.

Parliament has 94 MPs without O/Ls
Ninety four MPs have not passed their GEC (O/L) examination while there are only 25 graduates among the 225 legislators in the present Sri Lankan Parliament, former Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, Prof. M O A de Zoysa said yesterday.
He observed that MPs who have been elected to make laws on behalf of the people must conduct themselves with dignity.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the conduct of the Joint Opposition MPs since the day the Yahapalana government came to power amounted to a contravention of parliamentary discipline.
Parliament is a place that makes laws. Its members should be dignified, with a knowledge of their subjects, logical intelligence and of impeccable conduct. But, we cannot see these qualities in most of the MPs today, he said.Taxpayers money is being spent for the welfare of all MPs and a Rs. 2500 Special Attendance Allowance, with the luxury meals, are provided to them for one sitting. Therefore, MPs should bear in mind their responsibilities. But, everyday, when parliament meets, JO members disrupt parliament proceedings for about one or two hours. So how can parliament pass laws on behalf of the people and the country The conduct of certain senior members is not good and it is disgusting.
They may be senior but, they have not matured. They have been given front seats to set an example to junior MPs, he said. Senior Lecturer at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura Dr. Terrence Purasinghe said Sri Lanka follows traditions and conventions built over a long period of time in the British Parliament. Apart from these, Standing Orders have laid down how business should be conducted in the House. These are the rules that have to be followed by the MPs. But, most of the MPs do not follow them today.

Passion driven Royal-Thomian match
Hilmy Cader of MTI Consulting has been generous in a piece in the Sunday Observer on the subject 138 years of cricket between Royal and S. Thomas and what businesses could learn from it. He says. profit is the only driver of a business, here is an exception where passion is the driver of the business, a cult brand status for their brands, strong sub-brands, efforts of the different Brand Evangelists.
This piece turns the light inward and asks what Royal and S. Thomas could learn from business in this series. Giving media dignity and respect pays. Media are our access to the wider world and means to portray the brand. Twenty eight media institutions and publications sought access with seventy nine provided access passes. All without tickets at the match had photo ID passes.
What I would term as rudimentary comforts were enhanced with a mid-morning snack provisioned but used on two of three days along with the lunch, tea and soft drinks, a dedicated steward to serve the media in attendance and a cooler from which water could be picked up. Beer was to be kept in the cooler.
The space allocated was inadequate. A request is pending with a sponsor to send out mementos to those who took the trouble to use their passes. The visual monitors provided for the SLBC commentators packed up.
We need to invest on convincing the media that they are important to us.
The importance of business integrity
The misconduct of a few can undermine efforts of the many and erode trust in markets and institutions. This entails those who operate in such markets to play by the rules. A wider range of tools to induce meaningful behaviour change.
The challenges of corporate misbehaviour are not new, but the potential scope of their impact is, particularly in terms of lost trust. What is needed is to understand the distance between what expectations for responsible business behaviour recommend and how they are implemented. Given the stakes, for many continuing with business as usual is not an option.
Integrity as a question of long-term success.
Just pointing to whatever the leaders are doing is no longer good enough. The Royal Thomian brand must become one of those leaders. We have to define what we stand for and what behaviours are no longer appropriate, regardless of whether the majority of the industry follows those practices.
Match officials
We had on-field, reserve and a third umpire with a match referee. They were served with camera technology for referrals. Known only to a handful, the system providing camera technology was protected and kept independent from bias or influence for use by the third Umpire. It required discrete monitoring throughout the match.
A few were passionate in calling for a match officiating system which was truly independent and free of partisan pressures.
What is a conflict of interest
A situation where an individual or the entity for which they work, whether a government, business, media outlet or civil society organisation, is confronted with choosing between the duties and demands of their position and their own private interests.
Going forward the Joint Committee will have to codify areas where conflicts of interest arise to prevent negative outcomes.
CSR
The four categories of Case for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic  address the motivations for initiatives in the category and are also useful in identifying specific kinds of benefits that flow back to companies, as well as society, in their fulfillment.
A 138 year brand must ask of itself its CSR. Sure there is a revenue dividend to the brand with both schools becoming beneficiaries in equal measure. Can though economics of revenue supersede the cricket What is the cost of ear shattering, deafening noise masking all cricket related sounds at the centre where bowling and batting is undertaken
The brand is influential and can place enormous pressure on those officiating. All the more reason why cricketing laws must unflinchingly be respected. For the same reasons, since stakes are high cricketing ethics must be our first priority. Results must not be at the expense of ethics.
What of philanthropy The combined physical assets of both schools is unmatched. The cricketing talent and brains considerable. Have we thought it fit to share and or apply these assets in a rational manner to benefit talented but less well-endowed schools, rural but budding talent and left behind for cricket in this country the sheer breadth and volume of cricketing talent leaving at the end of every cricketing season from senior teams
The two schools have been blessed with cricket programmes which are sustainable. What is our give back to cricket in this country for the fortunes which have come our way It is my view some in the upper echelons running cricket in this country see Royalists and Thomians with a jaundiced view due to perceptions of elitism and privilege on our part. It is for us to show our generosity and heart to serve the larger interest of cricket in this country.
The history of the brand is replete with cricketing greatness in the past. Others have come along and shone not only in school cricket but also on the national stage more recently. Its a lesson to both schools. Nevertheless if ours is the second longest cricketing school encounter in the world, we possess some historical greatness. It must translate into unparalleled social investments unsurpassed by any other with comparable contexts.

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof.Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrates Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, was yesterday re-fixed for May 9 by Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the Court was informed that the prosecution was yet to receive the DNA report pertaining to the skeleton remains seized at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
At a previous occasion, former Colombo Chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to preempt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen.
On September 15, 2016, Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application, Prof.Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrates Court order to refuse him with anticipatory bail.
Prof. Samarasekara denied allegations leveled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.
Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando with Counsel Thisya Weragoda and Iresh Seneviratne appeared for the former JMO.

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters seem to have contracted measles.
The Minister was referring to Rajapaksas statement that the new constitution will destroy the nation.
The great scientist Albert Einstein said that nationalism is an infantile disease and it is the measles of mankind. And it seems Rajapaksa and his supporters have got measles, he said.
Speaking to The Daily News yesterday, Minister Senaratne said the northern political party was called Federal party in the past and since the 50s they demanded for a federal system.
For the first time in history, now the Tamil political parties have agreed to devolution of power under a unitary government and thats a great achievement, he said.
The minister further said if the former president is saying that the country will be divided if there is devolution of power under a unitary government, it is clear he does not have a proper idea about the subject.
I dont think even the people who are supporting him have a clear idea about the devolution of power. The motives of Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters are to look into all possible ways to come back to power. They tried to gain power before their leaders received prison sentences for corruption and crimes they were involved in.
Therefore, they will oppose everything that was said and done, he said.
Minister Senaratne further added that there will be a special paragraph in the new constitution that would allow the Central Government to dissolve the Provincial Council if they try to instigate separatism.
Now we have no provision as such and as a result, individuals attached to different Provincial Councils try to spread separatism, he said.

Revolt against tradition
Kapila Balasuriya has trained with an unimaginable vigour and delved into tribal rituals for his bold dance shows. In his latest endeavour to deconstruct the Mohini legend, he is investigating the secret society believed to be brainwashing the modern generation
Ive fallen down the rabbit hole, claims Kapila Balasuriya with somewhat a witty smile. He took time to describe the world of conspiracies, cults and celebrities that he has been exploring for his latest work to reinterpret the traditional version of Mohini. The choreographer has long been known for his brave and sometimes surprising choices, and for the depth of research he undertakes. He spent weeks in training while working with the professional contemporaries. None of his projects, though, has taken him into the popular strata in Sri Lanka. He is better known abroad.
Mohini is the only female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu. She is portrayed as an enchantress, who maddens lovers, sometimes leading them to their doom. Mohini is introduced into the Hindu mythology in the narrative epic of the Mahabharata. Here, she appears as a form of Vishnu, acquires the pot of Amrita (an elixir of immortality) from thieving asuras (demons), and gives it back to the devas (gods), helping them retain their immortality.
Many different legends tell of her various exploits and marriages, including union with Shiva. These tales relate, among other things, the birth of the god Shasta and the destruction of Bhasmasura, the ash-demon. Mohinis main modus operandi is to trick or beguile those she encounters. She is worshipped throughout Indian culture, but mainly in Western India, where temples are devoted to her depicted as Mahalasa, the consort of Khandoba, a regional avatar of Shiva.
Named after this traditional celebrity, Kapila Balasuriya developed an aesthetic melodrama to portray a shadowy cult believed to be on an elaborate mission of global domination, spreading its agenda through the brainwashing of prominent individuals in politics and the media.
He also expects to expand his horizons with setting a world record by dancing for nine hours without an interval. I am in the process of talking to the relevant government authorities to make it a reality. I hope they will offer me a helping hand, Balasuriya said.

Road signs erected along several roads in the Hambantota district have been removed by certain unscrupulous persons to be used as plates for making Kottu Roti, said D. C. Lionel Regional Engineer attached to the Road Development Authority in Hambantota.
He said so during a meeting of the Ambantota Regional Co-ordinating committee on Monday. He said iron plates used to mark road signs are strong enough to be used as floorboards for making Kottu Roti. He found several such robbed plates being used at eateries in the area making Kottu Roti for sale to their customers.
He said the removal of these road signs caused great inconvenience to motorists.
Co-chairman of the Regional Co-ordinating Committee State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi who presided over the meeting directed police to investigate this matter and take legal action against those robbing road signs under the Public Property Act.

The provisions were handed over to the farming families in Beralihela, Samakkuliya, Muthiyammagama, Sandungama, Osuvinna, Udasgama, and Thambarawa, by Director and Chief Executive Officer, Shammi Karunaratne.
These farmers are a vital part of the Samaposha family as they assure the supply of quality raw ingredients for our product. We are mindful of the needs of these farmers who often have to face natural disasters. We take pride in being able to come to their aid in their hour of need and strengthen our bond with the farming community in the country.

Silence, like a tide, splashes
The evening sun was setting at the faraway horizon. The sky was slightly turning to pale red. Solitary sky was disturbed by the gulls. They were flying serenely towards the western sky one after another. Ebbing tides splashed themselves on the rocks and sprayed the white foam to the empty sky. Constant coming and going of the waves drowsed me as a lullaby my mother used to sing when I was a little one.
I felt cozy on the warm sea sand while the cool breezes snared me and soothed myself. Empty papers of my file tried to fly with the sea wind but I kept it under my satchel. Crowds of people have flocked under the warmth of the setting sun. Screaming children were running and playing on the beach. But they didnt see that the sand castles they built few minutes ago were swept away by the rude tides of the sea. I felt cold as usual. I gazed at the crowds of people but still he was absent.
At last I saw him emerging at the far end. His thin cotton shirt was trying to fly away with the rustling evening winds. He walked towards my direction, constantly looking at the setting sun, faraway in the horizon.
Am I late had some assignments to finish Without even giving me a chance to answer, he finished the sentence.
I came half an hour ago..
I looked at his face. His face was blank. Blank as usual. The noisy crowds around us, were enjoying their evening; laughing and screaming at the top of their voices. I tried to remember the silent evenings we had spent among such happy and noisy crowds. Silenceit is not something new to us. Because it is silence that we shared with each other. We sat there for some time, looking at the setting sun. We saw a world created before our eyes red, yellow and orange.
Its beautiful.. he said.
Yes it is beautiful, as it is always I whispered.
Shall we go near that rock  He asked, still looking at the faraway sky.
I fetched my bag, file and the pair of slippers. The slight warmth of the sea sand has now disappeared as the sun has gone from the sky and the cold sand escorted me. After twilight, the shadows of darkness were creeping around. End of another day yes, a silent end of another silent meeting.
We let our feet to take us along the dark streets of the city. Amidst the buzz of the busy city, we walked along the road. Where does this path take us Is it the road to our destination Sometimes it is really hard to understand what we really expect from life. Is it a matter of accepting everything that life gifts you At the end, all the time we were left with the ironical answer I dont know.
The unbearable silence reigns us. But still we were unable to disturb it as we cherished those silent moments so much. We were able to understand each other through this silence. If we can listen to the voice of our silent soul
Get in the bus is going to leave he said.
I took an empty seat at the far end. Through the misty panes of the shutter, I could see him walking along the road. He didnt look back.

We would like to recognise the participating teams and give the team medals before the game for playing this match. This is a historic occasion for Bangladesh and we are happy that they are sharing it us with, said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
Commenting on the performance of the team he added that the Bangladesh team has come a long way in cricket. Their participation has improved the economics of the game and Bangladesh now have a very mature, world-class cricketing structure. We are very proud and happy for Bangladesh.
While in Galle during the first test he also remarked about Bangladesh acquiring Test status. During 1998, I was the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. We voted for Bangladesh for Test status. I was also the president of Asian Cricket Council at the time. As an ACC initiative, we also sent four coaches for age-level cricket (U-13, 15, 17, 19). We have been helping each other since then and the team itself has come a long way.

Sokians retain Olcott Memorial Trophy in UAE
Defending champions, Dharmasoka College Past Pupils retained the crown as the 10th Olcott Memorial Trophy cricket tournament worked off at the Ajman Oval Ground, UAE with the participation of past pupils of Sri Lanka Olcott Community schools, namely Dharmasoka College (Ambalangoda), Mahinda College (Galle), Ananda College (Colombo), Rahula College (Matara), Maliyadewa College (Kurunegala), Nalanda College (Colombo), Dharmapala College (Pannipitiya), Dharmaraja College (Kandy).
Dharmasoka College was in Group B along with the Ananda College, Nalanda College and Dharmapala College and their first encounter was with Nalanda College which ended in a nail biting finish after both teams scored 79 runs each during their five overs. The match decided in the super over, where Nalanda College beat defending champions Dharmasoka College.
In their second match against Ananda College, Dharmasoka College scored 72 runs, but successfully defended that low score, largely due to tight bowling. Sokians recorded their first victory with a 20-run win.
Dharmasoka College end at second in Group B, thanks to their healthy net run rate in league. They met Dharmaraja College in semis, where Sokians piled up a mammoth 125 total (at 25 per over). Dharmaraja only managed to score 98 runs, allowing Sokians a cake walk to the final.
Final match was played between Dharmasoka College and Maliyadewa College where Sokians decided to bat first after winning the toss and posted a 98-run total.
Chasing a 99-run victory target, Maliyadewa College was restricted to a paltry 43 runs in their allotted five overs with all 10 wickets intact. It was due to superb tight bowling of Sokians, non of the Maliyadeva batsmen were able to pose a threat to steal the crown.
Sokians also won many of the special awards including the Man of the Match (Nalaka Thenuwara), Man of the Series (Nalin Thenuwara) and Best Batsman (Pasindu Prabhash).

Somali pirates strike again
An oil tanker with eight Sri Lankan crew on board has been hijacked off the coast of Djibouti.
On Monday, the Aris 13 issued a distress call and set a course for the Somali town of Alula, according to agency reports. This was after two high-speed skiffs were reported to have been following the ship.
Agencies reported that the ship turned off its tracking system on Monday. The Navy reported that the French Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) had notified the Rescue Coordinating Center (RCC) in Colombo of the ongoing situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Sri Lanka Navy have confirmed the presence of Sri Lankans on the ship, but noted that the ship was not sailing under a Sri Lankan flag. The ship is allegedly sailing under the Comoros Islands flag but was previously registered in Sri Lanka.Navy Spokesman Lt. Commander Chaminda Walakuluge stated that the 1800 deadweight ton tanker was owned by Armi Shipping and managed by The United Arab Emirates company Aurora Ship Management.
It is unclear whether the pirates have looted the ship or taken it and the crew is under their control, according to the Navy spokesman.
In addition, we have notified the UN Drugs and Traffic Control, and we have asked each of these agencies to enable us to rescue the eight Sri Lankans onboard this vessel, Walakuluge said. Agencies reported that the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Organization (UKMTO), a company that manages merchant ships and private yachts in the Gulf of Aden, has been monitoring the ship, but that there has been a breakdown in communication between the ship and authorities.
Aircraft from the European Unions regional naval force had been conducting surveillance flights in order to determine what was happening onboard, agency reports stated. This had occurred in the Gulf of Aden. This area is frequently patrolled by maritime security patrols and anti-piracy operations patrols conducted by the Combined Maritime Patrol Force. The Combined Task Force, which comes under the Combined Maritime Patrol Force, CTF 151, is responsible for counter piracy actions. We have informed these organisations and they are on high alert, said Walakuluge.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement Tuesday noting that it is working to verify the various reports and still gathering information. The identities of the Sri Lankan crew are yet unknown.
The Ministry continues to remain in touch with the shipping agents, concerned authorities, as well as relevant Sri Lanka Missions overseas to ascertain further information on the matter in order to ensure the safety and welfare of the Sri Lankan crew, the statement read in part.
This would be the first successful hijacking of a merchant vessel by Somali pirates since 2012.

SriLankan to keep activities alive  in Europe - Manoj Gunawardane
SriLankan Airlines though now dont operate direct flights to Paris and Frankfurt would still keep on their activities alive in Europe, said Regional Head of Europe and America, SriLankan, Manoj Gunawardane.
Speaking to Daily News Business at the recently concluded ITB Berlin, he said that this is the reason they were also participating at one of the worlds largest travels and aviation shows the ITB. He said that they still sell tickets and claim 20% their earlier business through series of agreements.
The passengers are then connected to the SriLankan Airline network mostly from the Gulf or London to fly to Colombo and back.
He said that the airline is now going through a restricting process and this is part of the airline synergies. When things improve in the airline these two routes may come online again. Accordingly, the last flights between Frankfurt and Colombo on UL 553/554 were operated on October 30, while UL 563/564 on November 6, 2016 concluded the operations between Paris and Colombo.
Asked if the airline was paying for these routes he answered in the negative. He also said that it would not be a great issue to get these routes back forms these three destinations. What is currently needed is to increase more flights to London which is the only air link on the national carrier to Europe and nurse it carefully, he said.
SriLankan operates daily flights to both Doha and Abu Dhabi and has a strong code share relationship with Etihad and Qatar through which it will continue to provide onward connectivity to European destinations it has been serving via Paris and Frankfurt, the airline said.
The Indian Sub-continent, the Middle East and the Far East will remain SriLankans focal markets, where the Airline will continue to explore its potential for expansion, the airline said. Meanwhile Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunga speaking at the well-attended ITB Sri Lankan Press conference said that Sri Lanka Tourism has suffered a great deal due to the pull out of these two flights during tourism peak season. However its the airlines decision and when we get back we will make representations again to get at least the Frankfurt route back by next winter.

## Date: Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - 01:00
Start your day well
It is another day. Another twenty-four hours, starting from morning, afternoon, evening and night. This is the way the day has been divided.
THE GLITTERING GREETINGS THROUGH THE DAY
We always greet people during the day. Starting from morning which continuous to afternoon, evening and night. The glittering two words we use to greet a person throughout the day has been symbolized from past to present and will continue in the future too.
GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING GOOD NIGHT
A smiling Good Morning at a sight wherever you are makes you live and cheerful. It is a mental comfort as well.
The noon is hot, sometimes cool, but it is always a Good Afternoon.
Good Evening comes next. The bright sunshine glitter its colorful orange.
The dark blue sky is the Good Night which ends the day. A Good Night sleep and sweet dreams keep you away from everything until the next day.
A GOOD START
Start the day with your prayers. Whatever religion you are it will be a blessing and the mental comfort to enlighten your day. Rise up early. It will take you off with the hurry-up and the prevailing rush.
RISING UP EARLY
Rising up early is the first thing to start your day. It makes things easy for you, rather than being hurry and messing-up everything during the day. If you get up early there is plenty of time for you to get ready and attend to the entire things that you should do in the morning. Late rising will be a big rush. Your mood and the entire mentality will be tarnished. I will be late to class to office. Bus breakdown, traffic all will be pestering you. You can get rid of all these issues by getting up early. Another important fact that I should point out is avoid going to bed late in the night.
MORNINGS CAN SET THE TONE FOR YOUR DAY
Why is it You are fresh and comfortable in the mornings. Dressed and groomed to leave home to school or office. Everyone attend to their chores in the morning. Your power of strength is more in the morning.
DAYS OF THE WEEK
Seven days. Its the lucky seven indeed. Every day is a new day. It has to be dealt with care and consideration. For children schooling is from Monday to Friday. They work according to a time-table in class. It is well-organized. What about the professionals They too have to cope up with their regular routines for the day.
A WISH AND A POSITIVE THOUGHT
The wish within you to be successful during the day on all transactions will be a positive thought. Make a wish as soon as you finish your daily prayers it will be fulfilled. Think about the good things that will happen throughout the day. Even if something doesnt look good, look at the positive side of it. For instance, you might have a difficult task at work. But instead of thinking about how difficult it is, think about what an exciting challenge it is. By reframing your mind like this, you will have a positive attitude about your day.
BE NORMAL AND CALM
The attitude you have when you start your day can have a big impact. If you grumble that you will have a miserable day ahead, it will be difficult for you to have a good day. On the other hand, if you think that whatever comes your way within day to take it up or face it with your power of strength it will happen! Fascinate the day. Keep a free mind. You can make the day or all the seven days your best.
PLAN YOUR DAY AHEAD
You should have a plan before going into your day. How should you do it Arrange your schedule in a way that maximizes your effectiveness. What you should schedule in the morning and what comes first because your mind is fresh in the morning. The rest can be carried out during the day. By arranging your activities this way you can be more effective and gain fruitful results.
A HEALTHY NUTRIOUS MEAL  BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER
While you start the day think of your three main meals. Do not slip. Make it! Sometimes it will be difficult. A nourishing meal will keep you fit always. Especially breakfast. You should not use the words No time to have breakfast even. Make the time for your meals. I know that there are different opinions about this, but for many people having a breakfast can give them the energy they need to start the day. This is one of the reasons why you should get-up early enough. You will have time for a good breakfast. Lunch is also important followed by dinner.
FACING UNEXPECTED SITUATIONS DURING THE DAY
Sudden changes in your daily routine may occur. All seven days will not be the same. It differs. Be flexible to go ahead with difficult situations as well. Rainy days, Power cuts, Traffic, Road blocks, closure of roads these are frequent incidents.
BE A WINNER AT THE END OF THE DAY
Take time off from your busy schedules to think and analyze whether you were able to take the maximum use of the day which will never come back. .

Still confident and strong
Human Nature is such that if one believes in oneself and acquires confidence, lifes challenges and difficulties can be overcome. Though life is not easy, working with dedication, desire and discipline can help one breakthrough. The Daily News features Vajira Chitrasena on her 85th birthday.
Q: Your 85th birthday falls on this Wednesday. Have you enjoyed your life up to now and do you feel that all dreams have been realized
A. As a dancer, teacher, choreographer and a mother life has not been easy. But, I persevered for the love of dance. I believe I was the first female Kandyan dancer to take to the modern stage very seriously, making it a professional career, in a mans field at the time.
I have danced in all corners of the globe, not just anywhere but performed at the most prestigious theatres, to many distinguished audiences and heads of state. As a teacher, I have passed my knowledge and love to countless number of students. As a choreographer I have created a number of acclaimed ballets and dance recitals that followed in the footsteps of my Guru Chitrasena.
We always ensured that our work preserved the beauty of our islands unique dance heritage, never compromising it for commercial gain. Above all however, as a mother, grandmother and great grandmother I couldnt be more proud of all my children and how they have chosen to live.
In that sense, I have no regrets becoming an artist of the highest caliber and being a true cultural ambassador to my country, teaching and creating many generations of artists without holding back any part of my knowledge or experiences and I also balanced motherhood all in one life. But there is one wish that I still continue to dream of and that is to have a place of my own, to be able to live at the dance school premises and hear the drums once again and watch over the next generation of budding artists.
I have spent over 70 years of my life dedicating it to dance and to my country with no expectation in return. But, travelling now is becoming very hard for me. In fact, I told my grand children recently, I am not sure how long more I can do this. They are trying very hard to construct a Guru Gedara at the Kalayathanaya premises, which I would like to see in my life time, but because of the lack of funds nothing has come up yet.
Q: At the age of 85 are you at peace believing you have made the right choices and faced life bravely
A. Yes! I feel I have always made the right choices and I am grateful to Guru Chitrasena for recognizing the potential within me, challenging me and giving me the freedom to compose my own work. Although it was a challenge to maintain the standards that were already set by him, there were also many students in the Dance School who gave me the courage and inspiration to work. I never faltered; I kept learning through each experience but knew that Chitrasena was always there to guide me and point out any short comings. When I look back, I have achieved quite a bit, but when I was dabbling in it all, never realized what its outcome would be. I loved what I did and everything else followed.
Q: You have a wonderful family, are you content with watching them grow into adults with their own personalities
A. They are all strong individuals in their own right working wholeheartedly to preserve and promote our culture here and around the world. I am content and my mind is at peace knowing that our legacy is safe in the hands of our children and grand children.
Q: Having devoted much of your life to dance and to the love of your life Master Chitrasena, are you now devoting time to spirituality Because people at your age are considered to be in the golden days of their lives
A. I started off on my spiritual journey in my early 40s and have been a student of S.N Goenka who is a well known Guru. Since then I have followed 10 day meditation courses whenever possible. Meditation has helped me over come many challenging situations in life during the height of my career as well. As a follower of the teachings of Buddha, I have always applied his philosophies in my daily life. I truly believe this is the way the Buddha intended his followers to do.
Q: You have such wisdom, such knowledge, experiences and experiences. What kind of advice do you have to offer to a youngster who is trying to discover what to do with his or her life
A. It is important to be truthful to oneself and to others in order to reach your goals in life. Pursue your passion wholeheartedly and work towards making your journey a valuable one for your country and the world.
Q: What are your pursuits these days What do you do in your free time when you are not overseeing the Kalayathanaya
A. Exercise has always been essential in my life and even to this day I have continued my daily exercises in the morning. I also help my daughter-in-law with small chores around the house. I enjoy stitching and reading during my quiet times at home. I still teach three days of the week at the Dance School.
But my happiness now lies in spending time with my great grandchildren. Its nice to see the 4th generation of the family gradually assimilating with the Dance. I can only hope that they too continue to carry this forward.
Q: Is there anything you would like to say, that I have not asked you in this interview
A. A cultured environment in my opinion is crucial for children to become creative and more importantly sensitive individuals. I feel its important for the younger generation to have more exposure to the arts and culture of this country as it is the one thing that gives each one of us a true identity that we can be proud of. And the beauty of our arts, is that it is for everyone.

Stray cattle to be captured
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry had requested dairy owners in the Western Province to ensure that their cattle are tethered in grazing land safely without allowing them to stray into public places in search of fodder.
The ministry said this request is made because straying cattle have caused many problems in the province including inconveniencing the public, traffic accidents, obstruction to places of business as well as traffic congestion. A recent survey on obstacles to development under the Western Megapolis Development programme had identified straying cattle as one of the obstacles for the implementation of the programme.
The main cause for this had been the severe limitation of grazing land due to the proliferation of industries and other construction work in the region in recent times.

Syria has become torture chamber: UN rights chief
SWITZERLAND: The UN rights chief warned Tuesday that a tidal wave of bloodshed over more than six years of war in Syria had effectively turned the country into a torture chamber.
As the conflict enters its seventh year, this is the worst man-made disaster the world has seen since World War II, said Zeid Raad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
More than 320,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since the conflict erupted in March 2011, as protests against President Bashar al-Assad morphed into war following a government crackdown.
In an address to the UN Human Rights Council, Zeid said that his office had been refused access to the country and that no international human rights observers had been admitted to places where very probably tens of thousands of people are currently held. They are places of torture. Indeed, the entire conflict, this immense tidal wave of bloodshed and atrocity, began with torture, he said, citing as an example the torture of a group of children by security officials over anti-government graffiti six years ago.
Today, in a sense, the entire country has become a torture chamber, a place of savage horror and absolute injustice, he said.
The UN and other organisations have repeatedly accused the Syrian authorities of widespread torture.
Amnesty International said in a report last August that an estimated 17,700 people had died from torture in custody since the beginning of the conflict, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number at at least 60,000.
Many others have been executed, and far more have simply disappeared, according to the reports.
Were speaking of a daily continuous massacre that has been going on for six years, Mazen Darwish, a Syrian lawyer who was detained for more than three years, told the UN rights council.
While we are here today, there are civilians, women, children, innocent people who are being killed under torture, said Darwish, one of several Syrian victims and activists who spoke to the council during a special session on Syria.
Zeid criticised international leaders for failing to act decisively to ensure accountability for the abuses.
Vetoes have repeatedly pushed back hope for an end to this senseless carnage and for referral of alleged international crimes to the International Criminal Court, he said.
He was referring to a blocked UN Security Council, where Russia in particular has vetoed several attempts to bring a case against Syria before the ICC in The Hague.
But Zeid welcomed the UN General Assemblys agreement in December to set up a body to gather evidence on war crimes in Syria, which would build up the basis for criminal proceedings against individual perpetrators. Ensuring accountability, establishing the truth and providing reparations must happen if the Syrian people are ever to find reconciliation and peace, he said. - AFP

Tobacco, alcohol claim 35,000 lives annually
Around 35,000 Sri Lankans die each year due to the use of tobacco and alcohol, and five percent of them (1,750) are children. Seventy percent of deaths of warded patients in hospitals in Sri Lanka are due to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the main reason for the rapidly increasing NCDs in the country is the use of tobacco and alcohol.
The excessive use of salt, sugar and fat has a significant impact.
The minister was addressing the opening of several fitness centres in the Kalutara district recently. The Health Ministry has provided Rs. 2 million worth equipment for each fitness centre.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the ministry expects to reduce the presence of NCDs in Sri Lanka by five percent by 2020. It is also expected to register 5,000 people for one medical practitioner and screen them for NCDs.
The concept of `Family Doctor will be introduced to Sri Lanka soon and screening will be made available for people through lifestyle and well-woman centres.
Minister Dr. Senaratne explained at length the services carried out by the government for the advancement of the health sector and action to be taken to improve the health of the people.

Trespassing Indian fishermens arrests will continue: Amaraweera
The government will relentlessly pursue its current policy of arresting Indian fishermen trespassing into Sri Lankan territorial waters and confiscating their boats and equipment, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. He said nearly 5,000 Indian fishing boats enter Sri Lankas maritime zone almost thrice a week for poaching, thereby destroying the countrys fishing resources. The problem had been festering for the past several years and no past government had been able to find a lasting solution to it. But in his capacity as Fisheries Minister, he had issued strict orders to arrest all Indian fishermen entering Sri Lankas territorial waters to engage in illegal fishing.
The minister was addressing a meeting at the Kudawella Jayawickrama Vidyalaya to mark the launching of the ministrys Wewak Samaga Gamak programme in Kudawella North recently.
Although arrests were made before 2015, all seized boats and equipment had been subsequently released. Once the boats were released, Indian fishermen used the same boats to continue their illegal activity.
Minister Amaraweera said Indian fishing boats trespassing into Sri Lankan waters were mainly made of steel and they crashed against Sri Lankan fishing boats damaging them. They also engaged in bottom trawling completely eliminating fish shoals.

Underwater hockey makes splash in Hong Kong
Hong Kong: The gravity defying sport of underwater hockey has gained a worldwide following -- now a Hong Kong team is diving in as the game takes off in Asia.
Invented by British navy divers in the 1950s, the acrobatic six-a-side sport requires participants to hunt a heavy plastic puck and hit it into their opponents' net with a short curved stick.
Competitors wear snorkels, fins, ear protectors and gloves, resembling a school of fish as they swarm around the puck, diving and somersaulting to gain possession.
The sport has built up a loyal fanbase in Canada, Australia and South Africa and has spread to Asian countries in recent years, including China and Malaysia. Hong Kong's amateur team, which has around 25 active players, draws from all walks of life, including teachers, an artist, a pilot and geologist Henry Chan, who founded the club which is nicknamed "HK Typhoon".
A former competitive swimmer, Chan, 28, learned to play the sport while studying in the US.
He decided to set up a Facebook page seeking fellow fans on his return to Hong Kong in 2010 as he missed playing what he describes as a "fast-paced and three-dimensional" game.
"I started receiving messages from veterans from all over the world who had transferred to Hong Kong to work. They have a lot of experience in playing, teaching and even competing at the highest level," Chan told AFP.
Chan's Facebook group is followed by nearly 200 people and his fellow Hong Kong players have now formed a competitive team, taking part in their first tournament in May last year. They came third out of 11 Chinese cities that participated in the China Cup in Chengdu.
The team's long-term aim is to secure a place in the underwater hockey world cup -- but for now they are setting their sights on this year's China Cup in May.
"We are aiming for the first prize and I'm very confident about it," said Chan of the upcoming tournament in Hangzhou. The Hong Kong team practises once a week at a 25-metre school pool, working to improve their power, endurance and lung capacity.
Experienced players swim whole lengths without coming up for air in training, to help when they dive to chase the puck.
But head coach Nowie Ignacio Cornelia, from the Philippines, says the skills do not come easily.
"Being great comes with time. Your muscles have to get used to being underwater," said Cornelia, 37, who is a freelance cinematographer.
"The key ingredient is to be very calm and relaxed," Cornelia added. But Chan says it is cooperation that is the key. "There are six (opponents) to defeat before scoring," he said. "You have to make good use of your teammates and you should really be passing the puck around, take a breath, advance to a better location quicker and receive the puck again."
Out of the pool, the team reviews tactics and analyses underwater footage, along with visits to the gym.
But while there is a hard core of enthusiasts in Hong Kong, Chan says he would like to see more awareness of the game as well as technology and pools designed to help spectators engage fully with the sport.
Team member Flora Tang, 31, said that while water polo and scuba diving were well-known in the city, underwater hockey was still a mystery for most. - AFP

Where silence reigned
Turn you attention inward. Become aware of your posture, how you sit on the chair. Notice all your body sensations, notice any tensions that may be present, gently relax those places, relax your whole body, be totally comfortable in your posture Now look closely for thoughts that may arise in your mind. If they are linked to the past or future just let them go by becoming aware You might experience a sense of silence and then you will notice that you are breathing. There must be movement for the mind to notice. Please observe the whole process of breathing without interfering, without forcing it in any way as you do this, whenever you notice that you are thinking of something else please bring your attention back to breathing... keep doing this exercise
Following these instructions, the whole audience, a cross section of corporate leaders experienced the bliss of being totally silent for some time, perhaps for the first time in life during the very unique corporate event organized to launch the book Inward Bound for Mindful Living as a Sarasavi Publication by Deepal Sooriyaarachchi. Deepal is a seasoned corporate executive, now fully committed to the purpose of developing managers while serving a number of blue chip boards. Union Ball Room of JAIC Hilton was filled to capacity on the 16th February by those who responded to Deepals invitation to discover how mindfulness, the simple skill of becoming aware of what happens here now and observing them non-judgmentally, can improve corporate performance and happiness.
It was a book launch with a difference with complete focus on the audience, which echoed the likes of an evening lecture series organized by a professional institute. The formal presenting of the book was replaced by a lineup of excellent presentations by eminent speakers.
Having referred to the origins of Mindfulness to Buddhas teaching, Dr Tara De Mel educated the audience on how in the last decade the scientific community had discovered immense benefits of the practice of mindfulness with undisputable evidence, recorded in over 500 peer reviewed articles in leading scientific journals. Referring to a large number of scientific research publications she took the audience through as to how the practice of mindfulness definitely affects all the systems of the human physiology with positive benefits. She used the secular definition of mindfulness popularized by John Kabat Zin of USA Paying Attention on Purpose in the present Moment non-judgmentally in sharing the various scientific aspects. She went on to say how the mindfulness revolution began when His Holiness Dalai Lama challenged Professor Richard Davidson (Neuroscientist - Founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison) to research about the positive emotion and their impact on the human brain. Accordingly Mindfulness has gained recognition and has got introduced to many fields including medicine, education, management and business. One of the key points that took the audiences attention was the Mindful Nation policy that has been adopted by the British Parliament in a bipartisan move.
Deepal first introduced this book at PIM when it was a UK publication with his adopted pen name Deepal Soori and in fact he has become a shuri (expert) in showing us the importance of a very important aspect we tend to ignore in our hustle and bustle of busy life, which is to be Mindful, was how Prof Ajantha Dharmasiri commenced his presentation. He eloquently argued for the immense benefit of the practice of Mindfulness to be effective Managers. He iterated that the invitation to travel inward bound is timely as most Managers consider being productive by being faster and busier; as a result being more stressful rather than being smarter. He invited the Managers to consider the four foundations of Mindfulness discussed in Sati Pattana Sutta, as the basis for peak performance.
President's Counsel Prasantha Lal De Alwis, an eminent criminal lawyer, structurally reviewed the book to show how Insightful, Practical, Theoretical, Readable, and Logical it was, while also being affordable. He observed the unusual structure of the book and emphasized that this book has been obviously written by someone who walks the talk as evidenced by the simplicity with which some deep insights are brought out.
Deepal used the opportunity to recall with gratitude all those who helped him to rise up in life and particularly those who helped in publishing the book. He explained how we are Distracted, Confused and Stressed today more than ever and how the simple practice of mindfulness can make a world of difference to everyone who can develop the skill by spending a few minutes a day. He revealed that he had been practicing mindfulness since 1980, integrating it into his life long before the current awareness on the subject. In Mindfulness we learn to bring our attention to notice what goes on in this moment, the only moment we can observe, without getting involved  just like a CCTV camera. While appreciating all the health and other benefits valued by the scientific community, Deepal said that gaining those benefits through mindfulness is like using a Backhoe Machine to uproot a Banana Plant! The real benefit is getting to know yourself!
Please read my book, but the most important book you must read is YOUR LIFE, emphasized Deepal. During his presentation he conducted a guided mindfulness practice session as well. Young ad man, Shaveen Bandaranayake facilitated the whole programme weaving in the clips of the Inward Bound for Mindful Living hosted by him for ARTV. He had selected clips that brought out some fascinating insights shared by Deepal through some powerful analogies such as Our mind is like a meeting without an agenda or a chair person. He vouched on how he had benefited from the practice of mindfulness as a result of getting the opportunity to host the show.

Whither street protests
If you talk to any of the Colombos bus or train passengers about the current wave of street protests, their first reaction will be anger and frustration against protestors, saying this is a public nuisance and people are either getting late to get to work or getting late to return home.
Public inconvenience is only one side of the coin. The other side includes more serious issues. The economy, including the private sector, is adversely affected costing billions in lost business and opportunities. With the continued protest marches in the countrys capital, foreign businessmen would think twice before taking a final decision in making investment in Sri Lanka.
Disruption
I recently asked a protest leader who is in the limelight these days why he thinks street protests succeed. This is what he said: Let me get this out of the way and be as frank as possible. You cannot claim any sort of moral high ground if youre more concerned with disruptions not reaching your jobs, homes, highways, and neighbourhood as long as justice does not exist for an entire population of people in the country.
These disruptions dont occur in a vacuum. Context informs them. To get that many people to disrupt life in the Capital means that the legal, less risky channels for addressing ones grievances have been exhausted. Negotiations, appeals, passive marches and strikes all have failed.
As for the tactic of the disruptions themselves, lets simply ask ourselves this: Does a negotiation with the Minister occupy physical space, garner wall-to-wall news coverage, or offer feelings of solidarity and pride amongst people who are victimised
Dont think the protests in main roads and public transit the sole activity we are utilizing Theres a diversity of tactics at play ranging from public debate, sit-downs with the political bosses and higher officials, preparing for legal action, enlighten the citizens through media conferences, petitions to Human Rights and so on.
And these tactics work. Political bosses get scared easily. As an activist whos been invited to sit and discuss things with power after engaging in street protests, I always used to laugh when theyd express the desire to change. Id literally think to myself, You can already do what you want - what are you so afraid of
He has a point. The right to protest is a perceived human right arising out of a number of recognized human rights. While no human rights instrument or national constitution grants the absolute right to protest, such a right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech.
There was one point on which he had, even grudgingly, agreed: That such freedom to protest without being arrested (in large numbers) or brute force used, was not possible before 2015.
So, it is a right stolen and regained and, therefore, it is our duty to cherish and protect this right and not let it abused. Anybody can protest, anybody can rally without being antagonistic. Anybody can express his point as long as there is no impingement on the rights of others. I think the protesters need to work to address these issues.
Street protests and rallies will not go away in the foreseen future. In fact, they will become more and more intensive. Hence, it may prove useful for us to take a look at these protests and to focus on how the three main stakeholders  participants, public and police could manage those inevitable frustrating times.
Participants
First, its crucial for a protester to know what rights he has and doesnt have. He must do his homework and find out whether the organizing leaders have a history of non-violent protests, and search whether the leaders plan to move through unrestricted areas and gather in a public, safe space. Second, he should assess carefully whether the protest leaders are genuine to fight for the cause and do not have any ulterior political motives.
Its a common story, seen in many instances, where an initially peaceful protest movement subsequently engages in violent clashes with authorities. Images of peaceful demonstrators are replaced by rioters with poles, rocks and bottles. What separates the campaigns that maintain non-violent discipline from those whose discipline begins to break down From the experiences of some recent incidents it is obvious there were pre-meditated plans by the protest organisers to create disruption and havoc for their own hidden political agenda.
The participant must be smart enough to know when to stay, and know when to leave. The important thing to know whether he is going out to enjoy his right to assemble or participate in or just make his voice heard. He must act accordingly, and when the time comes to leave or obey the police direction he should do so without delay. He should never go toe to toe with the police and antagonize them. He must be aware that arguing about his rights with a dozen police officers is probably a losing battle.
Public
Few generalizations can be made about the general publics support for street protest movements in general; level of support varies by issue. But, in the current context, the publics overall attitude toward street demonstrations seems to range from scepticism to outright condemnation.
I once asked a young protest leader, Why don't you work these issuers through negotiation, legal action and other means that don't inconvenience me The leader quoted Martin Luther King Jr as his answer. King wrote in a Birmingham jail cell These white moderates were quite right in calling for negotiation. The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.
In the end, even acknowledging the necessity of disruption to achieve change might not relieve the citizens resentment at being inconvenienced. Whether it is the SAITM case or the Pensions issue, street protests have always had its consequences  the public had always paid the full price for it.
Police
Sri Lankan Police has a long history of handling street protests and has been tested time and again on how to best manage mass protest demonstrations. Often the police succeeded brilliantly in peacefully managing thousands of demonstrators. At other times, the actions of the police became the unintended focus of protesters and the centrepiece of media coverage of the event. Tough lessons were learned during this period.
The challenge of policing street protests highlights a number of issues for todays police officials, including how to effectively manage police resources to deal with large numbers of people who may be expressing their fundamental constitutional right to protest; how to work with business/community members who are not involved in the demonstration but who have an expectation that the police will protect them and their property from unlawful or destructive behaviour; how to effectively gather information for a planned or spontaneous mass street demonstration; how to integrate local and national resources - and maintain accountability; how to identify the policy issues and what procedures and safeguards should be in place for mass arrests, if necessary; determining what level of force should be used when demonstrators become unruly and who gives the command to use it.
Planning
In addition, police actions have now become the subject of increased monitoring by third parties, including news agencies and civil rights organizations, all of whom are armed with video cameras. These developments exert sustained pressure on law enforcement to get it right.
Police officers must also balance a number of conflicting demands when managing street protests. While allowing legitimate groups to express their fundamental rights, police needs to protect innocent bystanders; safeguard municipal and private property; ensure unimpeded commerce and traffic; contain unruly protestors with the appropriate type and amount of force; prevent injuries to officers, and, all the while, projecting professionalism and proficiency.
What is most important in handling street protests is the early and comprehensive planning for the events. The planning does not stop with the plan. It is a live process designed to avoid a potential crisis, while allowing senior officers the flexibility to meet unforeseen circumstances.
There is no contradiction between activist democracy and representative democracy. On the contrary, direct participation and activism of citizens, including through protest movements on the street, is a prerequisite for a representative democracy that functions and addresses the concerns of citizens.

'World's best health practices to be  introduced to Sri Lanka'  Dr Rajitha
At a recently conducted press briefing, the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka appreciated the efforts taken by the Government in developing the health sector of Sri Lanka.
This strategic decisions taken by the Government is much commendable and the Chamber believes that these decisions will take the health sector to a different era accruing benefits of the health sector to the general public in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, speaking at the press briefing said,  we will introduce the best health practices to Sri Lanka.
The National Chamber strongly believes that these benefits should reach the general public so that the business community could cater to the needs of the country at large.
The Chamber has been taking many initiatives for the development of the health sector, be it- Indigenous Medicine or Western medicine, for the last 15 years. The Chamber is well known for its mid year international exhibitions conducted every year for the promotion of the health sector and therefore expectation of the Chamber is to help the business community to develop businesses, whilst giving the best health sector opportunities to the general public.
Going further on the same theme, the National Chamber is organizing a grand scale Health Sector Exhibition - Mahajan Suwa-Dhana in July 2017 at BMICH with the collaboration of Ceylon College of Physicians and with the support of the Ministry of Health, Indigenous Medicine and Nutrition.
This exhibition would pave the way for the following exhibitor categories.
Hospitals and Clinics, Pharmaceuticals, Food and Nutrition, Health and IT, Health -Transport, Health Housing, Social Services, Leisure, Sports, Physiotherapy and Beauty Care, Medical Tourism etc.
