Messi penalty snatches thrilling Barca win
Lionel Messi shrugged off his recent woes from the penalty spot with a decisive 94th-minute spot-kick to move Barcelona top of La Liga with a pulsating 3-2 win at Valencia on Saturday.
However, the dramatic victory came at a cost for Barca as a tearful Andres Iniesta suffered ligament damage in his right knee that could keep him out for several months.
Messi netted twice and his opener midway through the first half was allowed to stand despite Luis Suarez straying into an offside position.
Valencia hit back with two goals in six second-half minutes through on-loan Barca winger Munir El Haddadi and Rodrigo.
However, Suarez levelled and was then upended inside the area by Aymen Abdennour to allow Messi to hold his nerve and slot past penalty-stopping specialist Diego Alves for all three points.
Victory moves the champions a point clear of Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid, who face Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao respectively on Sunday. He may be one of the finest footballers ever but Messi has struggled from the spot in recent seasons, most notably blazing over as Argentina lost the Copa America final to Chile in June.
Our best penalty-taker is Leo Messi without any doubt, Barca boss Luis Enrique said.
Valencia stopper Alves had saved three penalties this season and from Messi in the past, but was beaten low to his right.
Messi took responsibility in the best moment and it is a glorious feeling for us, added Enrique.
A bad-tempered encounter spilled over after Messis strike, though, as Suarez and Neymar were hit by a plastic bottle thrown by the Valencia fans as Barca celebrated.
We celebrated as it is normal to celebrate a last-minute winner, said Enrique.
The game was only 14 minutes old when Iniesta was carried from the field in tears holding his right knee, which buckled under a heavy challenge from Enzo Perez.

Plaudits for All Blacks while Wallabies sulk
The Australians were sour but elsewhere there was high praise for the All Blacks world-record winning streak, with suggestions their unbeaten run is far from over.
The reigning world champions downed the Wallabies 37-10 in Auckland on Saturday to set a record for top-tier nations of 18 consecutive victories.
All Blacks coach Steve Hansen felt his Australian opposite Michael Cheika hijacked celebrations with a withering outburst targeting the referee, the news media and claiming the New Zealanders did not respect his Wallabies.
But Cheika was in the minority for not congratulating the All Blacks on their historic achievement.
The All Blacks march on, fallible for sure, but buoyed by the self-assurance greatness bestows, wrote Paul Rees in London's Observer.
The best, it is hard not to suspect, is yet to come.
London's Telegraph noted that less than a year after becoming the first team to win back-to-back World Cups with a much-changed line-up, Steve Hansen's side bolstered their claim to being the greatest ever rugby team.
Among the flood of tributes for the All Blacks unprecedented winning streak were tweets of congratulations from both the Irish Rugby Union and the British and Irish Lions.
The All Blacks need to win their next seven Tests, which include two against Ireland and three against the Lions, if they are to break the outright record of 24 Tests held by Cyprus who compete in the European Nations Cup division 2B.
Great contest from both sides. Congratulations @AllBlacks on your achievement, the Lions tweeted.
@AllBlacks Congratulations on an incredible winning run, added Ireland who play New Zealand in Chicago and Dublin next month.
Former All Blacks captain Sean Fitzpatrick expected the winning sequence to continue, tweeting: I suspect there will be a few more added to the total by this outstanding team.
Former Wallaby Stirling Mortlock tweeted that the All Blacks were too good while South African cricket great Allan Donald added: Simply have to applaud the way these men play their rugby.
Such was the All Blacks superior finishing that they outscored the Wallabies six tries to one despite enjoying only 35 percent of possession and 32 percent of territory.
That said, we saw enough of the real All Blacks to know that this side are still way ahead of the rest of the world and that they will continue to move upwards, wrote Steve James in London's Telegraph.
Their fitness in the last quarter yet again proved irresistible.
In Sydney's Daily Telegraph Jamie Pandaram referred to the extraordinarily ugly aftermath to the Test which saw trans-Tasman relations plunge.
Australian coach Michael Cheika claimed the Kiwis don't respect them while rival Steve Hansen told him not to get sulky, Pandaram wrote.

Wenger rues costly Cazorla absence
Arsenal's Wenger bemoaned the absence of Santi Cazorla after Arsenal were held to a drab goalless draw by struggling Middlesbrough.
Cazorla did not feature at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday and the Spanish midfielder was sorely missed by the spluttering Gunners.
Arsenal were frustrated by Middlesbrough as they wasted a chance to win for a seventh successive Premier League game and eighth in all competitions.
You always miss Cazorla at home. From deep midfield into the final third his pass is always quick, accurate, said Wenger, whose side will be knocked out of first place if Manchester City avoid defeat against Southampton on Sunday.
Cazorla, I don't really know when he will be back. We have to see how he recovers on Monday.
There was better news on France striker Olivier Giroud who is now set to return for Arsenal's home League Cup game with Reading on Tuesday.
We didn't make enough from our set-pieces and crosses. So the first thing that comes to mind is whether a guy with more size and physical presence in the box could have helped, said Wenger.
But we have just come out of six straight wins so I wouldn't like to jump on this kind of excuse.
We have to deal with what we face and unfortunately we are used to scoring. We are an offensive team. We had five or six offensive players on the pitch at the end but we didnt manage to score so it's a bit frustrating.
It's part of the Premier League. The other day Manchester City had a similar possession against Everton and didn't win.
We have to find a way to be efficient even when the games are like that.
- Tired legs -
Wenger, whose side had beaten Ludogorets 6-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday, saw the Gunners run out of ideas and it was his own goalkeeper Petr Cech forced into a string of saves.

Bayern break Gladbach jinx to go three clear
Bayern Munich broke their Borussia Moenchengladbach jinx on Saturday as Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa netted in a 2-0 home win to put the champions three points clear on Saturday.
First-half goals by Bayern's Chile and Brazil internationals gave Carlo Ancelotti's Munich a first win over Gladbach in five German league matches after Borussia claimed home and away league wins in 2015.
After back-to-back draws in the league the win caps a good week for Bayern, who enjoyed a 4-1 romp against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday.
Ancelotti rested Germany forward Thomas Mueller from the starting line-up, but after Robert Lewandowski hit the post early on, Bayern went ahead after 16 minutes when Chile's Vidal headed home Rafinha's cross.
Winger Costa's crisp shot on 31 minutes doubled the lead in front of a packed house at Munich's Allianz Arena, while Gladbach's best chance came when winger Andre Hahn hit the post on 71 minutes.
Hertha Berlin went second with a 2-1 home win over Cologne, who lost their unbeaten record.
Hertha took the lead in the capital when Mitchell Weiser broke clear and his pass found Vedad Ibisevic, who netted his sixth goal in eight league games on 13 minutes.
Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste, the league's top scorer, levelled with his eighth goal in eight games on 65 minutes, but Hertha defender Niklas Stark headed the winner six minutes from time.
Cologne's Simon Zoller hit the post in the dying stages, then replacement Artjoms Rudnevs had a goal disallowed and the result leaves their side fourth.
Borussia Dortmund are three Bundesliga games without a win, although they fought back from two goals down to draw 3-3 at Ingolstadt and sit sixth.
Dortmund were 2-0 down as Israel international Almog Cohen and Paraguay's Dario Lezcano netted for Ingolstadt.
Cohen wriggled free of his marker from a free-kick before Lezcano looped his header into the top corner.
Borussia hit back when Mario Goetze set up Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to head home his seventh goal in his seven league games on 59 minutes, only for Lezcano to net Ingolstadt's third less than 60 seconds later to make it 3-1.
Dortmund dominated the final quarter as Adrian Ramos pulled a goal back on 69 minutes and Christian Pulisic scored the crucial equaliser in stoppage time.
The draw saw Ingolstadt climb off the bottom above Hamburg, who lost 3-0 to Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday.
- Schmidt off again -
Bayer Leverkusen slumped to a 3-0 defeat at home to Hoffenheim after playing virtually the entire match with 10 men.
Kevin Volland earned the fastest red card of the season with just six minutes gone for bringing down Kerem Demirbay, who was through on goal.
Demirbay, Sandro Wagner and Swiss midfielder Steven Zuber netted the visitors goals.
Bayer coach Roger Schmidt was sent to the stands in the wake of the second goal and faces a lengthy ban for his second dismissal this year.
Ten-man Wolfsburg dropped to 15th after their 3-1 defeat at Darmstadt left them seven games without a win.
Frenchman Valerien Ismael was appointed Wolfsburg's new head coach on Monday after Dieter Hecking was sacked.
Freiburg were 2-1 winners at home to Augsburg as they claimed a fourth victory in as many matches in front of their own fans. AFP

Sluggish Spurs worry Pochettino
Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted he is concerned after three successive draws called into question his squad's ability to stay the course in the Premier League and Champions League.
He acknowledged his players were not fresh in Saturday's goalless draw away to Bournemouth, which cost them the chance to top the Premier League table, especially in a sluggish opening 15 minutes.
Spurs had previously drawn 1-1 with West Bromwich Albion and 0-0 with Bayer Leverkusen, costing them momentum on both the domestic front and in Europe.
Yes, we are concerned, Pochettino said. It's true we need to improve if we want to be a real contender. It's true after two games away at West Bromwich and Bournemouth, you must win at least one.
But when you analyse the whole situation, we have to give value to the point because the effort was fantastic. We had some injuries. So I am happy.
The game was very competitive and very tough. Bournemouth pushed us a lot, but we were not fresh from the beginning. Our start was very sloppy, but after 15 minutes we started to manage the game.
His defence coped adequately without the injured Toby Alderweireld, but the continued absence of Harry Kane and his ability to create and convert chances meant that Tottenham's goal threat was restricted largely to shots from range.
The news that Kane, who scored five goals against Bournemouth in two victories last season, is not far away from a full recovery from his ankle injury was encouraging, if vague. I'm very pleased after we played in the Champions League and before that in West Bromwich, two tough games, because the players made a very big effort, said Pochettino.
But we missed the freshness to be sharp in the last third. Second half we dominated, but it was more difficult to create chances to score.
Pochettino said he did not see an incident in which substitute Moussa Sissoko caught Bournemouth's Harry Arter in the head with his elbow, which left home fans calling for a red card.
But he admitted that fatigue had contributed to four first-half yellow cards that left Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose, Erik Lamela and Delle Alli one careless lunge from being sent off. AFP
