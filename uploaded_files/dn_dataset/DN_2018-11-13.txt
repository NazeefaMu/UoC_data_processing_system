Debacle of the UNP and the duty of the voter
President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to dissolve the parliament sounds fairly prudent and timely since the country had plunged into anarchy and political wilderness due to the undemocratic statements flung by the Speaker in an attempt to harness majority will in it to help Ranil Wickremesinghe to hold power of the Temple Trees. It is evident that Ranil Wikremesinghe does not seem to believe his own voters, and thats why he wanted to convince the ambassadors from the West to impose their well-practised manoeuvres to manipulate the rein of internal political affairs of the country.
For the past three and half years, despite the flamboyant outbursts of the politicians, the economic policy of the country crippled its growth and hit the bottom of the economic stagnation. It was brought under tight international controls to such an extent that the country had to kneel down in front of the so-called international monetary bodies. This situation intensified the pressure on the already battered economy; and the currency, the real, collapsed to recorded low standards.
The prices soared for everything from the peoples daily provisions to the imported vehicles. Under these circumstances, President took the initiative to steer the country from the economic degradation it was heading for by appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister.
International community
Ranil Wikremesinghe was shrewdly aiming to focus the attention of the international community including the European Union to sanction the Mahinda Rajapaksas administration using the diplomatic and economic clout around the West. What these institutions were looking for was not to help resolve the situation but to topple the administration. The goal of their instruction was nothing else but regime change. If not for the wise decision taken by the President, the country would have easily be taken by the tentacles of economic hegemony of the West whose ultimate aim is to coerce the country to move on its banking and financial policies. With Mahinda Rajapaksa taking the responsibility of putting the country back on the track, there appeared a steady climb of the countrys currency, but it came to a halt because of the adverse situation created by the Speaker.
What happened to the national pride with Ranil Wikremesinghes administration The country was brought under regional ambitions, and as a result, the economically viable ventures which were started by the Mahinda Rajapaksas regime were sold. This, in turn, raised fears among the general public of foreign influence because the harbours are directly related to the internal security of any country.
What is ludicrous in its foreign policy were the attempts taken to hand over the rest of the ports of the country to our neighbour in order to pacify them and to douse their dislike towards us for handing over the Hambanthota harbour to China. If this is the nature of the foreign policy of a regime, it, no doubt, raises the question of threat to the countrys sovereignty.
The real economic pain was felt by the poor when a more rigorous set of sanctions on the essential goods and the transactions was introduced. The measures taken by the government under the pretext of dealing with the foreign debt problem caused by the previous regime burdened the people and reduced their purchases nearly 50 % towards the end of the three and half years period. People found it very difficult to make their ends meet. The fact of the matter is the strategies adopted by the government such a fuel pricing formula forced the people to tighten their belts further and to watch how friendly alliances of the government empty the coffer through the frauds such as Bond Issue controversy.
It was right for the leadership of the country to worry and to do what was expected from him, that is, to think of the country before his political affiliations. His moves already appear to have an effect. Political analysts project that holding general elections will definitely pave the way for establishing political stability that will help the economy grow pulling it out from its present dilapidating state.
Fresh elections
With the politicians from the green hot on their heels seeking redress from the Supreme Court for what they term as unconstitutional moves by the President, and trying to cover their failure to improve the economy, the Presidents sudden decision to call for fresh elections will strengthen democracy allowing people to decide what they can do to safeguard their country from political and economic chaotic situation.
What is the sublime duty of the voter at this juncture Should they let those politicians who took them on a ride trick them again It is the supreme duty of the people of the country to elect those who are truly congruent and genuine in their thoughts and deeds to serve the country. The development gained by pawning the country to the international community or institutions must be understood as a political hara-kiri. We all must lobby for an independent state devoid of the visible or invisible strings of the West with which they trap us either covertly or overtly.
Though we are torn apart by political colours, we must be intelligent and modest enough to understand with our social consciousness who have displayed over the years their immaculate love for the country, its environs and its people.
The lessons learnt in the recent past of the country when it was gripped in a civil war can guide the people to realize who the real leaders are to take the country into the future in order to turn it into the miracle of Asia in all its splendour and glory.

Dhawan hits 92 as India sweep T20 series
Chennai, Sunday: Opener Shikhar Dhawan smashed 92 as India completed a six-wicket Twenty20 international win on the last ball against West Indies on Sunday to sweep the three-match series.
Dhawan put on a crucial 130-run third wicket stand with Rishabh Pant, who hit 58, to bring India close to their target of 182 before West Indies hit back in Chennai.
Pant was out in the 19th over and Dhawan lost his wicket on the penultimate ball of the match, but Manish Pandey hit the winning run to deny West Indies any chance of a consolation victory. A tie would have taken the match into a super over.
The result caps off a complete domination by India, who had won the Tests 2-0 and then the one-day international series 3-1 against the visiting West Indians.
Paceman Keemo Paul took two wickets including the dangerous Pant in a penultimate over that yielded just three runs, leaving India needing five from the final six balls.
Nicholas Pooran stood out with the bat for West Indies in the final game of a tough tour, with a 25-ball 53 that guided the visitors to 181-3 after electing to bat first. But the left-handed pair of Dhawan and Pant put the hosts chase on track after they had lost two early wickets including their in-form skipper Rohit Sharma for four.
We wanted to be ruthless and not take a backseat. This kind of performance gives a lot of confidence. We didnt want to be complacent and wanted to come out and win, said Sharma.
As a team there is always scope for improvement.
Dhawan registered his first fifty of the series across formats as he batted with assurance, hitting 10 fours and two sixes during his 62-ball knock.
Pant, 21, complimented his senior partner with some lusty hitting in his 38-ball stay at the crease.
Earlier Pooran put on a key 87-run unbeaten stand with Darren Bravo, who made 43, to give the tourists a competitive total. AFP

Dreamers domain
In my second dream, thus addressed King Kosol to his sole holy audience, the Buddha, to puzzle out some mysterious visions he had in sleep. Small trees and shrubs burst through the soil and grown hardly a span or two high when they suddenly bore flowers and fruits. The king had 15 more dreams vivid in imagery. Mighty bulls making a big show of fighting only to leave the battle empty-handed, elderly cows suckling from baby calves, the young calves forced to pull heavy wagons to no avail, two-headed horses fed fodder on both mouths, old jackals relieving themselves on a gold bowl and so on. In response to each and every dream, the Buddha comforts the monarchy assuring the effect of such dreams would materialize only in a future period when the world will fall into decay and shrunken human life-span.
Whether this Jataka-book incident has a genuine historic accreditation or not, keep that argument aside. The mythical, philosophical and aesthetic element of the 16-dream long narrative has inspired Professor Ariyaratne Atugala to sign in his latest theatrical endeavour, Maha Supina. The play will be staged at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre on November 16 at 6.30 pm. The lotus pond-configured theatre designed for swanky productions is no novel experience for Atugala whose previous production, Mahasamayama, had over 10 runs at the same premises.
Mahasupina is Professor Atugalas teaching-learning project introduced for the Mass Communication undergraduates of Kelaniya University.
The prevailing classroom teaching methodology is coarse. The knowledge acquisition is there, no doubt, but not to a practical height. This phenomenon kind of forced me to initiate this teaching-learning project. The inspiration was already present as my guru, Professor Sunanda Mahendra, has brought forward several theatre productions as teaching-learning projects, Atugala makes his objective clear.
The play features a cast of seasoned performers as well in addition to the undergraduates. Among them are Akhila Danuddara, Saranga Disasekara, Nissanka Diddeniya, Madani Malwatta, Sulochana Weerasinghe, Buddhadasa Withanarachchi and Janaka Ranasinghe, with Ravibandu Vidyapathi and Tharupathi Munasinghe handling choreography and music.
The professional-undergraduate combo serves a purpose.
If I cast only undergraduates, they will acquire only my knowledge. Now, they have the opportunity to work with the veterans. On this platform, our undergraduates will learn quite a lot of things directly as well as indirectly. I remember some undergraduates could not even improvise the scripted dialogues. Within a few months working with the veterans, they befit even the lead roles, the academic turned thespian makes a case for his casting.
The journey from the basic amenities of Kelaniya University Dharmaloka Hall, where the production was previously staged, to the plush atmosphere of Nelum Pokuna has brought in quite a few marked differences. Video mapping, executed for the first time in Sri Lankas theatre history, will be employed at the Nelum Pokuna. Sound system and stage management are two more remarkable aspects. The undergraduates bogged down by the exhaustive confines of the traditional theatre will enjoy ample freedom before a wider spectacle.
The academia and the external society mourn a gulf to an ivory-tower proportion. Universities, the most sacrosanct of the academic institutions, teach art, whereas the external society practises the same. Ariyaratne Atugala reminds us that it should not be so. The mass communication professor admits that there could be a conflict of interests when he chooses to become a thespian when theatre arts are taught as a separate subject.
But then again, theatrical arts cannot be confined to a subject territory. Ediriweera Sarachchandra, for instance, was a linguistic expert who used his academic prowess to usher in a fresh lease of life to the vernacular theatre. Jothipala and Khemadasa marked their niche as professional artistes but they belong to no school as such, comments Atugala, entering into details.
Art is a right of any citizen. Any citizen has a right to engage in art.
That said, Atugala also wants to introduce theatre as a secondary unit to the mainstream subject, mass communication, to inculcate creative spirit among the undergraduates. The undergraduates interested in theatre will be able to grab that opportunity to kindle their aesthetic spirit. Atugala firmly believes that the theatre provides ample opportunity to personality development and tension management. Improvisation provides room to develop ones personality.
Above all else, what ails the local theatre is the poor presentation. Lack of a proper national programme has made it worse. The global theatre has gone so long, which is something we cannot turn a blind eye on.
We have been used to the mobile theatre more than enough. We should move on. The developed countries have theatres enjoying a regular influx of spectators. Our own Nelum Pokuna must be privileged with a similar phenomenon. For instance, the followers of God Katharagama make it a point to visit his sacred site at any cost. They do it with utmost reverence and affection towards the god, Atugala offers an explanation.
The intrusion of cinema, television, internet and ultimately the smart devices held on palms would not affect the stage according to the mass communication professor. He has his own experience to support his claim.
Within one year and three months, we had Mahasamayama on Nelum Pokuna over ten times attracting a sizeable audience each time. The audience included expatriates and foreigners as well, Atugala explained. We will never grow tired of theatres, yet, Professor Atugala is quick to add, the artistes of this day must look upon the technical aspect as well. Theatre has grown to many proportions along with the inevitable technological expansion. That is something no artiste can afford to overlook.

No matter how big you get, its impossible to outgrow the love of a good lullaby. Just ask Faa Mai.
At 6 years old, Faa Mai is just about on the eve of adulthood, but the happy elephant still enjoys nothing more than hearing the soothing sound of her favorite human singing a sweet little song to her as she slips off to sleep.
Born on the grounds of Elephant Nature Park, a safe haven for pachyderms in Thailand, Faa Mai has forged a close bond with sanctuary founder Lek Chailet, whose dedication to improving the lives of elephants is as touching as the simple music that she sings.
The relationship between Faa Mai and Lek can show you that animals and human[s] are not different, writes the sanctuary. Once we give love, definitely we can get love as well.
When all has gone dark and quiet at night, the world can seem a cold, scary place - but theres nothing like the comfort of a gentle song to cozy a sleepy soul, no matter who the listener might be.

Equality to the fore
Identity politics is perishable. It seems true in Sri Lanka in particular and in almost all the countries where parliamentary politics prevail. A close perusal of the election results including by elections in the post independent era of our country drives home the concept that identity politics has done much harm to the nation than good. Now, the time is opportune to make a critical analysis of the tragi-comic status quo political crisis of the nation from a different angle in the context of global politics.
In my view, the parliament should essentially be a broad church in order to find solutions to our burning issues. There is nothing to hide to the international community. It is crystal clear that almost all the party leaders adhered to identity politics to grab the ruling power of the country.
Edmund Burke, the iconic political philosopher, needs no introduction to the students of political science but, to most of the present day politicians. The quotable quotes by this great Guru are many. He identifies the political animals in the society divided into little platoons. A profound analysis of this phrase could have meant to refer to the grouping of miscellaneous types of individual voters into clusters glued together for a common goal. They declare that they strive to do good to the whole community.
In Sri Lanka, the change of presidents and prime ministers happen in the most unexpected manner.The writer would like to proceed with his argument to make the current parliament an organisation that would entertain the opinions of all the stakeholders with the same weight. In other words, to say no to identity politics in capital letters. In this sense, the prime minister has to deliver the goods to the nation.
The elected members to the parliament on the party ticket are obliged to respect his or her supremacy for the smooth functioning of the system. The political turncoats become crucial decision makers or kingpin factors of changing governments under these circumstances. The west minister system rejects all these undemocratic acts because it vehemently advocates democracy. The other side of the same coin should display that all the members are equal. As the old adage goes, one should not be more equal than others.
Ideas and values
The rapport between the prime minister and the party members is of paramount importance. Thus, there should be a constant dialogue between the prime minister and the elected parliamentarians because they would tend to think that they would do better than some ministers of the Cabinet. It was very palpable to me many a time and discernible to the public again and again. Mishandling of this situation has proved fatal many a time.
Ideas and values play a pivotal role in politics in democracies. Only high calibre politicians with a proven track record would win in this race. Charisma matters a lot in politics. Lack of high presentation has proved detrimental not only in the recent past, but also throughout the political history of our paradise isle.
The soul of the political party should be kept untouched for short term gains. There should be changes of the political journey of a country for a thriving democracy. The so-called January 8 silent revolution was not result oriented because the left hand didnt know what the right hand was doing. The Good Governance cauldron was boiling without the necessary ingredients, even without a drop of beer because of public protest. Burke further adds, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of conservation. The warmth of change was not palpable to the Sri Lankan voter. Now, the Sri Lankan electorate could be optimistic as most of the policymakers and the members of the legislature have learnt bitter lessons from the past. To form a profound view of the status quo of Sri Lankas political crisis, a quick assessment of the global political scenario seems to be a guiding light. Failure of most of the political orthodoxies around the world signals us to take a U-turn in policy making.
It is quite evident that most of the political pundits have taken very disastrous decisions in the past without feeling the pulse of the nation. In Mark Twains Prince and the Pauper most correctly concluded that the boy in mothers warmth was not her Tom Canty. But our Yahapalanaya advocates were not able to deliver the things because they were not able to feel the pulse of the nation. During the last decade, the unbiased intellectuals witnessed many a failure in global politics. The following stand in array would convince it you to a great extent. Donald Trump emerged the victor in America, the British voted to leave the European Union, and mishandling of the immigration issue brought adverse consequences to Angela Markel.
Political campaign
Stagnant wages crushed most of the segments of the public. But, due to employment generation for political gains and population explosions drastically reduced the unemployment figures in most of the countries. Yet, people everywhere do not seem contented. Some governments printed currency notes as a short term remedy, but it proved a flop.
Gama Apita slogan of the extremist political parties such as JVP and the Progressive Front limited their political campaign targeted at a very narrow strip of voters. Most of the radical left parties still believe that they could come to power using the university students as their cats paw. Kepuwath Kola or Nil has become another failure. Keeping their electorates as home pockets based on the caste system and winning on the religious card do not prove long lasting. Some political parties seek winning by assuring the empowerment of the underdog and forget even the electorate after winning.
Even the silver tongue of Asia came to power by uniting sangha, veda, guru, govi, kamkaru. One time Oxford Union president Caraka laments in his magnum opus writing I go West about the realities of India.
To conclude, I vehemently advocate the doing away with identity politics in Sri Lanka for the good of the nation.
The August assembly should essentially be a broad church to realize our cherished dreams; otherwise we will have to bask in the ancient glory without moving a step further.

Federer crashes to Nishikori in ATP Finals opener
LONDON: Roger Federer suffered a shock straight-sets defeat to Kei Nishikori at the ATP Finals on Sunday, severely denting his bid for the 100th title of his illustrious career.
The Swiss, who has won the season-ending event a record six times, produced an uncharacteristically error-prone and fractious display in the round-robin match as the Japanese seventh seed prevailed 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
The result means Federer is now in danger of failing to qualify for the semi-finals for just the second time in 16 appearances at the event.
I felt we both struggled, you know, throughout the first set, he said. You could tell it was sort of a first round. I had my chances maybe a bit more than he did. Then I started to feel better in the second set. I think we both did. The level went up. Unfortunately I couldn't keep the lead that I got early. That was important, I think, at the end. That was the key of the match. Federer, 37, has beaten Nishikori in Shanghai and Paris in recent weeks but despite having the backing of a full house at the O2 Arena, he never really settled into a groove.
The normally cool Swiss was warned by the umpire for ball abuse in the 12th game after Nishikori produced a staggering backhand winner down the line.
The Swiss great made 20 unforced errors in the first set and Nishikori capitalised, forcing a tie-break in which he raced to a 6/1 lead before sealing it 7/4.
Federer, showing real urgency, broke Nishikori immediately at the start of the second set but it proved a false dawn as he lost his own serve immediately Nishikori broke again in the sixth game and kept his nerve, serving out for victory.
I lost to him twice in the last two months so I played more aggressively and things started working, especially in the second set. There were some lucky points but I played well today, said Nishikori.
Overall the statistics made grim reading for Federer, who made a total of 34 unforced errors against 19 winners.
Federer denied that cutting back on his schedule increased the pressure on him to do well at the tournaments he did play.
I don't think, per se, I'm playing worse because of it, he said. I think I've had that pressure, not going out early, most of my career. - Anderson win - The ATP Finals is contested by the eight players who have accumulated the most ranking points over the season separated into two groups, with the best four players reaching the knockout semi-finals stage.

Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama briefed foreign diplomats based in Colombo at the Foreign Affairs Ministry yesterday.
The Minister clarified the chain of events that compelled President Maithripala Sirisena to arrive at the decision to dissolve Parliament.
He emphasised the constitutionality of the steps taken by President Sirisena and added that having being elected through a nation-wide vote, the President derives his authority directly from the people of Sri Lanka.
The Minister said in the event of a conflict between the organs of government, seeking a mandate from people who are sovereign ensures that democracy prevails.
Minister Amunugama also made special note of the peaceful atmosphere that continues to prevail in Sri Lanka, in the midst of internal political changes.
This is to the credit of the people of Sri Lanka and re-affirms the democratic traditions of the country. Through the measures adopted, the Minister added, the Executive has discharged his responsibility of ensuring the security and safety of all Sri Lankans, which may have been compromised by the growing tension and the departure from parliamentary traditions.
Several country representatives present at the briefing expressed their confidence in the strength of Sri Lankas long-standing democratic traditions in resolving this internal matter.

Invite to Dpls., foreign journalists to Parliament a sinister plan-Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday said that there was a sinister plan to invite members of the diplomatic corps and foreign journalists to Parliament and instigate a clash within the Chamber in their presence to create an international slur on the country.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday, Minister Samarasinghe said that some UNP MPs stated that there is going to be a bloodbath on November 14 and they challenged the government to convene Parliament according to the standing orders.
These plans aroused some sort of suspicion in the Presidents mind about a possibility of damaging the countrys image and an illegal functioning of Parliament. Therefore, finally he decided that the dissolution of Parliament was the only solution for all these issues, the Minister said. According to the President, one of the main reasons for the dissolution of Parliament was the behaviour of the Speaker.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who acted beyond his Constitutional powers met several ambassadors and tried to mislead them by showing only the English copy of the Constitution, Minister Samarasinghe said. By doing that, he only wanted to accomplish his political objectives and he didnt think about the damage done by him to the countrys image, the Minister said.
President Sirisena never expected this type of behaviour from the Speaker and his politically biased behaviour aroused a suspicion whether he would acted beyond the Standing Orders.
The Speaker summoned three Party Leaders meetings and during these meetings he showed a file and claimed that there was a document signed by 116 MPs and because of that he wanted to hold a vote on the same day Parliament reconvened. But he never showed us the document, he charged.
Commenting on a media release issued by the former Speaker stating that he is the one who decides the legitimacy of the decisions by the President, the Minister said that it is questionable whether he was appointed to the Supreme Court recently.

Japan to work with SL irrespective of which Govt. in power
Japan will continue to work in close co-operation with Sri Lanka irrespective of whichever Government is in power, a senior official at the Japanese Foreign Ministry said.
The Director, Development Administration Division, International Cooperation Bureau at the Japanese Foreign Ministry Koji Yagi said Japans foreign policy towards Sri Lanka has not changed as a result of the political changes in the country.
Yagi said that the current development projects under Japans economic corporation in Sri Lanka will continue and those in the pipeline will be discussed with officials.
Japan has always been and will be committed to promoting peace, stability and prosperity in Sri Lanka he added.
Assistant Director, Country Assistance Planning Division 1, International Cooperation Bureau, Naoki Kawai stated that Japans assistance to Sri Lanka aims to help Sri Lanka in addressing its challenges and promoting further economic growth.
Highlighting some of the major ongoing projects Kawai said Japan has granted loan aid amounting to 24.93 billion yen for the national transmission and distribution network development and efficiency improvement project in Sri Lanka, 31.810 billion yen loan aid for Kalu Ganga water supply expansion project, 23.137 billion yen loan aid for Anuradhapura North water supply project phase 2 and 13.717 billion yen loan aid for digitalization of terrestrial broadcasting project.

The offer to repurchase shares amounting to a potential outlay of Rs. 11.10 billion reflects the view of the Board and management that the JKH share is currently not reflective of the value of the company and does not adequately represent the growth prospects of the company and therefore presents an opportunity for the company to repurchase its shares.
Further, the strength of the JKH Balance Sheet, along with existing cash reserves, is more than adequate to fund the Companys planned investment pipeline while retaining its track record of dividend payout.

Jones tells Japan to pray ahead of England clash
Twickenham, Sunday: England coach Eddie Jones has advised Japan to go to the temple and pray as he promised to show no mercy when the team he coached at the 2015 World Cup come to Twickenham.
England will head into the November 17 clash buoyed, if ultimately frustrated by a hugely encouraging display in an agonising 16-15 loss to reigning world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.
That result, allied to Englands 12-11 win over South Africa in their opening November international, has calmed the fevered debate over Jones future that erupted after a run of five straight defeats earlier this year.
Jones knows how much Japan would love to cause another shock on English soil having guided them to a stunning 34-32 win over South Africa in Brighton during the last World Cup -- a result now widely regarded as the biggest upset in rugby union history.
Japan captain Michael Leitch was quoted as saying recently weve been bullied a lot by Eddie and would like to give it back by beating England as a sign of gratitude.
Jones responded with a stark warning for his old side. AFP

Lankan owned Peace Air to take wings on Feb. 4
Creating aviation history, Sri Lankas first privately owned airline, Peace Air is scheduled to be airborne from February 4 (Independence Day), Chairman Peace Air Pvt Ltd, Gamini H. Wethasinghe told Daily News Business.
Peace Air will be operating daily direct flights to five new destinations in China, starting from Wuhan under the first phase of our operations. The other four destinations that would be included to the schedule are Xi, An Urumqi, Chongqing and Hardin. We have also tied up with a leading Chinese travel agency to market these routes and they have guaranteed us of an 80% load factor and large volumes of Cargo.
From March Peace air plans to operate flights to Indonesia targeting the Umrah (Muslim Religious traffic) and then to Saudi Arabia targeting Haj passengers. This too would be a daily flight.
Weththasinghe said that they will initially take delivery of a new 747 aircraft for the Chinese sector which would be a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner which could accommodate 265 passengers. This would be followed up by a Boeing Deamliner 787-10 that could accommodate 330 passengers.
The new airline has already placed order for these two brand new 747 aircraft with Boeing and will also look at buying eight other aircraft.
He said that they will initially obtain US$ 2 billion investment from US and Chinese investors for this operation.
Peace Air will also deploy a 15 member US crew including pilots for a period of six month and they will be gradually phased out replacing them with Sri Lanka crew who are working overseas. We will use SriLankan Catering, he said
He ruled out operating flights to Mattala and said the Hambantota airport would come under their radar when they look at operating flights to Indian destinations towards mid next year.
Peace Air will also open their passenger sales office in December at Green Lanka Building, Nawam Mawatha, Colombo 02. We also hope to offer commissions for airline travel agents in Sri Lanka, he added.

Magistrate orders Police to file amended charge sheet
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne yesterday ordered the Cinnamon Gardens Police to file an amended charge sheet against National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa and five other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
The NFF staged the protest march against the visiting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein On February 6, 2016.
On a previous occassion, the Cinnamon Gardens Police submitted an amended charge sheet related to six suspects before the Magistrate and stated that they were still to find any information regarding the seventh suspect.
Six suspects including NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne and Mohammed Muzammil.
The seventh accused Lalith Chaminda Jayalal did not appear before the Court yesterday.
Cinnamon Gardens Police informed the Magistrate that the suspects who organised the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from the Police to stage the march.
Police further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid licence. Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing an inconvenience to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
After considering all the matters, the Magistrate ordered Cinnamon Gardens Police to file an amended charge sheet against the first six suspects and fixed further inquiries for November 16.

Man City dominate Man Utd, Liverpool win
London, Sunday: Manchester City stormed back to the top of the Premier League with a 3-1 derby win at home to Manchester United on Sunday as Liverpool maintained their title challenge to the champions with a 2-0 victory over Fulham.
Chelsea, like the top two, remain unbeaten under Maurizio Sarri but lost ground in a goalless draw at home to Everton.
Arsenal also missed the chance to leapfrog North London rivals Spurs into fourth and needed Henrikh Mkhitaryan's late equaliser to salvage a 1-1 draw with Wolves at the Emirates.
City remain two points clear of Liverpool, but open four-point gap on Chelsea.
A fourth league defeat of the season leaves United languishing in eighth, 12 points off the top.
Mohamed Salah scored to keep Liverpool on Manchester City's coat tails with a 2-0 win over Fulham. AFP
Goals early in each half from David Silva and Sergio Aguero left City in a commanding position before an Anthony Martial penalty gave United hope of a comeback.
But Ilkay Gundogan put the result beyond doubt four minutes from time with a third goal that crowned a sublime 44-pass move.
"I think Man City right now and Liverpool, Chelsea, and even Arsenal and Tottenham, I think they have numbers to be champion, not just City. We're just two points in front," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
"What is important is that we are consistent, that we play most of the time good, and always I see many things that we can improve."
Fight for top four
United manager Jose Mourinho accepted his side are now just fighting to try and make the top four having finished second to City last season.
"Since the beginning of the season, we knew that our second position last season was a fantastic achievement for us, and this season we are going to fight for the top four," said Mourinho.
"To speak about the title you need to be in the top positions. So let's fight to close the gap and jump into the top four, if one day we jump into the top four, we'll see what the difference is."
United scored twice in the closing five minutes to secure a hard-fought 2-1 win away to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, while City thrashed Shakhtar Donetsk 6-0 at the Etihad.
And Mourinho used his side's tougher preparation to excuse the gulf in class.
"Everybody has to agree, it is one thing to go to Juventus and play against one of the best teams in the world for 90 minutes, another thing to beat Shakhtar Donetsk at home 6-0 and be very relaxed," said Mourinho. "We arrive in different circumstances."
Earlier, Liverpool briefly went top by inflicting Fulham's seventh straight defeat at Anfield.
But they needed a huge slice of luck in 14 seconds that completely changed the game shortly before the break.
Aleksandar Mitrovic headed home for the visitors only to be wrongly ruled offside.
The hosts quickly broke upfield as Alisson and Trent Alexander-Arnold freed Mohamed Salah to score his eighth goal of the season.
"The most important thing is reacting in a situation like that and that was brilliant. Allison, Trent, Mo and done, it was a fantastic situation," said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, whose side put the result beyond doubt when Xherdan Shaqiri made it 2-0 in the 53rd minute.
Chelsea dominated possession at Stamford Bridge, but could not find a way past the inspired Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal to leave Sarri frustrated.
"At the beginning we moved the ball too slowly, so it is easy for the opposition to defend and impossible for us to be dangerous," bemoaned Sarri.
Arsenal were in danger of defeat for the first time since August after falling behind to Ivan Cavaleiro's 13th-minute goal before Mkhitaryan came off the bench to rescue a point for the Gunners. AFP

Mushfiqurs record innings puts Bdesh on top
Dhaka, Monday: Mushfiqur Rahim became the first wicketkeeper-batsman in history to score two double hundreds in Tests as Bangladesh built a strong total in the second Test against Zimbabwe in Dhaka on Monday.
Mushfiqur hit an unbeaten 219 to help Bangladesh declare their first innings at 522-7 an hour into the final session, before the hosts reduced Zimbabwe to 25 for one at stumps on the second day.
Taijul Islam removed Hamilton Masakadza for 14 after an edge flew to Mehidy Hasan at first slip for Bangladeshs first breakthrough.
Masakadza was earlier spared when he was dropped at seven by Ariful Haque at first slip off the bowling of debutant Khaled Ahmed. Brian Chari, 10 not out, and nightwatchman Donald Tiripano (naught) prevented further damage.
Zimbabwe, ahead in the two-match tournament 1-0, needs at least a draw to win their first Test series in seven years.
But it was Mushfiqur who shone, pulling leg-spinner Brendon Mavuta for a single at square leg after the tea break to become the first wicketkeeper-batsman ever to score two double tonnes in Test cricket.
I wasnt in bad form in Tests, but yes I wasnt getting a big innings. I believed that it was around the corner, Mushfiqur said at the close of second days play.
I knew that converting a fifty would ensure a big score. I had a lot of self-belief. I had my preparations in place.
Mushfiqur, who played 421 balls and hit 18 fours and a six, also surpassed Shakib al Hasan to become the highest individual scorer in an innings for Bangladesh in Test cricket. Skipper Mahmudullah Riyad called the batsmen to the dressing room soon after Mushfiqur nudged Sean Williams for a single to pass Shakibs 217 against New Zealand at Wellington in 2017.
Mushfiqur shared a record 144-run in their unbroken eighth wicket stand with Mehidy Hasan, after Kyle Jarvis took two scalps in the afternoon session to complete his third five-wicket haul in Tests.
Mushfiqur also had a hand in the previous eighth wicket record when he added 113 with Naeem Islam against England in 2010. Jarvis, who claimed three wickets on the opening day, removed Mahmudullah for 36 and Ariful Haque for four but Mushfiqur and Mehidy denied the visitors further success. Resuming on 303-5, Bangladesh began cautiously on day two, scoring just 22 runs in the first hour before Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah finally opened up.
Mushfiqur, who now has six Test centuries, took 56 balls to score his first boundary in the morning.
Zimbabwe suffered a blow when fast bowler Tendai Chatara was stretchered off after damaging his hamstring while delivering a ball in the morning.
Zimbabwe Cricket said Chatara had suffered a suspected quad muscle strain and was out of the match. Zimbabwe won the opener by 151 runs in Sylhet, their first Test win in five years. AFP

Owner of Nihal Shantha and Sons Nihal Shantha, a renowned cinnamon exporter in the country was awarded the Presidential Exports Award for Emerging Exporter of the Year in the Spice Exports Category.
The Presidential Exports Awards was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Nihal Shantha had entered the spice business in 1983 under the guidance of his father and today he is one of the most prominent exporters of cinnamon in the Southern Province. Having finished school, he served in the Sri Lanka Navy for about 13 years and there after returned to the cinnamon trade to restart his business on a small scale. This has grown to be one of the leading cinnamon exporting companies in Sri Lanka. At present he exports cinnamon to the United States and countries in South America and Europe. I started this business with nothing. To grow this business to this level, I received a lot of support from my family, friends and employees as well as banks and financial institutions. At the same time I would like to appreciate the assistance given to me by Ravi Silva from the G.P. De Silva Company. It was Ravi Silva who was able to break the monopoly of the cinnamon export trade in Colombo and bring the cinnamon export business to the South, Shantha said speaking on his achievements thus far. He further stated that he was able to build an internationally and nationally renowned strong company with the full confidence of his customers through discipline, commitment and sheer effort.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also expected to attend the function, the Indian media reported. That will be Modis first visit to the Maldives since becoming Prime Minister in 2014.
Rajapaksa was invited even before he was sworn-in as Lankan Prime Minister on October 26. But he will attend the inaugural as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, his staff said. Rajapaksa has had close relations with the Maldives since he became President of Sri Lanka in 2005. In July 2010, during a visit to the Maldives he mediated between President Mohammed Nasheed and the Opposition led by Ahamed Thasmeen Ali. Rajapaksa met the Maldivan Chief Justice, the Speaker of the Majilis (Parliament), former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and delegations of the Maldivian Democratic Party led by Nasheed and the Opposition consisting of the DRP, Qaumi Party, Jumhoori Party and Peoples Alliance.
The Opposition agreed, in the presence of President Rajapaksa, to constitute a committee of six members of the Majlis, comprising three each from the Government and Opposition, to carry forward a dialogue addressing the pressing issues aimed at the smooth functioning of the legislative process. Maldivian Vice-President Dr. Mohammed Waheed Hassan speaking at the 65th Session of the UN General Assembly thanked Sri Lanka and President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his support during the Maldivian political crisis. I would like to thank the international community for their engagement and assistance to find a peaceful solution to the political conflict in the Maldives, especially President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka for his constructive contributions, the Maldivian Vice-President had said. He called on the international community to support Sri Lanka in her post-war reconstruction and reconciliation efforts.
Furthermore, the Maldives welcomes Sri Lankas success in their reconciliation efforts and calls on the international community to support their efforts to rebuild a nation torn apart by 25 years of sustained conflict, Waheed said at the General Debate. The Maldives supported Sri Lanka at the post-war sessions of the UN Human Rights Council meetings in Geneva when Sri Lanka faced severe criticisms and hostile resolutions for war crimes allegedly committed by its armed forces in the final phase of the war against the LTTE in 2009.

Presidents reasons valid
As our front page main story yesterday aptly put it, President Maithripala Sirisena has set the record straight on the circumstances that compelled him to dissolve Parliament. They, no doubt, all cumulatively had a profound effect which finally forced the hand of the President. Issuing a special statement detailing the reasons as to why he took the decision President Sirisena maintained that all democratic norms were being flouted and revealed how MPs were being traded for sums ranging from Rs.150 million to as much as Rs.500 million. The President said it was really a regrettable situation where a representative elected by the voters had to be traded in this manner.
The buying of MPs was not a recent phenomenon but had been practiced from as far back as 1964. On that occasion the UNP managed to contrive a mass exodus from the then Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike that led to that Government being defeated on the Throne Speech. Rumours were rife that a well known power-broker at the time engineered the defections by throwing money bags, when the Government was set to take over the Lake House Group of Newspapers through the Press Council Bill, the individual in question having a major stake in the concern. Years later, in 2000, there was yet another instance of mass buying of MPs at the height of the Package affair where CBK sought to divide the country into a Union of Regions. On that occasion, both sides went on a buying spree, with the UNP even sending some of its MPs abroad to keep them out of temptations way.
The President gave as another reason (for the termination of Parliament) the intransigence of former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in failing to abide by the Constitution and Parliamentary Standing Orders and arrogating to himself powers that were not his to claim. The President said; I am very disappointed by his (former Speakers) actions. It is the Parliamentary tradition to have the Speaker act impartially and independent of party politics. However Jayasuriya chose to disregard Parliamentary Standing Orders, procedures and norms and not accept the Prime Minister appointed by the Executive, releasing statements to that effect, which left me no choice but to dissolve Parliament.
But what would, no doubt, have been the most compelling reason that eventually forced the hand of the President was the very real possibility of bloodletting in the August Assembly when it convened on November 14. Like the President noted, grim forebodings were in the air and the possibility of bloodshed on the floor of the House could not have been ruled out. The President himself alluded to this when he said;through various media briefings, both sides stressed that there could be a violent situation when Parliament reconvened on Nobember14, even resulting in the death of some. If I had allowed that when Parliament met on November 14, it would not only have been bloodshed in Parliament but was likely to have spread to your towns, villages and every street in the country.
The President opined that he opted for the best solution, that of not permitting violence to take place on a large scale across the country but to respect democracy and let the 15 million voters decide who should be sent to Parliament.
No right thinking citizen of this country could find fault with the Presidents reasoning and the eventual decision. Had some untoward incident occurred at a time emotions were running high in the midst of a highly charged political atmosphere, there is no knowing as to where things would have ended up. We say this because unlike in the times of the immediate post Independence Parliaments where politicians with staid deportment, stature and standing adorned the Assembly what we have today is a House which is in constant turmoil with violent behaviour and fisticuffs being commonplace. This is because on both sides there are those who were nominated for their muscle power where the brawn prevails over brain with no room for dignity and decorum, two terms widely used to underline Parliamentary sanctity.
President Sirisena, no doubt, is well aware of the state of play and was obviously leaving nothing to chance. With the former Speaker expressing his intention to go for a floor test at the very outset of sittings, this was bound to have resulted in unprecedented violence going by what we have already seen at lesser volatile situations in the House. Besides, the President had acted well within the Constitution as attested by independent legal opinion.
Which leaves us with the next question as to which criteria will be adopted when picking candidates for the General Election by all parties. There have been a clamour from several quarters, nay an outcry, that professionals and the educated be liberally included in the lists for the greater benefit of the country. We hope that this will be a golden opportunity to change the present political culture where misfits and undesirables prevail. We need true, honest and hardworking servants of the people in the House from all shades of political opinion.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday conducted an inspection tour of the Moragahakanda, Kalu Ganga Irrigation development projects and was told by Mahaweli officials that the dam was filling up at a satisfactory level.
The filling of the reservoir began in July of this year and with the rains, they expect it to be full by January. The completion of this dam will help farmers even during the drought season to continue with their irrigation activities.
The President, who held a meeting with officials after the inspection tour, discussed the progress of the inland fisheries industry, power generation, tourism, and other additional industries created as a result of the Morgahakanda-Kalu Ganga Irrigation Development project.
In addition, the development works in the new Laggala town, Sri Lanka first organic agriculture park and special zonal agricultural projects were discussed.
The President paid attention to the release of lands in the Mahaweli zones and asked that officials complete the processes soon. The President thereafter visited the Gem and Jewellery Authority on an inspection tour and later visited the reception area of the Presidential Secretariat to inspect whether visitors to the Secretariat had adequate facilities.

## Title: Rehab and the addict

Rehab and the addict
The path to drug addiction begins with the voluntary act of using drugs and over time, a persons ability to choose not to do so becomes compromised. Seeking and taking the drug becomes compulsive. According to medical experts, this is mostly due to the effects of long-term drug exposure on the function of the brain. Addiction affects parts of the brain involved with reward and motivation, learning and memory, and control over behaviour. This habit invariably leads to other anti-social activities to fund the addiction. In the end, most addicts end up behind bars.
This is not the ideal solution. This is a group of people whom society prefers to ignore and discard. However, based on a concept by the former Chairperson of the Dangerous Drugs Control Board, Leysha de Silva, the former government took steps to turn the Kandakadu ex-LTTE rehabilitation centre into a drug rehabilitation centre, around 2013.
Rehabilitation
While the ex-combatants were being released after rehabilitation and reintegrated into society, the facility run by military personnel attached to the Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation was put to good use to rehabilitate these drug addicts.
At the time, many were sceptical as to its effectiveness and some even criticised the government accusing them of trying to militarise such institutions. There are many such drug rehabilitation centres throughout the country, and although many of them provide treatment, these drug addicts somehow get their hands on drugs even while in rehabilitation.
However, the Kandakadu and Senapura Drug Rehab Centres are run in accordance with military discipline and throughout their training the addicts are kept away from drugs. Even the staff members are thoroughly checked prior to entering the premises. Staff members are also not allowed to smoke cigarettes within the facility.
Despite the strict military discipline and training, the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake and his Deputy, Brigadier Darshana Liyanage ensure that those who are undergoing the rehabilitation programme are treated with kindness and respect.
One may ask if rehabilitation is effective and can drug addiction be treated Yes, but its not simple. Because addiction is a chronic disease, people cant simply stop using drugs for a few days and be cured. Most patients need long-term or repeated care to stop using narcotics completely and recover their lives.
The main aim of this treatment programme is to ensure that these persons stop using drugs, stay drug-free, and be productive in the family, at work, and in society.
The drug addicts are brought to the substance-abuse rehabilitation centre in Kandakadu in the Eastern Province based on court orders. This is a positive sign that attitudes are slowly changing as the authorities begin to confront an uncomfortable problem that has long been ignored. In the past, drug addicts when brought before the courts were handed prison sentences. However, one of the biggest problems in combatting the drug menace in this country has been that prison is a haven for these addicts and there have been many instances where even prisoners who had never used drugs before had eventually come out of prison as addicts.
A new lease of life
During a recent visit to the facility, the Daily News spoke with some of the rehabilitants and staff about their treatment and the effectiveness of the programme. According to Maj. G.H. Nandasiri, there are around 1,066 drug addicts who are being rehabilitated at the Kandakadu facility and after six months of initial training which includes spiritual training, counselling, therapy, and meditation, they are then transferred to Senapura for the second leg of their rehabilitation, where they are given vocational training and skills development to help them find employment opportunities once they are reintegrated into society.
According to Maj. Nandasiri, the facilities in Kandakadu are insufficient to cater to the growing number of drug addicts who come there to be rehabilitated. However, he added that as a result of several appeals, the government has agreed to provide them several more permanent buildings and sanitary facilities. The facility is secured with double fencing and sentry points are set up around the facility where there is no possibility for anyone to escape.
These rehabilitants have to follow military rules and their day is planned out for them. The daily routine starts with the hoisting of the national flag followed by PT from 6.00 am to 7.00 am. On some days, they have aerobics. Then they tidy up their living areas and have breakfast. The first session for the day commences at 9.00 am where they engage in cognitive therapy and other personality and self-confidence-building exercises. This ends at around 10.30 am. From 10.30 am to 11.00 am, they have a tea break.
Then from 11 am to 12.30 pm they have another session of leadership skills, personal development and soft skills development. From 12.30 pm to 2.30 pm, they are given a lunch break and from thereon, until 4.00 pm these rehabilitants engage in various activities such as music and other collective recreational activities. From 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm they engage in sports such as volleyball, football, cricket, badminton or use the gym for physical fitness. At 6.00 pm, they line up and a head count is taken to ensure that all are accounted for. After dinner at 7.00 pm, they either watch TV or read the newspapers. On Wednesdays, they are allowed to watch a musical programme and on another day a movie and so on, after which at 10.00 pm the lights are turned off and they must retire for the day, according to Lt. C.B. Atapattu.
There are around 70 staff members attending to the rehabilitants, including seven counsellors. They are all from the National Cadet Corps; all are teachers, but have been given military training. They wear civilian attire and have all undergone a one-year diploma and the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board certificate course in counselling. Hence, they have the requisite training and are suitable for the task. Their military background also helps them to instill discipline in the lives of the rehabilitants, who are required to have neat haircuts and shave, clip their nails and keep themselves clean, neat and tidy. The centre provides them all with clothing and toiletries required during their rehabilitation.
For the initial three months of rehabilitation, they are not allowed visitors and thereafter, family members are allowed to visit them twice a month. However, these rehabilitants are allowed to maintain contact with their families by telephone where they are allowed phone calls to their families every Sunday between 9.30 am and 4.00 pm.
When these drug addicts are first brought to this facility, they are directed towards agro therapy where they engage in agricultural activities which is believed to be helpful in breaking their drug habit. When they engage in agriculture and see the results of their efforts and the plants bearing fruit by the time they leave the facility, these rehabilitants get great mental satisfaction, said Capt. R.M.S.B. Ratnayake.
During their initial six months at Kandakadu, these rehabilitants also undergo a 10-day Vipassana meditation programme, where they are not allowed to speak to anyone but engage in reflecting on their lives and meditation. This programme is held from 4.30 am to 9.00 pm during the 10 days and is conducted by a Buddhist monk from the Kalaththewa Dhamma Bhawana Centre. This is aimed at curing their minds.
The Kandakadu facility has made provisions for all four religious denominations to practice their own faiths. Most of these addicts are those who have lost their families or their parents are either separated or overseas. This facility does not allow mobile phones or food from outside as a precautionary measure. According to the councillors, the success rate of this programme is around 50 percent, which is far higher than many of such facilities. However, they said that there is a certain percentage that relapses.

In 1983, I got into bad company and started smoking and taking other drugs. I am a chef and have worked in Abu Dhabi. When I returned to Sri Lanka, I got into the drug business with some friends. In fact, the police warned me on many occasions and eventually I was arrested. There was no bail and they sent me here for one year. This is my first time in rehab. I have been undergoing this programme for five months and 14 days. It is very effective and its the best place for these young boys who have got into this bad habit. My father was a Naval officer. Now I am 58 years old and I have realised that I must turn my life around. My brothers are living in Abu Dhabi and my mother is here because of me. I want to change and go back and live a good life. I had many girlfriends, but never settled down. I was introduced to heroin by some American sailors who came to Sri Lanka. I was working at Holiday Inn at the time. I want to get over this habit and I feel I am finally ready and have the strength to stay clean.

I am 28 and from Beruwala. I have my parents and two brothers. I got used to drugs at the age of 18 through a neighbour and have been doing drugs ever since. I initially came to this facility in 2016, but relapsed after around two months due to bad company. I was brought back by the Kandakadu follow-up officers. I am scared that when I go back, this time too my friends might draw me back into drugs. Therefore, my family is trying to send me overseas for employment, once I am released. I had a girlfriend but because of my drug addiction, she left me. I want to go back and try to stay clean and start my life with her.
Lakshman Kumara
I am 53, married, and a father of two sons and a daughter. I started doing drugs in 1983. I was given drugs by a prostitute who told me it would help my endurance. But eventually, it took away everything including my strength. I come from a good family and have been to many rehabilitation centres, but have not managed to kick this habit. In every other facility I went to, I managed to get my hands on drugs. But this place is different and I have been totally clean for the past three months. I want to change as even my children are also suffering because of me. This facility is very effective and I am certain that once I get through these 12 months of abstinence and go through this programme, I will be able to stop this habit and live peacefully with my wife and children.

President Maithripala Sirisena has asked that all former MPs, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers return their vehicles and public property to the relevant Ministry Secretary to avoid having legal action taken against them under the Election law.
He reiterated that strict action would be taken against any member of the government who misuses public property for election purposes. In his address to the nation on Sunday night, the President stated that he would extend all the support necessary to the Elections Commission to ensure that there is a free and fair election. He noted that at present, in accordance with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, a caretaker government is in operation from the time nominations are called for to the time where a new Parliament convenes.
Thus, only the President, Prime Minister and Cabinet members would function in this caretaker government.
All former state ministers, deputy ministers and MPs who no longer hold office are prohibited from using public property under election law.
Thus I request that all former state, deputy and ministers hand over your vehicles to the relevant Ministry Secretary. If there is a delay, I would be forced to take legal action and bring in the Police to recover such property, and regardless of party, strict legal action will be taken against anyone who violates the election law.
I would like to remind you that it is illegal to use government property for election purposes, stated the President.

SC decision eagerly awaited
A cross section of political leaders and lawyers interviewed by the Daily News said they were eagerly awaiting the Supreme Courts verdict on the dissolution of Parliament. Representatives of all parties said they would abide by the Courts decision. Most expressed the opinion that people have now been given an opportunity to elect a Government of their choice on January 5. Excerpts from the interviews:
JNP leader, Minister Wimal Weerawansa:
Sri Lanka has the only party in the world which goes to Court against elections. We are seeking a mandate to chase away the bank robbers, to stop the persecution of war heroes and end the shady oil price formula. It is a pity that our opposition parties have stooped to this low level.
SLFP General Secretary Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa:
The President has an option to seek the peoples verdict in a crisis. Holding an election is one such method. The President has taken that decision, but if some think it is not a good decision, they are free to seek the Courts opinion. And going to Court is a much better option than resorting to violence. The people must reign supreme in all our endeavours.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Minister Udaya Gammanpila:
The UNP suffers from people phobia and have been postponing elections for the last four years. However, now the President has given an opportunity for the people to elect their representatives. The power lies with the people. An election is the best feature of a democracy.
Today, many have filed petitions in the Supreme Court against the holding of an election. This is the first time in the world that political parties have gone to Court against an election. This is a matter of shame for the UNP. However, we are happy that the UNP has finally gone to Court instead of taking their case to foreign ambassadors.
SLPP General Secretary Sagara Kariyawasam:
The Presidents decision is Constitutional. He has taken this decision in terms of the powers vested in him by the Constitution. However we have no issue with parties and individuals going to Court on this issue. Our stance is that the President acted legally within his rights.
LSSP General Secretary Prof Tissa Vitarana:
We are happy that the UNP is seeking the Courts opinion instead of going to foreign embassies. We should find solutions to our problems without foreign intervention.
An election is an opportunity to express the peoples will and supremacy. The President took every action within the confines of the Constitution. He has the right and the power to dissolve and prorogate Parliament. However, the Supreme Court will provide an interpretation. We should all abide by that ruling. We thank the President for calling an election which is a good chance for the people to elect a Government of their choice.
Senior lawyer Gomin Dayasri:
The President has taken a decision to dissolve Parliament and we are awaiting the Courts decision. All parties expect to hear the opinion of the masses. The people now expect a General Election. We are seeking a verdict that both sides can accept.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath:
The Fundamental Rights of the six Parliamentarians from our party have been violated by the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament. This is why we instituted legal action.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam:
We have faith in the Judiciary and the Courts. We are ready to accept the verdict given by the Supreme Court.

Several California infernos bring more deaths
US: The number of dead in a wildfire raging in California has reached 29, matching the deadliest in the states history as recovery teams found six more bodies in the grim search through the wreckage.
The Camp Fire -- in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains north of Sacramento -- is the largest and most destructive of several infernos that have sent 250,000 people fleeing their homes across the tinder-dry state, razing 6,400 homes in the town of Paradise and effectively wiping it off the map.
At least 31 people have died in fire zones in north and south California, where acrid smoke blanketed the sky for miles, the sun barely visible.
On the ground, cars caught in the flames were reduced to scorched metal skeletons, while homes were left as smoldering piles of debris, with an occasional brick wall or chimney remaining.
Scores of people remain unaccounted for, and several fire-affected areas have been left without cell phone service.
The Camp Fire has the grisly distinction of matching the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles -- until now the single deadliest wildfire on record, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).
Fanned by strong winds, the Camp Fire has scorched 111,000 acres (45000 hectares) and is 25 percent contained, Cal Fire said. So far, three of the more than 4,000 firefighters deployed have been injured. Almost 6,000 miles away, President Donald Trump, in France for World War I commemorations on Sunday, drew fierce criticism for an unsympathetic reaction to the devastation.
There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor, Trump tweeted, threatening to withdraw federal support.
Brian Rice, the head of the California Professional Firefighters, slammed the tweet as ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines.
Singer Miley Cyruss home was one of the destroyed southern California buildings.
Completely devestated (sic) by the fires affecting my community. I am one of the lucky ones. My animals and LOVE OF MY LIFE made it out safely & thats all that matters right now, she tweeted.
My house no longer stands but the memories shared with family & friends stand strong. Many of the wealthy areas residents own horses, and for the past days Twitter has been filled with messages of people seeking and offering help.
Actor James Wood, a rare political conservative in liberal Hollywood, has made new friends by using his Twitter account to help find missing people and getting help for pets, including horses.
Please think about fostering #pets while evacuees are dealing with the crisis. Los Angeles #animal shelters are mostly filled, so follow my hashtags, and see if someone in need is someone you can help! read one of his tweets.
The Ventura County Humane Society said it was deeply humbled by a $100,000 donation from Sandra Bullock and family to rescue and care for animals evacuated from the fires. - AFP

She also handed over gifts to the students who have excelled in their extracurricular activities and studies.
Speaking at the event Dr Gunaratne said that though there is a way to grade a persons academic progress, a person may possess many other talents which cannot be measured in grades. She noted that extracurricu
lar activities enhance a persons ability to work with a team, decision making skills, and corporation.
It is a pity that parents tend to spoon feed their children and not allow them to make their decisions or engage in activities on their own, she said stressing that parents need to encourage their children to take part in team work as it will prepare them for future challenges.

SL was wrongfully maligned abroad - Akashi
Yasushi Akashi, the former representative of the government of Japan for Peace-Building, Reconciliation and Reconstruction in Sri Lanka, said at times, he felt Sri Lanka and its wartime conduct and its aftermath was wrongfully maligned by some influential sections of the international community.
Sri Lanka was depicted as not wanting a peaceful solution by some sections of the international community, which is not correct, Akashi said in an interview with the Daily News in Tokyo.
Akashi, who is the current chairman of the International House of Japan, said during the period of war in Sri Lanka, he spoke with various foreign government leaders to convince them that the Sri Lankan governments doors were not closed for a peaceful solution.
He said that some of these talks had been very fruitful and he had been able to convince some international partners to view the Lankan conflict from a much broader perspective and help the country to achieve peace and development.
Akashi who had engaged in talks with LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, said Prabhakaran became intoxicated with military victories and as time went by, he became over confident about his power.
In the end, Prabhakaran was his own enemy. He shut the door on many initiatives for peace and dialogue, he said.
Akashi said in achieving the objectives of sustainable development, peace, and reconciliation, the Sri Lankan government should deal with the past honestly.
He said at the national level, achieving reconciliation, lasting peace and development goals becomes impossible without good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
If people are found guilty of crimes in the past, they should be punished irrespective of status.
While noting that he still follows developments in Sri Lanka closely, Akashi said it was important for Sri Lanka to demonstrate its firm commitment, willingness and ability to advance truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence of conflict.
In this regard, he praised the operationalising of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), releasing of private land held by the military to civilians, operationalising of the Right to Information Act, establishment of an Office for Reparations, passing legislation to give effect to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, as steps in the right direction.
Akashi also praised the measures taken by the government to resettle and enhance the living standards of war-affected people in the North and East.
However, I still regret that the promise I made when accepting my mission in Sri Lanka which is helping the country to find lasting peace and reconciliation remains unaccomplished, he added.
Akashi said if there is another invitation in the future to help Sri Lanka again he may consider it.
Akashi was involved in mediating between the government and the international community and the LTTE during the last period of war.
As peace envoy, he visited the country frequently since 2002 until the end of war in 2009. And even after the war, he visited Sri Lanka to push for reconciliation and peace-building.

SLFP to announce alliance by weekend
SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa yesterday said the SLFP will be contesting the upcoming General Election under a broad national alliance that will include all leftist, nationalist, and patriotic political parties.
Speaking to the media yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters, the General Secretary said discussions have already started with all parties and the final decision on the alliance would be taken by the end of this week. He said that the symbol of the new alliance is yet to be decided.
Responding to a question by a journalist with regard to the SLFPers who joined the SLPP, the General Secretary said that these type of incidents are common to the SLFP and rather than paying attention to these incidents, the SLFP and other coalition partners will focus on the defeat of the common enemy at the upcoming election. There were issues within the party since the 1950s, but the SLFP overcame all these issues and never went into total political oblivion, he said.

SoftBank unveils massive $21 bn IPO of Japan mobile unit
Telecoms giant SoftBank will list shares in its Japanese mobile unit next month in a sale that could raise over $21 billion and be one of the biggest tech IPOs in years.
The IPO will help raise funds for the company as it increasingly transforms into an investment firm, ploughing money into a broad range of companies and projects around the world. The IPO will take place in Tokyo on Dec 19 and will offer 1.6 billion shares in the SoftBank Corp mobile unit at 1,500 yen (US$13) each.
That values the mobile unit at 7.18 trillion yen, and the IPO could be Japans biggest-ever, local media said.
The company had announced in February that it was going ahead with the IPO after media speculation about the plan.
It said then that the listing would give the mobile unit greater managerial autonomy.
In its announcement Monday, SoftBank said the listing would also help clarify the roles of the parent company (SBG) and its Japanese mobile unit.
SBG is accelerating investments on a global scale, while SB is a core company to the Groups telecommunications business, the statement said.

Songs for the season
The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is a service of Christian worship celebrating the birth of Jesus that is traditionally followed at Christmas. The story of the fall of humanity, the promise of the Messiah, and the birth of Jesus is told in nine short Bible readings from Genesis, the prophetic books and the Gospels, interspersed with the singing of Christmas carols, hymns and choir music.
Melodies speaks to Angelo Perera who is conducting the choir. The Choir of St. Sebastian College will be having their Carol Service at St. Sebastians College Auditorium on December 9 from 6.30pm. This Carol Service has been taking place from 2003 to 2017. The theme is Breath of Heaven selected from a famous Christmas carol that tells the nativity story from Marys perspective.
The Choir of St. Sebastians College, began with just a handful of dedicated students who were musically inclined and under the guidance of Rev. Fr. Prasad Niranjan who was a great musician it transformed into a choir accepted at a national level.
Singing the praises of God, the choir got its new costume which is a red and white cassock, used by the altar servers, symbolizing the belief that we are all servants of God. The choir began its rapid journey of development over the years to become a well-known name among the choirs in the country, said Perera
The Choir of St. Sebastians College was introduced to Sri Lankan audiences by the concert, Vibrant Voices organized by the Interact clubs of St. Sebastians College and St. Bridgets Convent in 2005 at the BMICH auditorium.
But in 2006 the Choir of St. Sebastians College organized their own first ever choir show, named Whispers of Music. The Choir of St. Sebastians College are the pioneers of choral music in Sri Lanka. The Choir of St. Sebastians College also organized a successful choir concert named Echoes of Heaven followed by Echoes of Heaven II a choral presentation of sacred music and famous hits. The team consists of a group of well trained and dedicated students who are committed to achieve the best both academically and in extracurricular activities. Success through commitment is an integral part of the choirs philosophy, explained Perera.
Currently the team is trained by Shihan Chamba and Sanjeeva E Silva two proud products of the college choir. The choir is conducted by Mas. Angelo Perera and led by Mas. Shane Leyon, Mas. Gayan Jayawardena, Mas. Kavindu Cooray, and Mas. Revon Cooray. The potential for growth at the Choir of St. Sebastians College is immense.
A perfect example is the continuous development of the Christmas carols for 16 consecutive years. The history of St. Sebastians Colleges Carols goes back to 1960s, when the College administration was under De La Salle Brothers. But it wasnt a well-organized carol service, due to which it didnt take place annually, stated Perera.
After the takeover of the College administration by the Archdiocese of Colombo, the former Rector Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle together with Rev. Fr. Prasad Niranjan the founder Priest in Charge of the choir, re-established the choir and it was made an inseparable part of the College. In the same year itself the first carol service or the foundation for the present carol service was laid, stated Perera.
Since 2003 up to date the annual carol service was developed year by year due to the dedication and hard work of its interested parties, and is the main Carol Service in Moratuwa now.
In 2013 Fr. Prasad was sent to UK for his higher studies which were a blow to the choir. But every cloud has a silver lining and. Chamba and. Silva took over the choir, which was the commencement of a new era.
In year 2015 Rev Fr. Vincent Ashley was appointed as the Priest in charge, who directed the choir successfully together with the two trainers. At present the Priest in charge of the choir is our dearest Rector, Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi.
The program includes Traditional Hymns, Classical compositions of Great composers (e.g. Beethoven), Modern classical compositions and modern and traditional Sinhala/English Carols. This year too, the carols will be held in the aim of spreading the Christmas cheer among the Moratuwa music loving community. The carols are an important event in the school calendar.
During the past 16 carol services there was a 100 percent audience turnout. The auditorium was full each year and the boys expect the same result this year as well.
We have always put in a lot of effort which can be seen by the audience turn out. They just love to hear our music. All in all they love our singing and the overall performance. With the guidance of Late Rev Fr. Bonnie and our former trainer founder of modern choir Rev Fr. Prasad we have reached great heights. If these two greats were not there, it would be a very different tale, pointed out Perera.
Their special thanks go to Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi, the Rector and the Priest in charge of the choir for nurturing the boys. They wish to thank Rev. Fr. Prasad Niranjan and Rev. Fr. Vincent Ashley for their dedication. They are also grateful to Shihan Chamba and Sanjeeva E. Silva, the trainers and master in charger for their dedication and the sacrifices done on behalf of the choir since 2013.

British artist Rebecca Louise Law uses real flowers as her medium to create stunning, immersive installation art. Suspended with copper wire, her floating indoor gardens transform art galleries and cocoon the viewer in a world of mesmerizing color.
For her largest installation to date, titled Community, Law had the help of local volunteers from Toledo, Ohio to install 500,000 dried and fresh flowers inside the Toledo Art Museum.
An advocate for sustainability, Law reused dried flowers from her previous exhibitions from around the world, as well as over 150,000 locally sourced native plants. The colossal project required 1,650 hours of volunteer assistance provided by northwest Ohio community members. The result is an immersive experience that explores the relationship between humanity and nature, where each visitor can walk through the myriad of cascading plant life and appreciate their beauty up-close.
We hope this installation will offer visitors a sensory experience, evocative of the people and places, natural history and landscapes of northwest Ohio, said Brian Kennedy, Toledo Art Museums Edward Drummond and Florence Scott Libbey director. Laws transporting vision wonderfully reflects the spirit and textures of our local and global communities.
The exhibit is on view at the Toledo Art Museum through January 13, 2019.

Sri Lanka take on SA after first game washout
Sri Lanka have one point from the washed-out fixture against England, while South Africa are starting their campaign in the ICC Womens World T20 2018  if rain permits. Its all to play for in Gros Islet, if the rain relents.
Sri Lankas opening game was against England, and going by the MRF Tyres ICC Womens T20I Team Rankings  England are at No.3 and Sri Lanka at No.8  the rain-enforced abandonment was better for the Asian side than the 50-over world champions.
Thats a point in the bag for Sri Lanka, and they will back their chances of adding two more against a team whose batting performance in the warm-up games was as modest as that of the Lankans.
Dane van Niekerks side were poor in their two official warm-ups, performing below par with the bat to go down to Pakistan and Australia. In the first, they scored 72/9 in 15.1 overs, and in the second, all they got in response to Australias 130/4 was 79/9.
But Sri Lanka were only marginally better  they were bowled out for 98 by New Zealand and 85 by Ireland in their games.
The bowling, for both teams, has been fine, but its the batters who have flattered to deceive, and its the batters who must rise to the occasion in this crunch clash.
On that front, South Africa have more pedigree. In Lizelle Lee, Chloe Tryon, Laura Wolvaardt, and van Niekerk herself, they have batters of class. Not that Sri Lanka dont have stalwarts of their own  the foremost among them is Chamari Atapattu, the captain.
But South Africa, at least on paper, have a better-rounded side. Sri Lanka will know that, but they will also know that the opposition batters might just be low on confidence, and it will be a good time to strike. And then hope for Atapattu & Co to do enough to keep Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp, Tumi Sekhukhune and the like at bay.
India beat Pakistan to maintain 100% record
India made it two wins from two matches in Group B at the Womens World Twenty20 with a comprehensive seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in Guyana.
Pakistan were soon reduced to 30-3 but India spilled five chances and Bismah Maroof (53) and Nida Dar (52) put on 93 within 12 overs to help them to 133-7.
But Pakistan were twice penalised for batters running down the centre of the pitch and India were gifted 10 runs. Mithali Raj hit seven fours in her 56 as India won with six balls remaining.
India who have yet to reach a WT20 final won on the opening day with a win against twice runners-up New Zealand.

Senior law academic tells UNP leader:
Stop degrading country by criticizing President
Criticizing the President over the scope of his significance, privileges and executive powers before various foreign entities, such as embassies, unions and organizations lowers the dignity of the country and its people, Judge and Law Professor of Canterbury University, Essex London and former Advisor to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees Prof. Dinesh K.Gunasekara said yesterday in an interview with the Daily News.
He was interviewed on the current political climate in the country after President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament.
Prof. Gunasekara said former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has acted, as if his voter base is in the US, UK and Norway, and not in Sri Lanka. He has let down a sovereign nation before the world. The Speaker must take responsibility for aggravating the situation who consistently contradicting Gazette notifications issued by the President using his mandated prerogatives under the Constitution to appoint the Prime Minister and other ministers, and to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament by his proclamation, Prof. Gunasekara said.
On being pointed that Wickremesinghe and UNP Parliamentarians were saying that the Presidents action s were incompatible with the Constitution, Prof. Gunasekara said, if they had a problem with the Constitution they should have acted in accordance with the Constitution and sought assistance of the Supreme Court.
But he said Wickremesinghe went about tarnishing the Presidents image making various statements against Presidential powers, actions and legality of the Presidents actions. Instead he was seeking assistance of various foreign embassies and hegemonic powers, as if they had voted him in as Prime Minister.
Is it the High Commissions of Australia, UK or Norway or the US, that are going to vote for Ranil and the UNP at an election, or is it going to be the people of this country he asked.
It is a shame to behave like this before other countries and degrade a sovereign nation as men of state, he stressed, I hardly know any statesmen behaving this way putting their countrys pride at risk of being looked down upon by other nations.
This is setting a bad precedent and it is also a display of shamelessness, lack of civility and moral sense of our statesmen, he said.
The truth is Ranil Wickremesinghe went before the international community to vocalise that his being sacked as Prime Minister by the President was unconstitutional, because going to an election and winning the peoples vote is a nightmare for him, he said.
As a lawyer I have no doubt that the President has acted in accordance with the Constitution, but the countrymen can know it better once the Supreme Court gives its determination on those Fundamental Rights petitions seeking the quashing of the Presidents order dissolving Parliament and Holding Elections.
Ratnajeevan Hoole who has filed a petition in this respect is also a member of the independent Elections Commission.
He should resign from this Commission and file this petition, otherwise it would seem that his independence has been compromised, he said.
I request the public of this country to be vigilant about these actors for they can be quite misleading, he said.
Always remember that the President of a country is elected by all countrymen, he is not a man restricted to some precinct or district, and he and his decisions must be respected at all times by the people. The external influences always come with the country having to pay a price. All political parties must bear in mind it is the people of Sri Lanka who are going to vote for you, and not them, he explained.

Overlord
Theatre of thrills and spills
It is the eve of D-Day; June 6, 1944. The Allied Forces make their way to Normandy in their operation to end the Nazis reign of terror. Here, a team of paratroopers are entrusted with the task of taking out a radio tower set up next to a church in a small town. But as war is unpredictable, their plane, among many others, is shot down, leaving only five survivors to carry out the mission. But how many of them would make it through alive, as what lies ahead of them far exceeds even ones darkest expectations
Even before the opening scene began to roll, the introduction to the movie set the mood that was expected of both a war and a horror movie; with an initial black and white setting followed by foreboding music, Overlord eases the audience into its domain whilst slowly setting the atmosphere for whats to follow. With a display of fighter planes hovering above an armada, the movie gives us a glimpse into what goes through the minds of Government Issues (GIs) just moments before the battle begins: some quiet and focused, while others jest to conceal their apprehension - and a few even overrun by fear - so much that their bodies tremble at the thought of what would become of them.
The movie wastes no time picking up the pace as it takes the audience through an onslaught that downs countless planes from the night sky in an inferno that reflects the ferity of war. On land, a GI called Boyce regroups with three of his comrades; Tibbet, Chase, and Corporal Ford; before resuming the mission. Wandering behind enemy lines, the troopers come across Chloe, a victim of war scavenging whatever she can find to help her sick aunt and eight-year-old brother get by. Determined to help the GIs take down the Nazis that plague her town, Chloe soon becomes an integral part of their plan.
Highlighting the true nature of war, Overlord speaks of the horrors of humanity; how avarice and pride fused with prejudice and unquestioned liberty leads to catastrophes untold - how science, in the wrong hands, gives birth to abominations unforeseen. This is impeccably presented in the sequences where Boyce infiltrates the Nazi base and stumbles upon the sinister experiments carried out by a one Dr. Schmidt who is attempting to reanimate the dead in order to create an unstoppable army. Here the test subjects, the casualties, as well as the collateral damage, are displayed in fine detail.
Furthermore, the movie also focuses on the atrocities of war that befall both the military and the civilians: In one scene, the movie introduces a soldier who is writing a book on his experiences in the war, only to show him being consumed by a mine explosion just moments later - a reminder of the fragility of life and the unforgiving nature of the battlefield. Another such moment was when the audience learns that Chloe had previously begun her studies at the University of London in hopes of becoming a veterinarian when the war destroyed those dreams.
Another notable feature in the movie, especially in the beginning, was its symbolism. Whilst trekking through a jungle, Boyce and the others come across the carcass of an unrecognisable creature. There, Chase suggests that it could be that of a jackal while speaking of stories in the Bible that relate the creature to the Devil. As they enter Chloes town, the camera gives us a close-up of two crucifixes amidst a pile of smouldering rubble. This symbolised that the experiments being conducted were the work of the Devil. Perhaps these symbols also convey the message War is Hell - something the movie could suggest by the song choice used for its trailer: Hells Bells by AC/DC.
Boyce is portrayed as someone who understands the value of life and is unwilling to compromise his moral beliefs, even in the face of a remorseless adversary. One such moment is when he attempts to prevent Corporal Ford from torturing an enemy soldier called Wafner. However, Boyce is shown to have steadfast loyalty to his comrades (evident in the scenes where he attempts to rescue them even when the odds are against them), as well as an unwavering will in the face of true evil; and Jovan Adepo flawlessly meets all these aspects of his character.
In contrast to Boyce, Corporal Ford comes off as a soldier who sees his mission through to the end regardless of the measures he has to take to achieve it: he is not someone who minds getting his hands dirty and doesnt concern himself with the wellbeing of anyone outside his team if it were to compromise his mission. This, in particular, is seen in his unwillingness to prevent a Nazi soldier from sexually assaulting Chloe because it would have compromised their position - something that Boyce, however, could not ignore. Regardless, Ford is shown to be dependable at times of crises, especially towards the climax of the movie. Wyatt Russell clearly feels comfortable in this role as Ford, highlighting not only a soldier thats rough around the edges, but also a comrade in arms who is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that not only evil is defeated, but that their work wouldnt fall into the wrong hands as well.
Mathilde Ollivier excels at capturing Chloes bravery and resilience, especially towards the end of the movie where she takes part in the mission to destroy the radio tower. Tibbet, played by John Magaro, acts as comic relief most of the time; but is also shown to be kind, even though he tends to put up a cold exterior; and Wafner, portrayed by Pilou Asbk, is the archetypal antagonist who wants nothing more than power.
From start to finish, the scores were spot-on in creating disquiet atmospheres for the audience as the musics intensities and speeds were often raised and lowered to create the element of uncertainty. This also melded well with the jump scares, which were neither overused nor the sole means to shock the audience. Furthermore, the CGI and cinematography were often utilised greatly to the movies advantage: the extreme long shot of the Allied Forces fleets, the wide shots of the carnage along the shoreline, and the transitions to extreme close-ups to create jump scares were some striking moments in the movie.
The special effects also succeeded in bringing to life ferocious undead beasts that appeared to be near indomitable, while creating environments that felt lived-in by the characters, especially when the storyline grew darker and the movie progressed to its Third Act. Certain plot-twists stood out from the rest as they highlighted the strength of character of certain roles while also setting the stage for more bloodshed.
Overlord stands out as a brilliant concoction of drama and thriller with well-balanced features of horror and action that hold ones attention till the last minute.
Overlord is screening at Liberty by Scope Cinemas, Empire  Colombo, MC Cinemas  Colombo, Milano  Kegalle, Scope Cinemas (CCC)  Colombo 3, Regal  Gampaha / Nuwara Eliya, Savoy Colombo 4, Aruna  Kiribatgoda, Rauoo  Katunayaka, Liberty Lite, Sky Lite Malabe, Vista  Ja-Ela and Sky Lite Matara

UNP, JVP have same political agenda - Vasu
The UNP and JVP did not seek legal interpretation when the Prime Minister was appointed but now seek judicial intervention after Parliament was dissolved because they are all having one political agenda and they know their fate, if they face an election, State Languages and National Integration, Reconciliation Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara said. He said this at a press briefing held at the N.M. Perera centre in Borella yesterday.
He further said he had written to the Speaker on November 8, asking him if it was ethically right for him to have met with the foreign ambassadors at a time when Parliament was prorogued and discus Sri Lankan state problems and Parliamentary issues.
I also wrote to the American House Speaker and asked him if he would under any circumstance, call on the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US and discuss state matters and Parliament matters with him. But, he did not respond, Minister Nnayakkara said.
I asked Speaker Karu Jauasuriya if what he was doing was right by meeting with the Ambassadors of countries that are clearly favouring the UNP and discussing state matters with them. He was responsible for ousting us from power and now he is acting as a porn of the UNP.
It is the Executive who decides who the Prime Minister should be and not the Legislative. What the legislative does is implement laws, manage finances. It is the Executive that deals with matters of the Cabinet, he added. Nanayakkara noted that the President is appointed by the peoples mandate and he holds the peoples sovereignty. Then the Parliament has the power which is only a Constitutional power.
Then there is the sovereignty of franchise. Now the President appointed by the people vote says that a constitutional crisis has arisen due to the wrong decisions taken by the Speaker. The Speaker is trying to create a clash between Parliament and the Executive. Then it will be impossible for a government to function. Under such circumstances, there is only one solution, that is to allow the peoples sovereignty to give a verdict on this issue. That is what the President has done, Minister Nnayakkara said.
Hence, I asked the Speaker in my letter, why he brought in the foreign diplomats to discuss internal matters of our country. The US had a big issue alleging the Russia had meddled in their elections and created undue influence. Now those very same countries are interfering in Sri Lankas internal matters. What right have they to meddle in our internal affairs. I accused him of being a partial person who favours one side and he was instrumental in bringing in the government. Previously when the former Prime Minister was appointed, the Speaker who did not talk about majority and allowed him to be appointed with some 40 seats in parliament. Today what right has he got to call for parliamentary majority How can a government function in this manner That is why the President had to dissolve Parliament and call for a general election. Nanayakkara pointed out that the current President was appointed based on an agreement with the UNP, but he realised that he could not work with the UNP. Having called for elections, now the Presidents party would contest with us and not the UNP. Even at the past Local Goverment elections, the Presidents party contested independently.
All this did not happen overnight. Now the government has been dissolved and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera in a letter said once the government has been dissolved, how can the Prime Minister remain in office That is like saying the gravy has remained after the pot had broken, he said blaming Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for being responsible for this situation. Then, they refused to accept the new Prime Minister who was appointed. The law cannot be manipulated according to anyones whims and fancies. Hence, what they should have done was to go to the Supreme Court at that time. If they had done so at that point, this complication would not have arisen. What they wanted was to create a riot and instability in the country at the point the Prime Minister was appointed and make the world this that the country is in anarchy. However, the people did not get sucked into such a situation and they acted wisely. They are trying everything to get Ranil back in the Prime Ministers seat, but the President instead, has opted to let the people decide, Nanayakkara said. Now they have gone to court. Let the court decide now and we will bow to the verdict given by the Supreme Court. The President, Parliament and the Judiciary have certain powers and the country functions smoothly based on the coordinated functioning of all these factors. If these factors cannot function together peacefully, then the government cannot function and at that point the government will have to change in order to resolve the issues and move forward.

UNP reluctant to face election - Prof. G.L. Peiris
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peris said yesterday the UNP is reluctant to face the forthcoming General Election as it is facing certain defeat.
That is why UNP members are trying to block the election by going to the courts because they know that they cannot win it, he added.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should not go to foreign embassies or Courts when an election has been announced.
Rather he should go to the villages to meet the people. But his defeat is already visible by his actions. That is why he is going before courts and foreign embassies. He will never give up the UNP leadership, he added.
Former MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena said that according to predictions, the SLPP has a chance of winning a two-thirds majority at the forthcoming General election.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will be nominated from the Kurunegala district. Hambantota SLPP team will be headed by former MP Chamal Rajapaksa while former MP Namal Rajapaksa will contest from the same district.

Verstappen threatens to punchOcon as Hamilton wins Brazilian GP
Sao Paulo, Monday: Dutch driver Max Verstappen was accused of trying to punch French rival Esteban Ocon after a controversial clash at Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix which was won by five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton.
Red Bull star Verstappen was seen on TV pushing Force India's Ocon three times and accused of threatening to hit him, after the pair had collided on track.
The collision on lap 44 of the 71-lap race at Interlagos' famed Senna S curves cost Verstappen the race and he had to settle for second place.
The livid Dutchman, 21, had earlier said he did not see the Frenchman in the paddock after the race, but made no effort to avoid him in the drivers' weighing room where he walked straight at him. "We were at the scales room," said Ocon. "He wanted to punch me. He pushed me and he was wanting to be violent. It was not professional." Ocon added that his rivalry with Verstappen "goes back a few years" and said he "has always been the same".
"I was behind Max for two laps," Ocon told Sky Sports. "On the first lap, I was a lot faster and, on the second lap, I was a lot faster. The rules say you are allowed to un-lap yourself so that's what I did.
"I'm used to the fights with Max. He's always been the same. It goes back a few years." Verstappen swore so much on team radio that his comments bleeped out after he described him as an "idiot".
Ocon was given a 10-second stop-go penalty by the race stewards for causing the collision.
A video clip of the post-race incident went viral soon afterwards but Verstappen said he had no regrets.
"He came out of the pit lane and he had the right to overtake, but the level of risk he was taking, it was not right," he explained.

Worlds first underwater villa
If you are a traveler and can afford luxury, you can now stay at the worlds first ever underwater villa in the Maldives.
The two-story villa is located around 16 feet below the Indian Ocean, and has been named Muraka, which, in the local Dhivehi language, means coral, reports CNN. Muraka is a part of the Conrad Maldives Rangali island resort.
The villa boasts of a private gym, a bar, an infinity pool, butlers quarters, an ocean-facing bathtub and an underwater bedroom with uninterrupted views of the ocean. The top floor of the villa, which is situated above the water, has a typical deck where one can soak up the sun.
To avail this unbelievable piece of luxury, you will have shell out $50,000 (Rs. 36.67 lakh) per night. The only catch is that one has to book it for a minimum of four nights. Although, Muraka isnt the first underwater concept since the resort already has an underwater five-star restaurant named Ithaa.
Like Ithaa, Muraka too is connected to the rest of the resort by a jetty. The villa is secluded since the initial idea was to not disturb several non-aquatic life forms.
The villa was built in Singapore on land and was brought into the Maldives with the help of a special purpose ship. The whole structure was then lowered into the water and was put into place with the help of concrete pylons which would eventually help to keep it steady from rough waves or high tides.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Youth Front President and former Kandy District MP Dilum Amunugama said the SLPP was conducting district level campaigns to eductae youth on the failed projects and false promises made by the previous regime.
He said this at a media briefing held in Kandy yesterday. The Youth Front got large numbers of youth together and planned several programmes for them, said Amunugama.
In the past three years, it is the youth who were treated unfairly. Thus a large number of people are dissatisfied, said the former MP.
From time to time, the youths were mostly affected by the actions of the UNP and the JVP and today, they have joined forces. He added that the people were waiting for an election so that they could express the frustration they have been feeling over the government during the last regime.
In the upcoming election, the team led by PM Mahinda Rajapaksa will be a force to be reckoned with and we will achieve one of the biggest electoral victories in the countrys history, said the former MP.
He added that not just Sajith Premadasa but even if J.R. Jayawardena were to take up the leadership of the UNP today, they would not be able to resuscitate the party which has fallen into ruin.

Antibiotics grossly misused in SL
Antibiotics are being used in a dangerous manner in Sri Lanka. At the moment, 13 percent of total expenditure of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry is for antibiotics.
A National Strategic Plan has been formulated to address this issue, Health Ministry's Deputy Director General (Laboratory Services) Dr. B.V.S.H. Beneragama said.
Speaking at a press conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said there are thousands of quacks in Sri Lanka who prescribe antibiotics for patients and become popular. Some qualified doctors also prescribe antibiotics which are not necessary for their patients to become popular.
According to Dr. Beneragama, antibiotics are given to chickens so that they gain weight. Some ayurvedic doctors too prescribe antibiotics. People go to private pharmacies and ask for antibiotics without prescriptions. But antibiotics should be issued only on prescription.
Once anti-microbial resistance is developed, the entire country and the world will be in danger without any antibiotics to treat diseases. It takes over 25 years and billions of dollars to develop an antibiotic, but within a very short time such antibiotics can become useless.
The WHO says by 2050, around 50 million will die without antibiotics to treat their diseases, he said.

Citizens should vote for patriotic group
Citizens have a responsibility at the next general election to grant the power to a group of politicians who protects the children and the future generation of the country, retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
He said that however, the previous government failed to establish the reconciliation in the country during their tenure to the expected level. Instead they hunt the war-heroes and took political vengeance.
He said that under the reconciliation banner, every step was not taken for the sake of the country, but to cater to the demand of the international community and a part of Tamil Diaspora.
Major General Gunaratne said the previous government arrested and punished the war heroes through the Prevention of Terrorism Act which he called the war-heroes hunting. They took steps to release the convicted terrorists in the custody saying that they are political prisoners. The things they did under the theme of Reconciliation were very unsatisfactory, he said.
He said the previous government has already given the Hambantota Port to China and they were trying to justify that decision by giving several other important ports such as Galle, Trincomalee, Kankesanturai (KKS), and the Colombo Eastern Terminal to the India despite the security of the country.
The KKS port and the Palali airport were the lifeline of the security forces during the war. Therefore, the security of these two important centers in the Northern Province should be strengthened to face any emergency situation. The previous government had ordered the military forces to release the lands around the KKS port and the Palali airport to the owners without considering the security of them, he said..
National Coordinator of Muslim Affairs to Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa Shiraz Yoonus said that nowadays the messages which create the religious unrest in the Muslim community are circulated via the social media networks.
The Muslim community should be aware of them and should not panic. They all are fake news and we condemned them, he said.
He said that some political party members representing the Muslim community are now on a pilgrimage to Mecca. They should not plan political conspiracies while being at that holy place, Yoonus said.
He requested the Muslim community to cast their vote at the next election not for money, but for the countrys sake. He said Sri Lanka at present needs a stable government with a two thirds majority in Parliament to make the country stable,

Parliament dissolved to stabilize economy
President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved Parliament to protect the country from economic instability. Parliament was dissolved to obtain a strong mandate of the people to form a new government, said City Planning and Water Supply Minister M. L. A. M. Hisbullah.
He was addressing the gathering at the felicitation ceremony organised by Maha Group to honour social workers at Hisbullah Hall in Kattankudy on Saturday.
"No one is safe in an economic crisis. Sovereignty, economy and defence would be at stake. The President urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and former Minister Sajith Premadasa to take over the Premiership. But, they refused. Then the SLFP was contemplating on appointing Minister Nimal Sirpala de Silva as Prime Minister.
Finally, considering the economic instability, the President took the decision to appoint former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
The new Prime Minister was appointed in keeping with the Constitution.
If the appointment of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was unconstitutional, the UNP and others could go to court seeking justice. They did not go to court because they have no provisions in the Constitution, said Minister Hisbullah. The ceremony themed, Let's felicitate the people alive was held under the patronage of Mumtaz Mathani, Secretary of Hira Foundation.

Silly mistake by Pakistan gifts India 10 runs in World T20 win
Providence, Sunday: Pakistans batters gifted India 10 penalty runs by consistently running on the pitch as they succumbed to a seven-wicket defeat by their rivals in the Womens World Twenty20 on Sunday.
Underdogs Pakistan posted a challenging total of 133-7 in Guyana thanks to fifties from Bismah Maroof and Nida Dar, but twice were penalised five runs for running down the middle of the pitch, including on the final ball of their innings.
Look, its a silly mistake from us, we shouldnt do this kind of thing and we should learn from this, Dar admitted.
India are top of the early Group B table after also beating New Zealand in their opening match on Friday, while Pakistan have suffered two straight losses.
Mithali Raj, Indias record run-scorer in T20 internationals, opened the batting and struck a 47-ball 56 as last years World Cup runners-up made the most of their headstart to wrap up victory with an over to spare.
After a dominant performance against New Zealand in which captain Harmanpreet Kaur became the first Indian woman to score a T20I century, her side were sloppy and dropped five catches in the field.
It will be playing on our minds that we shouldnt be doing the same mistakes in the coming matches because at some point it might cost us, admitted Raj.
India next face Ireland on Thursday, after Pakistan also take on the lowest-ranked team in the tournament on Tuesday. AFP

## Title: A.C.M LAFIR
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Tuesday, November 13, 2018 - 01:00
A.C.M LAFIR
He still holds the record for the first wicket with Ronnie Stephens in the Trinity St Anthonys big match played in 1954. Whilst still a schoolboy from St Anthonys he got selected to play for Ceylon against late Sir Leonard Huttons team at the Colombo Oval. He was a brave opening batsman who showed scant respect for any bowler including Ted Dexter, when he drove two scorching drives off the back foot through the covers, Dexter turned around and told him that he has never seen such glorious strokes before. That was the best compliment he ever got. He was batting with late C.I. Gunasekera and he noted that C.I. was reluctant to run for his strokes which were noted by late Ken Barrington. C.I. was plain jealous of the young brilliant opening bat from Kandy.
A.C.M.Lafir blazed a trail as an opening bat in Ceylon cricket, but he was dropped from the Ceylon team after that knock of 88 and was never recalled to play for Ceylon. He reminisced the fact that C.I. had a hand in that. I interviewed this charming ex-Ceylon cricketer at his Bambalapitiya flats.
Lafir stated that he never hesitated to take the bull by the horns when injustice was done to him in different walks of life. He pointed out that his cricket career was crudely cut short for several reasons such as CIs jealousy, also late B.R. Heyn who blocked his path. They looked at him with a jaundiced eye probably because he was a Kandyan and he never bum sucked. A.C.M purely believed in his innate ability as a free scoring batsman armed with all the strokes in the book excelling in the square cut and the cover drive. He paid a great tribute late John Halangoda who showed him the rudiments of batsmanship at St Anthonys Katugastota. Lafir admitted that he was a hard task master and even during festive seasons they had to attend practices.
After joining Esso as a sales executive, after school, Lafir did not have much time to play cricket due to lack of facilities in up country. Whenever he was called to Colombo for trial practices, he could not do justice to his talents because when his turn came to bat the pitches were very dicey, despite all those drawbacks he emerged as the no. 1 opening batsman in Ceylon until that innings of 88 he played under CIs captaincy.
After the carpet was pulled under his feet when playing, he wanted to get in to coaching via the Board of Control for Cricket. However late Abu Fuard put a spoke into that stated Lafir. Fuards excuse was that his coaching certificates from Australia was not good enough and they selected only English qualified coaches which was pure bunkum remarked Lafir.
During A.C.Ms tenure playing for Ceylon he faced Typhoon Tyson who he said was lightning quick, the first few balls Tyson bowled at him he could not see but only he could hear the ball thudding into the wicket keepers gloves. However once he got his bearings he tackled him well. Brian Statham he stressed had pace plus brilliant seam movement both ways and was hard to tackle.Dave Allen the off spinner was a steady bowler.
Lafir stated that it was a quite a challenge to face the spin twins of India, namely Subhash Gupte and Ghulam Ahmed. Lafir reminisced that when Gupte bowled he put so many revs on the ball and it hissed like a cobra and the corresponding spin was prodigious, and he also smuggled a well concealed googly in the rush. Ghulam Ahmed the tall and elegant left armer used to plug one end up enabling Gupte to snare batsmen to his trap from the other end.
Amongst the local pacies in his time it was T.B. Kehelgamuwa and late Sonny Yatawara with his tremendous upper torso who could generate good pace at will noted. Lafir added that for piercing pace Kehel was hard to beat. Anura Polonowita was another left arm spinner who could bowl the chinaman as well.
Lafir was coaching at Nomads and he immediately spotted two youngsters who had talent and he nurtured them. They were none other than Roshan Mahanama and Asanka Gurusinha. Lafir had high praise for Mahadevan Sathasivam when he saw him, Satha had seen better days but if he wanted to play a cover drive he could do so even if the bowler bowled outside his leg stump. Lafir said Kumar Sangakkara was always vulnerable to slow left arm orthodox and right arm leggies and he used to get trapped in the leg trap most of the time.
When inquired to draw comparisons between Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli without any hesitation he said that Tendulkar was the better bat since he played against better bowlers, in that era. Not so long ago they had quality bowlers noted Lafir, he went on to state that due to a plethora of T20 cricket bowlers have lost their sting.
There were times when A.C.M. found jobs hard to get and as a result he joined the police force as a sub inspector where he reluctantly showed his footballing skills as a left winger.
Lafir advised youngsters who want to go far in cricket to apply themselves diligently and to make sacrifices. He advised talented young batsmen to carry a skipping rope wherever they go so that they could improve their fitness and footwork. He still walks for about one hour in the morning in spite of a niggling left knee.

Americas World War I Dj Vu
Though he probably didnt know it, U.S. President Donald Trump was channeling Henry Cabot Lodge when he flew to Paris on Friday to join in the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I but elected to skip French President Emmanuel Macrons main eventhis Peace Forum promoting global cooperation.
A century ago, Lodge was the de facto Senate majority leader who had supported Americas entry into World War I, but in the years immediately afterward prodded America back into isolationism. As the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Lodge led the fight to vote down President Woodrow Wilsons League of Nations, denouncing it as a mongrel creation (though Wilson was to blame as well, having stubbornly rejected any compromise). Lodges campaign was the start of a broad U.S. withdrawal from the world, culminating in trade protectionism under the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, all of which exacerbated the Great Depression and the fascist spiral into World War II that followed.
We have torn up Wilsonism by the roots, Lodge declared happily after the dying Wilson, paralyzed by a stroke, was replaced by an isolationist Republican president, Warren G. Harding, who never brought up the League again.
Trump, joined by his fiercely unilateralist national security advisor, John Bolton, appears eager to follow a path today that is unsettlingly similar to what occurred a century ago. We reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism, Trump said at the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Globalism wasnt a word people used in 1918, but Lodge no doubt would have applauded the sentiment.
And bit by bit, Trump has sought to detach the United States from the world in a very Lodge-ian way. In less than two years in office, Trump has withdrawn from several multilateral pacts, including the nuclear deal with Iran and the Paris climate agreement; announced his withdrawal from the most significant nuclear arms control accord in four decades, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; begun a multifront trade war with China and U.S. allies; and declared his hostility to NATO, the G-7, the European Community, and the World Trade Organization.
Macrons Paris Peace Forum
Macrons Paris Peace Forum, in contrast, carries echoes of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that set the stage for the League of Nations. According to its website, the forum is intended to reinforce the lessons of the last century and the dangers of nationalism. It plans to convene all those among states and civil society that still believe that collective action, multilateralism and the good stewardship of common public goods are our best chance to address common challenges and maintain peace.
Perhaps no programme could be more distasteful to Trump and Bolton. Like Lodge, who declared that the League of Nations (in particular, its Article X) would force the United States to be pulled into the conflicts of other nations, Trump and Bolton are passionate sovereigntists who reject being tied down by international organisations.
I have loved but one flag, Lodge said, and I cannot share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league. A century later Trump declared in the same spirit: We will never surrender Americas sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy.
Trump indicated in August that he was going to Paris mainly out of pique, as a rebuke to local Washington, D.C., officials who resisted a commemorative military parade he wanted to hold on his own, saying it was too expensive. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. I will instead  go to the Paris parade, the president tweeted.
Asked why Trump isnt attending the Peace Forum, a White House spokesperson told Foreign Policy, It is simply a scheduling conflict. The President is going to be participating in a Veterans Day ceremony that is taking place at the same time.
After being snubbed his entire career, the national security advisors fierce unilateralism has at last become U.S. policy. But even he cant stop Trump from making deals.
Trump will instead visit Suresnes American Cemetery, where the bodies of U.S. soldiers are buried.
It is unclear how much of the international system Trump can tear down in the next two yearsor the coming six if he wins another term in 2020. Its taken a long time to build this system up, and most of the dozens of world leaders convening in Paris this weekend support it.
But as the leader of the nation that mainly created this systemthe nation that finally realized, after U.S. isolationism in the interwar years helped lead to World War II, that multilateral cooperation was neededTrump could probably do a lot to destroy it.
The president has shown before that hes unconcerned about unpleasant echoes from the past or long-ago historical memory. As Susan Eisenhower, a scholar and the granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower, notes, Lodges efforts ultimately yielded the pre-World War II isolationist movement known as the America Firsters. Even Trumps campaign slogan is the same, she said. And both movements were tinged with anti-Semitism.
True, as the Lodge analogue shows, there have always been a lot of Americans who agree with Trumps distaste for the encumbrances of an international system. The president is tapping into an old nativist tradition when, for example, he attacks other NATO members for not carrying their weight militarily in the alliance (even former U.S. President Barack Obama called them free riders).
Wilson himself was aware that when he asked Congress to declare war on April 2, 1917 to make the world safe for democracy, he risked offending American sovereigntists. Harking back to the warnings of the Founding Fathers against too many entanglements abroad, Wilson sought to reassure the U.S. Senate in an earlier speech, There is no entangling alliance in a concert of power.
international governance
But the failure of the League of Nations and other efforts at international governance were followed by the most horrendous war in history, one that left an estimated 60 million dead. Wilson had warned of this outcome, as did John Maynard Keynes. And so did prescient generals such as Fox Conner, who was mentor to both a young Dwight D. Eisenhower and George C. Marshall.
According to Susan Eisenhower, her grandfather recalled:
Again and again General Conner said to me, We cannot escape another great war. When we go into that war it will be in company with allies.  We must insist on individual and single responsibilityleaders will have to learn how to overcome nationalistic considerations
The horrors of World War II gave way to an effort to overcome Americas nativist, nationalistic impulsesindeed to fundamentally remake the world in Americas image so world war wouldnt happen again. President Franklin Roosevelt, who as the vice presidential candidate in 1920 had stumped for the League, proclaimed a concept as idealistic as Wilsons: the Four Freedoms. He and his successor, Harry Truman, created more geopolitically astute, workable structures than the League of Nations to secure them.
The U.N., with its Security Council designed around Roosevelts Four Policemen conceptwhich ultimately became the Permanent Five, with the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China each given a veto power to prevent the world body from unduly constraining their sovereigntywas a conscious effort to correct Wilsons mistakes with the League. We will not accept a world, like the post-war world of the 1920s, in which the seeds of Hitlerism can again be planted and allowed to grow, Roosevelt said.

Australia different ball game, says Indias Sharma
New Delhi, Monday: Batsman Rohit Sharma said India were brimming with confidence after their crushing home victories over the West Indies -- but warned that winning their first Test series in Australia was a challenge of a different order.
India completed a 3-0 Twenty20 series sweep over the West Indies on Sunday, to add to their 2-0 Test whitewash and 3-1 victory in the ODIs, extending their dominating home form.
But Sharma said an away series against old rivals Australia, even without their batsmen Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, who are banned for ball-tampering, would be a much sterner test.
Australia is always challenging when it comes to going out there and performing. Every time you go there, you are tested as a player, as an individual and as a team as well, the veteran opener said after Sundays win.
I think we have got to be at our best and when you win a series like this (West Indies) and when you play like that in the tournament you are high on confidence. Its all about taking that confidence to Australia and doing what we did as a team.
India barely have time to catch their breath before heading on Friday to Australia, where the first of three T20 matches is in Brisbane on November 21. They will also play four Tests and three ODIs.
The worlds number one Test side are only too aware that away from home, their form is fragile. They went down 2-1 in South Africa and then 4-1 in England this year.
Sharma said India must start fresh and forget about their recent wins if they are to take their home consistency to Australia.
Australia will be a different ball game I completely understand. But I think the things that we have been doing as a team and as a player, we keep repeating it, he said.
The best teams in the world keep repeating those performances. It will be important for us that we start fresh. Not think about what we have done in the past.
Sharma, the only batsman to hit four T20 centuries, is part of Indias squad for the Tests which start in Adelaide on December 6 after being overlooked for the five-day games in England.
I am someone who doesnt think too far ahead. So I am focusing on the T20 series first, said Sharma.
Of course the Test match is something that I was looking forward for a long time and it will be nice to go out there and represent India in Tests, but we want to win the T20s first.
He added: The last time (2015-16) we played a T20 format in Australia we won 3-0. AFP

Bangladesh cricketer Mashrafe to stand in election
Dhaka, Monday: Bangladeshs one-day international captain Mashrafe Mortaza will stand in next months election, the ruling party announced Monday, after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina endorsed the superstars foray into politics.
A photograph of 35-year-old Mashrafe, who enjoys rockstar status in cricket-mad Bangladesh, alongside Hasina ran on the front pages of many newspapers in the South Asian nation of 160 million.
A spokesman for Hasinas Awami League said Mashrafe had been given the green light from the prime minister, who is seeking a third consecutive term in office on December 30.
He plans to contest from Narail, said spokesman Mahbubul Alam Hanif, referring to Mashrafes hometown district in western Bangladesh.
Mashrafe has not commented publicly on his running for the Awami League.
Cricketing authorities said there was no prohibition on active players trying their hand at politics.
To run in an election is his constitutional right. If he wants to exercise these rights, we have no issue, Bangladesh Cricket Board spokesman Jalal Yunus told AFP.
We expect him to keep the balance between his playing career and politics.
An alliance of opposition parties led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will contest the election, despite their leader and thousands of supporters locked behind bars.
Cricketers moving into politics is nothing new in South Asia, where star players command god-like devotion from millions of fans. However it is rare for a sitting player to make the change.
Mashrafe is widely expected to retire after the World Cup in 2019.
He has already retired from Twenty20 international cricket and has not played a Test match since 2009.
Some fans welcomed his decision but others worried it would tarnish his reputation.
I may be wrong, but this is the worst decision of his life, one fan, Omar Faruq, wrote on Mashrafes fan page on Facebook. AFP

There is something magical about funfairs and carnivals that defy description while thrilling the senses. The glittering lights, the scent of popcorn and cotton candy, the screams of happy riders on giant-wheels and carousels are timeless pleasures at these events.
Ever since I was this high, fun-fairs for me been charged with excitement. I love the myriad coloured lights that give cheer and enliven the venue. Besides, there's no telling what exciting things might happen.
Authentic old time carnival fun fair attractions were a great way to unwind and try your luck or skills. No matter whether you were seven or 70 everybody loved the fun fair. Fund-raising carnival booths were allowed latitude to indulge in a little betting flutter and who cared about the silly Gambling Ordinance anyway.
Small fortunes were won or lost at the Crown and Anchor or the Lucky Seven dice game where a player could bet on three numbers - below 7, above 7 or the lucky 7. On numbers below and above 7 the players got double their stake and on Lucky 7 the players raked in three times their stake. At many of these charity fund-raisers the minimum bet was 25 cents and the limit set at five rupees.
And then there was the most addictive game of skill known to every man with a penchant for throwing, meaning the Tin Can Alley stall. The objective of the game was to knock down the tower of stacked tin cans in pyramid fashion off the shelf with six tennis balls. The trick was to hit the bottom tins, ballasted with sand that formed the base of the pyramid.
A few of us were able to knock all ten tins down like ninepins! It seemed all too easy and we sometimes did it with a ball to spare. For folks of all ages it was a chance to escape the everyday monotony and enter into a world of party and fantasy. It was all about dressing up and having fun. Even in those somewhat moderate times we schoolboys were constrained to tog ourselves out in the most colourful shirts reminiscent of rodeo cowboys or mafia gangsters.
And what I liked most about the carnivals was the carousel or merry-go-round, the most popular ride which cut across all ages in appeal. Sitting atop of those beautifully decorated horses you were transformed into another world. You could be a princess riding to the Kingdom of Wonderland, or you could be a prince on his trusty steed riding to save his princess from the evil witch.
Or maybe you were the Lone Ranger or Annie Oakley having a shootout with the kid on the other horse adjoining yours. The enchantment and beauty of the fairground with the blinking lights, imaginative creatures, swirling colours and dashing horses never failed to capture adventure in fantasy from the oldest and youngest of generations.
For kids and the youth of the 50s, 60s and 70s era the carnival was a really fun place to be. By the end of the carousel rides we were all flushed and dizzy  and ready to do it again. Waiting your turn, you were hypnotized by the smiling faces that spun past and sprayed the scene with laughter unparalleled.
And there was always the brass band that played at funerals, weddings and other mournful and celebratory events right in the thick of the spinning carousel. These middle-aged minstrels were much sought after to perform the tootooing on their horns accompanied by the tattooing drum beats with no flagging or sense of fatigue.
Still, playing on the merry-go-rounds at carnivals they appeared at their dizzying, delirious peak filled with a wild exhilaration and an immense sense of triumph. Theirs had always been an unmatched musical style filled with full-flavoured vigour and originality. When you consider carousel rides what comes to mind will be the kids. Why do kids love spinning It seems theres hardly an activity more fun for little ones than twirling around in circles as fast as they possibly can, holding hands with a friend, throwing their heads back, and spinning around together. They squeal with delight, eventually falling on their backsides, loving the fact that the world continues to spin long after theyve stopped.
Even if we dismiss merry-go-rounds as a little-kiddie ride, they have a long-lasting universal appeal that cannot be denied. People all over the world have enjoyed these rotating transports of delight for centuries. However, carousels may also be affiliated with notions of courtship and affairs of the heart. They appear to endorse romance in a sort of nostalgic, roundabout way with folks pierced by Cupids arrows.
You might have probably also seen teenagers, or perhaps adults, even octogenarian couples who take advantage of the carousel. These represent the main reasons why carousel rides are often associated with ideas of romance. So it's not just a dizzying fun ride for the kids, but is also associated with folks who are in love or who crave for the days of their halcyon youth.
From the standpoint of the teenagers who have fallen for each other, they can be still, with their heart, just like a childs. When they have always had an affinity for such rotating platforms with horses that go up and down, they could correlate these amorous emotions with the love of their lives.
While they may have outgrown a carousel, they have those feelings inside. After they fall madly in love, there exists a connection between the carousel and how they feel concerning their spouse. This may not be associated with just teenagers. It many instances it certainly does spread its spirit of romantic adventure transporting many older couples into a magical past. While for many vertigo can be experienced as a spinning sensation similar to riding a merry-go-round.
For example, you will likely seen elderly couples that happen to be relaxing in the chairs that usually come with the carousel ride. They may sit beatifically together, holding hands smiling while they go around in a state of dj vu.
My school buddy Mad Maurice imagined that merry-go-rounds were magical and totally underrated. He said: I proposed to my girlfriend on a merry-go-round because I wanted to spin the rest of my life with her. As my fellow reveler buddy at the time Rufie quipped: Its a ticket to fun and feelin' young. He was spot on because every funfair and carnival has been replete with a carousel of memories that can never be expunged by time.

Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Grabs Silver for Best in Responsible Tourism at WTM
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts wins the Silver Award for Best in Responsible Tourism at the International Travel and Tourism Awards held for the first time by the World Travel Market in London last Tuesday. Cinnamon was the only Sri Lankan brand to be recognised at the Award ceremony, competing with tourism destinations such as Kerala, to win this prestigious award.
The award was won for the Cinnamon Elephant Project carried out together with Nature Trails supported by the John Keells Foundation as an initiative for elephant conservation in Sri Lanka.
Dileep Mudadeniya, Vice President John Keells Group, Head of Brand and Marketing, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts and CEO Cinnamon Life Mall stated We give importance to projects of this nature as it addresses timely causes in the country and showcases Sri Lanka not only a destination with diverse offerings but is also socially responsible.
Cinnamon was honoured in front of an audience of more than 500 senior industry professionals at the gala event near WTM Londons ExCeL venue.
Nick Pilbeam, Divisional Director at WTM Londons parent company, Reed Exhibitions led the judging panel alongside UNWTOs Director of Communications, Marcelo Risi. ITTAs Co-Founder Paul Nelson said; We have been delighted with the response from the industry to the ITTAs and blown away by both the quantity and the qualities of the entries.
The International Travel & Tourism Awards, presented by WTM London, celebrate the success of national, regional and city tourist boards and recognizes outstanding private sector companies and individuals.
Carmeline Jayasuriya, Head of CSR and Assistant Vice President of the John Keells Group stated, We are delighted to have partnered Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts on this long-term initiative to study the elephant gathering, behavioural and dispersion patterns in Anuradhapura District.
We supported this initiative from its inception as it aligns to our Environment pillar in terms of promoting environmental conservation and sustainability and is also expected to recommend solutions to the human-elephant conflict which has become a pervasive issue in Sri Lanka.
Considered to be among the top 10 greatest natural animal spectacles in the world, the Elephant Gathering is the largest wild gathering of the Asian elephant, occurring annually within the safety of the protected Minneriya and Kaudulla National Parks in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka.
Under the Project the satellite tracking of two elephant herds from Minneriya and Kaudulla was undertaken through GPS collaring. Data gathered from tracking the collared matriarchs will help understand the exact seasonal movement of the elephant herds, and help tackle the human-elephant conflict through better land and water management recommendations.
We take great pride in the work that we do to promote responsible tourism in Sri Lanka, and the Cinnamon Elephant Project is one that is extremely significant to us due to the critical nature of this sensitive issue and that this effort will generate valuable information which can be shared encouraging best practices in eco-tourism especially concerning elephants and their habits, stated Chitral Jayatillake, Head of Nature Trails at Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts.

President Sirisenas constitutional remedy
The Constitution of Sri Lanka is titled Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Most political leaders acted meek with regard to the constitutional democracy in favour of their own gains. Democracy was confined to its mere verbal status until President Maithripala Sirisena took up the cudgels to offer a brave interpretation to the sanctified script in the countrys legislature.
What we face today is not a political crisis. It is the real activation of democracy by the Head of State we voted to office three years ago. He stands aloof irrespective of party politics in favour of the wishes of the people. It is also the wish of the international community to see the country has a Democratic government. The international community must read between the constitutional lines before pointing the accusing finger at the newly formed government. Let us hope and pray sanity will prevail over personal gains, for the prosperity and peace of this Island.
