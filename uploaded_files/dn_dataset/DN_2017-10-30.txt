1990 Suwasariya Ambulance Service to be expanded
The 1990 Suwasariya Ambulance Service, which has proven its efficiency in a short period since its commencement, will recruit 1300 new staff members to expand its service island wide.
Accordingly, vacancies are called for 650 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) and 650 Ambulance Drivers who are below the age of 35. Two hundred and nine ambulances will be added to the service as part of the extension as well.
The government initiated the Suwasariya Ambulance Service in mid last year with 88 ambulances and 500 Sri Lankan staff in the Western and Southern provinces aided by the Government of India.
Many groups with their own personal agendas attempted to mislead the public by milling rumours and leveling allegations. There was a rumour campaign which mislead the unemployed youths stating that persons with Indian nationality are to be recruited as staff members for the 1990 ambulance service.
However, the Suwasariya proved itself with its excellent service and at present, the government is in the process of setting up a foundation to be called The 1990 Suwasariya Foundation to continue the service and extend it islandwide. The islandwide extension will be done through a grant given by the Indian Government. National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, while visiting the 1990 Suwaseriya Command and Control Center at Rajagiriya, said this service perhaps one of the most efficient operations in Sri Lanka. He also commended the 500 plus staff employed at the center while stating that he is so proud of the commitment they all have shown. This services current response time is less than 13 minutes. Around 99.6% of calls are answered in the first ring. Over 40,000 emergency patients transferred to hospitals. Just imagine if we were able to save just 1% of lives! Obviously the figure has to be more. We are inundated with thanks coming from so many quarters, Dr. Harsha de Silva said. We are now in the final phase of the Act of Parliament to incorporate the 1990 Foundation which will be fully owned by the Government of Sri Lanka and run as an independent entity. The discussions are currently on with the Government of India and things are moving rapidly in finalising the islandwide rollout using the USD 15m grant, which is not a loan, but a grant just like the USD 07 million for the first phase, he further said.

## Title: Anita Brookner was no latter-day Jane Austen

Anita Brookner was no latter-day Jane Austen
The British novelist Anita Brookner, who died last year at age eighty-seven, suffered from the most misleading of literary reputations. Over the course of several decades and an astonishing twenty-four novels, including the Booker Prizewinning Hotel du Lac, the prevailing myth held that Brookner wrote conservative, middlebrow stories about dull and repressed women.
The novelist Tessa Hadley admitted in the Guardian that before reading her, Id expected something ladylike, lavender-scented, prissy and precious; I knew as soon as I opened my eyes to her words that this writing was everything opposite to that. On a recent episode of the Backlisted podcast, the literary critic and Brookner convert Lucy Scholes said, For many years, I labored under that rather stupid impression that she wrote novels about spinsters in the worst possible shape and form a spinster can take. It didnt help that Publishers Weekly, in 1990, described Brookner as a latter-day Jane Austen, a label oft repeated despite its almost comical inaccuracy.
Clandestine lives
If Austen popularized the marriage plot, Brookner upended it, immersing us in the emotionally clandestine lives of mistresses and other romantic misfits. Literature from the point of view of the other woman is rare, and she is the genres subversive maestro. Cheated-on wives, in her portrayal, are too self-centered, ruthless, and confident to warrant our compassion. In any case, their marriages and invariably privileged lives are never in jeopardy.
In The Rules of Engagement (2003), the unhappily married narrator, Elizabeth Wetherall, embarks on an affair with her older, undesirable husbands charismatic friend. Before she does so, she grimly assesses her soon-to-be lovers wife:
Small, dark, and sardonic, she was tacitly given permission to interrupt her husband, to demand attention, to wait with a cigarette between her long fingers until he lit it for her; and to view me with an amused insistence which seemed to me to hold little indulgence  She was rude, with the rudeness of a moneyed woman who was wealthier than her husband.
Right messages
The gift for demanding attention is, in Brookner-land, the defining characteristic of the successfully married woman. As a teenager, Elizabeth has already diagnosed herself as not the kind of woman who sent out the right messages. She was excluded, she perceived, by some sort of biological misunderstanding from the high-flown passion she saw in films. Yet nurture, not nature, is to blame. What has marked Elizabeth for life is the hostile atmosphere at home, the palpable enmity between an unfaithful father and a mother whose scornful bitter voice in the bedroom filled me with horror.
In Brookners tragic vision, the die is cast by family dynamics, and ones destiny, so ordained, cannot be averted via either inner or outer resources. Her heroines rarely aspire to personal growth (the very phrase would doubtless strike them as embarrassingly American). Nor do they undergo psychotherapy (which only features in her novel most explicitly about the Holocaust, Latecomers). Rachel Kennedy in A Friend from England has aquaphobia and is plagued by recurrent symbolic dreams but considers any kind of self-analysis dangerous. Telling dreams, like blaming ones parents, or falling in love and making a fool of oneself, comes into my category of forbidden things. Safer to stick to superficial attachments, easily ditched.
Look at Me (1983), one of Brookners earliest, saddest, and best novels, is a sustained and gripping meditation on her central theme: the inevitable and Darwinian triumph of the shallow and grasping over the observant and kind. Frances Hinton, an aspiring novelist who works in a medical library, is scarred by a past affair with, it is indicated, a married man (That time of which I never speak  That secrecy, that urgency, that lack of hope). When she is taken up by Nick and Alix Fraser, a glamorous couple she meets through work, deliverance from past mistakes and a brighter future seem possible.
Writing habit
Alix, a charming emotional terrorist, takes a proprietorial interest in Frances (or, as she calls her, Little Orphan Fanny), who marvels I had been rescued from my solitude; I had been given another chance. As she responds to the overtures of the Frasers divorced friend James, her writing habit is superseded by, if not quite happiness, then its tantalizing prospect. The passage in which she reflects on her new circumstances is a beautiful and brutal x-ray of a writers soul:
It was then that I saw the business of writing for what it truly was and is to me. It is your penance for not being lucky. It is an attempt to reach others and make them love you. It is your instinctive protest, when you find you have no voice at the worlds tribunals, and that no one will speak for you. I would give my entire output of words, past, present, and to come, in exchange for easier access to the world, for permission to state I hurt or I hate or I want. Or, indeed, Look at me.

Anuradhapura accident : Two police officers interdicted
Two police officers involved in an accident that killed two graduate sisters in Anuradhapura were interdicted, Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara yesterday said.
SP Gunasekara said a special investigation into the conduct of the two police officers was going on.
The two police officers were chasing a lorry when it hit the motorcycle. The two officers had turned their police vehicle when they witnessed the accident.
The investigators are also looking into the reason why these two officers were chasing the lorry, Gunasekara said. The deceased were Jayani Swetha Jayakodi (32) and Samadhi Navodya Jayakodi (29) from Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura. They were attached to the Public Service, one at the Audit Division of the North Central Health Ministry and the other at the Ambagahawewa Vidayalaya, Nochchiyagama. The lorry was transporting cattle and hit head on with a motorcycle the two sisters were travelling for work. They succumbed to their injuries after they were admitted to the Anuradhapura Hospital.

[APPRECIATIONS - (30-10-2017)]

V. Vamadevan
An innovative police administrator
V. Vamadevan was one of those senior police officers who had excellent public relations and always thought of the welfare of his subordinates.
He was one of those exceptional officers in the Police department, never wanting to follow only his predecessor's systems and always thinking out of the box.
Perhaps if he had joined the mercantile sector, he would have certainly reached the position of chairman with ease. Not many are aware that he initiated the change of uniform from shorts to pair of longs for the lower ranks with the blessing of the IGP at the time, Standley Senanayake.
It was his idea to have shoulder flashes with the insignia on the shirts worm by the constables and sergeants, despite comments by some by saying that it resembled beer bottle labels. However, later it became popular as it did give some colour to the uniform.
I never worked with Vamadevan, but it was certainly a strange meeting when he was the Colombo Police Commissioner, when we in the security industry invited him as our chief guest at the Police pavilion to form an association of industrial security, along with the then Lever Bros.
Security Manager Bobby Welikala, Rtd SSP late H. B. Dissanayake and the later Ceylon Cold Stores Chief Security Officer Sydney Soysa, who was then in the Defence Ministry. There were many others including Security Consultants and Investigators General Manager (and Railway Department former Chief Security Officer) E. J. De Silva.
He gave us all encouragement, but unfortunately, enthusiasm was lacking in most of the participants and only later, we formed the Industrial Security Foundation in 1992 with the leadership of Rtd. Senior DIG Edward Gunawardane.
It was unfortunate that Vamadevan and his family had to leave this country under sad circumstances. We lost a gentleman officer who would have contributed much to the Police Department and the country at large.
I did speak to him briefly on the phone in June, this year, whilst I was in Australia, as I had visited my son in Brisbane and the first question he asked me was "Nihal, when are you coming to see me" I had to disappoint him and told him that since I was in Brisbane, I would certainly see him during my next visit. He did inquire about various Police officers, including M. Edward Gunawardane and Terry Williams.
Perhaps I was not fortunate enough to see him before he closed his eyes! His wife, Charmaine and his children who lived close to his house were a blessing to him.
I recall a verse in a hymn which is typical of him:
Make me your brother, make me your friend Make me a part of your life till its end Accept me in full whatever I be Whatever my race, whatever my creed May he rest in peace.
Nihal De Alwis
Terry Willilams
He was an honest officer
I came to know Terry Williams when he was the Kuliyapitiya Police Headquarters Inspector with ASP Iddamalgoda when I was the officer-in-charge of the Narammala Police. He often acted for the ASP when Iddamalgoda was on leave.
Later, he retired prematurely due to personal reasons as a Police superintendent and on an appeal made by him, he was given the rank of retired Senior Superintendent of Police.
After Terry's retirement, he worked in the capacity of Security Manager at Carson Cumberbatch and Co., with his office located at Turret Road and overlooked all their institutions.
He had an excellent rapport with the Chairman, Directors to Manager and other staff.
His unblemished reputation in the Police, his sports connections at St. Peter's College and as Captain of the Police rugger team certainly helped him in his management and leadership skills. He was a capable leader and a rugby legend in the Police. As Security Manager of Carsons, he was assigned to work with me towards the end of 1997, when I was the KLM Royal Dutch Airline Security Manager, when KLM ceased to operate in Colombo. Both of us had a very responsible task in checking the travel documents as the airline was fined for transporting illegal passengers to Amsterdam and the West. In this operation, he was active and he displayed a high degree of honesty and integrity.
Perhaps my task was made easy by his presence and assistance and I would proceed on leave without any hesitation, as there were many travel agents who were trying to bribe both of us to send passengers with forged travel documents.
In our endeavour to prevent unauthorized travel, we angered many in the immigration, travel trade, airport and Sri Lankan Airlines, but Terry stood firm with me and KLM. He was courageous and feared none if challenged, as he was knowledgeable and a man of character, a rare breed.
Having retired from Carsons, he joined my company as a Director Consultant and was of great assistance to me in developing the investigation aspect and coordinating with the Police.
Some family members of his were keen that he retire from work and relax at home watching sports on TV.
I advised him not to retire and work half a day in my office, as he was still healthy and could drive his car.
But he opted to listen to his family members and ultimately fell ill due to inactivity and not having an opportunity to use his knowledge and experience and being unable to keep his mind and body occupied and alert. I visited him as often as I could.
It was sad that his wife Celine died before him, which made him depressed due to loneliness and lack of company with his long-standing spouse departing from this world. All his children were close to him and they loved him, so did his in-laws and the sister-in-law who cared for him till he breathed his last.
Terry, we are sad about your demise. But we know you lived an exemplary life. Perhaps you and Celine are together once again. May you rest in peace

Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudason
An exemplary teacher
It is saddening to know that death has taken way my dearest, eldest sister, 'Periya akka' Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudasan from our midst. She lived amidst us fruitfully for 89 years and the latter period of her life after retirement was spent with her daughter in the USA. It has been almost three months since she was called to eternal rest. We are certain she will be safe in the abode of our creator.
My husband and I share with her daughter and family, along with her loved ones, the pain and grief of their personal bereavement and poignancy of the void left in their lives.
As I write this tribute, tears from my eyes trickle down my cheeks and a flood of memories flash back to the days I spent closely with my 'periya akka.' Hailing from a distinguished family in Jaffna, my eldest sister had a great pride in our family heritage. She always loved and cherished her childhood memories and the times we spent with her. Even before she passed away, she phoned us on her last birthday, June 19 and expressed her concern about our health. She was the very epitome of love and sacrifice.
She had her secondary school education at Jaffna Vembadi Girls High School until she enrolled herself at Jaffna Central College for her GCE Advanced Level. It was during the days of the English Principal Scowcroft that my sister learnt English from her and developed the love of reading. Besides her academic progress, she excelled in Dramatics and Music, which helped her later in her career as a teacher.
She was a faithful and devoted wife, an affectionate mother, a loving grandmother, an understanding mother-in-law and a dearest sister. She brought up her only daughter in the fear of God, trained her in character and instilled noble values in her. Her hospitality endeared her to her friends and relatives and she stood by them in times of adversity. She was not only a mentor, but also a guide to them. Her life was exemplary and it was a blessing to her near and dear ones.
Though her loving and caring husband, Samuel Jesudason; who was a senior lecturer at Kundasale Training School of Agriculture, predeceased her in 1989; she did not feel her heart withered, because her daughter and son-in-law looked after her with much love and care and they kept her spirits up till the very end.
My sister started her career as an English Teacher in Jaffna with the qualification of London Matriculation and subsequently gained her BA Degree from the University of London, followed by a Postgraduate Diploma-in-Education from the University of Sri Lanka.
She spent her major period of her teaching career at Kandy Girls High School, which is a school of name and fame. She served there as a Graduate teacher from 1958 for 30 years and retired from her services in 1988. During her tenure, she held the positions of Grade 2 Special Post and Grade 1 Principal Post (SLPS-1).
Being an experienced graduate teacher with her Postgraduate Diploma-in-Education, she served with a stamp of efficiency, commitment and integrity and she was greatly admired by her students and superiors. She taught especially Tamil in the GCE Advanced Level classes and her strategy of teaching, interspersed with humour and familiar examples, made the students to comprehend the subject concepts easily and achieve excellent results.
She not only taught lessons to students, but also instilled in them the values of discipline such as obedience, punctuality and responsibility. Though she was stern, she built up a good rapport with the students. This facilitated her to maintain discipline. Her students still remember her as the sectional head of the Tamil section, attired in a sophisticated style, well-suited to her fair complexion, gracefully and elegantly walking down the school corridors to maintain discipline. Many of her students are holding professional qualifications and even serving in different parts of the globe.
She gave her full co-operation in all the extra-curricular activities of the school. She composed a song in Tamil in regard to the Education Ministry centenary celebrations and also served in the Education Ministry Centenary Executive Committee. She trained students, staged dramas and played a key role in organizing Tamil Day/Cultural celebrations. She was a good singer, song writer and had translated the school anthem into Tamil. She used to represent the principal at the principals meeting for the Tamil section.
Though she is a practising Christian, the most admirable quality in her is that she had reverence for other religions and never showed any racial or religious bias. She even trained the students for bhakthi gee programmes and thus, set an example of inter-religious harmony. She is the very embodiment of simplicity, gentility, geniality, generosity and humaneness.
The then principal of Kandy Girls High School, T. K. Ekanayake, in her school annual report, made a special mention of my dearest sister, Jeyadevi Chelliah Jesudason, as a person who had all the noble values of a successful teacher and that the void created by her retirement cannot be easily filled.
My sister had a lively mind even in her old age and she spent her leisure in a fruitful way. The pictures patterned in cross-stich by her reminds her aesthetic skill in decorative sewing as we see them on the walls of the sitting rooms of her relatives and friends.
My husband and I extend our deepest sympathies to her daughter Kausi, her son-in-law, Wijeyan (Both are University Dons) and to her grandson, Cholan who is pursuing his medical studies. May the Almighty God, the greatest comforter, give strength to them to bear this profound grief.
Let me conclude my tribute with the following lines:
Dearest 'Periya akka,' You are gone, but not gone forever. Your sweet memories, we always treasure; That too, to an immense measure. Your near and dear ones, you will miss, Until we meet again in heavenly bliss

Remembering Nirmala Devi Ramachandran
The first lady Inland Revenue Commissioner is no more,
Because this sprightly 81-year-old has been summoned before, The universe's creator, To be assigned a place in the abode of the Maker. The news of her demise, Came as a surprise, After a private funeral-cremation, To many a friend and relation. In the salubrious environs of Ward Place, she was born and bred, And lived there, performing on the worlds stage, till she was pronounced dead. Born in 1935, on the 23rd of November Died in 2017, on the 21st of September. The only girl in a family of four, Her father: the late Dr. Vairamutthu Kathirgamatamby predeceased her by 70 years or more, Though deprived of a father's love and care at a tender age The values of honesty, justice and fair-play, she was imbued with from her mother (Chellam) and alma mater, enabled her to face any challenging task on the worlds stage. At Ladies College, she had her primary and secondary education, And read for a Physical Science degree of the London University, from Aquinas College, a Private Institution, And secured a Hons. class degree, That paved the way to join the Prestigious Inland Revenue fraternity. In 1960, Dr. Surendra married Nirmala Devi. In 1962, they brought forth Sudarshan, their progeny, Who has soared over his fathers medical renown, By bagging two professorial medical gowns. Dr. Surendra and Nimo acted as the wind under the others wings, To soar to great heights despite envious stings. The husband was bestowed the much-coveted Deshamanya National Award, The wife as the First Lady Commissioner General in the field of Inland Revenue a recond. During her watch as Commissioner General, The Revenue Collection reached a very high level. The Collection for the period 94 -95 being 20 percent of G.D.P. The highest in the last one and a half decades of the 20th century. Nimo was a voracious reader, And also a great traveller, Hence, she put pen and photography to paper, To publish 3 volumes of Hindu heritage to enrich Hindu culture. To the Ramakrishna Mission Trust Fund treasury She assigned the books royalty, To be used for charity, To alleviate poverty. Friends and relations please note, Nimos favourite quote, Culled from the verse Farewell my Friend by Rabindranath Tagore A plea by those who we will, on planet earth, see no more 'Farewell, farewell My friends I smile and bid you Goodbye. No, shed no tears For I need them not All I need is your smile' It is difficult to say goodbye with a smile dear friend Because your life on earth has come to an end. But Sudarshan, Sanju, Shanath, Pravinath, Harishnath and those near and dear to you will you miss, While you enjoy eternal bliss.

ASPI rebounds to push past 6,600 levels
The Colombo Bourse continued its upward momentum as the ASPI increased by 40.21 points (or +0.61%) to close at 6,612.91 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also increased by 41.08 points (or +1.07%) to close at 3,872.50 points.
Sampath Bank was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing Rs 0.88 Bn or 21.16% of total turnover value. Ceylon Cold Stores followed suit, accounting for 11.38% of turnover (value of Rs 0.47 Bn) while JKH contributed Rs 0.36 Bn to account for 8.75% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to Rs 4.17 Bn (cf. last weeks value of Rs 3.93 Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to Rs 0.83 Bn (-15.09% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of Rs 0.98 Bn. Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 0.87% W-o-W (or Rs 25.89 Bn) to Rs 3,006.73 Bn cf. Rs 2,980.84 Bn last week.
Liquidity (in Value Terms)
The Banking, Finance and Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 38.70% (or Rs 1.61 Bn) of market turnover. Sector turnover was driven primarily by Sampath Bank, Central Finance, HNB & Orient Finance which accounted for 76.54% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 17.91% (or Rs 0.75 Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH and Hemas Holdings which accounted for 79.11% of the sector turnover. The Beverage, Food and Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 12.70% (or Rs 0.53 Bn) to the market driven by Ceylon Cold Stores which accounted for 89.65% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Ascot Holdings and JKH led foreign purchases while Peoples Leasing and Tokyo Cement led foreign sales. In terms of value Ascot Holdings and JKH led foreign purchases while Peoples Leasing and Tokyo Cement led foreign sales.
Point of View
Equity markets rebounded to a net positive position after a weeks hiatus, gaining 40 index points W-o-W cf. last weeks decline of 60 points. The ASPI consequently pushed past the 6600-level, to touch a one-week high of 6633 points as retailers who have been largely on the sidelines over the past few weeks re-entered markets on expectations that the prevailing low interest rate environment would continue for longer.
Equity markets over the month of October rose 2.7%, helping wipe off some of the losses recorded at the start of Q3 2017 (-5.5%) in the run up to Parliamentary approval of the new IRD bill.
The ASPI lost 4.6% over Q3 2017 as tax concerns dominated markets, but the greater certainty post-approval of the tax reforms have led to markets rebounding strongly to gain approximately 250 points in the weeks following approval of the Act. Although lower than that of last week, institutional and HNI activity also remained relatively strong, with crossings for the week accounting to 42% of total market turnover (cf. 55% last week) amid heavy activity in Sampath Bank, CCS and JKH which cumulatively accounted for approximately 25% of total market turnover for the week. Interest in Dialog and a strategic transaction in Ascot also helped propel turnover levels, with crossings in Dialog accounting for 10% of total crossings and Ascot accounting for 11% of the weeks total crossings.
Despite this activity though, average daily turnover levels (Rs 0.83 Bn) fell 15% over the week to close 11% lower than the YTD average of Rs 0.94 Bn. Net foreign flows to the Bourse however, rebounded to a positive position this week, totaling Rs 535 Mn cf. last weeks outflows of Rs 1.1 Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from Sept Quarter corporate earnings which have begun trickling in.
Sri Lankas higher fuel import bill in Jan-Aug 2017 is in line with Acuitys predictions earlier this year that the countrys fuel import bill will increase amid higher global oil prices and higher volumes due to drought-induced thermal-based power-generation. The Fuel import bill in Jan-Aug 2017 rose 54% Y-o-Y to $2,153 Mn (cf. $1,401 Mn in Jan-Aug 2016) as oil prices have risen 26% and import volumes have increased 22% relative to the comparable period last year.
It is expected that the year-end fuel import bill to be $3.3 Bn (in line with our earlier estimate of $3.1 Bn) as Brent crude oil prices are expected to close the year at $ 54/bbl amid tightening supply and stronger demand fundamentals.
Although this increase is expected to widen the trade deficit, the consistent capital inflows and an improved reserve position seen throughout 2017 will continue to support the year-end LKR value.
Some movement is likely due to seasonal importer dollar demand, but overall, the year-end LKR value is expected to be broadly stable. Nevertheless, external risks beyond 2017 have heightened amid increasing indications that Developed Market Central Banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ, BoE) are beginning to end an era of exceptional quantitative easing.
The synchronized monetary policy normalization (ie, end of QE programs) by the these Central Banks could increase Sri Lankas external financing risks (external debt repayments due between 2019 and 2022 are expected to average $3.6 Bn p.a) as higher global rates could result in lower risk appetite for Sri Lankas planned ISB issues in 2018/19 while simultaneously lowering foreign inflows to bonds and T-bills and pressurizing the LKR.

Be fit with sunshine vitamin
Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced by the body as a response to sun exposure; it can also be consumed in food or supplements.
Despite the name, vitamin D is considered a pro-hormone and not actually a vitamin. Vitamins are nutrients that cannot be created by the body and therefore must be taken in through our diet. However, vitamin D can be synthesized by our body when sunlight hits our skin.
Vitamin D deficiency
Although the body can create vitamin D, there are many reasons deficiency can occur. For instance, darker skin colour and the use of sunscreen reduce the body's ability to absorb the ultraviolet radiation B rays from the sun needed to produce vitamin D.
Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency
Getting sick or infected more oftenFatiguePainful bones and backDepressed moodImpaired wound healingHair lossMuscle pain
Health benefits of vitamin D
1) Maintains calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, two factors that are important for maintaining healthy bones.
2) Reduces the risk of influenza A infection during the winter.
3) In people with type 2 diabetes, insufficient vitamin D levels may negatively effect insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. Infants who received vitamin D had an lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes by the age of 32.
4) Low vitamin D status has also been associated with a higher risk and severity of atopic childhood diseases and allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and eczema.
5) Pregnant women who are deficient in vitamin D seem to be at greater risk of developing preeclampsia and needing a cesarean Cancer prevention.
Recommended intake of vitamin D
Vitamin D food sources
Sunlight is the most common and efficient source of vitamin D.

Buffer to settle countrys loans
Taking note of the biggest loan repayments coming in 2018-2019, the Government opts to maintain a cash buffer and obtain only long term loans over 10 years from now, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H S Samaratunga said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Dr Samaratunga said the net foreign reserves of the country stands at USD 7.2 billion at present, and therefore the Government is in a better position to negotiate with the financial institutions to obtain longer term loans.
However, he stressed the importance of maintaining foreign reserves at around USD 7-9 billion to be in a stronger position to go for long term loans.
If the foreign reserves decline in future, we will be out of options, but to obtain short term loans, he explained.
The Secretary also said his Ministry is in the process of making a plan to have a cash buffer to settle the countrys dues in 2018-2019, the peak in domestic and external debt repayment. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament recently that the country has to pay Rs. 1,974 billion in 2018 and Rs. 1,515 billion in 2019 for public debt servicing based on the outstanding debt as at end of August 2017.
Dr. Samaratunga said the new Fiscal Liability Management Act the Government plans to bring in will allow borrowing in advance for debt servicing in future. For example, if interest rates come down internationally in 2018, it is advantageous for us to borrow in 2018 rather than waiting for 2019. In that way you borrow more in 2018 and probably less in 2019. The idea is that we borrow in advance when the conditions are good enabling us to settle our dues in the future, he explained.
It is for the first time we are going to do such a thing. What we have been doing is finding money immediately before the due date. Now we hope to switch for a long term programme, he added.
The Secretary observing that the drafting stage of new Fiscal Liability Management Act has been completed said it will come to Parliament within the next two months. Commenting on the new legislation Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy on Friday said that it would enable the Government to borrow more than the requirement for the Budget of that particular year. For the moment, the Appropriation Act limits Government borrowing. With the new legislation, we can collect extra money to manage our future debts, he stated.
The Governor pointed out that there are no domestic debt maturities in the last five months of this year, and it enables the Government to collect a buffer of resources to manage the peak of domestic debt repayments next year. The domestic debt portfolio mainly consists of Treasury Bonds and around 30 percent of them will mature by 2019. USD 2.3 billion worth of Sri Lanka Development Bonds, which is a USD denominated domestic debt instrument, will mature by 2018.

Cake popsicles from leftover cake scraps
Meet Raymond otherwise known as Ray Ray. He is a self-taught baker from Melbourne.
About three years ago, whilst completing his Master Degree in Accounting, which wasnt of his interest, he started baking as a humble hobby. That year, he conveniently announced that he will be bringing desserts to every friends and family party he is invited to. Then he baked his first cake.
He is probably best known for unique cake designs and cake pops or as he calls them cake-popsicles. The idea of it came from using leftover cake scraps from his offcuts and failed attempts at bad recipes. He finds the usual round cake pop shape was a little dated and decided that the little popsicle shape would give him a slightly bigger canvas to play with.
The cake comes in a variety of flavours from classic butter pound to black sesame, spinach and most recently white lotus and salted egg yolks.
Some of his favourite designs are inspired by architecture, mythical creatures, elements of nature, cartoon characters and often from his travel.
Apart from accepting occasional limited order, in the past year, he has travelled to cities like Paris, Singapore, Taipei, Bangkok Jakarta and Seoul for demonstrations, workshops, and collaborative work.

CICT highlights Colombo Port as pivotal player in global trade
The pivotal role played by the Port of Colombo in global trade and its contribution towards the betterment of the South Asian region was the focus of a presentation made by Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) recently at an international forum in Shenzhen, China.
The presentation was made by Catriona Jayasundera, Head of Commercial and Marketing of CICT at the '3rd Forum of 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the 6th Shenzhen International Port Chain Strategy Forum which was part of the 12th annual China (Shenzhen) International Logistics and Transportation Fair (CILF).

Commenting on the companys participation in the forum, CICTs CEO Ray Ren said: As an integral part of the Port of Colombo, CICT has always focussed on promoting the strengths and strategic location of the port to global players. We use every opportunity available to raise awareness of what Colombo has to offer, and this presentation reached a very influential audience.
This years forum was organised by the Ministry of Transport of the PRC, the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government and Shenzhen Logistics and Supply Chain Management Association.

Public lobby against apartment construction in private residential areas needed
As a concerned citizen, I am writing on a matter of great importance which if not controlled immediately, could lead to grave consequences such as the Meethotamulla garbage incident.
The areas under Colombo, Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia Municipalities, Maharagama UC, Kaduwela Pradheshiya Sabha, Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha are undergoing major changes due to massive real estate developments in these areas.
The Planning and Building regulations 2008-2020 and Zoning regulations 2007-2020 covering Colombo and Suburbs (Sri Jayawaredenepura, Dehiwela Mount Lavinia MC, Maharagama UC, Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha, Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha) has been hastily prepared by UDA without proper public consultation during the previous government (Minister Dinesh Gunawardena) which we believe was to satisfy the needs of corrupt individuals.
Further, even if these regulations are applied to approve the planning, the actual construction falls short of the UDA requirements and certificate of conformance is obtained through corrupt means by developers.
I strongly believe that these regulations have been established without proper quantification of the traffic flow, utility and other requirements of citizens.
Citizens will have to pay for additional fuel expenses, loss of privacy, noise, structural damage to their properties, time wastage in traffic jams causing lost opportunities in earning additional income, Diseases in chest and lungs due to pollution resulting in higher medical charges etc..
We have seen the fires in London, Dubai and Singapore in apartments resulting in loss of life and property. This should be a good example to government and buyers of apartments. Ashley De Vos said that our Fire Brigades cannot cope up for fires in buildings more than 10 stories. We cannot allow Colombo to be another Chennai or Manila with blocked drainage and pollution.
Currently, I can see there is no strong public interest body or a nation-wide association to voice public concerns to the government and authorities. What happens is an individual or group of residents of a particular road writing letters to the newspapers.
I strongly urge public interested citizens to form a body and collectively create public awareness on the subject and lobby the government and authorities to halt new approvals temporarily and revisit the regulations, have public discussion and consultation with all stakeholders and bench mark them with regulations in developed countries such as UK, USA.
The regulations have to reviewed and amended and then strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure buildings are constructed as per regulations. The Public should be educated on the aspects which they should be vigilant. Apartment construction should be banned in residential areas and private roads.
They should be constructed only in areas with large land mass available (like Havelock City) or outside Colombo in non urbanized areas where open large extent of lands are available.

CMA participates at integrated reporting convention in Amsterdam
The Official Integrated Reporting Convention 2017 was held in October 2017 at Rai, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The theme of the convention was Unlocking value for future-fit organisations. The official convention was organized by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) headquartered in the UK.
Sri Lanka had representations from CMA Sri Lanka President Prof Lakshman R Watawala; Diesel and Motor Engineering Co. was represented by Suresh Gooneratne, Executive Director and Chandane Kodituwakku, GM  Finance and Controlling; and SheConsults, a consultancy company engaged in integrated reporting was represented by Director Aruni Rajakariar.
Prof Lakshman R Watawala President CMA with IIRC Chairman Prof Mervyn King and Charles Tilly, Executive Chairman CGMA Research Foundation and former CEO CIMA at The Official Integrated Reporting Convention 2017 held in Amsterdam
The convention covered a range of topics which included Market trends and integrated reporting (IR) impact; IR leading practice: Framework implementation  findings from the global review; Reporting trends: challenges, leading practice and investors views; Materiality: practical approaches to materiality in integrated reporting; Navigating the corporate reporting landscape: the corporate reporting dialogue and Task Force on Climate Related Financial disclosures (TCFD); Hidden capitals: are you undervaluing your biggest asset; Strategy: informing strategy with Integrated Thinking; SDGs: How to implement Sustainable Development Goals through Integrated Thinking; Financial Services: Understanding value creation in financial services to reduce systemic risk; Technology for management insight and progressive reporting; Academics and Business: What the research says and where more is needed; Communication of Integrated Thinking: Whats the right approach for you; Investors: Broader Thinking and longer term perspectives from Integrated Reporting and a keynote address from the Chairman of IIRC Prof Mervyn King and a welcome from the IIRC CEO Richard Howitt.
The CEO Richard Howitt in his welcome stated that evidence shows that businesses adopting IR perform better, benefit from a lower cost of capital and attract long-term investors. The secret is out - IR is good for business and vital for the future success of our economy, workforce and planet.
He further stated that over 1,600 companies in 62 economies are globally adopting IR, it is vital that we listen, learn and implement the findings of the important consultation.
Prof Mervyn King, Chairman of IIRC, in his address stated that integrated reporting is an evolution of corporate reporting, with a focus on conciseness, strategic relevance and future orientation.
As well as improving the quality of information contained in the final report, IR makes the reporting process itself more productive, resulting in tangible benefits. IR requires and brings about integrated thinking, enabling a better understanding of the factors that materially affect an organizations ability to create value over time. It can lead to behavioural changes and improvement in performance throughout an organization.
As set out in the International IR Framework, an integrated report is a concise communication about how an organization's strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to the creation of value in the short, medium and long term. The Framework enables a business to bring these elements together through the concept of 'connectivity of information', to best tell an organizations value creation story.
He also spoke on intangible assets, reputation, value creation, materiality, sustainability, classifying the 17 SDGs under economy, society and environment, use of natural assets, pollution of the planet, all of which need to be considered in Integrated Reporting.
CMA Sri Lanka organized the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2017 and the awards were presented by IIRC Chief Executive Officer Richard Howitt in July this year in Sri Lanka. Discussions were also held to hold a South Asian Integrated Reporting Conference in Sri Lanka in 2018 in association with IIRC.
As per Judges Report of the CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards 2017, although there was no regulatory requirement for companies in Sri Lanka to adopt integrated reporting there was an increasing trend observed in the number of companies producing Integrated Reports.
The judges noted a significant improvement in the quality of integrated reports presented this year. They were particularly pleased by the progress made in areas highlighted as needing improvement in the preceding year. Two areas stood out. One was the description of the value creation process and the other was the description of corporate strategy.
The winners of the CMA Excellence in IR Awards 2017 were Diesel and Motor Engineering Company in First Place, John Keells Holdings in second place and Peoples Leasing Co. in third place with another 10 companies receiving the Ten Best Integrated Reporting Awards.

Constitutional Reforms debate begins today
Parliament will sit as the Constitutional Assembly (CA) today to commence a three-day debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee that includes proposals for a new Constitution.
The debate will be held from 10.30 am to 6.30 pm on all three days. This is the sixth meeting of the Constitutional Assembly.
The Interim Report was tabled in the Constitutional Assembly on September 21 by the Steering Committee Chairman and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
All Parliamentarians, except the five MPs of the National Freedom Front led by MP Wimal Weerawansa are members of the Assembly. The NFF members pulled out of the Assembly in July.
The interim report, which deals with the vital aspects of Constitutional reforms including the electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State, spells out the contours of Constitutional Bill.

Controversy as Joshua retains world heavyweight titles
CARDIFF, Saturday - Anthony Joshua maintained his 100 per cent knockout ratio by stopping a bloodied Carlos Takam in the tenth round on Saturday.
The English boxer retained his International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association world heavyweight titles with a devastating display of his punching power to finish Cameroons France-based challenger at the Principality Stadium.
Takam became Joshuas 20th consecutive knockout victim in a fourth defence of his IBF belt and first of his WBA title, but the challenger stubbornly resisted the champion after being cut by the right eye in the fourth round. It was a good fight until the ref stopped it. I have the upmost respect for Takam, said Joshua, who injured his nose from a headbutt in the second round.
Imagine if its broke and I couldnt breath and he started catching up in the middle rounds It would have been a disaster, so I kept my cool. You have to control these situations because, if I showed any signs of weakness, the ref could have jumped in. Takam was also given a count in the fourth round before being finished off by a barrage of unanswered punches which prompted the referee Phil Edwards to stop it. Takam complained it was a premature stoppage, which was jeered by Joshuas fans, and the challenger was given warm applause afterwards.
I dont think they should have stopped it, said Takam.
I want the rematch if Anthony gives me it.
Takam, 36, had only accepted his first world title shot at less than two weeks notice and fought for most of the fight with a gruesome cut which obscured his vision.
For Takam, it was a fourth career defeat after a points loss to Parker last year and knockout loss to Russias Alexander Povetkin in 2014.
Takam, who boxed for Cameroon at the 2004 Olympics before relocating to Paris a year later, was drafted in as a late replacement opponent at 12 days notice after Bulgarias Kubrat Pulev injured a shoulder.
Joshua made an especially cautious start, not landing any power punches in the opening round, as he took time to assess Takam, who fought out of a crouch and burst forward with punches.
Joshua landed a good left-right combination in the second round, but did not have as much success in the third.
In the fourth, Takam suffered a nasty cut by the right eye from a big right from Joshua which caused him problems instantly with his vision due to the blood. When the fight continued, Takam was caught by a left that sent him spinning and was given a count as his glove was ruled to have touched down.
Takam bravely fought back in the fifth but Joshua teed off on him in the sixth, landing heavy, unanswered blows.
Takam had some of his best moments of the fight in the seventh round as he repeatedly caught Joshua.
Joshua tried to regain momentum in the eighth with two left hands that shook Takam, who was inspected by the ringside doctor at the start of the ninth round.
Takam was allowed to fight on but in the tenth he was shook by a right to the head and as Joshua unloaded more punches that landed flush, referee Phil Edwards stopped the fight. On the undercard, Dillian Whyte unanimously out-pointed Finlands Robert Helenius by scores of 119-109 twice and 118-110 to move into contention for a shot at the WBC world heavyweight title.
Irelands Katie Taylor won a world title in her seventh professional fight after unanimously out-pointing Anahi Sanchez for the vacant WBA lightweight belt by three scores of 99-90. Englands Kal Yafai also unanimously out-pointed Japans Sho Ishida in a second defence of his WBA world super-flyweight title, winning by scores of 118-110, 116-112 and 116-112. - AFP .

The dark story of the Little Mermaid
Little Mermaid, her sisters and the Prince are nothing like you would imagine in the original tale.
A 14-year-old mythical creature is on a mission to find true love in Hans Christian Andersens 1837 story. The lengths she goes to achieve that is nothing like Walt Disneys fairytale.
The original story is dark that included a murder and suicide. When Little Mermaid visits Ursula, the Sea Witch she strikes a deal, swapping her voice and tongue for legs.
She will only survive if she wins over the affections of the Prince. In Hans version, she doesnt get the man of her dreams as he marries someone else, according to a report by The Sun.
The heartbroken girl is offered another ultimatum by the Sea Witch. Murder the prince to live. She agrees but doesnt go through with the deal.
She eventually dissolves into foam. But as her spirit floats in the sky, she gains a soul by having to carry out good deeds for 300 years.
In the Danish authors tale Little Mermaids sisters were also not innocent. They would brag about luring sailors to their deaths into the water.
And the prince, well hes no prince at all. The book reveals her would be entertained by female slaves at the palace and he describes his love for the mermaid as he would love a little child.
Arent you glad Walk Disney made some tweaks to the story Because that is definitely no happily ever after. The Sun

Deadly cells in lungs
This week Clinical Consultant Oncologist attached to the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka ( NCISL), Maharagama Dr. N. Jeyakumaran, MBBC (Jaffna), MD (Colombo) speaks about lung Cancer that shows a rapid increase among Sri Lankans. Medical experts in Sri Lanka say that lung cancer is the second commonest cancer among Sri Lankan males at the moment.
Q What is lung cancer 
A - Lung cancer occurs when normal cells of the lungs change into abnormal cells that multiply out of bodys control forming a malignant growth in lung tissue. Lung cancer is the number one killer in the West. Lung cancer incidence is slowly rising in Sri Lanka too. It is the second common malignancy among men in Sri Lanka.
There are different types of lung cancer. Some types appear in the central part and others do occur in the periphery of the lung.
There are many warning symptoms. Common symptoms of lung cancer when it is confined to the lung or the thorax are:
* Prolonged Cough
* Chest pain
* Hoarse voice
* Spitting or coughing up blood
* Trouble breathing or wheezing
When it spreads to other organs it gives rise to many symptoms due to its effects on those organs: If it spreads to the brain, there may be headache, vomiting and or any weakness of limb. All of these symptoms can also be caused by some other conditions too. But if you have these symptoms, you should see your doctor immediately
It is very important to identify or diagnose lung cancer at an early stage so that one can have a curative surgery or radiotherapy. If it is in late stage it would be very difficult to treat to cure the condition and one need to tolerate many side effects of chemotherapy as well.
Q- Who are at risk of developing Lung Cancer 
A - Lung cancers do occur mostly among heavy smokers. Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, of which more than 70 behave as carcinogens that cause, initiate or promote lung cancer. Second hand smoke (Passive smoking) can also induce lung cancer. Lung cancer is also caused by exposure to asbestos or to polluted air especially in industrial zone. Exposure to radiation like Radon gas too increases the incidence.
Lung cancer can occur among non smokers and young adults due to alteration in their chromosomes or with genetic disorders that are very vulnerable to the genesis of lung cancer.
Q - How Lung Cancer can be diagnosed
A - When a person is having above symptoms or being a chronic smoker, he / she should consult a doctor to do some tests to diagnose lung cancer. When you meet a doctor firstly you will be examined and a chest X-ray too will be performed. If the chest X-ray shows a spot or a shadow that looks like a cancer, further special tests like bronchoscopy, CT scan or PET scan will be done. These special imaging tests show details of lung tissues and any tumour or abnormal growths within the lung as well. These imaging tests also help in staging the lung cancer to offer appropriate treatment.
A small sample of tissue from the abnormal area can be obtained by either with bronchoscopy or with CT guidance. This tissue can be examined under the microscopy for final diagnosis and pathological sub-typing. There are some special molecular biomarker studies, like EGFR, KRAS and ALK mutation status can be performed in the tissue for targeted therapy especially when it is an adenocarcinoma.
Q - What is the treatment available for Lung Cancer 
A - The right treatment for lung cancer depends on the stage and the type of the disease. When the lung cancer is in the early stage, radical surgery or radiotherapy can be offered to cure the condition. When the patient is well fit and eligible for surgery, resection of part of the lung or even removal of the whole lung will be done. But when the patient is frail, very old and with co-morbidities, surgery cannot be offered even with an early stage of the disease. In this situation radical radiation treatment would be the best alternative.
In late stages the only hope is chemotherapy. It will help controlling the disease but at the expense of its side effects. When the molecular biomarkers are well expressed in the lung cancer tissue, targeted therapy like Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Crizotinib or Osimertinib could be prescribed. These molecules have few side effects that are very manageable. Recently vaccines too are tried to manage few types of lung cancers.
Anyhow in very late stages these lung cancer patients suffer badly with breathlessness and discomfort. Good palliative treatment with aspiration of pleural fluids or pleurodesis and use of morphine to have better quality and comfort is very essential.
Q - What is the message that can be given for the healthy people to prevent Lung Cancer 
A - The best way to lower the chances of getting or dying from lung cancer is to quit smoking. It does not matter how much or how long one has smoked, but quitting will reduce the chances not only of lung cancer development, but also of the heart diseases and many other cancers.
It is also extremely very important to detect lung cancer at its early stage by consulting a doctor when the above symptoms do occur. Researchers have been studying "low-dose CT scans" as a form of good screening tool for lung cancer detection in early stages among high risk individuals.
Government of Sri Lanka has taken many steps to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, especially under the His Excellencys initiatives by displaying pictorial warning in the cigarette packs, implementation of laws to stop smoking in public places and total banning of asbestos based products such as asbestos roof sheets from the year 2018.

Depression brings on early death
* Men's risk increases by up to three times, while women's peaks at 51 per cent
* Past research links depression to disorders associated with lowered immunity
* Sufferers may also have poor lifestyle habits, such as inactivity and smoking
* The risk of a premature passing is highest in the years after a depressive episode
Men's risk of a premature passing increase three-fold when suffering from the mental health condition, while women's risk is heightened by up to 51 per cent, a study found. Previous research reveals depression causes the release of stress hormones that suppress the immune system, putting sufferers at an increased risk of conditions such as cancer. People with the mental health condition may also be more likely to have unhealthy lifestyle habits, including a poor diet, inactivity and excessive alcohol intake, past studies have shown.
The researchers analyzed 3,410 adults between 1952 and 1967, 1968 and 1990, and 1991 and 2011. The study's participants' had an average age of 50 when the trial started. Results reveal depression increases the risk of an early death by up to three times.
The risk is greatest in the years following a depressive episode. Previous research has linked depression to the release of stress hormones that suppress the immune system, putting sufferers at increased risk of disorders including multiple sclerosis, arthritis and even certain cancers. The mental health condition is more prevalent in women. However, past findings suggest men suffer the effects of it more as they are often less inclined to seek help.

DEVELOPING A NATIONAL PLAN ON WOMEN HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
A significant feature of post war Sri Lanka is the increase in Women Headed Households WHH). According to the most recent Household and Income Expenditure Survey (2012/13), 1.2 million households (23 percent) of the households in Sri Lanka are WHH. Currently, there are 58,121 WHH in the Northern Province alone. To address the needs of WHH, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) in collaboration with the UN Gender Theme Group, and the technical support of UNFPA is developing a national initiative to address multiple and overlapping needs of WHH.
Cabinet Paper - National Plan for Women Headed Households"
The UNFPA on behalf of the UN Gender Theme Group, developed a programme in 2015 to provide for an opportunity of a collaborated effort with the contributions of all stakeholders, GoSL, I/NGOs and civil society to address the vulnerabilities of WHH. A gap analysis of immediate needs and existing services for WHH was conducted in collaboration with the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and was used to further strengthen the programme design and Cabinet paper. The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) developed and submitted a Cabinet paper (No. 16/1991/740/010) titled National Plan for Women Headed Households in September 2016.
This paper was approved by the Cabinet in October 2016. The Cabinet paper sought permission for the following to formulate a three year national plan with Ministries and institutions relevant to the 6 sectors: of health and psychosocial support, livelihood development, support services systems, protection, social security and national level policy formulation and awareness raising.
Implementation Process
Health and psychosocial support
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in coordination with the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) is undertaking a mapping of all existing health services in each district, in order to understand the available services and gaps. MoWCAs existing database of WHH families within each district, will contribute to this process.
Livelihoods development and food security
The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is currently ensuring that WHH engaged in farming are provided with insurance coverages. Known as the Kethata Aruna insurance compensation scheme, this would provide financial support for WHH to engage in farming for livelihoods as well as compensations to WHH dependents (i.e. Children and elderly).
Support services
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Ministry of Land and Parliamentary Affairs (MoL) are currently conducting a mapping of WHH through the Bim Saviya land titling programme, which would provide a definitive percentage of WHH with clear land titles.
A mobile land titling clinic will be established in every Grama Niladari Division. The Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare (MSEW) and Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) are conducting an assessment of available services / care facilities for elderly dependents of WHH. In addition, divisional level staff/field officers are provided trainings to address the specific needs of these elderly dependents.
Personal Security: The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) is conducting a comprehensive research to identify root causes and contributory factors of SGBV against WHH. The research is conducted with reference to the SGBV National Action Plan to gauge information on incidents of SGBV against WHH and their children.
Social protection
The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) is currently coordinating with District Secretariat Offices across the country to identify vulnerable families including WHH and their dependents. These findings will feed into a database of vulnerable WHH at the Grama Niladhari level based on age/ dependents/income/education/living arrangements. As identified by the above programme, the number of WHH already receiving allowances through Samurdhi and PAMA will be noted, while preference will be given to the WHH families that are left behind.
The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) will launch the National Action Plan on Women Headed Households (2018-2020) prior to the end of this year (2017).
Progress andcurrent status
Six sectoral meetings (1. health and psychosocial support, 2. livelihood development, 3. support services systems, 4. protection, 5. social security and 6. national level policy formulation) were conducted with the participation of 17 key ministries and stakeholder organisations.
Field-level stakeholder consultations were held in the Mullaithivu, Kilinochchi, Puttalam, Trincomalee and Jaffna districts with the participation of state personnel, NGOs, civil society and womens societies. These consultations provided a more comprehensive situation analysis of WHH in the North and East.
High-level meetings were also conducted, and a number of outcomes were outlined with key ministries that attended the initial sectoral consultations.
Key ministries involved: Ministry of Rural Economy; Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources; Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of Land and Parliamentary Affairs; Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs; Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare; Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development; Ministry of Policy Planning and Economic Affairs.
Key sectors within the action Plan
The following sectors catering to WHH needs are addressed:
1). Health and psychosocial services: By supporting the current work of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Family Health Bureau (FHB) and by strengthening the coordinating capacity between MoH, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) and the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka (FPA), this will support WHHs full and equal access to comprehensive, high-quality and affordable physical and mental health care, psychosocial support, nutrition education and services throughout their life cycle.
2) Livelihoods development and food security: This component intends to build on current and former livelihood assistance programmes carried out by the Ministry of Womens Affairs (MoWCA), Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Economic Development (MED), various UN agencies and other development partners.
This intervention area aims to effectively empower WHHs by enabling them to establish sustainable, long-term employment recognising the diversity of skills, assets and vulnerable circumstance of WHHs, such livelihoods interventions have built-in safety nets that will help WHHs move out of poverty.
3) Support services: WHHs often carry a double-burden: balancing productive and paid labour with unpaid care work. WHHs responsibilities pertaining to care work often impede their engagement in stable employment, and contribute to worsening financial conditions. To address the double-burden carried by WHHs, this component aims to build on current and former support services relating to affordable housing, childcare, mental health care and other services carried out by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA), Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and the Department of Probation and Childcare Services.
4) Personal Security: The fear of violence and intimidation further restricts womens movement and impedes upon their education and livelihood activities. The aim of this component is to address the systematic repression of womens rights and SGBV issues pertaining particularly to WHHs by supporting the ongoing work of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs (MoWCA) and other CSOs.
5) Social Protection: WHHs face multiple constraints and barriers that can limit opportunities available to them and further push them into pervasive poverty and physical insecurity.
Addressing gendered forms of vulnerability across the life cycle of WHHs can lead to gains in gender equity, poverty reduction and human development, which is crucial for unlocking economic potential for pro-poor growth.
The proposed programme intends to build on current and former social protection mechanisms carried out by the Ministry of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage (MSEW), the Samurdhi Authority and the Department of Pensions.

Dont be rash save your cash!
World Savings Day, also called World Thrift Day, will be celebrated tomorrow, Tuesday October 31 across the world. The event was introduced in 1924 in Milan Italy for promoting the value of bank savings and re-establishing citizens confidence in banks.
Right from childhood, many parents insist that a penny saved is a penny earned. The phrase highlights the importance of savings. While growing up, our elders constantly tell us that we should spend less than we earn and save some portion for future use. They also teach us to spend money according to our income, and our expenses should not exceed our income.
A lasting impact
Saving is the path to success. The money saved can be used in tough times such as any emergency medical situation. It can also be used to create more money by the way of investment. That is why it is said a penny saved is a penny earned because you start earning more with your saving. The 2018 theme for the event is: Our future starts with savings.
That is why this years World Savings Day theme, tries to evoke the idea that savings are the path to a brighter future. Savings is one of the most important areas to change ones life. Research has shown that by saving, even in small amounts, it can have a lasting impact on future economic prosperity, including micro and small-business creation, social cohesion and an overall better quality of life.
Security is especially important in todays world as societies in both developing and developed countries are frustrated by globalisation. Recent political events are proof of the growing discontent of people and widening inequality between those in the top echelon of income and wealth and those being squeezed out of the middle class.
There is also a sense of control, which comes with the conscious decision to save. People are the captains of their own destiny, both in financial terms and other aspects of daily life. That is especially the case now, as digitisation of financial services has emerged as a major force changing the way we approach savings.
World Savings Day was established to inform people all around the world about the idea of saving their money in a bank rather than keeping it under their mattress. There had been some examples of days that were committed to the idea of saving money to gain a higher standard of life and to secure the economy. For example, the first national thrift day was celebrated in 1921. In other countries, such as Germany, peoples confidence in savings had to be restored because many people did not even think of saving since they had lost close to everything in the German monetary reform of 1923.
An absolute tradition
After the Second World War, World Thrift Day continued and reached the peak of its popularity in the years between 1955 and 1970. It became a veritable tradition in certain countries. The banks received support from the womens associations, professionals, sports associations, the clergy, schools and various other organizations. World Thrift Day was basically promoted as a mission of moral and economic rise.
Saving in many countries is considered as a phase of maturity of both the country and the people. Saving money is important for gaining a better standard of living and to preserve the economy. The first national Thrift Day was celebrated in the year 1921 in Spain and the US. However, in countries like Germany, the confidence of people had to be regained because the 1923 German monetary reform had left people with almost nothing.
Savings Day is promoted through propaganda and educational films, broadcasting, chorus singing, press-articles, leaflets, brochures, lectures and posters. The event continued after the Second World War and reached the height of its popularity in between 1955 and 1970. It practically became an absolute tradition in many countries. For instance, the Sparefroh (literal meaning: Happy Saver) the official amulet of saving in Austria gained such popularity that a street was also named after him.
Even today, Thrift education is highly popular in developed countries because most of the people in those countries believe in saving money and basically there is no single individual who does not own a bank account. The concept of inspiring people towards saving is yet challenging in developing countries where the ratio of savings accounts is very minimal and barely exceeds 10 percent. Saving banks play a major role in promoting savings in the developing countries with various initiatives and campaigns. The Savings banks also work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in order to increase the number of savings accounts owned by the poor.
World Savings Day also aims to promote savings in educational institutions such as schools of the member countries and thus various savings movements were planned in the schools. In the Thrift week, particular courses were prepared to teach children about the merits of Thrift. Savings bank passbooks and Money boxes were disseminated in schools. Thus, the event has influenced school savings to a great extent.
The mission of savings
Initially, the World Savings Day was partly an educational activity. The World Savings Bank Institute quoted that saving was a practice and an asset that are necessary for the social progress of an individual, a nation and of the entire community. Thus, the World Savings Banks Congress affirmed schools as the most trustworthy partner for teaching to the future customers.
It was suggested that Thrift education was important for everyone for utilizing and spending their money sensibly. Savings is also a key element in safeguarding the future of people against any adversities and uncertainties of the future. It is also necessary that people get habituated to save their hard money and oppose as well as fight the gambling and lottery game.
Since the high rate of unemployment and poverty is still prevalent in many regions of the world, educating people on saving and influencing them to save money is very important. Savings are crucial for preparing for the bad days of life. It is especially important during the days when generating income gets hindered due to several reasons such as illness, loss of job, disability or old age. Savings also form the basis for investment and for earning more income.
World Savings Day reminds us of the importance of regularly saving for having a protection net. Savings also help an individual in achieving the dreams or goals such as starting a business, healthcare treatment, receiving a good education or purchasing a home.
Saving your money is crucial for everyones future. It is important not only on an individual level, but also at the national level as it brings down the poverty rate of a country, thereby contributing largely towards economic development.
World Savings Day reminds people to join hands in the mission of savings. It influences different banks, schools, people and the community to let the fervour of savings continue and spread everywhere possible. [emailprotected]

England come from behind to beat Spain 5-2 in U17 World Cup final
KOLKATA, Saturday  Manchester City starlet Phil Foden scored twice as England came from behind to crush Spain 5-2 in the Under 17 World Cup final on Saturday.
Victory added to Englands growing list of youth honours  they have won the Under 20 World Cup and European Under 19 championship this year  and was revenge for losing the Under 17 European Championship final to Spain in May.
On top of Fodens second half brace, Liverpools Rhian Brewster scored his seventh goal of the tournament and Morgan Gibbs-White and Marc Guehi also pierced the normally solid Spanish defence at the Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata.
Gibbs Whites low shot in the first minute of a fierce-paced final in front of 66,600 fans produced a lightning reflex save from Alvaro Fernandez in the Spanish goal.
But Spain captain Abel Ruiz masterminded the first goal in the 10th minute, heading the ball down in the goal area for Barcelona teammate Sergio Gomez to push the ball in the net.
On 31 minutes Ruiz again opened the England defence and laid the ball on for Cesar Gelabert who found Gomez on the other side of the area waiting to rocket a shot past goalkeeper Curtis Anderson.
England fought hard to get back into the game. Callum Hudson-Odoi fired a right foot shot onto the post with Fernandez beaten.
The pressure paid off in the 44th minute when Steven Sessegnon crossed from the right and an unmarked Brewster headed past Fernandez. With the final action of the half, Brewster sent a 22-metre free kick at the goal which Fernandez just tipped over the bar.
The second resumed at a furious pace with England pushing hard for an equaliser. The breakthrough came in the 58th minute when Foden took the ball into the Spain penalty area and laid it on to Sessegnon who found Gibbs-White with plenty of space to fire the ball past Fernandez. - AFP

Federer downs del Potro for eighth Basel crown
Basel: Home favourite Roger Federer claimed his eighth Swiss Indoors title on Sunday with a 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 final defeat of Juan Martin del Potro.
The 36-year-old fought back from a set down to win the 95th ATP title of his career, taking him clear above Ivan Lendl into second on the all-time list behind Jimmy Connors mark of 109.
It was Federers first success against the Argentine in a Basel final, after the South American beat him in both 2012 and 2013.
Federers victory boosts his hopes of taking the world number one spot from Rafael Nadal, with the regular season ending next week at the Paris Masters, followed by the year-ending ATP Finals in London.
The 19-time Grand Slam champion has now won a Tour-leading seven titles this season after beating Nadal in the Shanghai Masters final a fortnight ago.
Congratulations to Juan Martin, Federer said. Youve had a great run since the US Open (when he beat Federer in the quarter-finals) and before.
I wish that I was able to play every week like you have, its going to be difficult for me in the future to do that.
Del Potro will be playing for a fourth successive week in Paris after coming back earlier in the season from wrist problems, as he looks to snatch a late place for the eight-man event in London.
The 29-year-old reached the Shanghai semi-finals and won in Stockholm earlier this month before his run in Basel.
Federer lost only two sets during the week as he improved his head-to-head record to 17-6 over del Potro, with a third win in four matches against the former US Open champion in 2017.
Its unbelievable how well Roger is playing, said del Potro. I hope to be in such shape when Im his age. But I doubt I will be.AFP

Stormy Waves and a Lighthouse -
A Glimpse at the Journey of Theresa May
Being called a bloody difficult woman might not be the best compliment a woman would expect to hear from anyone. But when Theresa May was called just that, she accepted it, confirmed it and seemed to even embrace it. When British politician Ken Clarke brought up the expression - in an admission of how formidable she is rather than an insult - May, unruffled, answered, Politics could do with some bloody difficult women actually.
Theresa May, the woman who took the abandoned wheel to steer her nation into safety amidst one of the riskiest storms in its political history. When she took office in July, 2016, following the European Union (EU) membership referendum in which the majority of the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, May became the leader of the Conservative Party and the second woman Prime Minister in the U.K. history.
May emerged as the unity candidate to replace David Cameron, who stepped down following the outcome of the referendum. What I want to do is just recognize that there is a job to be done here, over the next few years. I want to get on with doing that job, determined and resolute, May once said, commenting on her first year in office in Downing Street and the weight of the task she finds at hand with Brexit.
That her party should rally round her at such a time of national uncertainty is testament not only to the respect in which she is held across the party but to the fact that, in a world where political reputations can be shredded in an instant, Mrs May is the ultimate political survivor, writes British journalist Gavin Stamp on the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website.
Early Life
Born on 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, Sussex, May is the only child of Zaidee Mary (ne Barnes) and Hubert Brasier. Her father was a vicar and her mother was a strong supporter of the Conservative Party. She attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there.
May then attended the University of Oxford where she read geography at St Hughs College, graduating with a second class BA degree in 1977.
Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who from an early age spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister.
Her university friend Pat Frankland, speaking in 2011 on a BBC Radio 4 profile of the then home secretary, said: I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions.
I well remember, at the time, that she did want to become the first woman prime minister and she was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first.
In 1976, in her third year at Oxford University, May met her husband Philip who was the president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders.
Early career and stepping into the political waters
Between 1977 and 1983 May worked at the Bank of England, and from 1985 to 1997 as a financial consultant and senior advisor in International Affairs at the Association for Payment Clearing Services.
But it was already clear that she saw her future in politics. She was elected as a local councillor in Merton, south London, and served her ward for a decade, rising to become deputy leader. However, she was soon setting her sights even higher.
She first entered politics in 1992 and worked her way up the ladder. In 2009, she became shadow work and pensions secretary.
In the early days at the parliament, she became known for her remarkable choice of footwear  her kitten heels became famous in the political circles in the noughties, while, on BBC Radio, she named a lifetime subscription to Vogue as the luxury item she would take to a desert island.
In May 2010, when May was appointed Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality by the then Prime Minister David Cameron as part of his first Cabinet, she became the fourth woman to hold one of the British Great Offices of State.
As stated in the BBC website, the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, after one difficult meeting with May once said, Shes a bit of an Ice Maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Even before she became the Prime Minister, May made history by becoming the second longest serving home secretary in the U.K. in the past 100 years.
She successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she lists as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.
May, who has become a confidante as well as role model for aspiring female MPs - told prospective candidates before the 2015 election that there is always a seat out there with your name on it. Generally thought to be in the mainstream of Conservative thinking on most economic and law and order issues, her social attitudes are slightly difficult to pin down. She backed same sex marriage and expressed a personal view in 2012 that the legal limit on abortion should be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks.
May has been seen to have strict migration rules. Speaking at the first prime ministers questions since the summer recess, May said, We continue to believe as a government that its important to have net migration at sustainable levels  we believe that to be the tens of thousands  because of the impact particularly it has on people at the lower end of the income scale in depressing their wages.
While the early years of Mays time in Downing Street may be dominated by the process of divorcing the UK from the EU, she has said that Brexit wont be allowed purely to define her time in office. As reported by the BBC, she has promised a radical programme of social reform, underpinned by values of One Nation Toryism, to promote social mobility and opportunity for the more disadvantaged in the British society.
Snap Election and losing majority
In June, 2017, May called for a snap general Election in the U.K., intending to strengthen the position of the parliament for the anticipated complications with Brexit. The outcome of the election was, however, quite a shock as it lead to Hung Parliament, Mays party losing the majority and turning to the Democratic Unionist Party to support them in forming a new government.
As media blared that Mays gamble backfired, she was called to step down by opposition leaders and grass root members of the Conservative Party, itself.
Among whispers that say she plans quit as Prime Minister after delivering Brexit in August, 2019, Theresa May still stands firmly on her feet, deftly maneuvering the weight on her shoulders. She moves onward, with her nation, and is always prepared for the tests the world dares to bring her.

GMOA on-board with government stance on SAITM


The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President requesting an appointment for a meeting in order to inform him of the GMOA's stand on SAITM solution presented by the Government, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that during the meeting with the President, the GMOA also expects to resolve unclear facts mentioned in the set of proposals presented by the Government to solve the SAITM issue.
Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it is commendable the Government decided to abolish SAITM, remove the ownership of SAITM from its current owner and his family and to legalize the minimum standards of medical education according to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) document.
The GMOA will extend its fullest support to implement the set of proposals - with certain amendments - he said.
He said he was confused about the proposed new institution to be set up after abolishing SAITM.
Whatever new institution must obtain the compliance certificate from the SLMC. This new institution should be scrutinized by a state body. The `Government / State Policy' mentioned in the Government's statement is not clear at all, he said.
An Interim Committee should be appointed under the SLMC immediately to look into the issue of current students in SAITM. The country's law should be implemented against the current SAITM owner for all grave offences executed by him so far, he added.

Honest to the core
Women play a significant role in development spheres and contribution to the national economy is enormous. Helen A. Meegasmulla, took on duties as the Commissioner General Department of Excise on September 18, 2017 to building a healthy society in Sri Lanka, which is free from illicit liquor and narcotics drugs. She is the first ever woman to head the department in its history.
The Department of Excise operates under the purview of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. It has legal authority for the implementation of excise policies of the Government and relevant activities including the protection and collection of excise revenue. In addition the authority and responsibility for administration of Tobacco Tax Act, the collective responsibility for the enforcement of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance with the Police and other relevant agencies and the responsibility of effecting of National Authority Act on Tobacco and Alcohol are also mandatory functions delegated to the department. The department is engaged in performing a national mission providing social security, by collecting a part of government revenue to finance the countrys economic development as well as preventing the use of illicit liquor by detecting illegal activities falling under the legislations.
The department sees efficient and effective administration of the Liquor and Tobacco industry in Sri Lanka through the collection of revenue, preventing of illicit manufacture and sale of products for development and welfare of the society as its mission. Families face many issues due to illicit liquor. Illicit liquor is consumed by the poor and they become even more poverty stricken. It is unhealthy for the human being. Illicit liquor is manufactured and distributed in every part of the island.
There are six special units in the department to detect such places and bring them under the law of the country. The persons holding the permits are also monitored to see whether they adhere to the rules and regulations. Our officers will prepare a technical crime report and fine the wrong doers, Meegasmulla said.
Aim
Commissioner GeneralDepartment of ExciseHelen A. Meegasmulla

While eradicating the use of illicit liquor she is aimed at uplifting the toddy tapping industry one of the oldest traditional industries in Sri Lankan history.Our aim is to free the society from liquor. Together with narcotic units and the police department we raid many placed where illicit liquor is made. During British ruling coconut industry was introduced to our country. Coconuts were abundant those days, but now there arent coconuts enough for consumption so people make artificial toddy which is very unhealthy, she said.
We will assist the toddy tapping industry to develop. We welcome suggestions and ideas of those who are involved. There are shortcomings in the industry which hinders its development. The diminishing of the toddy tapping industry would see the increase of the consumption of illicit liquor. Toddy is said to be a healthy beverage with medicinal values if manufactured according to the standards and consumed adequately, Meegasmulla said.
The Government estimates revenue from this industry of which there is a 30 per cent decline. It is our duty to see the targets are achieved. At the moment there are leaks in the collection of taxes. The Excise Department has officials will work to overcome these issues, she added.
Commenting on her responsibilities as the Commissioner General, Meegasmulla said it is prestigious position bestowed by the people. People chose us as their leaders. When I carry out my duties I think of the staff, the Government and the ordinary people of the country. I have to bring all three sectors on one platform and balance how I treat each party. I have to learn from people and take what is beneficial for the country to develop the economy. At the same time I have to communicate with the political leaders to achieve the revenue targets of the Government, she said.
The door is open
No one has to wait in a queue to meet me. The door is open for anyone to come and meet me regarding their issues. Some illicit liquor manufacturers have their own grief. When they admit they did wrong I cannot turn aside without opening up any avenue for them to earn an income. After all they have their families to look after. I try to help them to be good citizens in every possible way, Meegasmulla said.
I am also concerned about the women living in estates communities. They are vulnerable to many unhealthy practices due to low economic status and social inequalities. Steps should be taken to uplift their lives. Living and working in outstation areas as a District Secretary has exposed me to the hardships of life of women. It laid the foundation of my career and equipped me with the necessary experience to address issues at a larger scale, she pointed out.
Different perspectives
Meegasmulla says a woman tends to look at things in a different perspective. Whether you are a woman or a man you should be honest with your work and carry out responsibilities accurately. You have to put your heart and soul into your duties, be creative and innovative. A woman has the ability to handle work under any circumstance. As a daughter she grows up close to her mother and learns discipline and learns to take the responsibility to be a mother one day.
Most women dont earn money unnecessarily or misuse money. Women being in top positions will benefit the country, she said.
Meegasmulla also hopes to launch several programmes to safeguard young children from drug addiction. School children are addicted to drugs at present which has become a menace. The officers of the department will also be trained to carry out their duties efficiently and effectively. Finally I hope the society will be a better place for all of us to live in, she concluded.

Earlier sparkling centuries by opening batsman Rohit Sharma and skipper Virat Kohli steered India to 337-6 after being put in to bat.
Sharma, who smashed 147 off 138 balls, and Kohli, who made 113, became the first pair in ODIs to record four double-century stands between them after putting together 230 runs for the second wicket.
But it was the superb death bowling show by Bumrah that stood out in the big-scoring game. Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal also chipped in with two crucial wickets. Kiwi opener Colin Munro hit a quickfire 75 to give the visitors a blazing start despite losing his partner Martin Guptill for 10 to Bumrah. Munro put together a crucial 109-run partnership for the second wicket with skipper Kane Williamson, who made 64, as the pair took the attack to the opposition bowlers.
The left-handed Munro, who smashed 8 fours and 3 sixes in his 62-ball knock, took a special liking to Indian pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar, whose first five overs cost 51 runs.
Chahal soon spun into action to send Munro and Williamson trudging back to the pavilion as New Zealand stumbled in their chase.
It was then that the left-handed Latham got down to the grind, forming crucial partnerships with Ross Taylor and Henry Nicholls and take the attack to the opposition. Kumar bowled Nicholls for 37 and Bumrah soon took over to dash New Zealand's hopes of winning their first series on Indian soil.
The action now shifts to the three Twenty20 internationals starting November 1 in New Delhi. AFP

Innovation Towards Sustainable Agricultural Productivity
Since of 1990, the Agriculture Faculty of the Jaffna University has endured untold hardship and evacuation and now, after years of handicap, the faculty has ultimately returned to its official home, after a quarter century with effect from the beginning of the faculty.
It is remarkable that this faculty initiated by late Professor Alagaiah Thurairaja and a like-minded progressive movement on December 3, 1990, in Kilinochchi; for a period of seven years, was in total disarray, wandering about with uncertainty. In 1998, the faculty began functioning in the University of Jaffna and until 2014, continued in a state of instability and privation.
Enduring hardships
Jaffna University Agriculture FacultySenior Lecturer K. Umashankar.
Notwithstanding the hardships endured, graduates of the university's Agriculture Faculty are in gainful employment here and abroad in respectable and responsible offices. For this achievement, the faculty is indebted to the united and untiring effort of the staff who helped shape the formidable personalities who are now to be reckoned with. We remember their selfless services continuously. The following were the deans in chronological order from the inception of the faculty under whose consistent guidance and direction, the prevailing status of the faculty was achieved. They are; Prof. K. Kandaih, Prof. S. Mohanadas, Prof. A. Navaratnarajah, Eng. R. Vijayaratnam, Prof. S. Rajadurai, Dr. S. Sivamathy, Prof. G. Mihunthan and Prof. M. Thushyanthy.
Having finally returned to its prescribed permanent location, the Agriculture Faculty proposes to persevere towards compensating for the loss of time and usurped opportunities and targets in the agricultural sector of the region.
Inaugural conference
The Agriculture Faculty, in its jubilee year, conducted an inaugural conference titled 'International Conference on Dry Zone Agriculture' (ICDA). It was intended to bring together eminent researchers of the local and international community of all disciplines related to agricultural science. The main focus of the conference was to give priority for dry zone agriculture with special emphasis on agriculture and environment by providing a platform for delegates to disseminate their research findings.

The third international research conference with reference to dry zone agriculture has been scheduled to be held at the auditorium at the Agriculture Faculty from November 1-2 at Ariviyalnagar, Kilinochchi. The faculty acknowledges with appreciation, the contribution of the Indian Government for the infrastructure which is an integral part of the faculty currently.
In view of the needs of changing times, local and foreign professors, professionals, scholars, young researchers and students would attend this conference titled 'Innovation Towards Sustainable Agricultural Productivity.'
In this event, which will be chaired by the Agriculture Faculty Dean, the special guest will be Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha. The chief guest will be Jaffna University Vice Chancellor Prof. R. Vigneswaren.
The conference commences at 8.30 am on November 1. Academic Affairs Director and Horticulture Professor at Annamali University, Tamil Nadu, India, Professor K. Manivannanan is scheduled to deliver the plenary address.
The following dignitaries shall deliver keynote addresses. Prof. G. L. L. Pradeepa Silva of the Department of Animal Science at Peradeniya University, Prof. Jeevika Weerahewa of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Business Management at Peradeniya University, Prof. Terence Madhujith of the Department of Food Science and Technology at Peradeniya University and Dr. Meethika Vinthanage of the Faculty of Applied Sciences at Sri Jayawardenepura University.

On the second day of the conference, the theme address will be delivered by American University of Nigeria Dean and Professor of Economics John E. Leonard. Following this, UNICEF Health and Nutrition Program Officer N. Sutharman will speak on 'Contemporary Issues-Sustainable Development Goal' (SDG). The day will end with a panel discussion on Contemporary Issues and Future Engagement of Issues in Dry Zone Agriculture, chaired by Professor. C. Sivayoganathan.
The panel will consist of Prof. Manivannan, Jaffna University Graduate Studies Dean Prof. G. Mihunthan, World Bank Development Economist Geeva Perumalpillai, Agriculture Research Additional Director Dr. S. J. Arasakesary, HNB Northern Region Senior Regional Head S. Sunthareswaran and UNICEF Health and Nutrition Programme Officer N. Sutharman.
In the above international conference to be held in six sittings, in each sitting, researchers will be submitting their findings under distinct independent subtitles. Thus, nationally and internationally, a cumulative number of 66 research papers are to be submitted.
Climate Change and Agriculture, Agricultural Economics, Post-Harvest Technology, Farm Mechanization and Irrigation Water Management, Applied Economics, Agro-forestry and Crop Production, Food Science and Technology; Livestock, Aquaculture and Fisheries; Plant Protection and Biotechnology and Soil, Water and Environmental Management, are the sub-themes under which the nine sittings will be conducted.
For prolonged viability and feasibility of this conference, it is imperative that regional entrepreneurs take an active role in all its aspects.
It is essential that the Agriculture Faculty should endeavour to promote both regional and national development, particularly in the field of agriculture. In that sense, future research conferences shall form the base for envisaged development.
Jaffna University Agriculture Faculty Senior Lecturer K. Umashankar took five and a half years to finish his degree in Agriculture which would have otherwise taken 3-4 years to complete. He persevered like many of those who chose to study in the Agriculture Faculty of the University of Jaffna. The faculty, initially based in Jaffna, had to be moved many a time as the war front caught up with them.
At times, we were functioning out of private homes, recalled Umashankar.
During the final phases of the war, the Faculty functioned out of Jaffna and though the peninsula practiced intensive agriculture, it was not the best place to set up an agriculture faculty in.
There was no space for our farms; we could not conduct our practical examinations or trials. We also felt that the other academics in the University would treat us differently. We all wanted to go back to Kilinochchi, he said.
During the last few years, the faculty was finally able to move back to Kilinochchi and they are rebuilding their legacy from scratch.
We recently got more buildings and though we have 27 permanent staff and 30 temporary, we are still short of human resources and other facilities, said Umashankar; but more importantly, he noted that they still have not been able to deliver on their purpose of serving society and contributing to regional development through their work.
The Northern Province though mostly agrarian has shown very little interest in pursuing agriculture as a field of study. Umashankar pointed out that 70 percent of their students were from the South and that those who did end up in their faculty, were the ones with too low a Z Score to enter medicine or science.
They do not choose agriculture here. They are here because they have no other alternative, thus, we dont see the passion towards the field. Naturally, we have less people contributing to agriculture in the area, said Umshankar.
Over the years, the faculty has only produced six agri-entrepreneurs, a handful working in the Department of Agriculture and around 20-25 who have taken up agriculture part time to take care of their family farms. The rest have either chosen to go abroad or get into other fields such as banking or NGO work.
In countries like India and the west, students choose agriculture; they have an interest in it and thus they contribute to the progress of the field, said Umashankar. This was important to ensure the food security of a country currently preoccupied with being consumers, rather than producers.
The third International Dry Zone Conference, thus, is seen as a positive step to give focus to the Faculty and create more interest in the field.
When we first started three years ago, academics from other universities were surprised to know that the University of Jaffna even had an Agriculture Faculty. In our first year, we only got around 20 papers, then it gradually increased to 35 and now we have 66! said Umashankar.
We are progressing. In the next 2-3 years, we will get enough papers and the best would be sent in for general publication and used for policy recommendation purposes, he added.
The Conference is also seen as a good opportunity for the facultys students to interact with other academics in the field and get the exposure they need. For the moment, however, it signifies that the Agriculture Faculty at the University of Jaffna has finally arrived on the map.

## Title: Jean-Paul Sartre and the demands of freedom
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, October 30, 2017 - 01:00
Jean-Paul Sartre and the demands of freedom
In Existentialism and Humanism, Sartre wrote, There is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art. True to a central maxim of his existentialist philosophy  to be is to do  Sartre built his colossal reputation as a philosopher, novelist, playwright, screenwriter, biographer, diarist, literary theorist, essayist and journalist out of sustained hard work.
He was gifted but preferred to attribute his achievements to perspiration rather than inspiration. As he wrote in his autobiography, Words: Where would be the anguish, the ordeal, the temptation resisted, even the merit, if I had gifts From childhood his ambition was to be the great, dead French writer he became. He wrote for at least six hours a day for most of his life. If I go a day without writing, the scar burns me.
Sartres prolific and often drug-fuelled output is now a part of the legend, along with his numerous love affairs (despite his self-proclaimed ugliness), his wartime adventures and the post-war, hard-left political activism that led him and his lifelong companion, Simone de Beauvoir, to fraternize with many dictators.
Behind the melodrama
By the standards of most philosophers, Sartre led an exciting life. His adventures, his singular appearance, his relentless radicalism, his eccentricity, make him an easy figure to caricature, and he was canny when it came to crafting his image, but for all that there is a serious, systematic and inspiring philosophy behind the melodrama, a grand theory rooted in the best traditions of Western thought.
Born in Paris in 1905, Sartre was fifteen months old when his father died, leaving him to develop free from the oppressions of a paternal will. He was raised by his doting mother and her father, whose sizeable library was the precocious childs playground. Following a difficult period of exile in La Rochelle when his mother remarried, Sartre progressed to the prestigious cole Normale Suprieure where he met de Beauvoir and (on his second attempt) graduated with top marks in 1929.
The easy fame he had expected as an undergraduate eluded him and in 1931 he became a provincial school teacher in Le Havre. He continued studying and writing, however, and by 1938 finally made his name with the publication of his cult existentialist novel, Nausea.
Conscripted at the start of the Second World War, Sartre was taken prisoner by the German advance of 1940. He may have been released on medical grounds, he may have escaped, but by spring 1941 he was back in Paris where he founded the resistance movement Socialism and Freedom. All this time, invigorated by the war, he had been writing his major work, Being and Nothingness: An essay on phenomenological ontology, published in 1943.
Often called the bible of existentialism, this dense 650-page book was the extraordinary distillation of everything his monumental intellect had read, written, considered, experienced and discussed for more than twenty years. Today it is part of the canon of Western philosophy.
Authenticity elsewhere
Most philosophical analysis of Sartres existentialism has centred and continues to centre around Being and Nothingness. At the heart of Sartres philosophy are four closely related phenomena: consciousness, freedom, bad faith and authenticity. Being and Nothingness deals with the first three and promises a future work on the ethical plane. Authenticity is central to Sartres ethics.
Sartre never completed a book on ethics but he says enough on authenticity elsewhere for his position to be clear. Importantly, Sartres view of authenticity makes sense only in light of his view of bad faith, his view of bad faith only in light of his view of freedom and his view of freedom only in light of his view of consciousness. Sartres question in Being and Nothingness is the same as that of his major influences, Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger: what is consciousness What is the nature of a being that has and is a relationship to the world, that is an awareness or consciousness of the world and which acts upon the world Sartres answer is that the only kind of being that can exist in this way is one that is, in itself, nothing; a being that is a negation, non-being or nothingness.
Following Husserl, Sartre argues that consciousness is always consciousness of something. Consciousness is not a thing in its own right but entirely a relationship to the world it is conscious of.
This is the theory of intentionality. Consciousness always intends its object and is never merely a set of brain states. Expectation is expectation of something, desire is desire for something and so on. Sartre refers to consciousness as being-for-itself in order to highlight the fact that it does not exist in its own right, as the world (or being-in-itself) does, but must constantly achieve its borrowed being for itself by being consciousness of being-in-itself.
Each of us is a being-for-itself in relation to being-in-itself. Human reality encompasses both the facts of our situation and the not-yet-realized potential of the things we are not, but which we could be. It incorporates both the facts of our lives and our past  our facticity  and the negating, nihilating force of consciousness by virtue of which we have transcendence. We do not exist simply in our own right as chairs do, but always in relation to  and as the negation of  our situation. A chair is, but we must constantly create ourselves over time through our actions. We have to choose who we are each moment by what we choose to do, without ever being able to become a fixed entity. This is what existentialists call the indeterminacy of the self. The self is not a thing, it is a being unavoidably caught up in a constant temporal process of becoming.
Moving forward
Time or temporality is important for Sartres theory of consciousness. The dimensions of temporality so familiar to us, past, present, future, are the same as the dimensions of consciousness, to the extent that past and future only arise as features of the world through and for consciousness. We are never entirely what we were  the past  and not yet what we will be: the future. As for the present, it is nothing but our presence to the world as a being constantly moving forward in time. To reach the future is for it already to be past. Hence, tomorrow never comes.
Sartre calls the past past-future and the future future-past.
Closely related to being-for-itself is being-for-others. Certain features of a persons consciousness are only made real because of the consciousness of another person  the Other: shame, embarrassment and pride, for example. A person is his being-for-others whenever there is an Other conscious of him, one who is free to evaluate his actions as he chooses.
The Other is free to look at me, judge me, form opinions of me that I cannot ultimately control. And since each of us is Other to the Other, interpersonal relations are marked by conflict; each one of us casts everyone else as a being-for-others in our eyes; we are free to judge and objectify them and they in turn constantly and inexorably judge and objectify us.

Lawyers for Democracy expresses disappointment in BASL
A New Constitution which includes abolishing the Executive Presidency, greater devolution of power and electoral reform, has been an unrealized electoral promise of Presidential Candidates since 1994, Lawyers for Democracy said in response to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL).
Issuing a statement on Saturday, the Lawyers for Democracy stated that it was disappointing that the BASL would raise an ignorant question as What is the need/requirement for a new Constitution at this stage of the reform process.
The statement follows:
Lawyers for Democracy on the constitution-making process and the role of the BASL
It was reported that the BASL, at a special meeting held on October 23, resolved to express its concern about the proposed amendments to Articles 1 and 2 of the present Constitution. The Statement of the Bar Council also alleges that proposed amendments in the Interim of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka had the effect of converting the Unitary character of the State to a Federal structure.
The BASL has also forwarded 12 questions for the Government to answer and the first question was What is the need/requirement for a new Constitution Considering the history of this country, it is indeed disappointing that the BASL would raise such an ignorant question at this stage of the reform process.
In response to this question, at the outset we note that the BASL has, in the past, stood to protect Rule of Law, Human Rights and Democratic Form of Government. Thus, in or about early 2016, the BASL made proposals to the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms and subsequently to subcommittees of the Constitutional Assembly dealing with Independence of the Judiciary and Fundamental Rights.
We note that a New Constitution, which would include abolishing the Executive Presidency in its present form, greater devolution of power and electoral reform, has been an unrealised electoral promise of Presidential Candidates since 1994.
A large section of the Bar welcomed the steps taken to formulate a new constitution where thousands of people and professionals (including the BASL) have given their proposals.
We are also mindful of the fact that the present Constitutional reform exercise also seeks to address the national question, an issue which has remained unresolved since independence and, in its unresolved form has plagued Sri Lanka and been the cause of a three-decade long civil war which has claimed the lives of countless thousands of Sri Lankas sons and daughters, while leaving many more countless thousands maimed, displaced, orphaned and widowed. The importance of a political solution to the National question has been accepted since the late 1980s and even the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) appointed in 2010 recognises this;
The Commission takes the view that the root cause of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka lies in the failure of successive governments to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people. The country may not have been confronted with a violent separatist agenda if the political consensus at the time of independence had been sustained and if policies had been implemented to build up and strengthen the confidence of the minorities around the system which had gained a reasonable measure of acceptance. A political solution is imperative to address the causes of the conflict (LLRC Report p 291, Para 8.150, 8.151)
In this background we are appalled by the position taken by a small section of the Bar Council, based on a meeting held on a Monday afternoon to seek to discredit the present constitution-making process.
The Form of Government is a political and ideological issue that transcend all ethnicity which need to be answered politically and not by a small and unrepresentative section of a professional association. The questions that have been formulated shows that BASL at present has also taken a hard ideological line akin to the extremist elements, undermining value of diversity respected by the BASL before.
We note that in a very recent and progressive judgment of the Supreme Court, his Lordship Dep PC CJ held that The labelling of states as unitary and federal sometimes may be misleading. There could be unitary states with features or attributes of a federal state and vice versa. In a unitary state, if more powers are given to the units, it could be considered as a federal state. Similarly, in a federal state, if the centre is powerful and the power is concentrated in the centre, it could be considered as a unitary state. (SC Spl 03/2014, S.C. Minutes 4.8.2017).
The Statement of the Bar Council appears to have been released without reading the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka (Interim Report). The Statement has been issued based on a reading of one paragraph of the report, considered in isolation.
It is misleading (if not palpably false), to suggest that the present proposals advocate federalism.
A reading of the Interim Report makes it clear that:
- In Sri Lanka, sovereignty will vest with the people and shall be inalienable and indivisible.
- Sri Lanka should remain one undivided and indivisible country. - There shall be specific provisions included in the Constitution to prevent secession (division of the country).
- The Constitution shall be the Supreme Law of Sri Lanka.
- The power to amend the Constitution, or to repeal and replace the Constitution, shall remain with the Parliament and the People of Sri Lanka (where applicable), in the manner set out in the Constitution.
(page 1 of the Interim Report)
The Interim Report clarifies the matter further in its suggested formulation as to the nature of the State:
Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is a free, sovereign and independent Republic which is an aekiya rajyaya/orumiththa nadu, consisting of the institutions of the Centre and of the provinces which shall exercise power as laid down in the Constitution.
To prevent any misapprehension as to the meaning of the nature of the State, the phrase aekiya rajyaya/orumiththa nadu has been defined to provide a fixed definition:
In this Article aekiya rajyaya/orumiththa nadu means a State which is undivided and indivisible and in which the power to amend the Constitution or to repeal and replace the Constitution, shall remain with the Parliament and the People of Sri Lanka as provided in this Constitution
(page 2 of the Interim Report)
The Interim Report also provides additional safeguards against secession (which are not contained in the present 1978 Constitution):
1. No Provincial Council or other Authority may declare any part of the territory of Sri Lanka to be a separate State or advocate or take steps towards the secession of any province or part thereof, from Sri Lanka. (page 2 and 5 of the Interim Report)
2. Granting special powers to the President which can be exercised in the event of a threat of secession etc by a provincial administration. (page 26 of the Interim Report)
Anyone who bothered to read the Interim report, which has been in the public domain since September 21, would appreciate that it is within this framework that it is suggested that there be maximum devolution of power. Devolution of power is essential to ensure greater political accountability and balanced regional development, not only in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, but also in other underdeveloped regions such as the Uva Province.
Questions from 6 to 12 are dealt with in the Reports of the Sub-Committees of the Constitutional Assembly, and are to be debated by the Assembly. Hence, while proposals with regard to those questions are contained in the Sub-Committee Reports (for anyone interested enough to read same), it is apparent that a final decision will be made after the debates of the Constitutional Assembly. This could not have escaped the attention of the Bar Association, which also made submissions before one or more of those sub-committees.
It is regrettable that some elements within the BASL appear to have taken an irresponsible approach in dealing with the multi-party Constitutional reform process. This is particularly regrettable in light of the divisive speeches made by politicians (including one in which the speaker called on all those supporting constitutional reform to be murdered).
The BASL needs to be a force for reason and unity not an instrument of division and narrow political gain. We call upon the leadership of the BASL to engage constructively in the reform process, in a professional manner, and bearing in mind the need to urgently resolve the national question which has plagued our motherland.

Man City surges on, United sink Spurs to stay second
LONDON, Saturday: Manchester City maintained their charge towards the Premier League title with a 3-2 win at West Bromwich Albion as Manchester United kept within five points of their neighbours with a 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.
Goals from Leroy Sane, Fernandinho and Raheem Sterling moved the leaders on to 28 points - equalling the best return after 10 matches of a Premier League season - as irresistible City took their campaigns tally of league goals to a remarkable 35.
Earlier, Jose Mourinho received the response he had demanded from his United side following their humbling defeat at Huddersfield Town as an 81st-minute goal from substitute Anthony Martial preserved their perfect home record.
The win, their sixth straight victory in the league at Old Trafford without conceding a goal, moved United on to 23 points, three clear of Spurs as champions Chelsea and Arsenal both marched to within a point of their London rivals.
Chelsea boss Antonio Conte, who had shown unusual irritation last week when asked about stories linking compatriot Carlo Ancelotti with his job, seemed rather happier after Eden Hazards 51st minute goal earned his side a 1-0 win in the late game at Bournemouth to maintain their fourth spot.
Arsene Wenger celebrated a successful 800th Premier League match in charge as Arsenal fought from one down to beat Swansea City 2-1 with second-half goals from Sead Kolasinac and Aaron Ramsey.
Liverpools Juergen Klopp got the better of his best friend, Huddersfield boss David Wagner, in a 3-0 win at Anfield where second-half strikes from Daniel Sturridge, Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum pushed the Reds to sixth on 16 points.
Watfords giddy ascent, though, was checked with a 1-0 home defeat by struggling Stoke City - Darren Fletcher hit the target in the 16th minute - that dropped them to seventh on 15.
At the other end of the table, Crystal Palace escaped with an astonishing 2-2 draw with West Ham United, coming back from two down and earning a draw in the seventh minute of stoppage time through Wilfried Zaha.
Pep Guardiolas Man City continue to look unstoppable at domestic level, having opened up in brilliant fashion with Sane scoring his sixth goal in seven league games after 10 minutes.
Though Jay Rodriguez equalised quickly, City were in complete control once Fernandinhos deflected effort put them ahead after 15 minutes.
Substitute Sterling scored his ninth of the season in all competitions four minutes after coming with Citys only late moment of concern en route to a 13th straight win coming when careless defending from Nicolas Otamendi let in Matty Phillips for a consolation.
Citys 28 points equalled the tally accrued by Chelsea in 2005 and Manchester City themselves in 2011 - and both those sides went on to win the title - but neither of those teams could match the plus-29 goal difference of Guardiolas charges.
The manager reserved special praise for Sane, describing him as a special talent after City extended their unbeaten record in all competitions to a club record 21.
Mourinho hailed Uniteds win in difficult windy and rainy conditions in the lunchtime fixture between the second and third-placed teams as deserved after they had created the lions share of chances.
Martial struck 10 minutes after coming on, latching on to Lukakus flicked header from David de Geas goalkick.
It was a scruffy left-foot finish from the Frenchman, leaving Mourinho to smile: Martial scores with a bad shot -- but the bad shots can be the most beautiful.
Wenger was in bullish mood after Arsenals win, saying the Gunners had proved their critics wrong by overturning a lead for a third time in a week.
Again we have showed the mental strength to come back and win the game, said Wenger, now just 10 matches short of former Manchester United boss Alex Fergusons landmark of 810 Premier League matches as manager.  Agencies

Miller hits fastest T20 ton as South Africa rout Bangladesh
Potchefstroom: David Miller smashed the fastest century in Twenty20 international cricket as South Africa outclassed Bangladesh by 83 runs in the second and final Twenty20 international at Senwes Park on Sunday.
Millers 35-ball hundred propelled South Africa to 224 for four before Bangladesh were bowled out for 141, completing a clean-sweep for South Africa in two Tests, three one-day internationals and two T20 internationals.
It was an extraordinary innings by Miller.
Dropped on nought, he admitted: I felt pretty scratchy to be honest. In the first ten balls I could have been out twice.
He had only scored 18 runs off 14 balls, then came an assault which yielded 82 runs off 21 balls to get to his century.
Once I hit one or two I decided to keep going, he said.
The previous fastest T20 international century was made off 45 balls by fellow South African Richard Levi against New Zealand in Hamilton in 2011/12.Five of Millers nine sixes came off the first five balls of the 19th over, bowled by promising all-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin, who had dismissed AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla and conceded only 22 runs in his first three overs.
Miller said he felt the rare feat of six sixes in an over was possible.
I got to the fourth one and thought I might as well go for it. The fifth one came out nicely.
Saifuddin pushed the last ball of his over wide of the off stump and Miller mistimed it for a single.
Looking back I probably could have hit six off six, said Miller.
The left-handers innings could have ended off the second ball he faced as he gloved an attempted pull off Rubel Hossain.
Bangladesh wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim dived to his right and appeared to have caught the ball but lost control as he landed on the ground. Miller shared a 79-run fourth wicket partnership off 41 balls with Hashim Amla, who made 85 off 51 balls with 11 fours and a six. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan admitted it had been a poor tour for his team.
Today was a reflection of the series. We need to learn a lot from this. We have been terrific for the last two years at home but now it is time to get better overseas.
Bangladesh made a good start, restricting South Africa to 37 for two in the first five overs.
Shakib opened the bowling and sent down all his four overs in one spell, taking two for 22. But his teammates could not sustain the pressure in the face of Millers onslaught.
Bangladesh scored 17 runs off the first over, bowled by Beuran Hendricks. But Imrul Kayes was run out in the second over and the tourists never threatened again.
Miller was only the fourth South African to hit a century in 100 T20 internationals. AFP

Mindfulness CEO forum at Waters Edge
Mindfulness bestows emotional development on people of a country that is on fast track towards sustainable development, said globally renowned Mindfulness Guru Lydia Kan at Mindfulness CEO Forum held at Waters Edge.
Kan, a coach for IMD Business School's flagship High Performance Leadership course, teaches emotional intelligence, mindfulness, creativity and leadership in business schools and innovation academies.
The tailor-made session titled, Global Business Benefits was aimed at empowering CEOs in the corporate sector to enhance performances of their teams. Participating CEOs expressed how mindfulness has changed their lives.
What motivates you and what motivate others is important to a leader. Psychological safety is of utmost importance. Distractions hamper constructive communication and you must offer and accept feedback. Every participant in a meeting must be motivated to speak. Before responding to someone, be mindful to stop, breathe, notice, respect and think, said Kan at the interactive session.
She added, More than professional qualifications, titles and achievements, trustworthiness, warmth and ability to control situations help you in meetings. Always nurture one-to-one talk in communication and avoid resorting to constant communication via e-mail.
Meditation, regular exercising and yoga help a great deal in developing skills of attention to detail, she further commented.
The Mindfulness Centre for Wellbeing Sri Lanka unveiled in March 2017 by its Managing Director/CEO Peter Lalith Pinto is envisioned as a centre that caters to people from various walks of life to incorporate teachings and practice of mindfulness into their day-to-day activities.
By living in the present moment, you will see a vast purview of things that matter to your life. My life was in chaos when I got into the mindfulness bandwagon to calm my mind. I am determined to spread the message of mindfulness to the corporate sector for it to achieve enhanced productivity and wellness, said Pinto.
Mindfulness has been embraced by Apple, Google, GSK, Goldman Sachs and Aetna to witness revolutionary enhancement of productivity and wellbeing of their staffs.
The Mindfulness Centre for Wellbeing having chapters active in Sri Lanka and UK strives to make mindful living accessible. Programs that empower persons regardless of their age or profession greatly impact their overall performances.

National Cleaner Production  Centre signs MoU with IDB
The National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC) held a discussion with the Industrial Development Board (IDB) last week over the growing concern of the world to ensure greener world, under the Private-Public-Partnership program and last week signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the IDB.
The NCPC Chairman Gamini Gunasekera in its discussion with the IDB Chairman Mahinda Jinasena , had mentioned that the NCPC would assist the IDB to conduct training programs at regional level, to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) registered with the IDB, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a greener world for better healthy living. Strictly adhering to the instructs, the SMEs receive , will enable to obtain the ISO 14001 certificate issued by the SLSI.
The NCPC in a statement issued subsequently , had observed that there was a world movement showing greater interest among governments and industries to change the way of interact with the environment. According to that statement, the focus of this movement is to reduce environmental impact from industry through changes in industrial behavior and technology being used.
Nowadays consumers, suppliers, governments and the market at large are increasingly demanding environment responsibility from the business community. By ignoring this trend and rejecting the opportunity to improve environmental performances may find themselves left behind in the highly competitive global market. Therefore it is mandatory for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to minimize waster and by that reduce the impact to the environment.
 Cleaner production is a broad concept that addresses all aspects of inputs, production and outputs and defined as the continuous application of an integrated , preventive environmental strategy applied to processes, product services to increase overall efficiency and reduce risks to humans and the environment. The objective of the project is to facilitate SMEs to optimize the usage of resources through CP approaches, provide them with financial assistance to take remedial actions or preventive measures to minimize waste of resources and help them obtain ISO 14001: 2015 certification for the industry.
The ISO 14001 specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an organization can use to enhance its environmental performance. It helps an organization to achieve intended outcomes of its environmental management system, which provide value for the environment, the organization itself and interested parties, the statement added.

(Not) on state service
The main function of a modern State is the management of public affairs in keeping with widely accepted principles, values and procedures. But this is easier said than done, because the decisions of the state in many areas are influenced by diverse and even conflicting ideas and interests. This is what we observe in the recent history of human societies. The State itself has taken many forms and shapes due to the same reasons. The ideas of early capitalism, socialism, social democracy and global capitalism under neoliberalism combined with diverse interests embedded in them have shaped many societies in the recent past with wide ranging consequences.
Meanwhile, not all societies have fully embraced modern political ideas of democratic governance and, as a result, remnants of traditional monarchies, theocracies, autocracies, etc. exist side by side with modern democratic states. The way the public affairs are managed varies widely across the world due to this diversity and the people living in different parts of the world experience divergent outcomes due to this reason.
If we look at the recent history of the country, the Sri Lankan State evolved under western colonial rule and later, during the post-colonial period, and diverse ideas, both exogenous and endogenous, have shaped its structure and functions. For instance, the basic law under which the country is governed had changed several times and right now, we are debating what sort of a new constitution is suitable for the country, if at all. The same is also true for a whole range of other aspects of the state, including its functions. In 1977, a liberal economic policy was adopted and, as a result, the role of the Sri Lankan State in the management of the economy and social sectors changed significantly.
Diverse groups in society
The role of the State in managing public affairs is done through state polices, legislation and other interventions. When we look back over the years, policies and interventions in many areas have changed under the influence of changing ideas and interests. Though it is not so difficult to imagine what kind of changes are likely to follow a particular policy shift, the adoption or non-adoption of a new policy proposal depends on the relative influence of different ideas and interests articulated by diverse groups in society.
Some of the policies adopted have immediate effects while others lead to long term consequences. Since these effects can shape the social, economic, cultural and political conditions in the country in a decisive manner, serious and rigorous policy analyses should precede the adoption of policies.
Many institutions contribute to such analyses, including the ones that are established by the State for the sole purpose of developing policies in a particular sector, I.e. Education, health, social security, etc. In many countries, there exist national level planning bodies that assist governments to adopt evidence based policies and interventions. Though most Western European countries vigorously followed this path after the Second World War, some ex-colonial countries in the rest of the world also made an effort to emulate the above example. In more recent years, a number of East Asian States embraced an explicitly technocratic approach to managing public affairs. For instance, Singapore achieved rapid economic and social progress within a short span of time largely due to the technocratic orientation of their leaders. China in recent years has followed suit and achieved rapid economic growth. There are also other examples in the region and elsewhere.
Sri Lankas post independence experience is mixed. Some of the policies adopted around the time of independence helped avoid rapid rural urban migration, promote agricultural development, achieve greater income equality and social justice, etc. introduction of free education in the early 1940s from kindergarten to university was a major step forward. Some of the steps taken as part of this initiative such as the emphasis placed on bilingualism and the establishment of a network of central schools throughout the country not only facilitated significant social mobility but also helped bridge the rural urban gap to a great extent. Yet, subsequent policy interventions, taken under the influence of vested interests and conservative forces not only reversed the early gains but led to disastrous consequences as well.
Social and economic issue
The almost total lack of any correspondence between rigorous policy analysis and decision making in the education sector over the last several decades has resulted in the mismanagement of public education leading to disastrous consequences. Space does not permit me to elaborate on this further but suffice is to say that many social and economic issues in the country today, in one way or another, are connected to the countrys public education system. The same is also true with respect to many other areas like transport, health and the economy.
As mentioned above, the failure to adopt evidence based policies is part of the problem of mismanagement of public affairs. What is equally important is how decisions are made to address rapidly evolving issues like youth agitations due to unemployment or a devastating disaster like a Tsunami. Well thought out decisions in such cases can help the country to turn a problem into an opportunity. Let me illustrate this with an example.
Graduate unemployment has been a problem at least since the late 1960s. During the last regime, over 100,000 graduates were absorbed into the state sector simply to defuse growing unrest among educated youth. The absorption was done in an extremely ad hoc fashion with no consideration given to the future prospects of these young people or how they could be effectively engaged to improve the functioning of various state institutions that they were absorbed into. This is despite numerous representations some of us made to the authorities to encourage them to adopt a rational approach to training and deployment of these graduates in selected areas of the public sector.
As is well known, the outreach services of many state institutions are virtually non-existent and many people suffer in silence as a result.
There are many social, economic and environmental issues across the country that can be addressed through regional and local level interventions. These graduates could have been classified according to their training, aptitudes and interests, given additional training and deployed with a clear mandate to carry out such interventions. This would have not only enriched their professional lives but also help improve the services of many State institutions, contributing to a significant improvement of the life chances of people at a community level.
Instead, today, we have a large group of frustrated government employees maintained at public expense and a large mass of hapless citizens who continue to suffer in silence for want of professional assistance. Some of them of course give up and commit suicide, ending up in police records as mere numbers.
In popular democracies, politicians in general cannot resist popular pressures. So, those who are entrusted with the responsibility of managing public affairs tend to respond to popular pressures rather than professional advice. In the run up to the parliamentary elections in 2015, many concerned professionals and academics got together to formulate a sound institutional and policy framework to be considered by the new government. But the leaders of the government decided to ignore such advice for reasons best known to them. As we can see today, the consequences have been disastrous.

Pakistan mark SL return with Twenty20 win
Lahore: Pakistan marked the return of Sri Lanka with a 3-0 Twenty20 series whitewash on Sunday, as officials hoped it will help reestablish the country's reputation for hosting international cricket.
The third and final Twenty20 match, which Pakistan comfortably won by 36 runs at Gaddafi stadium in Lahore, was Sri Lanka's first since their team bus was attacked near the same venue in March 2009. Those attacks, which left eight people dead and seven Sri Lanka players and their staff injured, suspended international cricket in Pakistan and forced them to play at neutral venues of United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The first two matches, which Pakistan won by seven and two wickets respectively, were played in Abu Dhabi before Sri Lanka flew to Lahore in a 24-hour fly in, fly out arrangement.
The match was the fourth international since the attack, with Zimbabwe playing a five-match limited over series in 2015 followed by the final of Pakistan Super League and a three-match Twenty20 series with World XI comprising of players from seven countries -- both this year.
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi dubbed the match "historic".
"This is historic because it marks the beginning of a new era of international cricket in Pakistan," said Sethi. "This sends a big signal to the rest of the cricketing nations that Pakistan is ready to host international cricket."
Sri Lanka Cricket President Thilanag Sumathipala vowed his board will not leave Pakistan in isolation.
"We are happy and privileged to be here to support Pakistan cricket," said Sumathipala. "It's a wonderful cricketing nation. Pakistan has done so much for world cricket and to sports in general so we cannot leave them in isolation."
However, a rampaging Pakistan side did not show any mercy to their opponents as they piled up 180-3 in their 20 overs.
Shoaib Malik, the only player from both the sides to have also featured in the fateful 2009 Lahore Test, smashed a 24-ball 51 with five boundaries and two sixes.
He added 75 for the third wicket with Babar Azam (34 not out) in just 45 balls. Openers Umar Amin (37-ball 45 with a six and three boundaries) and Fakhar Zaman (27-ball 31 with three fours) were the other contributors.
Pace bowler Mohammad Amir, playing his first international match before the home crowd after making his debut soon after the terrorists' attacks, finished with a career best 4-13 as Sri Lanka managed 144-9 in 20 overs. Only Dasun Shanaka batted with aggression during a 36-ball 54 with five boundaries and three sixes before he became one of Faheem Ashraf's two wickets.
This becomes Pakistan's second 3-0 whitewash in a Twenty20 series, having previously beaten the West Indies in UAE last year.
Thousands of fans filled Gaddafi Stadium under intense security, as the countries' respective national anthems were played before a capacity 23,000 crowd.
The city was adorned with pictures of the Sri Lankan cricketers as fans converged on the stadium hours before the start of the match.
Fans applauded both the teams before the start of the match and beat drums in an exhilarating atmosphere.
Sethi hoped Sri Lanka's return will be followed by a three-match Twenty20 series with the world champions, West Indies, next month, which is due to be finalised in the next few days. AFP

Parliamentary debate views will help formulate salutary constitution: Speaker
Parliamentarians views expressed during the three debates on the Steering Committee Report on constitutional reforms would help formulate a salutary constitution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He was addressing the media after participating in a religious function at the Salwana Buddhimalu Viharaya, Polgolla on October 28.
He said both sides have very knowledgeable parliamentarians and reaching a consensus through their ideas, views and criticisms would show true democracy.
He said the Government would never go against public opinion in framing a new constitution since the final decision is with the people.
The Speaker said the President and the Prime Minister had pledged to place the Steering Committee Report along with the decisions of the Parliamentary sittings as the Constitutional Assembly before the Mahanayaka Theras and the clergy of other religions before taking the next step.
The Speaker said that given this status, there was no need for anyone to create unnecessary problems in the country.
If anyone is engaged in spreading false rumours about the proposed constitution when it had not been even drafted, it would be a severe attack on democracy.
The Speaker said that when the final Constitution was drafted, he would never give his consent if it spelled any harm to the country, people or Buddhism or any other community or religion.
He said that in his capacity as Speaker, he remained independent despite verbal onslaughts and criticism by various quarters.

Pilgrimage to the worlds most famous manuscript
The Book of Kells has been reported stolen twice. The second occasion was in 1874. The account in the Birmingham Daily Post and Journal for November 5 is typical of a large number of similar stories in the press across Britain and Ireland that week: Trinity College, Dublin, is in despair. One of its chief treasures is missingviz., the Book of Kells, written by Saint COLUMBKIL in 475the oldest book in the world, and the most perfect specimen of Irish art, with the richest illuminations, and valued at 12,000 . . .  It was recounted that the loss was discovered when the Provost of Trinity College had wished to show the manuscript to some lady visitors, and he found that it had disappeared. No one could recall when it was last seen, and the librarian was absent and could not be consulted.
Heady days
Rumors and whispers flew around, as they can only in universities. The Birmingham Daily Post reveled in a further layer of mystery: A receipt for the volume signed by a Mr. BOND, purporting to be from the British Museum, has been placed in the hands of the Provost. Within a week the manuscript was located. The librarian of Trinity College, J. A. Malet, had himself taken it to the British Museum in London for advice on rebinding. The College sent its lawyer to London to demand its return, and the manuscript was hastened indignantly back to Ireland. Those were heady days for Irish nationalism. In 1874 the Home Rule League was founded. Gladstones Irish Government Bill was narrowly defeated in 1886. In 1888, the executive committee of the politically charged Irish Exhibition at Olympia in London requested inclusion of the Book of Kells. It is believed that a satisfactory arrangement may be come to in that respect, blandly reported the Dublin newspaper Freemans Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser on April 25th of that year. It was widely announced in London that the manuscript would be exhibited. This was reckoning without politics. The Board of Trinity College soundly refused: They do not consider it consistent with their duty to subject such a unique and invaluable national treasure to exposure in England.
The previous occasion when the Book of Kells was stolen was a little over 850 years earlier, in 1007. We have only one source for this incident and some of its details are ambiguous. The account is in the so-called Annals of Ulster, an ever-updated chronicle partly in Old Irish from the earliest times to the beginning of the 16th century. The original manuscript is also in Trinity College, Dublin. One entry in the narrative for the year 1007 has been loosely rendered something like this: The great Gospel of Colum Cille was sacrilegiously stolen in the night from the western sacristy of the church of Cennanas.
Human forms
It was the most precious object of the Western world, on account of its covers with human forms. This Gospel was recovered after two months and 20 nights, its gold having been taken off it and with a sod over tablemat.
Colum Cille is Saint Columba (it literally means Columba of the Church). Cennanas is the old name for the town of Kells, or Kenlis, in County Meath, about 40 miles north-west of Dublin.
The westerly storage place of the bookairdom iartharach in the originalmay mean the western end of the church or it may have been some kind of free-standing treasury to the west of the church. The stated reason for the theft was because of a highly ornamented binding or fitted case, for Irish Gospel Books were commonly enclosed in portable shrines. - Lit Hub

PPP distributes over 3 mn biodegrable bags
Over three million compostable and biodegradable food wrapping sheets and bags have been distributed to super centres and local markets by Sri Lankas pioneer food wrapping sheets and bags manufacturer, the Plastic Pakaging Pte Ltd (PPP), during the last three weeks.
This was highlighted by PPP Chairman Dr Mervyn Dias at a meeting held at the company premises in Ratmalana, to create the awareness of media about the companys participation at `Sri Lanka NEXT - A Blue Green Era conference and Exhibition held at BMICH under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Dr Dias said his company would reach the five million production target during the next few weeks.
He said during the Presidents visit to his stall at the BMICH, the President had a close look at the compostable and biodegradable bags that get composted within 180 days.
It is said that polythene takes over 500 years to degrade, causing heavy damage to living beings and also to fauna and flora.
The 30-year-old 100 per cent Sri Lankan owned Plastic Pakaging Ltd. has been manufacturing bags and food wrapping papers for the UK market and the company commenced manufacturing compostable and biodegradable bags in 2006.
Dr Dias said the company supplied compostable and biodegradable bags even to the Sri Lankan market before the ban was announced.
Now we have focused full attention towards the local market, he said.
He said the company markets the products under the trade name `Natureplus, certified by Vincotte, Belgium and they have also certificates such as OK Compost.
He said these compostable wrapping sheets and bags are manufactured according to this UK approved EN 13432 stand.
Dr Dias said that no exports could be done to any EU country without this certification.
The OK Ccompost certification guarantees composting in an industrial composting and the OK Compost HOME guarantees the green light to use the certified bags in a home compost bin to compost.
He also said the company manufactures 10 micron compostable bags and it can even be reduced to 8 microns. Although the thickness was reduced, the strength of these bags are maintained to the maximum.
Dr Dias further says the company is now able to supply compostable food sheets and bags to super markets, shops and also to customers.

President calls for a dynamic plan to increase agricultural exports

President Maithripala Sirisena pointed out the need of a dynamic plan to increase the agricultural exports, while endorsing quantitative and qualitative standards of the agricultural crops.

Former Sub Inspector of Police B.A.L. Indika Bamunusinghe, a prisoner under death sentence, sat for his Master's Degree first examination yesterday, at the Welikada Prison under the inspection of representatives from the University of Kelaniya and Prisons Commissioner T.N. Upuldeniya said.
Bamunusinghe received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Jayewardenapura last January and enrolled in a Masters Degree in Social Science at the University of Kelaniya.
"The Prisons Department will facilitate every prisoner who wants to improve his level of education while being flexible within the legal limitations," Upuldeniya said.
Speaking of Bamunusinghes achievement, Upuldeniya said it was exemplary for not only prisoners but also for everyone. This prisoner, achieved a degree while in the prison. This was a first. He was not allowed to participate in lectures. But we allowed him the access of lecture notes. There were several inmates who already had degrees when they came into prison. They helped Bamunusinghe very much. We should applaud him for having hope and thriving for goals despite the death sentence. Upuldeniya pointed out.
Commissioner Upuldeniya pointed out that the rehabilitation programme for prisoners was manifolds. It targets on prisoners education, spirituality, professional skills and religious attributes.
When it comes to education, we are dedicated to provide basic literacy to inmates. 80 percent of the inmates have not completed secondary education. To have inmates with a high level of education, complements our effort. Upuldeniya said.
Bamunusinghe was sentenced to death for the murder of Bambalapitiya businessman Mohamed Shiyam. He was found guilty of the murder along with four more persons, including former DIG Vass Gunawardena, who was charged with aiding, abetting and giving authority to commit the crime.

Pyramid Wilmar is looking at increasing its stake in the local sugar industry with a refinery in their facility in Muthurajawela and looking at a sugar cane plantation.
We are to invest around US$ 50 million for this operation in the next three years which would also help reduce Sri Lankas sugar import bill, save foreign exchange to the country. We are now awaiting government approval to commence operations and the plantations, said Head of Sales and Marketing, Pyramid Wilmar Hiranth Fernando subsequent to the MeadowLea launch held at Cinnamon Lakeside.
He also aid that Pyramid Wilmar will also increase their production of MeadowLea spread mainly to cater to their growing export demand to regional markets. We are not exporting MeadowLea in sufficiant volumes. We expect to increase local production. Here we will invest US $15 million to expand our production facilities in the Muthurajawela plant. This investment would be utilized in the next two years.
Wilmar International and Hong Kong investment company First Pacific acquired Goodman Fielder Australia in 2015, hence Goodman Fielder International become a subsidiary of Wilmar International. Capitalising on the opportunity, Pyramid Wilmar seeks to start local production of MeadowLea spread in two years and commenced R&D to enhance MeadowLea spread to meet the needs of the local market.

The real-life Up
The skies above South Africa are filled with weird and wonderful creatures, from giant vultures to miniature sunbirds.
But those looking to the sky on Monday saw something even more unusual... a mad Brit in a chair with party balloons tied to it.
Like a scene from the smash Pixar film Up, Tom Morgan, from Bristol based company The Adventurists, took to the skies near Johannesburg.
The daredevil flew 25km (15.5 miles) and reached heights of 8,000ft (2,438m) suspended from 100 helium balloons.
After a somewhat disastrous week trying to fly in Botswana, Tom tried his luck in South Africa.
And his concept of an air race based around flying in a chair with large party balloons tied to it (ranging from one to five foot wide, the kind of thing youd find hovering outside a cheap car showroom) became a reality.
Whilst Tom had to hurriedly pop the balloons to get back to terra firma, after reports of strong winds on their way got radioed through to him, hed experienced enough to know the worlds wackiest air race can become a genuine event next year.
It was a fairly indescribable feeling, wafting across Africa on a cheap camping chair dangling from a load of balloons, he said.
Sort of peaceful and terrifying in equal measure. I came here to see if we could organise the worlds most ridiculous air race and after that flight Im more convinced than ever that we can. Youd be forgiven for thinking a race with this level of risk is too far-fetched in todays over sanitized world.
But given Tom and The Adventurists are already behind some of the globes most extreme adventures, from the Mongol Derby, a 1,000km horse race across Mongolia to the Ice Run a motorbike ride across the globes largest frozen lake in Russia, dont bet against there being an international line up ready to risk everything in the skies above Africa in 2018. Weve done some pretty ridiculous things in the past, but this is up there with the best of them and we cant wait to get this up and running as a full on race next year.

## Title: Reforming the Police

Reforming the Police
The Police have come in for a lot of flak from all levels of society and it is generally accepted that the Police force should undergo a vital transformation. There have been many suggestions that the Government should seek foreign expertise in this regard. The Government seems to have taken cognizance of this view as Sri Lanka Police is to undergo extensive reforms next year under the guidance of top international Police consultant Sir Hugh Orde.
The Sri Lankan Government has sought the assistance of the British expert to introduce reforms on a wide range of areas, including intelligence, training, best practices, equipment, hardware and software, according to a report published in our sister newspaper The Sunday Observer yesterday.
The former President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in the United Kingdom, Sir Orde on a five-day official visit to Sri Lanka last week, met with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Law and Order, Sagala Ratnayaka and a number of parties committed to the reforms process.
Sir Orde is expected to submit a report on his initial observations to Minister Ratnayaka on his return to the United Kingdom.
Sir Orde is due to visit Sri Lanka three times next year.
According to him, a real action plan can only be expected following the third visit after a thorough study of the Police force is conducted.
Sir Orde is also expected to address issues such as gender discrimination, Police torture, eliminating corruption and depoliticizing the Force during the process, while presenting proposals to modernize it. As he points out, it is not a process that can be done overnight and time is needed.
He has emphasized the need for the public to give the Force a chance to prove that it means to transform itself, while the Police also will need to communicate to its staff and public about the reform process. In other words, it should be an open, transparent process.
With the end of the war, military intelligence has taken a backseat and the police had to rise to the challenge of gathering intelligence on organised crime, narcotics smuggling, transnational crime, illegal migration etc. There have been some successes in this sphere, but better intelligence could have enabled the Police to do much more to combat such crimes. Intelligence sharing with regional police forces must be improved to tackle transnational crime.
While there had been a 30 percent reduction in major crimes in recent years, much more has to be done. There had been an upswing in crime in the North as it has returned to normality, mainly because of the activities of factions of former armed groups. In fact, the Police have to address the problem of the wide circulation of illegal small arms island-wide. The Police anti-narcotics units must also be strengthened as there is a dangerous trend of increased narcotics offences.
Ensuring road discipline is part and parcel of the duty of Police, but sometimes there is a feeling that the Police are using the majority of its resources for this alone. If you travel along any of the major roads leading to Colombo on a weekday, you will see an alarmingly high number of policemen at every junction, every pedestrian crossing and sometimes even by the roadside. Worse, some traffic policemen turn the signal lights off and manually control the traffic. This is an unmitigated disaster every time. Traffic lights have been designed to ensure the maximum flow of traffic according to set times of the day. They never get hungry, angry, bored, distracted, tired or emotional. It is just not a task that a lone policeman can perform at a busy junction even for one hour. Police must not be allowed to turn the traffic lights off and direct traffic by hand at any time of the day, except in an emergency. Police must also give up the practice of hiding behind trees to nab errant motorists. Police must be out in the open, which is much more likely to drive fear into offending motorists.
Police, especially the traffic police, will have to shed the image of corruption. We hope that a portion from the higher fines imposed recently would go to the police personnel, as in the case of the Customs Department.
Modernizing the police force is essential. Some of the vehicles used by certain police stations are 20 to 30- years-old and are not suitable for pursuit of criminals. Police vehicles in many countries are now equipped with computers which can access criminal databases on the move. The same goes for facilities such as walkie talkies and communications equipment which have to be upgraded. The lock up facilities in many police stations are in a deplorable state and all suspects have to be treated fairly until they are produced in a court of law.
There are many aspects of reforming the Police service that Sir Orde, the National Police Commission, the Law and Order Ministry and other relevant agencies have to look into. A dynamic new police force is essential for our forward march.

Russia, SL begin efforts to end Ceylon Tea impasse
After a marathon three-day bilateral trade session in Colombo that ended on October 25, both Russia and Sri Lanka achieved a greater understanding on breaking the Ceylon Tea impasse that has been dogging their trade cooperation efforts lately.
"We warmly welcome the Russian delegation to Colombo, said Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Commerce D.N. R.Asoka.
The Secretary, leading the Sri Lankan side and representing Minister of industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, was addressing the final session of Second Session of Russia - Sri Lanka Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.
The Russian side was led by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Head of the Federal Agency for Fishery of the Russian Federation, I.V. Shestakov. Also joining the session were Commerce Department Director General Sonali Wijeratne, Materiy Yuriy Borisovich (Russian Federations Ambassador Designate to Sri Lanka) and Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Russian Federation Dr. Saman Weerasinghe.
The total trade between the two countries in 2016 was at US$ 363 million, a decline of 17% over 2015. During the first eight months of 2017 however, trade returned to the growth trend  increasing by 5.6% to US$ 247.2 million in comparison with the US$ 234 million in the same period in 2016.
While highlighting the long-established friendship and cooperation between the two nations, I am confident that this Commissions functioning would inject a strong impetus in further strengthening the mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between Sri Lanka and the Russian Federation," Ashoka said.
Russian Minister Shestakov thanked the Sri Lankan Co-Chair for the hospitality extended to them. This is an important event in Russia-Sri Lanka bilateral trade cooperation he said. We are willing to implement the decisions adopted by this Commission in a consistent manner.
Sri Lankan side continuously pressed for the reduction of import duty by Moscow on its Ceylon Tea exports. Sri Lankas complaint was that the duties were based on gross weight of value added teas - that includes packaging material such as ceramic and wooden tea containers - rather than only the weight of net teas.
The Russian side stated that currently, in accordance with the Customs Code of the Customs Union, the basis for calculation of Customs duties (subject to type of goods and applicable duties) is Customs value of goods and or its physical characteristics in physical terms (quantity, mass with original packaging which is inseparable from the goods and in which the goods are due for retail, volume of goods or other characteristics).
More importantly, the Russian side said that it would take part in this regard within the limits of its competence in working out this issue with all the member states of Eurasian Economic Union.
At present, Ceylon Tea is the leading Lankan export to Russia, and last year tea claimed 78% (at US$ 143 million) of Sri Lankas total exports (US$ 182 million) to Russia. Other key Lankan exports to Russia last year were apparel, textile fibres, apparel accessories, and activated carbon.
Both sides also noted that the value of their bilateral trade had not reached the desired level over the recent years and called for ways to enhance efforts to improve trade through efficient exploitation of the hitherto untapped potentials.

SAITM medical faculty abolished
The Presidential Committee appointed to resolve issues related to the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has recommended abolishing the SAITM Medical Faculty and establishing a not-for-profit Institute under the supervision of the Higher Education Ministry for its operations and management.
The Government Information Department in a press statement yesterday, made known to the public the eight-point recommendations of the Committee headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva on SAITM.
Dr. Neville Fernando
The Committees proposals are aimed at a permanent solution to the long-drawn issue of the SAITM and its medical degree. The Committee, which consulted all stakeholder groups including the Deans of Medical Faculties of all State Universities, submitted the report to the President in September.
With the abolition of SAITM, the profit oriented entity owned and managed by Dr. Neville Fernando and family will cease to exist.
Abolishing SAITM shall be done in a manner legally acceptable to the current shareholders, lending institutions and the new entity interested in, the Committee has proposed.
The Committee has specifically stated that the current shareholders of SAITM shall not participate in the ownership or management of the new entity.
The cooperation of Dr. Neville Fernando and family is extremely important in this regard, the statement stressed.
It requested all parties to cooperate to ensure the implementation of the proposed solutions and provide an opportunity to students to return for education.
According to the proposals, the assets, liabilities, staff and students of SAITM shall be transferred to a non-state, not-for-profit making degree awarding entity that will comply with the minimum standards on Medical Education and Training. The new entity to be legislated will utilize any excess income over expenditure of the organization for development or research or scholarships, without distributing among shareholders.
The Government has consulted several already established non-state, not-for-profit entities with the objective of establishing the proposed not-for-profit entity for this purpose. Detailed discussions in this regard with interested parties shall start very soon, the statement added.
The new entity shall recognise all students currently enrolled at SAITM, who possess the required entry qualifications. Opportunity will be afforded to these students to continue medical education in the proposed new institution, it added.
Issues in respect of former students who have completed their degree course at SAITM should be addressed on the advice of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, based on the determination of the Supreme Court case filed on the same. Arrangements shall be made for the said students who have completed the degree at SAITM to undergo clinical training at recommended government hospitals the Committee proposed.
However, the suspension on admission of medical students to SAITM by the letter issued by the Higher Education Ministry Secretary on September 15 will continue. All new admissions shall be made to the new entity, which will comply with the minimum standards on Medical Education and training.
The Health Ministry will gazette and place before Parliament the agreed minimum standards for Medical Education and training based on the Draft submitted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). This task must be mandatorily completed within one month from today, the Committee stated.
The Government is to immediately appoint a Committee of high level officials to coordinate the implementation of the above measures.
This entire process shall be mandatorily completed by December 31, 2017, the Committee recommended.

The statement also said that SAITM founder Dr. Neville Fernando would continue to produce quality non-state doctors despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests.
The full statement is reproduced below:
The Management of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would like to inform the general public of Sri Lanka and reiterate their legitimacy following the media statements that are currently circulated through the Department of Government Information.
SAITM was established as a Degree Awarding Institute in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).
SAITM was established with the aim of providing quality private medical education in the country to augment the requirement of quality doctors to serve the people of the nation.
Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM. Therefore, these proposals need to be discussed at length with all stakeholders to ensure that justice to concerned parties are met.
Going forward, we hope that SAITM graduates will be given provisional registration, subject to court proceedings and the current students education will continue without any disruption to their studies.
We also note positively, the vision of SAITM's founder Dr. Neville Fernando's to produce quality non-state doctors will continue despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests.

SAMANALAYO AT 50
St. Aloysius Seminary, in Borella was the place where Raymond Fonseka, Nihal Silva, Roy Fonseka and Patrick Corera were studying to become priests. For various personal reasons they all left the seminary in the early 1960s. Patrick Corera inherited from his parents, Gowri Corporation, which held, among a variety of other businesses, a franchise for Philips Records. Patrick was toying with the idea of producing phonographic records. So he contacted his ex-seminarian friend Raymond Fonseka and they thought it was a good idea to record four songs (in Sinhala) onto an EP vinyl record. Raymond got the ball rolling. He contacted Nihal Silva and Roy Fonseka, his cousin. They all met at Patricks house in Borella and started putting together four songs. Raymond came up with a song called Paddhie Me Oruwe complete with lyrics and melody. Silva had a couple of melodies in his mind to which Raymond, the expert lyricist, wrote some words and Bingo! the four songs were ready for recording. Nihal Silva, at that time was a well established guitarist playing for the Patrick Denipitiya Combo, which had a long contract with Rohitha Jayasinghe, owner of Seac Entertainments that provided live music for all the Lottery Draws held every Thursday.
Mega hit
Silva talked to Patrick Denipitiya about the new group and their songs and asked him if he could provide the music for the recording. Patrick gladly obliged. They started rehearsing the songs at Patrick Coreras place. Then they were looking for a studio to record the songs. Patrick Denipitiya was working at Lake House Bookshop. Close to this book shop was a recording studio, The Lewis Brown Recording studio.
Tony Fernando was the owner of this studio. Patrick Denipitiya and Tony Fernando were good friends. Fernando agreed to record the new songs in his studio. Patrick Denipitiya hired top notch musicians from the Radio Ceylon Orchestra for this recording. T. F. Lateef (Clarinet player) A. J. Kareem (Clarinet player) M. W. Peiris (Flutist).Other musicians were from Patrick Denipitiyas band. Neville De Silva ( Drums ) Hector Fernando (Electric Bass) Nihal Silva (Acoustic and Electric Rythm guitar) Patrick Denipitiya (Hawaiian Electric guitar).From 1969 to 1972 Nihal Silva was a member of the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation as a guitarist.
After the recording was done, the master tape was sent to Singapore for pressing the vinyl records because there were no facilities in Ceylon those days for pressing records. This happened in May of 1967.At the end of September 1967, Patrick Corera received the first Sample disc of the recording. There was no writing on the blue label except the word  Philips in Bold letters. Patrick Corera called Fonseka and handed him the disc. Fonseka called Silva and together they took the sample to Radio Ceylon to give it to be broadcast.
As they were sitting in the lobby of Radio Ceylon, a yellow coloured Butterfly fluttered into the lobby. Silva said to Fonseka, The name for our Group just flew in! Fonseka took out his ball point pen and wrote in big Bold letters,  SAMANALAYO  The record was played that same night on the programme called  Radio Journal by Jimmy Barucha in the English beam, the very first Sinhala Song to be played in the English Beam. The song was NELAWENA MAVU UKULE. This song went on to become a mega hit. It was even recorded by the Jetliners and many other popular singers. The song Netum Guruwarie which Fonseka wrote for his then girl-friend (Now his wife) was also fairly popular. Nelawena Mavu Ukule apparently has been selected as one of the best 100 songs of the century. The Samanalayo went on to record a total of 13 songs. One more with Patrick Corera, one with Sooriya Records owner Gerald Wickramasooriya and
the last one with RAC Records, owner, Music Director R.A.Chandrasena. Even though the other songs did not do that well, the Samanalayo were always busy working with Rohitha Jayasinghe and the Ceylon Tobacco Company. In 1970,when there was a vacancy for a keyboard player in the Seac Band, Silva asked Rohitha Jayasinghe to hire Fonseka for the post. In 1972 Silva left Ceylon to settle down in Canada.
With Silva gone, the Samanalayo sort of dwindled down but the song Nelawena Mavu Ukule never faded. In Toronto, Ontario-Canada Silva played guitar for a German Band named  The Continentals  another Toronto based band called the  Singalongs  and a Portuguese band known as  The Midnight Stars  Silva also joined the Toronto Musicians Union and at present he is a member of the Songwriters Association of Canada since 2002.
A new album
Raymond Fonseka continued as keyboard player and vocalist with Seac band for 12 years. In 1983 he joined the band named Seranade led by the late Mike Gunasekera and toured Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and Leichenstein. He gained valuble experience in the field of Western music until the year 1985.He returned to Sri Lanka and started a one man band playing almost every night at the tourist resorts down south until the devastating Tsunami in 2004.Raymond Fonseka and Roy Fonseka continued to sing as Samanalayo every now and then In 2012, Roy Fonseka passed away leaving Raymond Fonseka as the sole member of Samanalayo in Sri Lanka.
When Nihal Silva left for Canada, his spot was occasionally filled by the versatile singer, Cecil Fernando appearing as one of the Samanalayo with Raymond Fonseka and Roy Fonseka, mostly for Seac Shows.
Fernando had made quite a name for himself by singing at places like The Coconut Grove, Kandy Lake Club, Hill Club, Akase Kade and many other interesting musical shows. That famous song called Revula- Vavennay, Revula Kapannay  was actually recorded onto an EP by Cecil Fernando in the mid 70s. Famous Hawaiian Guitarist Hemasiri De Silva who was the lead guitarist for the Seac Band, directed the music for this album with the assistance of Lal Thenabadu. This was recorded at the Gypsies Recording Studio and this recording was Dayananda Pereras first attempt as Sound Engineer! He was a great success!
Fernandoalso enjoyed the privilege of singing a Duet with the late Great Rukmani Devi only seven months prior to her most unfortunate death. Now, in 2017 things have taken a different turn. Cecil Fernando, the latest addition to the Samanalayo, who came to Canada in 1985, decided to produce a new album of the Samanalayo to celebrate their 50th anniversary. Fernando, who went to Sri Lanka in December 2016 for a holiday, met Raymond Fonseka. After serious talks, he invited Fonseka to come to Canada. On July 23 Fonseka came to Toronto with his wife. Fonseka also brought music tracks recorded in a fine recording studio in Sri lanka. The music tracks are for the eight songs that will go on the New Samanalayo 50th Anniversary Album. Out of the eight songs two are in English, one titled Niagara, the other titled Toronto ( Lyrics and melodies of both songs by Nihal Silva ) One brand new song by Raymond Fonseka titled Olu-Nelum-Manel. Two more new songs by Nihal Silva-Suduveli Paara Digay and Landesi-Vendesi. Three oldies, Tea-Rubber-Pol, Kandugeta Pasukara and of course their best song so far, Nelawena Mavu Ukule.
Magnificent job
The vocals were recorded in one of the Best recording studios in Canada ( Fifth best in North America) named Metalworks Studios, Mississauga, Ontario Canada, where Super Stars like Celine Dion, Drake, Justin Beeber, Christina Aguilera, Tina Turner, David Bowie etc. etc. have recorded their songs. The voice recording was handled by recording engineer Devon Brooks assisted by Angelo Angelicoes.
The final Mastering engineer was Chris Crerar. Some ideas for the songs have emanated from the imaginative and creative mind of Cecil Fernando. Incidentally Tony Fernando, husband of Mignonne Fernando is the first cousin of Dinalee Fernando who is the wife of Cecil Fernando. What a small world !!
The music tracks for the entire album were supervised by Raymond with assistance from the versatile musicians Mahinda Bandara and Vajira Ratnayake. The entire band of musicians gave their very best for the project. Sandaruwan from Studio Sage, the quiet engineer did a magnificent job handling the sound tracks. The production of this new venture is by Cecil Fernando to whom the New Look Samanalayo owes so much gratitude. The support extended to the Samanalayo by Chitral de Silva, Thilak Perera and
Rolinson Ferdinando is greatly appreciated. Special thanks go to the Wives of the New Samanalayo, Charmaine Fonseka, Pathma Silva and Dinalee Fernando for their opinions, patience, encouragement, understanding and care. Well worth mentioning with thanks is Ajith Lokuge.
The Samanalayo are truly grateful to Shanthi and Sanjeeva for featuring them in the TV programme  Kala Kavaya , Weera Fonseka, Sampath Peththawadu and Dinesh Peiris for featuring them in Rupane  programme and Vasanta Lankatillake for his invaluble support. The proprietor and editor of The Lanka Reporter, Sirimal Abeywardena also has been an immense supporter of The Samanalayo all along!!.

Saudi Arabia to allow women into sports stadiums

Saudi Arabia will allow women to attend sports events in stadiums for the first time from next year, officials say.
Families will be able to enter the stadiums in three major cities - Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam.
It is another move towards giving more freedom to Saudi women, who face strict gender segregation rules, and follows the historic lifting of a driving ban.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is leading a major drive to modernise Saudi society and boost the economy.
Saudi Arabia's sports authority said that preparations would start in the three stadiums so they can be "ready to accommodate families from early 2018".
Restaurants, cafes and monitor screens would be set up inside the stadiums as part of the changes, it added.
Up until now, the venues have been men-only areas.
Understanding the changes
The reforms are in line with a wide-ranging plan announced by 32-year-old Prince Mohammed to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom, known as Vision 2030.
Last month, a royal decree said that women would be allowed to drive for the first time from next June.
Concerts are once again being held and cinemas are expected to return soon.
On Wednesday, Prince Mohammed said that the return of a "moderate Islam" was key to his plans to modernise the country.
He said that 70% of the Saudi population was under 30 and that they wanted a "life in which our religion translates to tolerance".
But analysts warn that the plan is not without risks.
The kingdom faced a backlash from conservatives on social media after allowing women to participate in National Day celebrations in Riyadh's King Fahd Stadium for the first time last month.
Despite the recent announcements, women still face severe restrictions in the country, which enforces a strict form of Sunni Islam known as Wahhabism. Women have to adhere to strict dress codes and must not associate with unrelated men.
If they want to travel, work or access healthcare they must be accompanied by - or receive written permission from - a male guardian.

Seylan Bank posts PAT of Rs 3 bn
Seylan Bank closed the 9 months ending September 30, 2017 with a post-tax profit of Rs 3,002 million, a moderate growth of 6% over the corresponding period last year.
These results were impacted by provisions made on account of a legacy NPA, payment of which is due from the Compensation Tribunal.
Growth in advances coupled with the rise in interest rates enabled interest income to grow by 35% and interest expenses increased by 48% due to funds moving into higher yielding fixed deposits. Further impact on interest cost was partly cushioned by CASA base over Rs. 90 billion. As a result Net interest income recorded a commendable growth of 17.2 % to reach Rs. 11,376 million.
Net fees and commission income recorded an impressive growth of 25% for the period under review driven by core banking related transactional fees and net trading income recorded a gain (compared to mark to market losses in the prior period) due to favourable movements in the yields of the underlying Government Securities.
Total expenses increased by 14.8% from Rs. 7,146 million to Rs. 8,200 million and were fuelled by new investments in technology and human capital developments. Cost management initiatives coupled with the implementation of lean concepts across the Bank has aided in rationalising key cost lines.
The Bank reported a credit growth of 8.3 % increasing the advances from Rs. 236 billion to Rs. 255 billion while the deposit base grew from Rs. 273 billion to Rs. 295 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Bank CASA ratio stood over 30 %.

Shinzo Abes win to shape Asias future
INDIA: Just a few months back, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abes political future was looking uncertain as his unpopularity rose and corruption scandals took the sheen off his governance agenda. And now he has bounced back, and how.
Abes ruling coalition has won a clear majority with more than two-thirds of Parliaments 465 seats, with the Liberal Democratic Party holding a majority even without its coalition partner. Abes gamble of calling snap elections earlier this month has paid off, which was underlined by him in his post-victory comments: We were able to earn the powerful support of the Japanese people, well surpassing our goal.
Flush from his win, Abe went straight to business by focusing on his priority: My immediate task is to deal with North Korea. It will take tough diplomacy. With the mandate given by the people, I would like to exercise my command in diplomacy. Even during the congratulatory call from US President Donald Trump, Abes focus was on the need of being united to increase pressure on North Korea.
Along with a focus on the North Korean threat, a victory for Abe means a continuation of his earlier policies, which include strengthening the alliance with the US, a more robust defence and foreign policy vis--vis China, as well as a
super-loose monetary policy. With a so-called supermajority in both houses, Abe can now move forward on pushing for a revision to Japans war-renouncing constitution, a long-cherished goal of his and his nationalistic supporters. While Article 9 technically bans the maintenance of armed forces by saying that land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential will never be maintained, it has been interpreted by successive Japanese governments to allow the nations Self-Defence Forces for exclusively defensive purposes. As Chinese regional ambitions rise and uncertainty over Americas willingness to continue contributing to regional security continues, Article 9 is viewed by some as something of an anachronism. Abe had set a deadline of 2020 to revise Japans constitution though this remains a highly divisive issue.
Abe will be welcoming Trump during the latters first trip to Asia early next month at a time when China under Xi Jinping is convinced of the inevitability of its emergence as a global superpower. And the Trump administrations chaotic foreign policy is causing consternation about the future of its commitments to Asia. Abe has invested a lot in reaching out to Trump but he has also developed other regional partnerships.
An assertive Japan will be welcomed by India. Of all of Tokyos neighbours, India is perhaps the most comfortable with Japans rise. The two nations already share a close relationship across various sectorseconomic, defence, nuclearand even personal chemistry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi shares a close personal rapport with Abe that has only grown over the last three years. And the Indo-Japanese partnership is key to maintaining a stable balance of power in the wider Indo-Pacific. Abe always had a special place for India in his vision of the emerging order in the Asia-Pacific. Much before anyone else, he could foresee the need to view the Indian and Pacific oceans as a cohesive unit. In Modi he has found a kindred spirit. Both have a vision for the region in which the Indo-Japanese relationship plays a central stabilizing role.
India and Japan are keen on building a broader coalition of like-minded countries with the US and Australia to manage unfolding strategic realities in the broader Indo-Pacific. Abe had articulated a need for such a security architecture way back in 2012 when he had suggested a strategy whereby Australia, India, Japan, and the US state of Hawaii form a diamond to safeguard the maritime commons stretching from the Indian Ocean region to the western Pacific. Chinas aggressiveness has only made this idea more tangible.
India and Japan complement each other economically and this has allowed the two to leverage each others strengths.
While Japanese investment in India continues to grow and Indias need for Japanese technology in the infrastructure sector keeps on expanding, India has also decided to send 300,000 youth to Japan for on-job training for three-five years as part of the governments skill development programme. India is the largest recipient of Japanese foreign aid. Japanese investment in India is booming, with the Japanese making record investment in private equity and venture capital in India. Japan made an exception to its rule of not conducting nuclear commerce with any state that is not a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The two nations are working on an ambitious programme, the Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), which will find place in the Abe-Modi summit. With a Japanese commitment of $30 billion and an Indian commitment of $10 billion, the project is aimed at building capacity and human resource development in Africa as well as developing infrastructure and institutional regional connectivity.
As Abe begins to work on his ambitious agenda for Japan, he will find in India a reliable friend. And as Modi works to project India as a leading global power, he will find in Japan an important and powerful interlocutor at a time of unprecedented change in the larger Asian landscape. Delhi and Tokyo will need to continue to nurture this very important bilateral partnership but Abes victory augurs well for the relationship. - PTI

SLITHM takes hospitality training to Jaffna
In a strategic move to counter the shortage of trained hospitality industry personnel, the state run Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management has opened a new training facility in the in Jaffna recently.
The new facility aims to train youth in the former war ravaged region to take up lucrative jobs in the rapidly growing hospitality industry. Dozens of new hotels have opened up in the northern region in the recent past and many more are under construction at present. However the hotel industry in the region has been faced with a dilemma due to the acute shortage of trained personnel to operate these hotels at an acceptable standard.
It is a well-known fact that unemployment is high in the north. At the same time hotels are finding it difficult to recruit qualified people to work in their hotels. This is a situation that requires urgent attention, observed Minister of Tourism Development, John Amaratunga who mooted the idea of setting up a SLITHM training facility in Jaffna.
The youth in the area do not favour travelling to the south to obtain training. This is understandable. Given this scenario the best thing we could do to address this issue is to reach out to them, explained Minister Amaratunga.
In the recent past SLITHM has identified demand for human resources especially in popular and upcoming tourist destinations and established training facilities at these locations.
In line with this policy new training schools have been established in Hambantota, Passikudah, Negombo and Polonnaruwa in the recent past and now in Jaffna.
The opening of the SLITHM training facility in Jaffna is consistent with our policy of setting up hotel schools in popular tourism destinations. This is a concept of the Hon. Minister of Tourism who, given the current shortage of trained hospitality personnel, believes that it is better for us to go where there is demand rather than expecting the youth to come to us. This policy has worked for us and SLITHM is proud to say that our combined annual student output will double from 3000 to 6000 from this year, said Chairman, SLITHM, Mr. Sunil Dissanayake.
SLITHM Jaffna which is located at No: 88, 3rd Cross Street has already commenced academic operations with a Hospitality Apprenticeship Course aimed atattracting unemployed youth to the tourism industry. SLITHM has join hands with World University Service Canada to conduct these classes.
Already 50 students including 10 females have enrolled for courses in Jaffna. On completion of the training programme these individuals can look forward to a rewarding career in the hospitality industry. The courses offered at the facility will lay the foundation for these youth to become gainfully employed and go on to become future managers in the hospitality industry.
The present temporary facility will make way for a fully-fledged hotel school that is to open in January 2018. It will conduct courses in hotel front office, food and beverage, professional cookery, hotel housekeeping, pastry and bakery, National Tourist Guide courses and language courses.
We have succeeded in fulfilling a long felt need and social obligation. It is our hope that the youth in Jaffna will make full use of this training facility and contribute to the growth of the industry in this region, noted Director General, SLITHM Buddika Hewawasam.

India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam took part in the summit as its permanent members and Papua New Guinea and the Philippines participate as associate members.
Export Agriculture Director General Dr. M.A.P.K. Seneviratne told the Daily News that in addition to those countries, around 40 countries will participate in the four-day summit.
The summit was organized under the patronage of Primary Industry Development Minister Daya Gamage.
A pepper crops exhibition and a pepper clinic will take place during the summit. Sri Lanka boasts the best pepper varieties in the world with oil percentage at 4 percent.
Inclement climate in the last two years affected the local pepper production and the exporting volume dropped significantly.
Sri Lanka exported 16,656 MT of pepper in 2015 but the amount dropped in 2016 to 7,870 MT.
The country earned 19,552 million from pepper export in 2015 but last it was only Rs. 10,531 million, Dr. Seneviratne said.

Take your life back!
In the past 25 years, suicide has emerged as an important public health problem in many countries. The World Health Organisation estimates that each year approximately one million people die from suicide, which represents a global mortality rate of 16 people per 100,000.
Going by the statistics of Sri Lanka Police, 3,025 people died by suicide in 2016. It is about 14 people per 100,000 population. In 1995, we experienced 8,449 reported suicides and although it has now decreased considerably, the figure is still alarming when compared with other countries. Sri Lanka Police statistics also reveal that 27 per cent of the total suicides are of young people aged 17 - 30 years.
A recent report detailing the mental health of adolescents in Sri Lanka, the World Health Organisation South-East Asia Region has revealed that seven percent of adolescents aged between 13 and 17 have attempted suicide one or more times. The report also shows that nine percent of young people have considered committing suicide.
It is clear that Sri Lanka still has a crisis of suicidal behaviour among its young people. Doing something about this situation is the responsibility of every part of Sri Lankan society, be it private or public.
In every case we are aware of where rates of death by suicide have been lowered, assertive and sustained government actions have played a critical role. It means that the government, too, has an important role to play as well  as do Provincial Councils and other public representative bodies to reach the desired goal.
Mental health problems
Research findings suggest that a range of social, personality, childhood and related factors make contributions to risks of suicidal behaviour. However, by far the largest contribution comes from mental health problems. Recently the WHO disclosed that 800,000 Sri Lankans, mostly young people, suffer from depression.
These findings imply that any pragmatic suicide prevention strategy must involve approaches that aim to improve the detection, treatment, management and prevention of these disorders in the population.
Research findings also suggest that an important step in reducing the number of young people who are vulnerable to suicidal behaviours is through programmes that reduce their exposure to disadvantaged environments that lead to the risk of later suicide attempt.
There are a number of strategies by which this target might be achieved, including population-based programmes designed to reduce social inequity and social discrimination. Although they are long-term projects, such programmes may make an effective contribution to suicide prevention by providing an equitable social environment in which other, more targeted, approaches to suicide prevention would have their best chance of success.
Three more approaches are also available: first one, focuses on the development of general mental health programmes, which aim to foster good mental health skills particularly among young people to promote resiliency and address the psycho-social needs of those exposed to stress and adversity; second one lies in school-based competency-promoting and stress-reducing programmes to reduce the risks of mental disorders and behaviours with which suicidal behaviour is associated; and the third one is the provision of family support and early intervention programmes targeting at-risk families and designed to improve early-childhood exposure to family disadvantage.
Risk factors
According to American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, in addition to depression, there are other risk factors for youth suicide which include: (1) social isolation and loneliness, (2) intense loss and grief feelings caused by the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship, (3) sever family ties, work, financial, legal or social problems, (4) alcohol or other substance abuse, (5) Severe chronic stress, (6) victims of domestic violence, (7) Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, (8) low self-esteem, (9) difficulties dealing with life changes, (9) serious illness, (10) intense embarrassment or humiliation before family, friends, colleagues.
As we can see from the list, it isnt just young people with mental illness who commit suicide.
One of the areas often overlooked because we are so focused on the risk factors is youth suicide-seekers motivation. His major motivation is to avoid or end pain. But there are others such as (1) gain attention, (2) perceive as a martyr for a cause, (3) avenge a perceived wrong, (4) express grief over a relationship, (5) escape an intolerable situation, (6) respond to an internal impulse (like hearing voices telling you to kill yourself), and (7) avoid humiliation.
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry advises the parents and elders to be watchful for the warning signs that a young person may be considering suicide: (1) change in eating and sleeping habits, (2) withdrawal from friends, family, and regular activities, (3) violent or rebellious behaviour, (4) drug and alcohol use, (5) unusual neglect of personal appearance, (6) persistent boredom, difficulty concentrating, or a decline in the quality of work, (7) frequent complaints about physical symptoms, often related to emotions, such as stomach-aches, headaches, fatigue, etc. If one or more are persisting, it is time seek help.
A suicidal youth may not ask for help, but that doesnt mean that help isnt wanted. Most young people who commit suicide do not want to die - they just want to stop hurting. Youth suicide prevention starts with recognizing the warning signs and taking them seriously.
Prevention
There are a number of prevention measures, which can be helpful for reducing the rate of suicides of young people. The responsibility of implementing them lie among parents, schools and the Government authorities.
Responsibilities of parents
Parents should promote mental resilience and connectedness of their children. Also, they should educate the children about suicide, including risk factors, warning signs, and the availability of help. Parents would not be aware how to do it and its the Governments responsibility to offer training.
Parents also should strengthen the family as a strong with high emotional bonding and support and under no circumstances, compel the children to fulfil your own dreams.
Most importantly, parents should give attention towards changing behaviour of their children and provide help and support to handle the difficulties of life especially emotional ups and downs.
Responsibilities of school
School authorities should implement intervention programmes - emotional education in schoolchildren. Also, teachers need to be guided to be vigilant in detecting depression among children.
Government responsibilities
The Government has a fair amount of responsibilities. They must increase the proficiency of health and welfare services in responding to youth in need. This includes better training for health professionals and establishing crisis counselling units in every city. They must promote comprehensive community care services to provide services to youth stricken with mental illness.
Continuous professional training of selected teacher groups in each electorate about assessment, diagnosis and treatment support of high-risk groups detection. At the same time, provision of special short training course is needed for gatekeepers like parents, teachers, counsellors and other professional helpers who must provide emotional support to meet the needs of different age groups.
Another important matter is the formulation of responsible media policy for suicide prevention. Finally, the Government should create enhanced access to mental health services (such as hot/on line services).
Education
Specialised health professionals are presently playing an effective role in preventing, managing or rehabilitating young persons with suicidal tendencies and those who have committed a suicidal act. More support needs to be given to them, in the form of funds, facilities, personnel and appreciation.
Yet, in the long run, our structured education system needs to put in more emphasis in building value systems and coping strategies in its curriculum of studies. The objective is to set acceptable individual aspirations and indicating appropriate goal-setting mechanism among students. These are of prime importance for preventing the younger age group from attempting suicide.

Thor: Ragnarok review  humour lightens another load of Marvel [Video]

The thing that most annoys me about comic book superhero movies, apart from the inevitable baffling third-act onslaught of special effects, is that they are so intent on hitting the required beats of the formula that there is very little space left to squeeze in a sense of a distinctive directorial voice.
In this at least,Thor: Ragnarokis a departure. New Zealand director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows;Hunt for the Wilderpeople) takes the helm of the latest instalment of the adventures of Marvels meathead minor deity.
And while Waititi is not credited as a writer, you do get a tangible sense of his input, not just in the humour of the film  its the funniestMarvelso far by no small margin  but in the nature of that humour.
In common with Waititis vampire mockumentaryWhat We Do in the Shadows, the film finds absurd comedy by juxtaposing the extraordinary with deliciously prosaic details.
A badass warrior made of lumps of granite (and voiced by Waititi himself) bemoans a rebellion that failed because of a lack of pamphlets.
A formidable flesh-liquefying weapon wielded by Grandmaster, Jeff Goldblums despot/game-show host, is referred to, with deadpan banality, as the melt stick.
The film also manages a distinctive look  the dual backdrops of Thors threatened home planet, Asgard, and Sakaar, the junk-strewn setting for Grandmasters gladiatorial battles, are strikingly realised.
But perhaps the most fun comes from the prickly fraternal jostling between Chris Hemsworths lovable lunk Thor and his trickster stepbrother Loki (an enjoyably malicious Tom Hiddleston).

USAID supports Interfaith Forum to strengthen humanitarian response
From October 16-19, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) strengthened partnerships between organizations and local humanitarian response by co-hosting more than 140 participants from 36 countries in Colombo for the Forum on Localizing Response to Humanitarian Need and the Role of Religious and Faith-based Organizations.
The Forum was held from October 16-19, representing local and global faith networks, faith-based and secular organizations, aid agencies, policy makers, and governments, participants discussed how going local through community and faith-based actors and networks can improve aid to communities experiencing natural and man-made disasters.
Speaking at the event, USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives, Dr. Andrew Sisson, noted USAID Sri Lanka's long history of working directly with local organizations, both faith-based and secular. By engaging local communities we gain a deeper understanding of peoples perceptions and needs, of their context, and as a result there is a higher likelihood of finding effective and sustainable solutions.
A few years ago, localization became a key pillar of USAIDs sweeping reform agenda, whereby we work to increase the effectiveness of our development programs by finding local solutions and partnerships whenever possible, he further stated.
The three-day event addressed challenges, shared best practices, and offered evidence-based recommendations to improve humanitarian aid. Topics included conflict and peace-making, disaster response, refugees and forced migration, disaster risk reduction and resilience, gender-based violence, and children and health. The participants highlighted the significance of womens involvement across faith networks in all aspects of humanitarian work.
At the end of the Forum, participants took home a unified Call to Action that specified key actions at global, national, and local levels. It also identified entry points for other humanitarian actors and partners to engage in the work of local faith actors. One recommendation was to develop more opportunities to share models and best practices, capture validated experiences, and advocate with governments. Another was the need to financially support local organizations, including local faith communities, so that they can be on the front lines of humanitarian response, and to bring diverse communities together in disaster-preparedness.
This forum, co-sponsored by USAID, was organized by the local host committee chaired by the Venerable Banagala Upatissa Thera, Chairman of the Mahabodhi Society, and Reverend Ebenezer Joseph, leader of the National Christian Council, with representation of every Sri Lankan faith and the international Partnership for Faith and Development planning committee.

Even the leather coating process was painted in 24 carat gold paint. They are decorated with Arabian Jasmin flowers made from leather and encrusted with diamonds.
Then a rose gold accent was added to the shoes to give it a slight contrast. The soles and heels are in clients favourite colours but are said to give the footwear a more contemporary fusion. And last but not least the insides of the shoes are adorned with a real gold thread embellished inlay. A spokeswoman for Wingham explained the shoes were commissioned by a family who wanted a unique piece of diamond art for a loved ones birthday gift.
The design was a collaboration with Florida-based contemporary artist Chris Campbell. Wingham cam up with the ideas but Campbell made the shoe as he is the shoe artist and renowned for his attention to detail.
Debbie is designer of the Red Diamond Abaya dress which is still the worlds most expensive garment to date.
It was valued at a staggering 11.7 million.
She also holds the record for making the worlds most expensive cake, valued at $50 million dollar for a coming of age party.
She has a baking business called Couture to Cakes which currently has over a six months waiting list. Wingham said she is using the shoes as her swan song to the worlds most expensive creations. She will concentrate on her academy, The Future of Fashion, helping emerging talent. Mirror

Wozniacki ends Williams jinx to win WTA Finals
Singapore: Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki ended her career-long jinx against Venus Williams in spectacular style to lift the WTA Finals trophy for the first time on Sunday.
The Dane had won just one set from seven harrowing defeats to Williams but she turned the tables with a 6-4, 6-4 victory in 89 minutes at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.
Wozniacki had some nervy moments after 37-year-old Williams, the tournament's oldest ever finalist, clawed her way back from 0-5 down in the second set.
But she kept her cool to seal victory with a backhand down the line, throwing her racquet into the air and holding her hands to her face in disbelief.
"I am so happy I managed to win in the end," Wozniacki said. "Eight is my lucky number. If I was going to beat her (Williams) once in my career, it had to be today.
"It is really sweet, I couldn't be happier right now."
Wozniacki has been in brilliant, aggressive form in Singapore, beating Elina Svitolina and Simona Halep at the group stage and Karolina Pliskova in the semi-finals.
After an even start, she seized control of the final by breaking four straight times across the sets to lead 5-0 in the second set. But with the title in her sights, Wozniacki was unable to serve it out in the seventh game and the ninth, when Williams produced an astounding crosscourt winner to win her fourth straight game.
But Wozniacki finally triumphed in the 10th game with her backhand winner to celebrate in style.
Williams, 37, looked increasingly weary as the match wore on after playing a gruelling, three-set semi-final against Caroline Garcia on Saturday.
In a contrast of styles, counter-puncher Wozniacki tried to extend the rallies while her big-hitting opponent attempted to shorten points through sheer power and rushes to the net.
Wozniacki broke three times in the first set and took a one-set lead when Williams played a loose service game at 4-5 down -- just she second set she had ever conceded to the Dane. AFP
