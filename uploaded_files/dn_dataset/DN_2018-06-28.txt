Lake House Aloka Pooja - 2018
The Buddhas teachings  illumine a path of virtue
King Dharmasoka's eldest son Arahath Mahinda and the Buddhist entourage visited Mihintale 2,326 years ago to endow us with Buddhism. At the foot of the Aradhana Gala, King Devanampiya Tissa and his army who were deer-hunting, were enlightened by the Buddhas teachings. The king and his army laid down their weapons and set foot on a path of non-violence, Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Walawahangunuwewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera said, while delivering an anusasana at the inauguration of the Lake House Poson Aloka Pooja which commenced on June 26 with the cooperation of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
The nayaka thera said it was unfortunate that certain Buddhists had limited the festival to a mere form of entertainment. He said he wished that the 2,326th National Poson pinkama (2,326th mihindu jayanthi), would be a lesson for wayward Buddhists.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the chief guest at the Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja inauguration ceremony, said the Buddhist community would be grateful to Lake House founder late D. R. Wijewardane.
The government had paid special attention to restore Mihintale's past glory by renovating a large number of Buddhist monuments scattered in a land area spanning 600 acres, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the Mihintale illumination programme yesterday. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake along with the Mihintale Divisional Secretary, executive officials attached to agencies contributing to the aloka pooja's pinkama programme and CEB officials, would inaugurate the final day of the aloka pooja today.
A large crowd of devotees witnessed the Mihintale Mihindu Perahera that commenced on June 26 evening at the historic Mihintala Raja Maha Viharaya. Government Agent Wanninayake inaugurated the event by placing a Sacred Relic on the back of a tusker.
According to police, around 600,000 devotees had visited Anuradhapura and Mihintale since June 26. Anuradhapura Senior Superintendent of Police Thilina Hapuarachchi told the Daily News that 2,800 police officers were placed on special Poson duty, adding that 120 officers attached to the Police Life-Saving Squad were stationed at major water sources.

Activists misusing freedom of speech under present regime

Some civil organisation activists are making baseless allegations misusing the freedom of speech ushered by the present government, Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim yesterday said.
He said that these allegations are baseless and malicious.
Today they have freedom to make allegations. But there should be a basis for these allegations. I am sorry to state that those activists as well as the media which spreads this baseless information should check the truth of such information before they publish or broadcast it, he said.
Minister Hashim made these observations after attending a special programme in Kegalle yesterday morning.
The Minister pointed out that he worked as the Higher Education Minister until March 2015 under the 100-Day Programme and Dr Sarath Amunugama was appointed as the Higher Education Minister on March 22, 2015, by the President.
Meanwhile, on June 19, the Board of Directors of the University Grants Commission decided to channel investments through the National Savings Bank. At that time the Higher Education Minister was Dr. Sarath Amunugama. Not me. The decision was taken by the University Grants Commission. Therefore, contrary to allegations of activists, I have no connection at all with these matters and clearly I must say that these allegations are baseless, Minister Hashim said.
Minister Hashim said that the University Grant Commission was blamed by COPE and a system was introduced for UGC investments even in 2013. The UGC did so under the instructions of the Attorney General. Minister Hashim requested that fraud such as that committed by primary dealer, Entrust Company, amounting to over Rs. 12,000 million, be revealed. He was critical of the silence maintained on such issues as these have happened under the previous regime.
Out of that, Rs. 2,500 million was taken from the Central Bank Pensioners Fund and another Rs. 2,500 million from the Ceylon Electricity Board Pensioners Fund, he said.

Beauty tips that will  also improve  your health
Exfoliate your skin 
Dead skin cells equal dull skin tone. And by not getting rid of them, youre sabotaging the hydrating effects of body cleansers and moisturizers as they try to battle through the buildup barrier. Use a body scrub about twice a week. Alternatively, try daily dry-body brushing before showering.
Using a brush or loofah mitt, buff your skin in circular motions (dont scrub too hard), starting with the soles of your feet, then working upward on legs, front and back. Pay special attention to backs of the thighs, upper arms and hips. Of course, in the shower, you can use a nylon puff or sea sponge with your favourite body cleanser for a more gentle slough.
Exercise regularly 
Exercise definitely gives you more energy and keeps you in shape. But new research suggests that endurance exercise might help fight, and even reverse, the signs of aging, such as balding, grey hair and thinning skin.
Endurance exercise is aerobic activity-such as brisk walking, running or cycling-that improves cardio-respiratory fitness, according to the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology. The longer you can do aerobic exercise, the more endurance you have.
Stop shampooing every day 
Some women just dont feel clean if they dont shampoo daily. But washing your hair that often depletes your scalp of the natural oils that make hair shiny and manageable. It may make hair greasier as your body overproduces oils to compensate.
Instead, try shampooing every other day. If hair is flat, run damp hands through it and blow-dry on low to bring back volume. It helps if you dont go wild on hairspray and gel the first day. You could also try a dry shampoo.
Apply sunscreen daily 
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or indoor tanning equipment and having fair skin are the most common risk factors for skin cancer. People who work, or exercise, in the sun for long periods of time are at greater risk.

CEB Superintendent invents  shoes to safely negotiate  concrete, wooden posts
An Electrical Superintendent has made a pair of iron shoes that could be used to safely and quickly climb concrete and wooden lamp posts.
The inventor of this pair of iron shoes is Electrical Superintendent Nihal Samarakone attached to the Hatton Electricity Consumer Centre.
Speaking to the Daily News, Samarakone said currently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) workers use ladders to access power lines, which is a hassle to transport and is also dangerous.
He added that a worker could climb a post at the same speed of walking with the help of these shoes.
There are certain places where it is hard to transport a ladder which would also require several persons to carry it. On the contrary, this new invention weights a mere kilogramme and it also offers safety for the CEB worker, while allowing him greater access to work comfortably for longer periods. A worker has to stand on the ladder and this sometimes causes numbness in his legs. This also limits the time he can stand on the ladder. However, this new device makes it easier on his feet and prevents such difficulties, Samarakone said.
He said measures have been taken to apply for a patent for this new invention. Samarakone also has around 30-40 other patents for various inventions.
His latest product is the only patent obtained for a food substance which is sold under the brand name Sarva Posha. It is a cereal produced using the pulses and grains, especially indigenous rice varieties that have proven health benefits. These grains are not simply used and we extract the highest nutritional values using the maximum energy methods and this cereal is an excellent source of nutrition, he added.

COMBANK promotes Lankas biodiversity
Eight of the known types of fossorial blind snakes of the Typhlopidae family are endemic to Sri Lanka. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon is funding a new scientific project to identify and classify more types in this species to add to the countrys biodiversity pool and promote conservation.
The Bank has committed financing support to the Herpetological Foundation of Sri Lanka (HFS) to conduct a research study relating to the taxonomy or the classification study and conservation of the Typhlopidae, which seeks to systematically revise, study and classify the Typhlopidae in the country, with the potentialfor the introduction of several species of the family that are new to science.
The Foundation has said it is hopeful it will be able to taxonomically publish 30 new species of Typhlops as a result of this study.
Commercial Banks funding of this research will also help create conservation awareness about the family of blind snakes among the general public, while enabling the updating of a fully-curated collection of the species to be deposited in the National Museum of Sri Lanka, the Banks Managing Director Mr Jegan Durairatnam said. We believe that contributing to the expansion of scientific data and knowledge in the sphere of biodiversity is a worthy cause for the Bank to support.
The objective of the study extends to arriving at a detailed understanding of the current distribution of theTyphlopidae in the country, and to recognise conservation issues faced by the species. Besides this, publishing new species would pave the way to declare Sri Lanka as a separate Biodiversity Hotspot as per the mission begun by the National Species Conservation Advisory, and as a Megadiverse country a country with high numbers of endemic species, a spokesman for the Herpetological Foundation of Sri Lanka said.
Upon achieving these goals, the Foundation would be able to assess and determine the conservation status of the Typhlops using the IUCN Red List for threatened species criteria, and also update the national database on species maintained by the Ministry of Environment of Sri Lanka.
So far the HFS has collected data on the occurrence of Typhlops from approximately 169 locations on the island; 23 from the intermediate zone, 86 from the wet zone, and 60 from the dry and arid zones. However, the Herpetological Foundationis convinced of the possible occurrence of several more species of Typhlops in Sri Lanka.
Habitat loss and deterioration as a result of the expansion of agricultural land and human settlements; mortality related to man-made forest fires; application of agrochemicals; road kills and predation by farm animals (poultry) are listed as possible threats to the Typhlopidae in Sri Lanka by the Foundation. Since these fossorial reptiles prefer to live in moist soil with organic matter and leaf litter, a rise in atmospheric temperatures related to global warming too could also pose a threat to these sensitive reptiles.
Conservation is one of the main aims of this research project undertaken by Mr L. J. Mendis Wickramasinghe, the principal investigator and founder of the Foundation.
The HFS also said that it hopes to name one of the new species to be discovered after Commercial Bank according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) of fauna.

A commendable move
To say that the estate community in this country is a vastly neglected lot would, indeed, be the understatement of the century. They not only break their backs day in and day out to earn for the country, which until recently, was its largest foreign exchange source but also are exploited in many other ways. These hapless souls whose forebears were brought to the country by the British, as indentured labour, from South India are, for the most part, still living in line rooms in the most primitive conditions imaginable. In the past a single estate worker family, usually numbering around a dozen, or, more, were cramped into a single line room. This situation has improved only marginally today.
They are also plagued by malnutrition and the infant mortality rate is high. Estate children have hardly seen the inside of a school and what schools that exist dont have teachers. This community have been ignored and left to whither in the vines by all governments since independence.
It is in this context that the new measures that are being taken by the government to lift the living standards of the estate community and bring them on par with the rest of the society deserve commendation. According to a news report we carried in our front page yesterday, the government is to set up a new Authority in the plantations to develop new villages in the estates that would replace the line rooms which this community was condemned to by the British and continued to be condemned thereafter.
The Bill to set up an Authority known as the New Villages Development Authority for the Plantation Region is to be presented to parliament soon by Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Digambaran. The new villages that will be built under this programme will replace the existing line rooms with single houses and improved basic infrastructure facilities within those estates.
The government, with this move, aims to include the plantation community into to the social mainstream through socio-economic, cultural and infrastructure development in the plantation region, it was noted.
But integrating the estate community with the rest of the society wont be easy. For this, the government has to pay attention to their enlightenment and emancipation from a life of virtual slavery. We say this because plantation workers have been exploited for too long by the crafty politicians in the thottam and condemned to live a life of ignorance. These politicians liked to keep the community in the dark, forever, since enlightenment brought about by education was bound to expose their true motives and opulent living at the expense of the estate worker.
While the North had been famous for producing eminent men and women in the professions we hardly hear of any outstanding academic achievement from among the estate community. This is solely due to generations of the community been chained to the single job of plucking tea. Steps therefore should be taken to rid the community of this slave mentality if they are to be successfully integrated into society. They are also largely a community taken for granted and this factor is exploited by all political parties. Nay, they have been made a commodity in the hands of political leaders of the plantations who barter their community to the highest bidder during election time. This mould should also be broken so that they would not be a plaything in the hands of estate politician, to amass wealth.
This is not to say that grand old man Thondaman had neglected his community. Far from it, he has extracted many concessions from successive governments for the plantation workers such as increase in the daily wage and the collective bargaining mechanism that brought many benefits to the community. However, they came at a big price, the price borne by the governments by way of special favours such as ownership of airline agencies and other quid pro quos.
Be that as it may, a fully integrated programme to uplift the conditions of the estate workers should be carried out in earnest. Hopefully, this is the first step in a well thought out plan to address all aspects of estate life. It is all too well known that liquor addiction in the estates is rampant, eclipsing all other areas in the country, with a high percentage of women too falling prey. The harsh life led by the estate workers coupled with the cool climate, perhaps, has led to this phenomenon. What is worst is that almost 90% of the addicts consume moonshine due to the ill-affordability of the regular liquor, leading to the rise in alcohol related diseases in the estates. This aspect too should receive the attention of the authorities. Hospitals in the estates too lack doctors and vital medicines, as regular newspaper reports indicate. It is indeed a paradox that a region with the most salubrious climes and breathtaking scenery in the country is also home to an eyesore in the form of squalid line rooms housing an uncared for, largely abandoned community. Hope things will witness a turnaround with the latest initiative of the government.

Dark Prince to seize local cinema
Jayantha Chandrasiri is a folklore artiste of modern times. Being a filmmaker, playwright and a journalist he crafts his creations in a unique manner to carve a niche in any sphere he is involved.
Jayanthas films are made for the Sri Lankan audiences and he doesnt yearn for international recognition. Yet his philosophy in life can be kept on a global platform. Hence international creators too could benchmark with his rationalistic vision.
Sri Lankan audiences eagerly await a film by Jayantha Chandrasiri because they know his films talk to their inner conscious. This silent communication between the local filmgoers and the latter is sheer magic.
Gharasarpa
Demons and demonic possessions are subjects that are common to all religions and societies in the world.
Jayantha Chandrasiri has touched on this subject in his latest cinema, Gharasarpa.
Gharasarpa (Serpent that sneaks) revolves around the acts of Kalu Kumaraya (Dark Prince) a demon that dwells in the wits of people who respect Sinhala folklore and rituals.
The Dark Prince unleashes his power on young women who yearn for love and possesses the latter. Being a demon greedy for love and lust he only preys on young females.
At a weekend sermon at the Gadagama church the Dark Prince showcases his power to possess women and even challenges the priest.
The young adolescent Sandares being a new man in the environment finds this phenomenon alien to him. His distraction diminishes when his eyes meet with the electrifying eyes of Vidya, a Tamil girl in this premise.
Sandares witnesses Vidyas inclination towards the Dark Princes power. However the demonic power of the Dark Prince fails against the love of Sandares towards Vidya and on finding that the girls heart is being occupied by a mere mortal, the demon puts his wrath upon Sandares.
The demon prince is an expert of manipulation having played this game of preying on love for centuries like Dracula, challenging even the holiest people.
On the other aspect even the most inseparable love would be separated by socio-political factors taking place in a country. The two young lovers eventually fall prey to this scenario. Stripped from their lost love, the two lovers carry on with life.
Yet the Dark Prince follows Sandares for decades seeking for a chance to triumph over his initial defeat.
After 37 years when the separatist war ceases in the country, Dr Vidya Doreiyappa, a beautiful psychiatrist returns to her motherland.
Meanwhile Prof Sandares Edirisinghe, a professor in philosophy who still misses his first love is now respected by the Dark Prince for reasons unknown to others.
Soon in the film circuits
Gharasarpa will soon be released in local cinema circuits. The cinema features Kamal Addaraarachchi, Jackson Anthony, Sangeetha Weeraratne, Sriyantha Mendis, Ameesha Kaavindi with young actors, Dewnaka Porage and Kavindya Adikari.
Prabhath Roshan is the cinematographer of Gharasarpa.
Samitha Mudunkotuwa, Bhachi Susan and Dumal Warnakulasuriya have rendered their voices to the songs with melodies of Chinthaka Jayakody who has composed music for the cinema. Gharasarpa is produced by the popular actor Arjuna Kamalanath. Story, dialogues, screen play, direction and lyrics of the cinema is by Jayantha Chandrasiri.

Deputy Minister takes tipper drivers side in Suriyawewa
An argument erupted between Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma and Police Special Task Force officials at Suriyawewa after tipper drivers complained to the Deputy Minister that STF personnel in civvies are in the habit of confiscating their mobile phones.
The tipper drivers carrying earth to Southern Expressway construction sites complained that STF personnel in civvies are in the habit of abusing them verbally, stopping their vehicles and keeping their mobile phones with them.
They made this complaint to the Deputy Minister when the latter visited several Grama Niladhari divisions in the Suriyawewa DS division where wild elephants had started raiding villages destroying their cultivations in the night.
Thewarapperuma told the STF officials that they should take legal action against the tipper drivers if they indulge in illegal activities but abusing them verbally and keeping their phones with the STF personnel cannot be condoned.
At this instance, officials of STF camp at Suriyawewa had arrived at the scene where an argument with the Deputy Minister ensued. STF officials justified their actions in controlling illegal activities of tipper drivers.
The Deputy Minister said that he would inform the situation to the higher ups in the police department.

e-health cards for all   citizens soon
Information of all Sri Lankan citizens will be stored in e-health cards within four months from the date of launching the project, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said that a private company has computerised all the information of people living in Andra Pradesh in India. It is proposed to introduce the e-health card system for all Sri Lankans with the support of the same company. He was addressing the gathering after launching the information management system at Castle Street Maternity Hospital recently.
The Minister had pointed out that now there is no drug shortage in state hospitals due to the new software introduced in order to track down the availability of drugs and obtain required drugs at any time from where they are available (state hospitals).
If there is any drug shortage, the hospital director of the relevant hospital should take the responsibility for such a situation. Since all data of a person is stored in his or her e-health card, it is very easy for doctors to treat him or her without any delay to find out details such as blood group, etc. The e-health card would contain all health reports of the patient, the Minister said.

Exploring digital frontier of HNBs innovative trade services
HNB has been deeply entwined with the islands trade providing essential trade and advisory services to importers and exporters alike for over 130 years.
The nature of global trade and commerce is changing at an exponentially faster pace, facilitated by the rapid emergence of new technologies and business models, that are increasingly global in scale.
According to HNB, Assistant General Manager Trade and Financial Institutions, Janath Ilangantileke, these changes bring with them fresh opportunities to tap into global trade and strong economic development nationally.
Trade in international markets can often seem like a daunting challenge for Sri Lankan enterprises as such transactions are usually accompanied with complicated International rules and extensive documentation. The most basic of transactions, would require a very good knowledge of International Chamber of Commerce rules such as UCP 600, URC 522 and International Commercial (INCO) terms to ensure that each transaction is completed without any difficulty, he explained.
Most of the other banks operating in this space tend to offer a similar range of services, but where HNB really stands ahead, is in terms of our strategy of adding meaningful value to our clients at every stage. We have easily the largest number of technically qualified staff and Certified Documentary Credit Specialists (CDCS) in the industry and we use this wealth of knowledge to provide advisory services that go above and beyond what is typically found in the trade business, Ilangantileke stated.
In keeping with its mission to provide the most comprehensive support to trade business clients, HNB maintains a 24 hour response service with dedicated personnel, who will take calls from customers any time of the day and who possess the extensive knowledge required to resolve any issue quickly and conveniently.
Countrys International Trade Business is expected to grow, due to the increased economic activity from the many development projects and greater focus on Exports.
Catering to a wide variety of clients from large Corporates to businesses in the Mid-Market and SME sector, HNBs next major priority is in facilitating the complete digitization of trade services with a view of promoting sharp efficiency gains, that will support the drastic up scaling of international trade coming to Sri Lanka over the medium to long term.
HNB has reinforced the partnership with Trade clients in their adaptation to digitalization by guiding them through every step of their first transaction, explaining each process and the safeguards in place along the way to ensure that every transaction is completed safely, quickly and with complete ease.
In order to further reassure customers of the service standards , HNB Trade Service operations were the first to secure ISO Certification in year 2004 and have since been upgraded to ISO 9001:2015 status, following stringent audits by M/s Bureau Veritas.
HNBs local relationships in the trade services sector is further complemented by extensive international partnerships with a global network of over 800 correspondent banks whom we regularly interact, in order to ensure that HNB and our clients can transact with the global partners with seamless ease, Ilangantileke stated.

## Title: FAKE NEWS: NEW FORM OF CYBER CRIME
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

FAKE NEWS: NEW FORM OF CYBER CRIME
It is too soon to say whether Google or Facebook would accelerate their initiatives to prevent the spread of fake news and even if they did, whether the attempts would have a significant impact. However, the threats caused by fake news are not likely to go away as they have now become part and parcel of what the people have come to expect.
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) recently organised a symposium on Media and Democracy; Misinformation, fake news and its impact on national security at the Defence Ministry in which the speakers highlighted that the proliferation of fake news on the internet and its associated media has been identified as a new form of cybercrime endangering free debate, social peace and national security in many countries across the globe.
Defence Ministry to counter fake news
The military force of our country countered terrorism, but today, misinformation campaigns, fake news and electronic espionage operations have become the cutting edge of modern warfare. The Defence Ministry is now focusing on how to protect the country against these new threats.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, affirmed that the mission of the Defence Ministry was to ensure a secure and peaceful country and to achieve this through planning and executing strategies and policies for a secure, safe and sovereign country with total territorial integrity.
Waidyaratne, speaking about the danger of fake news and online radicalisation, said that it can be used to mobilise the masses and make them engage in violent acts on religion, racial and ethnic issues. He pointed out that the recent violence in Digana was one such example.
He noted that the importance of focussing on this matter lies in upholding the collective responsibility of narrating the truth, promoting the truth and protecting audiences from the dangers of fake news.
Misuse of various media insights violence, spreads uncertainty and is a sure threat to national security and democracy. We are also vested with the responsibility of making social media a democratic space with rules and guidelines, he said.
Waidyaratne highlighted the importance of making policies to avoid situations such as the country encountered earlier this year and added that preventing proliferation of fake news requires productive efforts, open minds and coherent strategies.
Military and technical perspective of misinformation
Group Captain M.D.A.G. Seneviratne was of the opinion that being exposed to an overload of information was dangerous.
Explaining that we were facing a crisis of credibility, he noted that with the dramatic increase and speed in transmitting information, there was a drastic decline in objectivity and accuracy. News is true unless it is proven otherwise.
Seneviratne pointed out that from a military perspective, dissemination of information to the public was always a concern. He further said that the major threat to the military today was the information released to the public and the right to information had to accompany the responsibility of information.
We should create awareness among people on the credibility of social media. Regulation is needed on misinformation in the public domain. When the platform changes, people would still have credibility issues. And to counteract it with censorship is not the solution. We need to find smart methods to deal with it, he said.
Seneviratne emphasised the need to capitalise on the digital revolution and keep moving forward.
Roshan Chandragupta from the Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) brought in the technical perspective: It is difficult to identify individuals behind certain accounts on social media, track IP addresses and obtain court orders to do so. We need to balance data privacy and privacy of users against the need for regulation.
He said that information spreads so quickly that it was called a global village today. But technically speaking, it is not at all easy to manage, as it comprises different organisations.
Accuracy is in eyes of beholder
The accessibility and instantaneous quality of online news platforms has propelled the rise of a new arena for information, but also misinformation.
Professor Gihan Dias from the Moratuwa University said that people go after news because often, it affected them in some way, and at other instances, it incited curiosity even though it might not affect them personally.
He said that the reasons for people to get news via social media were because it was convenient, fast, personalised, considered reliable and self-selecting.
Dias further said that the accuracy of fake news was mostly judged in the eyes of the beholder and that is how a post was shared and re-shared. Sometimes fake news is spread on organised media as well, but they do have a limit, unlike social media. People go after what they consider true on social media and do what needs to be done to disseminate the news they believe is true, he said.
He explained that the danger of fake news was that people select the news that they want and the audience strongly believes the news which might lead to issues in future. People continue to follow what they believe is true and unfollow, unfriend or delete what they consider false. So it is how they perceive things. And there are issues in identifying distinctions between fake and real news to avoid confusion among people, he said.
Harindra Dassanayake from the Presidents Media Unit stated that he was inspired by Andy Warhols words, In the future, everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes, which appeared in the programme for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden, and added that Warhols saying has turned out to be true today. Today, people are not bothered about what they share; instead, they focus on the number of likes and shares the post would get, he said.
The speaker reminded the audience that we are living in a world where information was on overload and added that it came with a package of non-reliable information.
Dassanayake, pointing out the recent incident that happened in Ampara where a tense situation arose over allegations that fertility pills were mixed with food, said that fake news usually accelerated existing issues. If a person has an intention of deceiving someone or creating conflict, he will always find a way to do that and the easiest way now is social media. And intention is not something that can be proved by anyone, he said.
Dassanayake highlighted that fake news was not new. Even in the good old days it was prevalent, but it spread slowly. Today, with the speedy development of technology, millions of people get to know fake or true news in seconds. There is no change in the content of the fake news, only its form has changed, he said.
His concern was that blocking social media was not the solution to the issue.
Dassanayake finally said that there are many other countries in the globe looking for ways to curb the spread of fake news.
Global fight against fake news
A December 2016 survey by the Pew Research Centre in USA suggests that 23 percent of US adults have shared fake news, knowingly or unknowingly, with friends and others. Data experts in Sri Lanka also revealed that there was a drastic increase in people following fake news and misinformation.
weaponised narratives
Director of Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies, Dr Harinda Vidanage said that globally, dissemination of fake news became a hot topic after the US Presidential Election in 2016. He said the concept proposed by security researchers was that there are ongoing weaponised narratives which look at misinformation, disinformation and fake news and its political impact.
He highlighted that most of the fake news challenged democracy and added that countries that are open to democracy face more issues compared to the rest. It is not a problem for countries that have traditionally not been democratic, he added. We have entered a post-factual society. It is a great challenge to deal with a society that does not accept or regard facts, he said.
Dr Vidanage said that he preferred calling the context of faking news as narrative and added that more than what it is called, the most powerful is the story that is spread.
Even though online platforms have been used in politics since 1995, he said it was from 2007 that all security establishments in the world started to look at cyberspace as a threat to national security. It was at that time that the world realised that cyberspace can be used by a third country to destabilise the political process of another country without using traditional methods of war.
It was after 2007 that even the US started developing serious cybersecurity responses on a global scale and it is still looking for a narrative. After 2010, it became more political, ever since WikiLeaks, as cyberspace became a liberation technology for some people, he said.
Revealing the fact that since 2010 there are more than 70 countries today actively using cyber-weaponisation projects, Dr Vidanage said that after 2016, it was found that cyber-weaponisation was a threat where a third country is able to manipulate the international political process of a country by compromising the minds of its people. This was especially highlighted in the allegation that Russia undermined democracy in the US through its social media.
He pointed out that fake news brings destruction to the internal and external security of a country. These can get combined as well - an internal hate campaign of a country can be carried out by an external party.
Citing the upcoming election in Sweden as an example, he said people are being warned about the overload of information that is being spread, which has turned out to be one of the major worries of that country. According to Dr Vidanage, even though Sri Lankans believe that an election in the country is a local matter, it is also geopolitical. Sri Lankans are very sensitive about what we see. Depriving people of what is true, cyberspace has made people look at what is comfortable. That is a dangerous threat. People are picking and choosing news which they like and as a result, there will be serious political and economic repercussions, he said.
Dr Vidanage said that academia also contributed to the decay of truth and emphasised the need to promote the idea of truth irrespective of who was in power.
Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Chairman Prof. Rohan Samarajiva proposed self regulation as an expected solution to this issue, though it was going to be very difficult in Sri Lanka. He said that there are possibilities to introduce norms and ethics for organised media institutions, but it was hardly possible to implement the same for social media. If an organised media institution violates the norms, its accreditation can be cancelled. But social media has no accreditation, he said.
Explaining that even self-regulation could be difficult in Sri Lanka, he said even in the traditional media, the newspapers that were established in the past few years have refused to adhere to accepted norms of regulation. Regarding the option of criminalisation, in the case of Sri Lanka, Article 14(1)(a) grants every citizen the right to freedom of speech, but there is a need to balance this right with regulating fake news, hate speech and incitement of violence via media platforms, he said.
In Malaysia, the Anti-Fake News Act, entered into force on 11 April and its content-based offences are much broader than those that already exist in legislation like the Sedition Act, Communications and Multimedia Act, or the Penal Code. Two months after it was enforced, it was reported in the media that the Malaysian Communication Minister intended to repeal the law.
Samarajiva said that even Sri Lanka could implement laws like in Malaysia, but questioned whether it would be practical to implement if the convicted person is residing in another country. Chandragupta was also of the same opinion that when information is published on a website owned by a person living in a different country, challenging it was not practical unless it was a threat to national security. The technical details are more complicated than what is apparent. Who is going to decide the credibility of the information The institutions will always have their own agendas, he said.

## Title: FAO-led Bay of Bengal project re-energised with US$ 15 mn

FAO-led Bay of Bengal project re-energised with US$ 15 mn
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has approved US$ 15 million in funding to assist continued management of the large marine ecosystem in the Bay of Bengal in order to help sustain ecosystem services for the benefit of the coastal populations and countries.
The ultimate goal is to help safeguard ecosystem services that are estimated to be worth around US$ 240 billion over the next 25 years, and reinforce nutrition and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people in the region.
Transboundary marine resources are particularly complex as there is a broad range of stakeholders with whom to consult. At the same time, these resources are affected by a wide range of issues, from overfishing and illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, to habitat degradation, water pollution and climate change.
The FAO led project, Sustainable Management of the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem (BOBLME), was first launched in 2009 to enhance the regional management of the areas environment and fisheries sector. In addition to the GEF funding, the governments of Sweden and Norway had provided financial resources in support of the projects initial phase 20092017.
The new GEF funding will help FAO and its partners to continue working with national and local government agencies, commercial fishers, artisanal fisher-folk, academic institutions and local NGOs to further develop capacities of these groups to plan and implement a holistic ecosystem approach to the management of these resources.
Lifeline for hundreds of millions
Eight countries depend on the Bay of Bengal - Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand, with some 400 million people, the vast majority of whom subsist at the poverty line or below it, and are dependent on the Bay of Bengal for their food and livelihood. But the continuing degradation of the Bay of Bengals coastal and marine resources is having a severe impact on the quality of life and the prospects for economic growth in these communities.
The BOBLME project brought together not just various governments in the region, but also various ministries and departments. A breakthrough came when, for the first time ever, the ministries of environment and fisheries of these eight countries eventually agreed on a process to collectively manage a large marine ecosystem, and a Strategic Action Programme finally emerged.
In developing and agreeing on a Strategic Action Programme, the countries have prioritised regional actions for collaboration and have identified their own national actions to support the sustainable management of the Bay of Bengal and the long-term wellbeing for the people who depend on it, said FAOs Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo, who is attending the 6th GEF Assembly in Da Nang, Viet Nam this week.
The Strategic Action Programme has defined four main areas of intervention: sustainable management of fisheries, restoration of degraded marine habitats for biodiversity conservation, coastal and marine pollution management and improvement of peoples livelihoods and enhanced resilience of the coastal areas.
The GEFs renewed funding will allow for concrete actions to make the programme a reality, further contributing to enhanced food security and poverty reduction in coastal communities in the region. (FAO)

FIU signs MOU with SEC to prevent money laundering
The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) on to establish a framework for sharing information on supervisory findings based on comprehensive risk-based supervision focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) /Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) in the Securities Sector.
This is in terms of the provisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA) Vajira Wijegunawardena, Director General of the SEC and D M Rupasinghe, Director, FIU signed the MOU on behalf of the respective institutions in the presence of Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, who is also the Chairman of the AML/CFT National Coordinating Committee and Ranel T Wijesinha, Chairman of the SEC.
Compliance with the AML/CFT framework of the country is essential for the Securities Sector participants too in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and connected financial crimes which could threaten the stability of domestic as well as global economic and financial systems.
The SEC, as the regulatory and supervisory body of the Securities Sector will conduct risk-based AML/CFT supervision and share supervisory findings with the FIU to ensure sector compliance with the AML/CFT framework.
The FIU has already entered into MOUs with foreign counterparts and domestic government agencies such as Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Immigration and Emigration, Department of Inland Revenue, Department for Registration of Persons and Sri Lanka Police in order to share information to facilitate investigations.
The MOU with the SEC is the 1st MOU signed with a regulatory/supervisory authority to share information relating to AML/CFT supervision. Further, arrangements have been made to sign MOUs with several other regulatory/supervisory authorities for the above purpose soon.

Fleetwood defending French Open title at different Ryder Cup course
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Wednesday: Defending champion Tommy Fleetwood is keen to land an early blow for Europe ahead of Septembers Ryder Cup when he tees off at the French Open on Thursday.
Jon Rahm of Spain and Fleetwood, two of Europes leading stars, line up in a strong field at Le Golf National, the widely-acclaimed course which hosts the 42nd Ryder Cup in just under three months time.
World number 10 Fleetwood, runner-up at the US Open earlier this month, said he was glad to be back at the challenging French course but noted that it had a new look about it.
The course seems so different. Its so set up now for the Ryder Cup in September... its like difficult to get your bearings a bit, said the 27-year-old. Spaniard Rahm, ranked fifth in the world, is another man expected to spearhead the European Ryder Cup challenge. But the 23-year-old said he was looking forward to playing the French Open, not as a scouting exercise for the Ryder Cup, but because it remains one of the top events on the tour and a personal favourite.
Its probably one of my favourite courses all year, not only on the European Tour but worldwide, he said.
Its a great golf course but its very difficult. Its fair, you can think your way around it and if youre smart enough, you can actually get a score but to win you need to play extremely good.
Rahm said he had originally thought there would be more top Americans at the course, where they will be attempting to win the title on European soil for the first time since 1993.
I thought there were going to be at least four or five, he added.
And if it wasnt the players that were already in guaranteed, maybe the people who are on the edge (of gaining a Ryder Cup place).
Justin Thomas, the world number two, is the top American contender in what he said was a tremendous French Open field this year. AFP

Former SLSCA secretary commended Mother of all Shows
Former Secretary of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA), B.S. Perera commended the role played by the Lake House and the Sunday Observer for launching countrys first ever school cricket awards ceremony four decades ago, stating that it was a huge inspiration for schoolboy cricketers.
He added that more schoolboy cricketers are stepping into the Test arena now, than in the past, but only a few have been able to cement their places. Comparing the richest era of local school cricket  1979 to 1991, during which legendary Sri Lanka cricketers in the caliber of Ranjan Madugalle, Arjuna Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan, Marvan Atapattu, Kumara Dharmasena, Chaminda Vaas, to name a few, to present day school cricket, the veteran school cricket official said a greater number of schoolboy cricketers are being produced at present although most of them have failed to retain their places.
If you go by the number, there are more schoolboys stepping directly to the national tram. But quality-wise there is a vast gap compared to what was dished out in the 80s and early 90s, he said.
The former SLSCA Secretary, who was affectionately known as BS during his unblemished three-decade long career as a top school cricket official and a veteran teacher at Sri Jayewardenepura MV, recalled the origin of Sri Lankas inter-school league tournament in late 1980s.
We did not have an official inter-school under-19 league tournament for the under-19 age group, though the SLSCA had its own structure for junior age groups. There were only friendly traditional games for first X1 teams. But with Coca-Cola stepping in to sponsor a knock out limited over tournament for Under-19 school teams, we had to find criteria to select the top eight school teams, he said.
BS said since the Coca-Cola Under-19 limited over knock out tournament was organized after the First X1 season in April, they decided to take the performances of the teams during the first X1 season into account to pick the best eight teams that would play in the knock out tournament. Although there was no league tournament as such, we introduced a points system for friendly matches played during the season so that we could find some basic criteria to pick the teams, he said.
There could have been mistakes when selecting the best eight teams for the limited over knock out as there was no official league tournament.
It was a difficult task. It is easy to organize things now but in an era where there had not been any organized under-19 league tournament, we had to work hard to get things going. At the same time, we had to look after the interests of the sponsors who preferred to accommodate teams considered as crowd pullers, he said.
Comparing the present day school cricket to that of yesteryear, BS said schoolboy cricketers are rewarded better as tournaments now have a better monitory value.
At the initial stages, we did not get any financial support from the national governing body, the then Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka. I remember how former SLSCA President Merrill Fernando, the then Principal of Prince of Wales College, presented the case to the then board president, the late minister Gamini Dissanayake who had responded favorably, he added.
BS said the late Fernando was of the view that school cricket should be a mere extra-curricular activity for schoolboys as in other sport and not with the sole intention of producing Test cricketers. Yet, we produced top Sri Lanka cricketers during that era, he said.
Asked about lack of spectator interest for school cricket now, the former school cricket stalwart said people would prefer to watch action from home.
Not only for school matches, there are hardly any spectators even for club matches. The lives of people have turned out to be more complicated and busy. Moreover, with the development of technology, people could watch action in home comfort. Thats why even home Test matches project virtually empty stadia, he pointed out.
BS said the decision makers at the school cricket governing body should be knowledgeable. But he alleged that the SLSCA has a huge executive committee in which the majority is from division 11 and 111 schools with relatively poor knowledge of the game.
He said most qualified teachers in the past had volunteered to serve as masters-in-charge of cricket purely for the love for the game, forgoing numerous opportunities they had to make an extra earning through private tuition in the evenings.
There are only a few good school teachers and masters who devote their time with school teams now. You cant blame them, circumstances are different now. Some school teams, mostly in division 11 and 111, dont even have a master-in-charge and their coaches play a dual role. Then the boys lack the protection of a guardian to look into their needs. This is an unfortunate situation, he said.
BS maintained his old stance to scrapping Under-13 and 15 inter-school tournaments. I still maintain what I have told about junior tournaments, that the Under-13 and under-15 inter-school cricket should only be confined to friendly matches. They should not be exposed to undue competition at that age, he explained.
He alleged that the present school cricket structure is designed to promote school teams individually but not the game in general. BS stressed to need to change the SLSCA Constitution and also to introduce a better tournament structure to meet present day challenges.
We need more knowledgeable people to man school cricket and dedicated people who are willing to sacrifice their free time for the game and take care of schoolboy cricketers, Perera said.

Fuel bowser owners threaten to strike from tomorrow
Private fuel bowser operators of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation have threatened to strike from midnight tomorrow if the government fails to address their concerns regarding the recent fuel pricing formula.
The owners have called on the CPC to revise their payment structure based on the new pricing formula.
The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners Association has asked the CPC to revise their payment structures.
The association had reportedly made a written request, but was yet to obtain a reply.
The unionists had initially planned to protest on Wednesday, but put it off considering Poson Poya.
A majority of fuel from CPC is transported by private bowsers and if the operators launch a strike, it would result in a severe fuel storage issue across the country.

Germany crash out of WC as South Korea stun holders
Russia, Wednesday: Germany crashed out of the World Cup on Wednesday after a stoppage-time VAR-assisted goal from Younggwon Kim and a late second by Son Heungmin earned South Korea a famous 2-0 win.
The Germans needed to beat Korea by two clear goals in their final group F match at Kazan stadium to advance to the last 16.
But Joachim Loews men wasted a series of chances in a tense match that saw a pale version of the world champions become the fourth holders of the title this century to be sent packing at the first hurdle.
Germanys team of superstars could only look on in shock in the final minutes of the match as US referee Mark Geiger called for the video assistant referee to intervene after the unmarked Kim had bundled his shot past Germany keeper Manuel Neuer from a corner early in stoppage time.
The goal was awarded because Toni Kroos touch had played him onside, and minutes later Germany were 2-0 down after Neuer ran up the pitch in a desperate attempt to get a goal.
A long punt upfield saw Tottenham forward Son chase a clearance to fire into an empty net.
It means Germany, the four-time champions who had competed in the past 16 editions of the World Cup, fail to make it past the first hurdle of the tournament since 1938.
Germany coach Joachim Loew caused a surprise by leaving midfield attacking stalwart Thomas Mueller on the bench for the first time since 2012 after his underwhelming displays against Mexico and Sweden.
But by the end of a frustrating opening half, Loew was left desperately studying his options.
Germany suffered the first of several scares after South Korea won a free kick on the quarter hour when Sami Khediras boot connected with the head of Jung Wooyoung.
From 30 yards out, it should have been fodder for World Cup-winning goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, but after fumbling Jungs dipping drive Neuer scrambled desperately to clear as Son raced to pounce.
Germany spurned a series of chances soon afterwards.
Marco Reus, who hit a crucial leveller in the 2-1 win over Sweden, saw his drive deflected and Mesut Ozil saw his effort deflected off a Korean boot and out for a corner, after which goalkeeper Hyeonwoo Jo smothered desperately when Goretzkas header found Hummels trying to pounce on the loose ball.
Germany resumed with more urgency after the interval, but despite edging closer when Loew introduced Mario Gomez just before the hour the big Stuttgart striker headed straight at Jo from Kimmichs cross.
Striker Timo Werner then met another Kimmich ball from the left byeline with a right-foot volley that skewed agonisingly wide of Jos upright.
Germany urgency was not matched by their normal efficiency and soon legs started to tire.
Loew played his final card when he introduced Mueller for Leon Goretzka.
But the late changes failed to spark Germany into life as Korea hung on for a famous win that, unfortunately for the impressive Asians, saw them bow out after Sweden beat Mexico 3-0. AFP

Hambantota Port agreement purely  a commercial transaction - Minister
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the agreement with the Chinese firm on the Hambantota Port makes it clear that the facility cannot be used for military purposes.
In an interview with the Daily News, the Minister noted that intelligence and strategic possibilities of the ports location were not part of negotiations and added that it was purely a commercial transaction. The New York Times recently published an article titled How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port, in which they stated the transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.
According to a New York Times analysis of construction projects, China has helped finance at least 35 ports around the world in the past decade and Hambantota port is one of them.
In response to the allegations, Minister Samarasinghe said the port has nothing to do, other than commercial transactions and it has been clearly mentioned in the agreement.
China Merchant Port (CMP) over all has a lease of 69.9 percent and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority has 30.1 percent. So we are also an equity holder. Two Sri Lankan companies registered under the Companies Act will run the operations. And the Chinese will only be handling the commercial operations, the Minister said.
Minister Samarasinghe further explained that CMP will be taking care of bunkering services, facilitating export and import activities, transshipment of vehicles while industries will be set up inside the port and they will be facilitating them as well and many more.
But, every operation that CMP is involved will be confined to port and marine related activities, he said.
The Minister said that even the Sri Lankan Navy would continue to remain there.
There is an area that the Navy has been operating near the port and they will carry out their respective mandates. Further, all security related decisions will be taken by the Sri Lankan government, he said. Minister Samarasinghe said for a naval ship to arrive at the port, it has to come through the government and it would be the same even its a Chinese naval ship.
Whichever government wants to send a naval ship will have to get permission from the government of Sri Lanka and the Chinese will not come into any of that, he said.

Has SLC lost the plot on Chandimals alleged ball tampering
Having viewed the purported footage released by ICC of Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimals alleged ball tampering during the 2nd Sri Lanka  West Indies Test match, it would appear there is MERIT in the allegation.
This does no credit to this country and is reflective of what is happening in the wider arena of its governance. Nevertheless this must be viewed in the context of current realities which apply to this allegation which include:
Over a long period of time no one in authority in the ICC has objected to players (i) applying saliva on the cricket ball during matches (ii) having eatables in the mouth which could include sweets. Under the circumstances, why has ICC selectively cherry picked on Chandimal applying saliva on the ball even if it is after allegedly having a sweet in his mouth
It is now reported that Chandimal has been found Guilty of ball tampering by Michael Beloff, QC - Chairman, ICC Code of Conduct Commission.
I suggest that SLC:
1) Appeal to the ICC to forthwith rescind the finding of guilt on the basis of current realities.
2) Urge ICC to forthwith ban (i) applying of saliva on the cricket ball at all matches (ii) Spitting on the ground during matches. This should be done at least for reasons of hygiene and decorum.
It is puzzling that ICC is tolerating such practice.
Being neither a cricket nor legal expert but merely a lover of the game, I seek the views of knowledgeable persons whether Sri Lanka Cricket by and large not known for its professionalism or integrity has lost the plot in its approach to the alleged ball tampering charge against Chandimal

IIT first institute to provide BCS accredited degree programs
Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in British higher education in Sri Lanka, has become the first institute in Sri Lanka to provide degree programmes with British Computer Society (BCS) accreditation.
Four programs offered by IIT in collaboration with University of Westminster are accredited by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. They are BSc/BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering, BSc (Hons) in Computer Science, BSc (Hons) in Business Information Systems and MSc Advanced Software Engineering.
Due to this accreditation, graduates who successfully complete any of the 4 degrees will fully meet the educational requirement for Chartered IT Professional (CITP) registration. While they would be obligated to meet relevant professional experience requirements, graduates from these accredited programmes will benefit from an accelerated route to CITP status
The BCS accreditation of degrees is a globally-accepted benchmark of the standard of higher education programmes and their contribution to the IT profession. It provides an indicator of quality to students and employers and also provides independent recognition for the institutions that offer them. IIT was given accreditation after an extensive evaluation process that took several months. The BCS looks at all aspects of a higher education institute in detail, such as faculty, resources, teaching material and coursework and also conducts independent interviews with lecturers and students during their final visit prior to giving the accredited status.
BCS is the Chartered Institute for IT with a mission to enable the information society. The organisation promotes wider social and economic progress through the advancement of information technology science and practice.
Sharing her views on the accreditation, Naomi Krishnarajah  Dean of IIT stated, We are privileged to have our degree programmes recognised by the British Computer Society. This clearly underscores the high quality of the IT degree programmes that we provide at IIT.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he expects the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to increase its financing to $40 billion by 2020 and to $100 billion by 2025 from $ 4 billion now.
While inaugurating the third AIIB annual meeting on Tuesday, Mr Modi said With 87 members and a committed capital stock of 100 billion dollars, the AIIB is surely going to play a critical role in Asia.
Modi said the Indian economy is in a bright spot with strong macroeconomic fundamentals like lower inflation, over $400 billion foreign exchange reserves and robust foreign direct investment flows.
Noting that investors prefer political stability and a supportive regulatory framework in the regions they want to invest, Modi said India fits the bill.
From the point of larger scale of operations and higher value addition, an investor is also attracted by a large domestic market size, availability of skilled labour and good physical infrastructure. On each of these parameters, India is well placed and has performed very well, he said.
He also pointed out various reform measures initiated by the government like introduction of the Goods and Services Tax, housing for all by 2020, among others.

* Pain is usually rare and fairly minimal. Half of the patients do not require any pain relievers, and the others take Solpadine or Panadol for a few days.
Hair extensions
Hair extensions can cause strain on our hair, which can, in turn, lead to traction alopecia if you continue to have hair. We always advise that you get your hair extensions applied by a professional. This will lower the risk of the extensions putting any strain on your natural hair causing hair loss.
Habits to follow to prevent hair loss
* Wash hair with mild shampoo.
*Choose a suitable shampoo for your hair type.
* Look at the ingredients to find a mild shampoo.
* Use a good hairbrush.

Lankaputhra Development Bank celebrates 12th  anniversary
Lankaputhra Development Bank celebrated their 12th anniversary yesterday. The bank was incorporated on February 24, 2006. Lankaputhra Development Bank has eight branches island wide covering important cities in Sri Lanka.
Lankaputhra Development Bank Chairman, J. T. S. P. Kariyawasam speaking to Daily News Business said that they are planning to open more branches in Sri Lanka before the end of this year.
We have created an action plan and we are working on that master plan. We are going to open one or two branches in every district in the country and we have identified perfect locations to set up the branches, he said.
We have branches in Colombo, Kandy, Kegalle, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Wennappuwa, Polonnaruwa and Hambantota. We have covered eight districts and we are targeting the other seventeen districts in the country, he said.
Our main objective is to give more loan facilities to our local people. For the 12th anniversary we are going to offer a special loan scheme in the Central Province and we are granting up to Rs. 500,000 for new entrepreneurs. In the first phase we are granting the loan facilities to about hundred entrepreneurs and before the end of the year we are going to grant this loan facility to five hundred entrepreneurs.

LEADERSHIP TO DELIVER  US FROM EVILS
The widespread wrongdoing and evil in the political culture, the public service in the social and community life has brought on a repellant degeneracy to our society. All are aware that deception and lying are evil, stealing is evil, murder, adultery and fornication are evil; betrayal and treachery, fraudulence, bribery and corruption are evil; hate speech, denigrating and threatening other persons or a community is evil; insulting, intimidating and invading anothers person is evil; racialism, fanaticism and bigotry are evil. Conceit, arrogance, instigating social disorder, discord and law-breaking with impunity are evil. And all these evils in the personal and communitarian life of the people and their leaders are incompatible with the genuine doctrines of the religions and their followers supposed faithful and coherent adherence to them.
PEOPLE OUTRAGED BY SHIRKERS
Widespread public wrongdoing in society by a comparatively few miscreants makes the many ordinary law abiding citizens almost desperate because such unlawful activity cause dismay and bring confusion and chaos upon their lives. When the agencies of law and order are made to remain ineffective, they add insult to injury. The people wonder whether Sri Lanka as a nation would be ever capable of ordering our national communitarian life in a disciplined manner of a civilized people even nearly a decade after a thirty-year civil war the traumatic and sad experiences of which should have brought the people and their leaders to their senses.
Indeed many human beings are afflicted with these and various other kinds of evil. These evils are there in fluctuating intensity and overshadow the lives of all people and harm others in varying degrees consciously or unconsciously. People often fail to discern these evils in their own lives even though they do not miss noticing them in others.
However when these evils are glaringly visible especially in prominent personalities in politics their harmful effects on human dignity, human rights and well-being of people in society cause agony and annoyance. When in the face of the occurrence of these evils subtle excuses are made and the evils of dodging, skirting and shirking public issues without squarely facing national questions are resorted to, the public is outraged and great harm is done to all.
SELF-EXAMINATION PRECEDES REFORM
The issues that have estranged the people and need to be settled are well known. Those who do not have the strength of character are reluctant to diagnose and identify the fangs of these evils in their own lives. Nor could they put right the disorder in the minds, the emotions and the understanding of their colleagues. Pride, narcissism, fear and self-absorption together prevent the acknowledgement of evils and guilt. Though we are often called to sanity by thoughtfulness, reflection, understanding, insight and knowledge, we seem to be reluctant and/or unaided to grow to or recover our better self. Many are hesitant though not incapable of recognizing the demonic within themselves. To do that humility is necessary. With humility one embarks on self examination. That is the first step to abandoning evil ways of behaviour that lead to repentance preceding self-reform which brings on a spirit of benevolence, magnanimity and generosity.
A just and righteous person is not self-centred; he is a man for others. When a just and upright leader and, in our context, a group of like-minded individuals  a captain and a team  is genuinely intent on freeing the people, their fellow citizens, from the many shackles of injustice and unfairness that enchain and demean them, they should not be enticed and tempted by the power, perks and wealth to be acquired and secured to possess it exclusively for themselves. They should not prioritize their spouses and children, relatives and friends
These are indeed the life-forces of a civilized and cultured people. Civilization and culture are not merely in vestiges in archaeological sites and venerable doctrinal documents but imbued in the hearts and minds of living people. A civilized cultured people are conscious of the humane values which constantly operate in their lives and enrich them due to their thoughtful, meditative, prayerful and meek sub-consciousness of them. When this capacity in opportune circumstances suddenly erupt and activate the lives of people, they come alive with a new vision of life full of spiritual vigour and humane energy and amicable solidarity.
RULERS, DONT SOW DISCONTENT
A respected economist who adorned the public service is remembered today in honour due to his remarkable sagacity and his humility. Quite unlike are some of the people sitting in high places holding responsible positions, wielding power and influence who are lacking in both of these qualities; when they let their pride, arrogance and egoism dominate and let the evil of their manifest flaws overflow on to society, they cause irreparable harm not only to themselves and others but also to institutions and structures of law and order which they manipulate selfishly to advance their narrow purposes and perpetuate their tunnel vision thereby causing social evils. This is currently happening in Sri Lanka today.
When a righteous person and a loyal team gives leadership to any society or community, there is order, harmony in relationships and the people are content. They find meaning and purpose in life. When a wicked person, a tyrant rules there is discontent and sadness and the people groan. Today among us there is much that is not considered right with those who have governed in the past and some of those who govern presently and much that is debase in the way things have been and are administered.
A UNIFIER NOT A DIVIDER
A just and righteous person is not self-centred; he is a man for others. When a just and upright leader and, in our context, a group of like-minded individuals  a captain and a team  is genuinely intent on freeing the people, their fellow citizens, from the many shackles of injustice and unfairness that enchain and demean them, they should not be enticed and tempted by the power, perks and wealth to be acquired and secured to possess it exclusively for themselves.
They should not prioritize their spouses and children, relatives and friends. Like Moses of old who led his people from slavery to freedom and human solidarity, on an occasion opposing his own brother who misled the people, true leaders uphold the law, despise privileges, favoured positions and riches and prefer to share the afflictions and the abject condition of their people, suffer with them and set out to liberate them. (Cf. Biblical Letter to the Hebrews, Ch 11 vv 24-26).
Jesus Christ, in a parable on talents, referred to public service as a reward bestowed on faithful servants who were appointed to rule the people. (Gospel of Luke, Ch. 19).
The prominent people who present themselves to us their fellow citizens as their prospective leaders are focused on a praiseworthy project if they could come before the people as genuine servants who are sincere in their commitment to public service. They should come forward not to take revenge but to restore justice, not to assure security and satisfaction to a majority, even the majority that elect them, at the expense of a minority, but to restore the bonds of national solidarity, peace and unity and the contentment of all the citizens in the pleasantly multifaceted pluralist national community in Sri Lanka enriched by her rich cultural heritage and traditions.
For support they should not appeal to baser feelings of rivalry, tribalism and clannish ideologies but to the genuine good sense and feelings of fraternity among the people, unifying them, not dividing them on biases and superficial values that go against democratic principles.
True patriotism embraces all the citizens of the country in a spirit of sharing, mutual forgiveness where needed and islandwide solidarity. We need a leader and a team free of prejudice and partiality who will deliver us from the social evils that afflict our country and give us hope of a brighter tomorrow.

Norway, FAO will scale up innovative  forest monitoring tool
Access to satellite data and cutting-edge geospatial technologies will be broadened thanks to deeper collaboration between FAO and Norway, whose International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI)agreed to scale up an innovative FAO digital platform that helps countries measure, monitor and report on their forests and land use.
The $6 million, three-year project, announced during the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum, will allow for boosting the power and reach of FAOs innovative forest monitoring platform, SEPAL (System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring).
The easy-to-use platform offers developing countries unparalleled access to granular satellite data and super computing power, paving the way for them to improve the accuracy and transparency of national plans to mitigate the effects of climate change and fine-tune land-use policies and implementation.
Governments, civil society, companies and citizens need accurate and complete forest information to manage our forests. This is critically important in efforts to combat deforestation - efforts which must succeed if we are to reach the Sustainable Development Goals or fulfil the Paris Agreement, said NICFI Director Per Pharo.
Platforms such as SEPAL show how state of the art technologies can make forest information easier and faster. SEPAL has lowered costs, removed barriers, and improved forest monitoring for more than a dozen national governments. I am particularly eager to see what SEPAL can achieve with new access to high-resolution satellite data. SEPAL allows users to query and process satellite data quickly and efficiently, tailor their products for local needs, and produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses quickly. Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. Google Earth Engine), SEPAL enables access and processing of critical historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europes Copernicus programme.
An example demonstrated in a recent training session in Indonesia showed how the platform allows for rapid detection of changes in the location and scale of burned areas. Such information is of enormous use to track activities that affect greenhouse gas emissions.
This project underscores how FAO delivers value to member countries, providing them with the means to deliver sustainable results on their national climate and development plans, said Hiroto Mitsugi, Assistant Director-General for Forestry.
The new agreement between Norway and FAO will allow the scaling up of the platform and the procurement and distribution of high-resolution satellite imagery via the SEPAL platform. Together - with cooperating partners such as the World Banks Forest Carbon Partnership Facility - SEPAL will improve forest monitoring and contribute to REDD+ Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV), for countries progressing towards results-based payments for actions that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) as well as foster the conservation and sustainable management of forests.

Politics of a different ideology
The shadow of former Defence Secretary and Rajapaksa sibling Gotabhaya Rajapaksa looms large these days over the Sri Lankan political firmament. Not yet officially nominated as a candidate for the 2020 presidential elections, he appears to have assumed that role by default. Still, Rajapaksa found out last week that the publicity he generated made not be the type that furthers his cause.
The controversy began at an alms-giving conducted to mark Rajapaksas 69th birthday. All the politically active Rajapaksa siblings, Chamal, Mahinda and Basil were also in attendance. It is also noteworthy that some parliamentarians from the group of sixteen who recently left President Maithripala Sirisenas government- notably John Seneviratne, Dayasiri Jayasekara and Thilanga Sumathipala- were present on the occasion.
The Rajapaksas being always adept at courting the support of Buddhist monks, the anunayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, Wendaruwe Upali Thera was at hand to deliver a sermon. It was this sermon that raised eyebrows.
We need a leadership that is tied to the Sinhalese and Buddhists. However, we see that the dhamma is not functioning in the country. As a result, there is a crime wave. Therefore, the Maha Sangha feels the need for a just ruler. You have been called a Hitler. You must mend this country even if it means becoming a Hitler. Conduct a military rule if necessary and mend this country, Upali Thera said in his sermon, with Gotabhaya Rajapaksa seated in front of him.
The moral of the story is that, under normal conditions- such as the circumstances existing now- it would be almost impossible for a presidential candidate to win at first count without the support of the minority communities. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa never had much support from the minority communities. With the recent Hitler controversy, what little sympathy he had may have been lost. If that happens, it is partly his own doing because he hasnt been bold enough to categorically condemn Upali theras comments. He has had the opportunity to do so but has chosen not to do that. Whether this controversy is merely a storm in a tea cup or whether it transformsinto a political tsunamiremains to be seen
Excerpts of the sermon were broadcast on a private television network known to support the Rajapaksas. That was when the gravitas of what was said was felt in the Rajapaksa camp: Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was being compared to and urged to emulate a leader who was a ruthless dictator who was responsible for the genocide of over five million people, a leader of whom even the Germans are ashamed of.
Of course, Upali Thera would not have meant his remarks to be taken in a literal context. No one would expect Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, if elected, to embark on a genocidal spree or to open concentration camps. However, he was being portrayed as a strongman who brooked no nonsense and he was urged to go a step further if necessary- to set up military rule, if that was thought to be required.
Monks remarks
Critics of the Rajapaksas were quick to seize on the comments. President Maithripala Sirisena told a meeting in Nikaweratiya that, as a Buddhist he had the highest respect for the clergy but could not agree with the senior monk of the Asgiriya chapter who invited Rajapaksa to be a Hitler and establish military rule. The President said he was saddened by Upali Theras remarks.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he would have condemned the statement immediately if it had been made in his presence. There is no way Buddhism and Hitlers brutality can be reconciled, Wickremesinghe told a public meeting in Matara.
In a similar reaction, the German Ambassador in Colombo also condemned the monks remarks. Jorn Rohde said that he fully agrees with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes condemnation of the outrageous remarks made by Upali Thera.
The remarks only demonstrate that wearing a robe does not prevent individuals from issuing irresponsible and plain stupid statements. We need more democracy- not less- all over the world, the German envoy said.
Until these comments began to emerge, the Rajapaksa camp had remained silent regarding the remarks, perhaps hoping that, in a media saturated with news, it would be replaced by the next controversy without attracting much attention. That was not to be. The comments were already generating plenty of discussion and debate in social media.
Dayana Jayatilleka, political scientist and an ardent loyalist of the Rajapaksas was quick to realise the damage this could do to the potential candidacy of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Writing to the mainstream media he stated that I was more alarmed by what I saw and heard on TV news last evening than by anything I have seen or heard in the Sri Lankan media throughout my life. It would be the most dangerous public statement that could be uttered in any country in the world. Jayatilleka went on to add: let me be very clear. I am not saying that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa shares these views or will adhere to this sage counsel.
Clearly, the panic buttons were being pressed in the Rajapaksa camp. This issue had the potential to snuff out Gotabhaya Rajapaksas potential presidential election campaign even before it could begin. Faced with this prospect, it went in to damage control mode.
The anunayake thera concerned issued a statement. In his statement, Upali thera said that he only said some people compared Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to Hitler. I only asked him to develop the country. In governing a country, firm policies are required. I never wanted him to equal the barbaric administration of Hitler that annihilated people, he said, adding that his lengthy speech had been taken out of context by some politicians with vested interests.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa himself was confronted with questions about the issue. That was when he attended the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) this week to make a statement over an alleged misappropriation of government funds to build a monument for his parents. This followed an undertaking he gave to the Court of Appeal that he would provide such a statement.
Rajapaksa siblings
Emerging from the FCID after several hours of questioning, Rajapaksa said that those who have not fathomed the context of the sermon are making various comments. Im an ordinary person and not someone of importance. I dont know the reason for issuing so many statements over a sermon at a private function at my residence, Rajapaksa said. Critics have however pointed out that Rajapaksa has stopped short of condemning outright the remarks made by the thera or even dissociating himself from them.
A candidacy for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, most likely from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has yet to be formalised. However, he has emerged as the clear frontrunner among the Rajapaksa siblings for the task. Unfortunately for him, this controversy will make his task that much harder.
That is because victory at a presidential election requires over fifty per cent of the vote to win at first count. All previous presidential polls have been decided in this manner but all winners have had the support of the minority vote- except Gotabhayas brother Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2005 and in 2010.
In 2005, while Mahinda Rajapaksa didnt have the support of the minorities, he managed to engineer a boycott in the North and East that deprived Ranil Wickremesinghe of some 700,000 votes. Rajapaksas winning margin was a wafer thin 180,000 votes. In 2010, although Mahinda Rajapaksa did not have the support of the minorities, that did not matter as the poll was held in the aftermath of the war victory and the South voted overwhelmingly for him to offset the shortfall of votes in the North and East.
The moral of the story is that, under normal conditions- such as the circumstances existing now- it would be almost impossible for a presidential candidate to win at first count without the support of the minority communities. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa never had much support from the minority communities. With the recent Hitler controversy, what little sympathy he had may have been lost. If that happens, it is partly his own doing because he hasnt been bold enough to categorically condemn Upali Theras comments. He has had the opportunity to do so but has chosen not to do that.
Whether this controversy is merely a storm in a tea cup or whether it transforms into a political tsunami remains to be seen. However, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is learning that hard way that careless talk can not only cost lives, it can cost presidential aspirations as well.

Regional challenges, local derbys,  and skills on top!

June has proved to be more than competitive and a fair share of drama in the middle ...especially at home with the Milo Knockouts and hemisphere wide with some grinding performances by the worlds elite rugby nations.
Not much doubt about the depth and bench power of this new look All Blacks squad that is way past incredible.
Their 2nd half impact and clinical intensity, too much firepower for the expensive French revolution.
The Blacks intimidate from the Haka threat to the 80th minute. Ipso facto a blackwash v the French and bragging rights for many years to hail from the Eiffel Tower. The All Blacks really stride quite alone at that elusive altitude of pure adrenaline power.
Ireland stunned Australia and England won their last test v the resurgent Springboks ....Eddie Jones ambition for the IRB World Cup, very much a work in progress...
I believe Japan are still seeking consistency with their team on the summer circuit and huge interest in Asia about whom the world will welcome next from our corner of planet rugby.
Its still a risky toss up to rate Hong Kong or South Korea making that grade and scaling up the international ladder.
Closer to home its an All Saints Milo Knockout final under floodlights at the delightful Racecourse in Colombo 7.
Joes, the defending champions have grown in stature and confidence, and are very much the force to beat in this remarkable competition.
St Peters on the other side have been a few metres short all season.
The final we be relentless in every sense of the word...and given their league encounter, will go right down to the wire.
Both coaches ...Martis and Ibrahim, more than capable, but probably quite annoyed about the wafer thin line that separates the teams.
On the day ...in the middle, who will be more efficient and motivated
Will it be blue blood defence to the front or Bamba running skills that fly the flag
Leadership and decision making will be under the microscope...in fact will Peters repeat the league error in fighting shy to kick at goal...or will there be added kicking power via the FIFA World Cup and silky skills to inspire magic ...without the drama diving to win penalties
Looking forward to the confrontation and improved crowd control and behavior from the thousands of local faithful.
The Racecourse needs to be secured so all genuine rugby hearts can kick back and really enjoy the enthralling Milo Knockout 2018 final.
Experts will be seen and not quoted ... As it really boils down to whose got more fire in the belly....these Maradana defenders or the Bamba attackers
What splendiferous options of possibilities...what nerve wrenching opportunities....
Its a magnificent start 6.15pm.under lights on Junes penultimate cycle.
Much rhetoric and contemplation will be wasted on referees and anticipated whistle power...it must be said, and as a quiet aside .....we must arguably be the only playing nation on planet rugby that talks about referees and assistant skills, more than the team, players, strategic opportunities, psychology, injuries, prodigies and ground conditions....
Lets hope that changes ...where cheers and compliments replace ...jeers and insecurities.
Pressure on the TMO to get it right for a cracking finish.
Sri Lanka Rugby have a heap on their plate and desperately need to get our islanders performance platform absolutely right on the button.
There are huge priorities to be acknowledged and delivered as we strife boldly to tournaments around the globe.
On the very note lets hope our 7s trip to Paris, sharpens our game power and running skills before our Asian series expedition.
Time we confronted the Hong Kong ghost and exorcise that elusive force in the middle.
I for one join CEO Priyantha Ekanayake on that special victory platform...with the right intensity of prep and top opposition , our islanders understanding and performance under pressure....grow from being intimidated, to confidence, skill and finishing power....
Its everything to plan and implement, rather than hesitate and speculate.
The future is 7s and lots more skilled islanders winning for Sri Lanka.
Bula bula the islanders away from home and magical skills to elevate our world 7s ranking.
Vive la Sri Api!

The P3 GROWTHS Model, which is the model upon which the book has been written, was highlighted throughout the launch, and the ideas within the model on growing as people, and growing people was discussed in detail during the panel discussion.
The human body was presented as a leadership model, drawing parallels from the principles of the P3 GROWTHS model and the functions of our bodily organs.
At the end of the launch, the authors also presented a diagnostic tool, Transformational Quotient (TQ), a questionnaire that can help a leader ascertain their level of readiness to bring about transformation in their work.
This tool is based on insights from the P3 GROWTHS Model as well.

## Title: Satellite images show North Korea upgrading nuclear facility

Satellite images show North Korea upgrading nuclear facility

New satellite images show North Korea has made rapid improvements to the infrastructure at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center -- a facility used to produce weapons-grade fissile material, according to an analysis published by 38 North, a prominent North Korea monitoring group.
Captured on June 21, the photos reveal modifications to the site's plutonium production reactor and the construction of several support facilities -- long-planned upgrades that were already underway before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump met in Singapore earlier this month.
When contacted by CNN about 38 North's analysis, the Unification Ministry said they "cannot confirm the report" and are "watching it closely."
The report states that "continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea's pledge to denuclearize," but the photos suggest that Pyongyang continues to proceed with business as usual when it comes to maintaining its nuclear sites following the summit.
"No change is actually a pretty significant story ... this is still an active site producing plutonium for North Korea," according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
The images stand in stark contrast to Trump'srecent declaration that the North Korean regimeno longer poses a nuclear threat, even though the meeting produced no verifiable proof that North Korea will discontinue its nuclear program.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that North Korea remains a nuclear threat, but defended Trump's previous comment.
"I'm confident what he intended there was we did reduce the threat," said Pompeo. "I don't think there's any doubt about that. We took the tension level down."
"I think his point was a fair one," he added. "For the moment, we have reduced risk."
But Trump has repeatedly mischaracterized the nature of his deal with Kim, insisting last week that the North Korean dictator had agreed to begin "total denuclearization" right away.
In reality, the document he signed with Kim at their June 12 summit in Singapore only reiterated North Korea's previous commitment to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," and the new images released Wednesday align withDefense Secretary James Mattis' assessmentthat Pyongyang remains in a holding pattern as negotiators discuss the next steps in talks.
"The summit pledge is important, but it was not a written agreement that laid out what the North Koreans have to do -- that doesn't exist right now, so I'm not surprised they are continuing to operate their facilities," said Joel Wit, a Senior Fellow at the Stimson Center and Director of 38 North.
Adam Mount, a senior fellow and director at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed thatthe imagesindicate that North Korea will continue to support the foundation of its nuclear program until the two sides are able to agree on specific terms.
"Because Kim Jong Un has so far avoided making a commitment to halt research and development activities, the changes are not a success or failure of the diplomatic process, but simply a signal that North Korea's nuclear infrastructure remains fully in use," Mount said.
"That Yongbyon continues to receive scarce funds speaks to its continued value to the regime. There is little indication that North Korea has halted research, development, or production of nuclear systems even as talks continue," he added.
North Korea also maintains other nuclear facilities where they produce the bulk of their nuclear weapons materials and missiles. While these sites cannot be detected by monitoring groups, they are assumed to remain operational, according to Wit.
Trump has often pointed to the absence of North Korean missile and nuclear tests in recent months as a sign of progress toward denuclearization, but continued maintenance of facilities like Yongbyon show that talks with the US have not yet prompted Kim to take significant steps toward truly dismantling the foundation of his program.
"Both secret and Yongbyon facilities can continue operating and expand the fissile material stockpile," Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN.
"We have no way to stop this or verify any pledges to freeze," he said, noting that Kim has intentionally only agreed to freeze full blown testing, not production.
North Korea can also continue to improve its warhead and ballistic designs without conducting tests, Narang added.
"North Korea has had a decade-long nuclear testing sequence where they have presumably learned a lot about designs," he said. "They probably do not need full blown tests to go into serial production of warheads. And they can improve components and perfect designs with subcritical and hydrodynamic tests which we wouldn't be able to monitor or detect."
Ultimately, 38 North's analysis of these images provides a realistic look at the current state of North Korea's nuclear program amid talks with the US and the challenges facing negotiators tasked with achieving denuclearization -- a process for which Pompeo has refused to offer a timeline.
"We should remain skeptical that North Korea's nuclear calculus has changed dramatically. Every indication since the beginning of the year is that Pyongyang is seeking to exploit diplomacy to its advantage, including by continuing to improve its arsenal," Mount told CNN. "Halting a clearly-defined list of weapons activities should be the first step in negotiations."
"What is needed now is sustained and direct negotiations between the two sides on a framework for phased steps on denuclearization, as well as concrete steps toward a peace regime on the Korean peninsula," according to Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.
"So far, such a framework has not been established. In other words, there is no 'deal,'" he said.

Siva takes charge of  Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage
One of the finest rugby forwards of the mid 1980s Duraisamy Sivasubramaniam was elected as chairman of the Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage at their Annual General Meeting held last Saturday at the at the Orient Club. The previous committee under Dharshan Munasinghe from 2016/17 resigned to make way for the next OTRS Committee to establish themselves.
Siva, as he is popularly known was a top front row forward who sported Trinity College jersey in 1983, for the first time under the leadership of Ashan Ratwatte, and some of his first team mates were R. Gunasekara, Rohan Abeyakoon, D. Ratwatte, Hassan Ally, Manoj Jayatissa, J. Hadunge, J. Perera. In his first year he won his colors and the following year 1984 he led the side in five games when the regular captain was injured, and guided Trinity to win the Cannon R de Saram Shield against S. Thomas College.
That is the year he won the coveted Lion and it was the one and only award for that season. He played for Outstation Schools against Colombo Schools in the Gratiaen Cup and also for the Combined Schools XV. Straight from school he joined Kandy Sports Club and played for many years and also for Up-Country, and later was in the committee, as a committee member, treasurer, vice president and rugby chairman for well over ten years. It was under his chairmanship that Kandy SC won the first League title in 1994. He was involved with Kandy SC for nearly 25 years. He was also the Up Country Lions SC chairman. So, with his experience he is sure to continue the good work done by the past chairman.
New appointees to the Scrummage apart from the chairman are: Vice Chairmen: Adrain Basnayake, a prop forward and Channa Pathirana, a second row forward, Secretary: Dinesh Nugegoda played as a forward, Treasurer: Amil Ramanathan a good runner as wing-three-quarter. Filling the role as committee members are M.T.L.J. Perera a top full back, N.L.K. Ratnayake a talented wing-three-quarter, Jannindra Dunwuille hooked well during his days, Thaksala Hettiarachchi second row, Shalindra Wickramasiri a center, Murad Ramzeen third row forward and Hariss Omar a talented third row forward.
Old Trinitians Rugby Scrummage (OTRS) is an organization affiliated to the Old Boys Association of Trinity College Kandy and manages rugby across all age groups at the school under the guidance of the principal. It remains responsible in the areas of management, administration and coaching of rugby at Trinity. From the day, they started this Scrummage; it has been good for Trinity rugby in all forms of the game. The main object of the Scrummage is to promote the advancement and progress of rugby, within the means of the rugby Scrummage, in concurrence with the Principal, to enlist the support of the former rugby players of the school to Trinity College, foster fellowship among all former players and to raise funds in support of Trinity rugby.
Rugby Scrummage was the brainchild of Kenneth Boteju who played for Trinity in the late 1940s as a wing three quarter. Boteju started it around 1992 together with his friend Rajah Dabar Adihetty. He gathered around some former players including M.T.M. Zaruk, Dr. Robert Soujha, Dr. Abeyratne, Dr. Kenneth Gunawardena, Wilhelm Balthazar, Ken de Joodt. Dr. Robert Soujha was the first chairman with Dr. Kenneth Gunawardena as vice chairman, Kenneth Boteju as secretary, Dabar Adihetty as treasurer. With a fifteen member committee in the next few years many stalwarts like Jayantha Jayawardena, Jayantissa Ratwatta, Indrajith Balasooriya who travelled all the way from Matara for meetings joined in.
The aim was to help in all aspects of rugby, in an advisory capacity and financially wherever possible and also getting together and fellowship of all former players.
In those early years a few small projects were tried out to collect some money, mugs, ceramic wall-hangings of the Bradby Shield, etc. Later on the younger ex players took over the Committee.

Six EU countries to take  in stranded migrants
MALTA: Six EU countries have agreed to take in over 200 migrants stranded on a rescue ship off Malta's coast, French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday, after days of bickering between member states over their fate.
Each of the member states, which include France, Italy and Portugal, will take a few dozen individuals of the 233 migrants on board the Lifeline vessel, Macron said in Rome after talks with Pope Francis.
However, Macron also criticised the German NGO running the ship for contravening all the rules by coming to the migrants' rescue when the Libyan coastguard was already intervening.
We cannot permanently accept this situation, he said.
In the end we are playing into the hands of smugglers by reducing the risks of the journey.
Macron's comments came after Malta said it would only allow the migrants to land if fellow European Union countries took their quota.
The vessel's fate has hung in the balance since last week as bloc members remained at loggerheads over how to handle the influx of people trying to reach the continent.
The ship had rescued the migrants, including children and pregnant women, on Thursday but Malta and Italy initially refused to take them in.
However, Valletta agreed Tuesday to let the ship dock once other EU states confirmed they would help.
But Malta also warned it would launch an investigation and possibly take action against the Lifeline once it entered Maltese waters. The Lifeline NGO meanwhile said it had received a message from Malta on Tuesday still banning it from entering territorial waters.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini quickly hailed the news that a second migrant ship he had turned away would be taken in elsewhere.
Earlier this month, Rome rejected the Aquarius ship carrying 630 migrants, forcing it to eventually dock in Spain.
"For women and children really fleeing the war the doors are open, for everyone else they are not! Salvini tweeted. He has repeatedly warned foreign charities to stop rescuing migrants off Libya, insisting Italian ports are and will be closed to those who aid human traffickers.
The decision by Italys new hardline government and Malta to turn away rescue vessels has plunged Europe into a political crisis over how to collectively handle the huge numbers of people fleeing war and misery in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux earlier told RTL radio that a European solution seems to be emerging. He insisted there was no migrant crisis but urged leaders to respond quickly to an urgent situation. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also said Tuesday that Madrid would take part in a joint response over Lifeline, but several countries must participate.
Italy and Malta say they are unfairly bearing the brunt of the new arrivals, while other European countries are urging more forceful policies to block their entry.
During a surprise visit to Libya on Monday, Salvini called for processing centres to be set up in various unnamed African countries to deal with potential migrants in a move to help Libya as well as Italy block migration. - AFP

He joined SLIM in 2000 where he completed most of his marketing related studies. He was appointed the Charter President of the SLIM MBA Alumni and the Director of SLIM CPM Society. In 2013 he was elected to the Ex-Co of SLIM and moved up the ranks as Assistant Secretary, Secretary, Vice President and President.
I am a firm non-believer in having role models. My personal view is that there are leaders whom one can look up to and be inspired by, but one should not try to imitate them. It is important to understand your inner strength and develop yourself, said Edwqrd.
Pradeep Edward is the current CEO of Lanka Hospitals Diagnostics (Pvt.) Ltd. With over two decades of experience, out of which 15 years have been in the Managerial capacity and 8 in the level of General Manager and COO and CEO, his experience and knowledge makes him fit to lead the National Body for Marketing.
Expressing his views about marketing in Sri Lanka, Pradeep stated, similar to many other areas, Sri Lanka has alot of talent in the field of marketing as well, but we fail to achieve the mark at the final outcome. I have been involved in several judging panels of several awards and seen the magnitude of thinking that is behind the campaigns which come from our very own region.
The country lacks international exposure and the President of SLIM is proud to declare that SLIM is in the forefront in bridging this gap. We initiated this by bringing down Philip Kotler. Last year we had Ron 4

## Title: SOUND CHOICE!

SOUND CHOICE!
Sound is the vocabulary of nature. Through state-of-the-art equipment, he irons out defects to offer that ultimate listening experience. He has been communicating in this vocabulary with immense success for many years now. The numerous awards for best sound designer on his shelf are proof of his expertise. However he has been away working on numerous films when most of the awards have been announced.
I started off my stint with cinema when I joined the National Film Corporation in 2001 as a trainee. I encountered the field of sound designing there. Sarasavi Studios was converted into a digital colour lab in 2006. Indian Production Mixer and Sound Designer Baylon Fonseca trained us during this era. Fonseca has been the sound designer behind mammoth projects like Raees, Krrish 3, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Dostana, Billu etc. I developed an interest towards the field and began doing research on it. I even flew to Bangalore to engage in the technical training required for the process. I soon realized that I need some knowledge about the aesthetic side of the process too to give a quality output. Renowned directors like Prasanna Jayakody and Channa Perera helped me lot in this aspect. Prasanna Vithanage introduced me to the Indian sound designer Tapas Nayak and the Indian editing professional Sreekar Prasad. They have both worked with Mani Ratnam. I spoke with them and gained knowledge about the field, Sasika Ruwan Marasinghe shares memories and experiences from a journey he was destined to undertake.
Engaged in sound mixing for Dekala Purudu Kenek at AudioMagick Studio, Mumbai
Marasinghe won his first award in 2012 at the Derana Sunsilk Film Awards for Prasanna Jayakodys Karma. The award had been given to both him and his mentor Lionel Gunarathne. Next was the OCIC award for Indika Ferdinandos Ho Gana Pokuna (The Singing Pond) in 2016. Later he bagged the Best Sound Design Award for Malaka Devapriyas Bahuchithawadiya (The Undecided) at the Eighth SAARC Film Festival which was held recently this year.
Starting off with Rosa Mal Sayanaya, he has many popular films like Dedunu Akase, Heena Hoyana Samanallu, Aloko Udapadi, The Rainbow, Spandana, Mago Digo Dai, Parapura, Kalpanthe Sihinayak, Que Sera, Dekala Purudu Kenek, Ranja and many more to his name.

Receiving the Signis Salutation award 2016
Though sound designing involved creating sound tracks for various needs such as filmmaking, television production, theater, video game development and live performances, Marasinghe only handles filmmaking. He says that it is no childs play because a sound track needs to suit the genre of the movie as well as the particular action taking place in the scene.
For example the sound track for an epic film differs a lot from a film that is based in the modern society. I do not consider the fact that the film is a commercial or art production. My chore is to provide a background sound to enhance the visuals as well as to keep the audience engaged in the story. At times I have even used silence to convey the message, he noted adding that he has won his awards for three movies which represent three different genres.
He says that designing the sound for Bahuchithawadiya had been the toughest of the three. He has spent over one year designing and redesigning the tracks which had gone into the project.
One of the reasons why it took so long to make the tracks was that the male protagonist of the film spoke with a foreign accent. We had to spend a considerable span dubbing for him. We only used music at the end of the film but this was not evident when one watches the film, he explained.
Karma was the other tough project for which he had to provide sound.
I got involved with the project at the beginning of my career. Jayakodys storyline too demanded a lot from the sound department to drive home his message, he added.
He noted that sound directing is one of the key components which decides the success of a film. Only someone who has a lot of experience in the field can teach sound designing.
You encounter new challenges everyday because each project differs from the other. The storylines, time frames and directors are different. Therefore, their requirements too are different. At times the director might not agree with you on the sound design you choose for a particular scene. You need to learn to accept this and come to terms with a track that both of you are satisfied with for the end product, Marasinghe said.
Though the music director is in charge of the sounds in a song included in a film, Marasinghe says that as the sound designer, he has to look into its sound mixing process. He has a say in the expressions of the actors during their dubbing process too.
A product of Wedamulla Maha Vidyalaya and Gurukula Vidyalaya, Marasinghe hails from a family whose parents were into the technical field. He too has followed in their footsteps though in a different field.
He notes that the ability to detect the kind of sounds most suited for a particular visual comes with experience.
He or she needs to recognize the sounds in his or her surroundings first. For example if you come close to a waterfall, you realize that it is not only the sound of the water flowing that you hear. There are many other sounds in the backdrop which are almost drowned by the sound of the waterfall. Similarly, if you get a scene of a fire, it is not purely the sound of the raging fire that you hear. You get sounds like firewood crackling too. You need to identify each of these layers embedded in the episode. A person also needs to recognize the manner in which people can speak, Marasinghe elaborated on what it takes to make a successful sound designer.
He says that he admires the sound designs of the recent Bollywood film Raees and the Hollywood production Adrift. Though he has been the sound designer for films of various genres he says that he has not gotten the chance to provide sound for a science fiction film yet.
That is something I wish to tackle in the future. Watch as many good films as you can and learn from their sound designing. Do not merely listen to the noises in nature but learn to recognize each of their sounds. This will help you excel as a sound director, he advised.
Currently, he has his hands full with multiple projects. He is engaged in sound designing for Aruna Jayawardanas 1970 Love Story. He will also be working on Chathra Weeramans Ayu and Indika Ferdinandos unnamed project.

Sri Lanka, Japan sign grant  agreement under JDS
Following an exchange of notes signed between Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma and Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, a grant agreement under the Japanese Grant Aid for Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS) was signed on June 26 at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, to the tune of 265 million Japanese Yen (Rs. 374 million) between Dr. Samaratunga and JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Fusato Tanaka.
Concluding the signing, Dr. Samaratunga said, I see this as a good opportunity for our young officers to learn from Japan's vast experiences. This will help them build their individual capacities on strategic planning and implementation-related topics, which they are now dealing in their day-to-day work. Research findings and best practices they observed during their stay in Japan, will be quite useful to each organisation and individual.
The JDS scheme was introduced to the Sri Lankan Government in the year 2010, with the purpose of developing capacities of young government officials who are actively involved in the planning and execution of development policies.
Since its initiation, 122 government officials had been accepted for Master's and Doctoral Degree courses at Japanese universities, while another batch of 15 officials would depart to Japan later this year.
By applying to the JDS programme, participants under its study would have access to components such as public policy and public finance, economics, business-management, environmental studies, disaster-management and climate change.
Participants would also receive an opportunity to acquire knowledge on the latest financial theories and growth models besides social aspects such as labour and employment, child health, health equity, education, micro-finance, investments and even spreading to other new areas such as disaster risk-management on landslide and irrigation.
Other than its academic diversity and attractiveness, the JDS scheme is also renowned for its special characteristics in terms of preparations and amenities provided to its fellows.
By the end of the programme, it is expected that the total number of Sri Lankan Government officials who would receive fellowships from JICA would reach 188.

Set a target of 144 and resuming on the fourth day at the overnight position of 81 for five, Sri Lanka reached their goal for the loss of one additional wicket to become the first Asian team ever to win a Test match at Caribbean crickets most iconic venue.
That wicket, which fell in the very first over of the afternoon to West Indies captain Jason Holder, ushered in Kusal, whose further participation in the match was in serious doubt when he injured himself crashing into the advertising boards the previous night.

Both Kusal and Dilruwan had made only minimal contributions previously in the three-match series with the all-rounder Dilruwan having been dropped for the second Test while there was speculation that Kusal, the experienced but out-of-form opening batsman, would have been omitted from this final Test were it not for the suspension of regular captain Dinesh Chandimal for ball tampering in the previous match in St Lucia.
However they both played with great determination, weathering the storm from the West Indies fast bowlers in an unbroken seventh-wicket partnership of 63. Kusal finished unbeaten on 28 with Dilruwan on 23. It was Dilruwan who made the winning hit, hoisting Holder over mid-off for the boundary that sealed only Sri Lankas second Test victory in the West Indies.
Me and Kusal play for the same club so we know each other, said a delighted Dilruwan in savouring the victory. That experience and knowledge of each others games helped a lot because it was challenging. The pitch was bit uneven.
For Holder it was a cruel final twist of fate in a match in which he excelled all-around. His dismissal of Kusal Mendis, leg-before without adding to his overnight score of 25, was his fifth wicket of the innings and he finished with innings figures of five for 41 and a match analysis of nine for 59.
Holder also contributed a topscore of 74 in the West Indies first innings of 204 and was just one of four batsmen to get into double-figures when they crashed to 93 - their lowest-ever total in a Test innings in Barbados - on the third evening.
He was the obvious choice as Man of the Match, small consolation for his team failing to finish the job.
We just did not have enough runs in the second innings, Holder reflected. We missed some chances in the field but it wont put us down because we have a quick turnaround for the series against Bangladesh starting next week.
Despite that early success, which raised hopes for the West Indies mowing through the tail in the same manner of 24 hours earlier in Sri Lankas first innings, none of the other bowlers could match their skippers probing accuracy and penetration.
Shannon Gabriel failed to add to his series-leading tally of 20 wickets while the experienced Kemar Roach and seamer Miguel Cummins lacked potency when it was most needed for the home side to clinch their first series victory in six years against a team ranked higher than themselves.
Our second innings bowling won us the game, said Sri Lanka coach Chandika Hathurusingha. We always had hope but the way the game progressed we were under pressure. Credit to all four bowlers. Suranga (Lakmal) led from the front.
Charged with the responsibility of leadership for the first time at senior international level, Lakmal could not disguise the delight at his teams achievement.
I didnt expect to be made captain but I thought it was a good opportunity to lead and I took it, he said. Im happy with my contributions but all the bowlers did very well. AFP

Sri Lankan Tamil, two sons found dead in Chennai
A 38-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil man and his two sons, aged six and four, were found dead in their house at Maduravoyal, Chennai, on Tuesday (26).
Police suspect that the man, identified as Habib Rahman, had killed his sons by forcing them to drink poison and proceeded to commit suicide by doing the same. However, police did not find any suicide note in the house.
Rahmans estranged wife is living in Sri Lanka. Neighbours last saw Rahman and his children on Sunday (24) and the house had been locked from inside since.
As there was no response when they knocked on the door on Tuesday morning, neighbours had alerted Maduravoyal Police.
Police broke open the door and found the bodies of the trio. The cadavers were sent to the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for a postmortem. (The Times of India)

Sweden power into World Cup  last 16 by beating Mexico
Yekaterinburg, Wednesday: Sweden surged into the last 16 of the World Cup with a deserved 3-0 victory on Wednesday over a poor Mexico side, who still qualified ahead of Germany after the holders loss to South Korea.
The Swedes went through to the knockout rounds as the unlikely winners of Group F, taking the beaten Mexicans with them.
Second-half goals from defenders Ludwig Augustinsson and Andreas Granqvist, from the penalty spot, plus a comical own goal were reward for a physical display from Sweden, who only made it to Russia by beating Italy in the play-offs.
They and Mexico, who were ragged throughout, will next play whichever two teams emerge out of Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia in Group E, which concludes later on Wednesday.
Mexico came into the game at the Yekaterinburg Arena in the driving seat in a group where all four teams, including South Korea, could qualify, but they appeared the more nervous.
It took them less than 30 seconds to make their mark on Sweden, Jesus Gallardo earning a yellow card for clattering into Ola Toivonen almost straight from kick-off.
Goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa handled outside the box and then flapped at the resulting free-kick. On 12 minutes Marcus Berg clipped wide from close range with a bicycle kick.
On the quarter-hour mark, Mexico, who had the overwhelming support inside the stadium, should have taken the lead when Carlos Vela found himself in space on the edge of the box.
His bending left-footer shaved the post, catapulting a few sombreros off the heads of Mexico fans as they expectantly sprang to their feet.
They were up again on 30 minutes when referee Nestor Pitana of Argentina took a look at a video replay when the ball hit Mexico striker Javier Hernandez on the arm in the box. After lingering at the pitch-side monitor, then going back for a second glance, Pitana ruled it no penalty -- the Mexicans celebrated as if they had scored a goal.
The Swedish players and coach Janne Andersson were furious, and understandably -- Hernandez appeared to move his arm towards the ball.
Sweden, with their greater physicality, were on top, but Mexico were dangerous on the break.
At the interval, with the game also goalless in Kazan, Mexico and Germany were going through.
Sweden badly needed a goal and five minutes after half-time they deservedly got it, defender Augustinsson popping up from left-back to volley in.
There was more drama on the hour, as Hector Moreno brought down Berg in the box and skipper Granqvist held his nerve in front of the massed ranks of Mexicans to bury his penalty.
Plastic beer cups rained down, before Mexico defender Edson Alvarez compounded a miserable evening with a 74th-minute own goal when he miskicked past Ochoa.
That left Mexico in a perilous position, as a late German winner would have sent the Central Americans crashing out, but two injury-time South Korean goals in Kazan ensured Juan Carlos Osorios men edged through as runners-up.
Mexico will need to pick themselves up quickly if they are to go beyond the last 16 for the first time since 1986 and end a run of six consecutive second-round defeats.

Treasure trove seized from Najib properties
MALAYSIA: A vast trove of items seized in raids on properties linked to Malaysias scandal-mired former leader, including cash, jewellery and luxury handbags, are worth up to $273 million, police said Wednesday.
The searches, part of investigations into scandal-hit sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, netted 12,000 pieces of jewellery, bags containing almost $30 million in cash across 26 different currencies, more than 400 watches worth $19.3 million, and other high-end designer goods.
I think this is the biggest seizure in Malaysian history, said Amar Singh, the polices head of commercial crime investigations, after officials completed the mammoth task of counting up all the items they uncovered in raids around Kuala Lumpur last month.
He said the items were worth between 910 million ringgit ($225 million) and 1.1 billion ringgit ($273 million).
The official salary of Najib Razak, the former premier, while in office was 22,827 ringgit ($5,670) a month.
Allegations of massive corruption were a major factor behind last months shock election loss of Najibs long-ruling coalition to a reformist alliance headed by Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib and his cronies were accused of plundering billions of dollars from 1MDB to buy everything from US real estate to artworks. Najib and the fund deny any wrongdoing.
His luxury-loving wife Rosmah Mansor became a lightning rod for public anger due to her vast collection of handbags and jewels, and her reported love of overseas shopping trips.
The mind-boggling collection of luxury items listed by police will increase public anger at the former first couple, whose spendthrift ways came to symbolise the decadence and rot in the Barisan Nasional coalition which had ruled the country uninterrupted since independence from Britain in 1957.
The items were seized in raids on six premises linked to Najib, including luxury apartments in Kuala Lumpur and his main residence in an upmarket part of the city.
The huge collection of jewellery included 1,400 necklaces and 2,200 rings. The most expensive item of jewellery was a necklace, which was estimated to be worth 6.4 million ringgit ($1.5 million) Amar said.
A total of 567 handbags were also seized, including 272 Hermes bags, worth 51.3 million ringgit, police said, adding that the values of the other handbags were still being calculated.
A total of 423 watches worth a total of 78 million ringgit were also discovered, along with 234 pairs of sunglasses.
New Prime Minister Mahathir, who has just started his second stint as premier at the age of 92, has reopened investigations into 1MDB which were shut down by Najib, and has vowed the former leader will be charged.
Since their election loss, Najib and Rosmah have been questioned by anti-graft investigators over allegations that money linked to the state fund ended up Najibs bank accounts.

THE VOICE OF Generation X
When I was twenty-four a friend and I spent three nights in Khao San Road, Bangkok, mingling with young Westerners with long hair, tattoos, a wide variety of accents and one particular book in their hands - (a book I too had in my backpack  a graduation gift from my father). That book helped us make new friends. A German girl in torn jeans who saw me holding the book told us she had ripped through it in about three days; her friend said he had just finished it. The next day a Cambridge University student kept a finger on the page she was reading and said she was a quarter way through the story, and that her traveling companion planned to read it next.
Staying true to the laws that governed the book - the incurious nature of backpackers - even though we talked a lot with our new friends (about books ,food, places to visit etc) we did not inquire about their lives because Richard, the protagonist of the book we were all reading, didnt do it either. He confesses on one page, Id spent countless hours talking to Keaty, and the only thing I knew about his background was that he used to go to Sunday school. But I didnt know if he had brothers or sisters, or what his parents did, or the area of London where he grew up  The only talking topic that stretched beyond the circle of cliffs was travel  Even now, I can still reel off the list of countries that my friends had visited...
If you are a bookworm and between the ages of 35 and 50, you would probably have guessed what this is all about. If you are a movie buff and familiar with Leonardo DiCaprio, you probably remember the movie made from the book in which Leonardo dressed in a pair of beach shorts, jumps off cliffs and falls in love with a French girl.
But, in case you happen to be one of the dozen people left on this small planet who are not familiar with this book of all books, Alex Garlands debut novel, The Beach, you might still want to know something about it, though much has changed since it was first published way back in 1996.
The story begins when Richard, a twenty-something Brit, arrives on the famous Khao San Road  the first stop on the well-trodden backpackers trail. On his first night, the man in the room next to him slits his wrists and leaves Richard with a map to a mysterious beach. Back in the days when there were no Google maps to guide him, along with a French couple, he sets out to find this supposed paradise, where a select community is trying to create their own version of utopia. When they finally arrive, having survived a harrowing swim and some AK-47 toting marijuana farmers, the new visitors are welcomed rather uneasily. I dare not tell you more lest I spoil the story. But if you have read the Heart of Darkness and the Lord of the Flies you would probably be able to guess the rest.
Keep in mind though, that the book is a sort of antitheses of anything written by Conrad or Golding. This is because Alex Garland has a knack for seeing and expressing things in a very understandable way, and this is no doubt part of his appeal to young readers who are turned off by the so-called classic yet impenetrable authors. Garland knows this, and says, I think if you asked the average literary editor whether they thought my work was equitable with Salman Rushdies, they would say no. Well, thats not something that bothers me very much and I doubt very much that it bothers Salman Rushdie.
Having written only three novels so far, he wrote Beach when he was twenty-three, The Tesseract when he was twenty-seven and more recently, The Coma, Garland is humble enough to confess he has clay feet. Especially when it comes to writing dialogue. He says he tried to overcome this weakness by studying other writers. There were a few writers who I took off the shelves simply to, on a technical level, look at how they did it. One of them was Ishiguro, another one was Ballard. Ballard often would not do any attribution of dialogue. It would just be by proximity of the last person mentioned that you would figure out who was speaking. And Graham Greene, I think it was, he said, she said every line, and that fascinated me, because it didnt feel like repetition. The word said, why didnt it feel like repetition Why does your brain not register it Very mechanical things like that. And I ended up modeling a section of the dialogue in this first book I was writing, The Beach, on a section of dialogue in Ishiguros work because Id been looking at it to see how he did it, and I modeled it in a self-conscious way.
And the best thing is, Ishiguro didnt mind, explains Garland and had no objections to Garland writing the movie script for his novel Never Let Me Go.Its this kind of thing you get asked, sub-editors or commissioning editors at newspapers are constantly trawling for new people to drop into their paper to feed the incredibly voracious writing rate that those mediums required, so I got asked, Will you write about your favorite book Youre a new novelist. Whats your favorite book So I did it about an Ishiguro novel and mentioned that I had stolen this thing, and Ishiguro then wrote me a nice letter, and we had coffee, and became pals.
Born in 1970, Alex Garland is the son of the well-known and respected political cartoonist, Nick Garland. Growing up in a middle-class and intellectual background, he graduated from Manchester University with a degree in History of Art, and was planning on following in his fathers footsteps before he changed his mind. I understood enough about drawing to see my precise limitations. So, I ditched the pictures and just stuck with the words. From then on he turned his attention to fiction, and started writing The Beach drawing on his many experiences of traveling (he first went to India when he was 17, on a school trip, and he now makes several visits to South East Asia per year.)
The Beach was brought out in 1996, with no big promotional push from the publishers, yet within a year, it was a best seller. Rave reviews everywhere from The Mail On Sunday to the New York Times certainly did no harm, but predominantly it was word of mouth that made The Beach a success. Only three years after he first put pen to paper, Garland was being heralded as the new voice of Generation X and making Vogues most eligible bachelors list.
Yet, for all this publicity he is media shy and has a very low-key approach to what he does. There is a business side to writing and if you dont sell books then publishers wont print them. Youre only as hot as your last novel. I think you can reach a point when youre not as good as your last novel, you may have written one or even two bad books in a row, and the publishers will hang onto you. But you need to have proved yourself in a long term way before that and I certainly havent done that yet. I still feel like Im doing an incredible bluffing trick and Im going to get caught out.
Not yet. In his third novel, The Coma which has also been turned into a movie, he got his father, to do all the illustrations. When asked what it was like working with his father Garland gives the answer most of us who are the offspring of artists are so familiar with. I cant put the qualities of his work into words. I just know that hes a more talented and dedicated artist than Ill ever be. As for what it was like working with him, it was basically easy. I knew how to play to his strengths, because I grew up watching him do this stuff. The only real difficulties wed get would be because I would on occasion dramatically revert to being a stroppy adolescent, and start yelling about something or another. But he was well used to me being an idiot, so it all worked out okay in the end.
With many more miles to go as a novelist and scriptwriter cum movie director, Garland has the following advice for first-time writers.
Show people your stuff, listen carefully to their responses, but ultimately dont value anyones opinion above your own. Be influenced by writers you dislike as well as writers you like. Read their stuff to figure out whats wrong. Find a balance between the confidence that allows you to continue, and the self-critical facility that enables you to improve. Get the balance wrong on either side, and youre screwed.

Ivor Dennis was Sri Lankas golden icon of music for over 50 years. Ivors meeting with his mentor Sunil Shantha resulted in a friendship between the two men that changed Ivors life and cemented his position as one of the musical greats in Sri Lanka. Both men had an identical voice and Sunil Shantha saw something of himself in Dennis. He saw the young mans potential for greatness.
Dennis was born in 1932 and passed away at the age of 86 last week and has left behind him a huge following and unforgettable memories that cannot be erased because of the impact he has made in Sri Lankas musical history. He released a CD 11 years ago with 15 of his new songs in 2007.
Dennis, a proud product of Maris Stella and Loyola College started his career around 1956 became incredibly successful with his talent, hard work and a bit of luck.
Fate played its hand in Dennis life when Shantha heard him sing one of his songs over the radio. When still at school Dennis took part in a program for amateur singers on the radio and sang Sunil Santhas Waren Heensare, Redee walawe that was when Shantha happened to hear him.
Sunil Shantha, one of the finest singers that Sri Lanka produced thought it was actually him singing and was bewildered and amazed to learn that it was someone else. Like the prince searching for the woman whose foot would fit in the glass slipper Shantha dispatched a friend to Seeduwa in search of Dennis and that was how Dennis began a career that made history. He invited Dennis to join him. Dennis was delighted since Shantha was one of his idols. Shantha from there onwards guided Dennis teaching him the ways of music. Right throughout his life Dennis would recall his encounter with his guru with great love and warmth. By joining hands with Shantha, Dennis changed the course of history in Sri Lankan music. It was at Sunil Shanthas house in Ja Ela, that a current started up that would change the lives of many.
Dennis was quick to rise to heights of greatness. It was in that year 1986 that he won first place in an international singing competition organized by the Asian Broadcasting Union in New Zealand. The Cultural Ministry delighted in their discovery of this musician who showed rare talent awarded him the Desha Nethru award.
Dennis life was not about making money and entertaining himself. He was at heart a man who dedicated his life to the service of others. The church was where his heart was. He was the happiest when he sang for his faith. Dennis became famous but sang for the love of it much like Stevie Wonder or John Denver.
The world has changed a lot since the golden days of Ivor Dennis. Now we have so many musical reality shows. But still Dennis is remembered with fondness and love. Dennis too on many occasions has commented on the talent out there. In fact Dennis is amazed at how their careers are made  through SMS. During his days his career did not depend on the number of SMS he got! He made it to the top on his own steam.
Dennis during his life time was legendary and was sought after by many people. The giant of dance Premasiri Khemadasa too contacted Dennis. He was a key singer in Premasiri Khemadasas operas, Manasawila and Pirinivan Mangallaya. He sang in Khemdasa Masters cassette Raja Weda. He worked with W D Makuloluwa in Depano and Pahanin Pahana. Dr Lester James Peries debut Rekawa and Sandeshaya added to Ivors fame for he was the singer of the lyrics by late Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody, for which the music was composed by Sunil Shantha.When Dennis passed away he was a man at peace with the world and himself.

Weerasinghes perseverance earned him Germanys fourth biggest logistics company
He always had a dream to study and work overseas but never imagined that his dream would lead him towards owning Germanys fourth biggest logistics company Transline GmbH Transprote & Pakete.
Hailing from the deep South in Matara, Kapila Indika Weerasinghes long lasting lust turned into a reality when he got the opportunity to study in Russia. Accountancy was his much loved profession and after a two year stint in Russia he moved to Bonn, Germany to gain employment.
He was drone from place to place doing odd jobs in restaurants, bars, supermarkets and finally settled down in a delivery company as a delivery boy in 2002. Having learnt the subtle points of the profession he observed that he could earn more and decided to seek a Sub Agency of this own courier company.
Kapila Indika Weerasinghe
Leaning the fine art of the business he then quit the company and started his own logistics company and with the business expanding hired two more hands and also bought a van for speedy delivery. Many leading courier companies in Europe too recognized him and awarded several Sub Agencies, mainly due to his on time delivery and competitive rates.
The company was expanding rapidly and he then moved to Dusseldorf and opened his first warehouse investing 50,000 Euro which was his life time savings.
After six years of opening his first Sub Agency with just three employees and one van he acquired , Transline GmbH Transprote & Pakete with 100 employees and a 80 vehicle fleet delivering over 6 ,000 parcels daily all over the world. The company also maintains and annual growth of 12.5% and today is ranked among the fourth largest logistic company in Germany.
Delivery van stolen
He said that he could expand more but finding staff is one of his major concerns. Looking back I can say that I reinvested in my business at the right time and also took calculated risks which never failed.
Recalling an unforgettable incident he said that one of his employees had left the delivery van with the engine running in Bonn and had gone to drop a parcel at a store when he returned after few minutes the van was stolen.
More than the van what mattered was the loss of over of 400 parcels which were in it and had to pay compensation for it. Since the driver had left the engine running under German law I could not claim insure as well. I lost around 140, 000 Euro from this incident.
Settled down in business and married to a Sri Lankan whom he met in Germany Weerasinghe wants to give something back to Sri Lanka.
Bail out City Finance
It was during this time that my brother in Sri Lanka told me about the defunct City Finance Corporation and how the depositors were finding it hard to survive as all their life savings were deposited in it. I decided to bail out this company and decided to set aside Rs. 500 million for it.
While I was planning the best model to bail out City Finance I was also introduced to K. Gamage Leelananda CEO, Lanka Credit and Business Ltd (LCBL) a leading lending institution in down South. This was Sothern Provinces only registered Finance company, which was doing a yeomen service to the SME sector. After several discussions I decided to join LCBL and acquire City Finance and merge it with LCBL.
We met Central Bank (CBSL) officials 30 to 40 times and after discussions and negotiations got all approvals and acquired City Finance.
Initially LCBL made a capital infusion of Rs. 565.0 million. LCBL also reached an agreement with CBSL to repay existing deposit liabilities and accrued interest up to March 2017 within two years in three tranches, 10% of deposits and interest liabilities were settled by end May, 45% of deposits and interest liabilities on or before 30th April 2019 and balance 45% on or before 30th April 2020. Interest for the existing deposit liabilities will be paid at 4% per annum on a monthly basis according to CBSL advice.
The LCBL has proposed to change the name of the company and it was rebranded as LCB Finance Limited after the merger of the two companies. We are now looking to obtain listing in the Colombo Stock Exchanges on or before 31.03.2020.
He said that Sri Lanka needs more exports and LCB Finance is keen to assist SME enterprisers in this direction.
Advice to youngsters
He said that looking back his success can be attributed to focusing in one line of business rather than diverting from it. One of the first things a youth should do when going overseas is getting thorough with the countrys native language and also have some local qualification in country where he or she is.
When you are armed with this you must then save and think about a business avenue and then concentrate in it.
He also said that one must also reinvest at the proper time and most importantly study the competitors and new industry trends.
Today I have competition from several small time online companies and to overcome this I also offer similar services. One must not think and rest that I have now reached the peak in my business and I can rest now.

Will South Korean Universities see return  of North Korean studies
Last month, a Seoul-based bank found itself in the centre of public criticism. In a job advertisement for a North Korean expert, the bank said candidates should have either a Ph.D. in a relevant field or have earned more than $55,000 per year at a previous job.
The bank explained that since the position it was looking to fill required professional knowledge and experience in North Korea, it was necessary for candidates to have a higher degree in the field. The bank added that it believed those who have made more than $55,000 have the equivalent qualification.
Despite the banks explanation, it did not stop public criticism that the amount of money one earns has no connection with his or her ability or qualification. It is unclear whether the bank has been able to fill the vacancy.
Divided for 70 years
This case is just one of a common trend that has been seen in South Korea recently. More and more companies are looking to hire so-called North Korean experts amid expectations of an improved inter-Korean relationship as they hope to benefit from reduced tensions. The issue seems to be, however, that companies do not know whom to hire and based on what qualifications.
This is related to the lack of institutions in South Korea for people develop their knowledge in North Korean studies.
Some might wonder why South Koreans need to study North Korea. After all, they both speak the Korean language and both nations were formerly united as one entity.
Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, has the answer. Although they are the same people, they have been divided for 70 years, and therefore their systems, ideologies, and cultures are all different, Nam noted.
Though there are differences based on curriculum, North Korean studies is usually categorized to include North Korean language, history, economy, politics, international relations, and inter-Korean relations as well as cooperation. Domestic universities first launched North Korean studies majors in the mid-1990s.
Seoul-based Dongguk University was the first to introduce such a major at its undergraduate school in 1994. It was followed by Myongji University in 1995, Catholic Kwandong University in 1996, Korea University in 1997, Chosun University in 1998, and Sun Moon University in 1998. They started a sudden boom in North Korea studies.
Strained inter-Korean relations
However, these glory days did not last long. Due to the sudden increase in supply, universities struggled to find students to take. The strained inter-Korean relations also did not help.
Chosun University closed its major within a year, while Catholic Kwandong University did the same in 2006. Myongji University, Sun Moon University, and Korea University merged their majors into other relevant departments, including international relations or political science studies.
As of the end of May 2018, only two higher educational institutions were operating North Korean studies as a separate major, namely Dongguk University and the University of North Korean Studies. However, the latter only offers graduate-level studies.
As mentioned above, strained inter-Korean relations are often blamed for the dearth of North Korean studies programmes. As inter-Korean relations rapidly deteriorated in the late 2000s, the demand for professionals with relevant knowledge naturally decreased as well. For instance, Hyundai Asan, which had carried out business with the North such as tours of Mount Kumgang, reduced its staff from about 1,080 to 260 after 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot a South Korean tourist during the tour.
The Ministry of Unification hires professionals specializing in North Korean matters, but only about two people a year have been recruited. As it became difficult for graduates of North Korean studies to find a job, fewer students wanted to major in the subject.
Some also blame a South Korean government initiative that implemented a restructuring of uncompetitive universities. Over the past few years, the government has been actively pushing this initiative by evaluating universities across the country.
Those who fail to meet its criteria are hit with penalties, including a suspension of subsidies or, in the worst case, the closure of the university itself.
One of the main criteria is the employment rates of graduates and acceptance rates of first-year students, which universities with a North Korean studies major have struggled to increase.
Korea Higher Education Research Institutes Lim Eun-hee said that a long-term approach and view is needed for the government and universities to operate and nurture North Korean studies. She noted that it is essential to prepare for increasing cooperation between the two Koreas amid improving inter-Korean relations. How things actually play out on this front, though, remains to be seen.
