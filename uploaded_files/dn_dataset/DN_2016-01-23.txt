An Anthonian cricket revival
As one of the first schools to play the game, St Anthony's College Katugastota has a great cricketing heritage, producing many exceptional cricketers over the past 109 years. The Antonians history has been so rich in the cricket field, that it requires a book with many chapters to do justice to all the proud cricketers who have emerged from that institution.
Their most looked forward game is against Trinity College. The first encounter was played at the Bogambara grounds in March 1914 with the Antonians winning the game. Sad, to say in the last two or three year's Antonian cricket has not been what it was and what it should be. They are now playing in division II.
The old boys give their best support but there is something wrong down the line. According to some old boys who love cricket and support cricket, the down fall is that there is no good coordination, between the team and the officer of the school who is in charge of the sport. Now it is the right time to show him the exit door from cricket. At one time the Antonians had the best cricket lovers to be in charge of the game.
The present principal Rev. Fr. Henry Wijeratne is trying his best to bring cricket back to the position where it was together with their cricket wing. The side is formidable which includes most of last season's players. A Kaniska Ugalpaya leads the side with Mohamed Alfer as the vice captain. Old boy Prasad Ranawake is the coach. At one time they were a major force in school cricket.
This Katugastota school has not only produced several champion teams but have also produced some of the finest cricketers who have done the school, Kandy and the country proud with their achievements - the greatest of them being Muthiah Muralitharan.
Their matches for the current season are against Kalutara Vidyalaya sponsored by Group 99, v S. Thomas' College Mt. Lavinia by Group 93, v Kingswood by Zaharan and Simry, v Dharmaraja by Group 2000, v SDS Jayasinghe, v St. Benedict's by SACKOBA Qatar, v St.Peter's by Hassan, v Sri Priyaratana by Anto Aus group 92, v St. Xavier's by Group of 98, and Big Match by Group 80.
Seetha Devi does well at hockey
Seetha Devi Balika Vidyalaya, which is housed along Peradeniya Road next to Kingswood College, pocketed another trophy, winning the Royal College inter-schools Sevens. In the final they beat Bishop's College by 4 goals to nil.
The team is led by goalkeeper Sakunthala Illepieruma, who was adjudged the best goal keeper of this tournament and Sahehani Fernando who was adjudged the player of the tournament. The champion team comprised players like Gimahanu Tiharaka, Charuka Abeyartne, Tharaki Paranagama, N. Pareenthan, Sakunthala Illeperuma (Capt), Thamali Dissanayake, Bashini Fernando, Charuka Abeyartne, Niranjana Ettipola, Teacher in charge Pushpa Rajakaruna who together with the principal has give the game of hockey the best support.
M.A.M. Ashroff is the coach.
Kandy Garden Club AGM
The 137th Annual General Meeting of the Kandy Garden Club was held recently. This was a club which gave a big hand for Lawn Tennis at one time and took part in the All Island inter club tennis tournament, and also had some top class players. They also fielded a veteran's team.
Later Municipal Commissioner late D.H. de Silva gave a big hand for tennis as a coach and promoter and he is the one who got more courts with the help of then mayor late Thilak Ratnayake. It was D.H. de Silva who introduced floodlights and started training young up and coming tennis players at these four courts. These tennis players made a name for themselves and Kandy.
At the AGM Samantha Uduwella was elected as the president with Dr. Anura Danthanarayan as the vice president, Aynoni Senanayake secretary, Benny Perera treasurer, Dr. Chaminda Ekanayake bar secretary and Ravi Ramanathan and tennis secretary. There are some hard workers in the general committee including Nimal Peiris.
Shehan Pathirana's matter settled by SLRFU
With reference to the official complaint made by Havelock Sports Club on Shehan Pathirana representing Kandy Sports Club in the Rugby League match between Kandy SC and CR & FC the Disciplinary Committee, of the SLRFU has completed the inquiry.
The letter from the Chairman Disciplinary committee says the complaint has been dealt with and inquiries held on 31 December, 2015 and 8 January 2016. The Disciplinary committee having carefully considered all available evidence has found him not guilty of any violation.
Four schools from Kandy to play in 7's
Vidyartha College, Dharmaraja College, Kingswood College and Trintiy College have been grouped in groups A,B,C and D for the inter school rugby sevens which is expected to kick off on January 30 in Colombo. St. Sylvester's College has to prove themselves in the weekend's division two seven-a-side tournament.
As already reported St. Anthony's College has pulled out of the tournament due to injuries. Of the Kandy schools Trinity and Dharmaraja are in top form. Kingswood and Vidyartha Colleges too are blessed with good players, and with their new coaches should prove themselves.
Kandy Cricket to be revived at club level
Newly elected president of Sri Lanka Cricket Thilanga Sumathipala is keen to give a hand to bring Kandy's club cricket to its former glory. He should advice the people to bring in new faces and hold the AGM which has not been held for the last several years. People who take office at KDCA should be able to attract sponsors and run the tournaments. Today they expect everything from the controlling body. In the good old days it was not so and the people who served in the committee were capable of promoting the game.
Dream cricket
Dream cricket ambassador from Australia Rick McCarthy is in Sri Lanka and is expected to play a dream cricket tournament in Kandy on February 4, after their match on January 30 in Jaffna. According to Rotarian B.D. R. "Suri' Rajan this dream cricket for disabled will be organized by the Rotary Club and it is going to be a full day's cricket carnival.
Lakshman to start cricket coaching
Lakshman Panditaratne, former St. Anthony's College and Kandy cricketer is now a coach who is well known for his good cricket coaching knowledge. He is expected to come out with a cricket coaching and developing project to help the beginners at cricket.
The program will cover areas such as qualities of a player, consistency, commitment, confidence, focus, match preparation, talent identification, physical fitness and the ultimate goal of a school cricketer.
It will be conducted for players between Under 13 to 17 years together with their parents in order to create awareness among all stakeholders to understand the objective of indulging in cricket as a schoolboy.
New principal Nelum to give sports a fillip
The new principal of 125-year-old Hillwood College Nelum de Alwis, who took over from Sudarshani Hettige is all out to give her best to sports with the help of the vice principals Asha Vidanapathirana and Anusha Praesody and the rest of the staff who are involved in sports.
Their main old girls association and the branches give a big hand for sports promotion.
Hillwood College encourages their pupils to take part in sports, like tennis, which was perhaps the first game introduced at the school and netball which was played for a number of years with the players in Kandyan saree.
The other sports they promote are swimming, basketball, volleyball, hockey, chess and athletics. Stoolball was yet another of the games played by the Hillwoodians, and was a favorite game.
It is no longer played, but they are keen to bring the sport back.
The founders of the school and all succeeding principals realized the importance of sports and gave due weight age to the physical development of the child.

Australia's O'Donnell sets new one hour record
ADELAIDE, FRIDAY: Australian cyclist Bridie O'Donnell broke the world hour distance record for women on Friday, eclipsing the previous one by more than 600 metres.
Cycling Australia confirmed on Twitter that O'Donnell had "set a new #UCIHourRecord of 46.882km" for the gruelling velodrome event.
"I can't believe I broke a world record," the 41-year-old said after getting off her bike and hoisting it above her head at the Super-Drome in Adelaide.
The previous record for distance ridden in 60 minutes by a woman was 46.274 kilometres set by American Molly Shaffer Van Houweling in Mexico in September.
O'Donnell said she had been nervous the day before the event, but had felt a lot more "calm and ready" as she prepared to race on Friday.
She kept to her plans for pacing herself for the sprint against the clock, and said she focused on what she was doing despite the pain.
"How you feel is kind of irrelevant, you just have to have confidence in the plan," she said.
O'Donnell, a doctor, has represented Australia at three UCI Road World Championships but said it was a matter of finding the right event for her.
"I wanted to do something great," she said, adding that she felt the record was a good start.
Ahead of the event, she said that her bid was as much psychological as physical.
"It's about planning and preparation and logistics and training and then certainly enacting the plan the best way you can," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Van Houweling was among the first to congratulate the Australian, tweeting: "Very impressive new #UCIHourRecord".

Cook, Amla share double century stand before England fight back
CENTURION, FRIDAY: Debutant Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla shared a double century partnership for South Africa before England fought back on the first day of the fourth and final Test at SuperSport Park on Friday.
Cook made 115 and Amla hit 109 in a South Africa total of 329 for five at the close of play.
The pair put on 202 for the second wicket before Amla's dismissal sparked a collapse in which four wickets, including that of Cook, fell for 36 runs.
Cook, called up at the age of 33 when the South African selectors finally opted for a specialist opening batsman to partner Dean Elgar, was calm and organised from the start of his 218-ball innings during which he hit 14 boundaries.
Amla, four months younger than Cook but 91 matches richer in Test experience, was back to his fluent best as he reached his century off 131 deliveries with 18 fours.
Hashim Amla stroked his 25th Test century as he and new cap Stephen Cook batted South Africa into a strong position on the first day of the fourth and final Test against England at SuperSport Park on Friday.
Amla made 102 not out and Cook was unbeaten on 91 as South Africa reached 224 for one at tea. The pair's second wicket partnership was worth 189 at the interval.
Cook, 33, displayed the old-fashioned virtues of a specialist opening batsman. He left alone balls that threatened danger outside the off stump and was strong off his legs, punctuated by the occasional firm drive through the off side.
In contrast to his father, Jimmy, who was dismissed first ball on his Test debut against India in 1992/93, Stephen Cook scored four off the first ball he faced, a leg side half volley from James Anderson. Jimmy Cook did, however, make a century on his debut against an English team in a 'rebel' international 11 seasons earlier. A freak catch by James Taylor at short leg was England's only success after South Africa won the toss and decided to bat.
Dean Elgar and Cook put on 35 for the first wicket before Elgar was caught by Taylor off Moeen Ali for 20 when the off-spinner was brought into the attack in the 11th over.
Elgar went for a pull shot and Taylor took avoiding action but the ball lodged between his legs and he was able to grab it before it touched the ground. AFP

Dreadlocks and poets herald new face of Spanish Parliament
SPAIN: When Alberto Rodriguez of Podemos turned up for the new Spanish parliament's first session in the grand chamber in Madrid, his dreadlocks, jeans and scruffy jumper drew a look of disapproval from the staid prime minister, Mariano Rajoy.
Such scenes are likely to become commonplace with the end of two-party domination of Spanish politics and a new wave of delegates takes their seats alongside the well-groomed ranks of the old guard.
It is more than just a style issue, however.
The national election on Dec. 20 left Rajoy's ruling People's Party (PP) without a majority and opened parliament's doors to two new parties, the anti-austerity Podemos and the centrist Ciudadanos.
Rodriguez, 34, and his cohorts want to reform a political class tainted by its handling of Spain's economic crisis and corruption scandals that have reached as high as Rajoy himself.
"Rajoy has not understood that we are in a new political era in which parliament is not the private reserve of the few," Rodriguez, a former oil refinery worker, told reporters when he made his parliamentary debut last week.
Although the 218 first-time delegates in the 350-seat lower house mark only a slight increase from five years ago when Rajoy won a comfortable majority, they come from diverse backgrounds - from actresses and poets to restaurant-owners and winemakers.
Party leaders are now wrangling over forming a government, with the opposition Socialist's leader, Pedro Sanchez, proposing a leftist coalition and Rajoy a "grand coalition" of centre-right and centre-left parties.
Podemos says the fuss kicked up by the traditional parties over Rodriguez and his dreadlocks was to distract people from the problems at hand. Despite a rebound in the economy, Spain still has Europe's second-highest youth unemployment rate.
"It is a symptom of how the political class want to prevent change," said Sofia Castanon, a well-known poet and Podemos delegate for Asturias, a mountainous region on Spain's northern coast.
Parliament had lost the trust of Spaniards, Castanon told, and Podemos would restore it by eliminating the privileges politicians had enjoyed, such as official cars, generous tax allowances and special pension schemes.
Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has restricted his lawmakers' salaries to three times the minimum wage of 757 euros ($824) a month, a change Castanon, 32, said showed how the party was in touch with Spain's economic reality.
Political analysts said that how far the new parliament could go in changing the course of Spanish politics remains to be seen, especially if the next government is a fragile coalition of many parties that could struggle to agree on a strong reform agenda.

## Title: 'I have pushed myself to the limit'

'I have pushed myself to the limit'
There is no denying that tennis legend Lleyton Hewitt pushed his body to new heights in the month before his professional career ending loss at the Australian Open.
Following his gripping straight set loss to Spaniard David Ferrer, the former world number one said he 'pushed himself to the limit' and couldn't be prouder that he left it all out on the court.
'I came out, I gave everything I had like always and left nothing in the locker room,' Hewitt said.
'That's something I can be proud of. My whole career I've given 100 per cent. I love competing.'
Long-time fans may have forgotten the brazen and sometimes off-putting attitude Hewitt displayed in his younger years.
Hewitts children - Mia, Ava and Cruz - joined their father on the court at Rod Laver Arena, in Melbourne, immediately after his storied 20-year, 878-match professional tennis career came to a close
But punters were given a stark reminder of his fiery temper when they were treated to one last outburst from the infamous 34-year-old.
'Get rid of him mate because he is the only moron who has called anything during the match,' he said of the 'f***ing cheat' linesman who had called a series of foot faults against him.
The father-of-three, who shed tears over an original song created by his children earlier that night, then turned his vitriol towards French official Pascal Maria.
'You're a friggin' idiot,' he said.
'That's why everyone in the locker room thinks you're so full of yourself.
Throughout the match, commentator Jim Courier said the spirit the veteran showed on the court was 'vintage Hewitt'.
'[He's] unhappy with the umpire, unhappy about the foot fault and one line's person at one end and let off a bit of steam there,' the commentator observed.
'Whatever happens he is not going gently into the good night, is he, whenever that might be.'
Hewitt's children - Mia, Ava and Cruz - joined their father on the court at Rod Laver Arena, in Melbourne, immediately after his storied 20-year, 878-match professional tennis career came to a close.
Spanish party pooper David Ferrer ended an era in Australian sport with a 6-2 6-4 6-4 victory over the wounded warrior in a gripping encounter that ended in controversial fashion on Thursday night.
Rod Laver Arena was packed with fans hoping to see the former world number one and dual grand slam champion wind back the clock at least one more time.
But he'll compete no more.
Instead, the tennis great will turn his attention to his new role as Australia's 19th Davis Cup captain and he admitted retirement wouldn't sink in for a few days yet.
'It's a weird emotion. Rod Laver Arena, it's like a second home for me,' he said.
'I'm just so lucky to keep having this opportunity 20 years in a row.
'I just felt like this was the perfect place to finish.
'I was getting goose bumps out here tonight.'
A part-time player for much of the past year since announcing after his second-round Open loss in 2015 that this would be his farewell to the sport, Hewitt still dared to dream following his first-round triumph over James Duckworth.
'I want six more,' the Hall of Famer said before Hunters and Collectors' Holy Grail was belted out on the sound system during his warm-up on Thursday night.
In reality, there was never going to be a fairytale finish for the veteran dream believer. In an unprecedented 20 straight Open appearances, Hewitt's best result will forever remain his epic run to the 2005 final that ended in a four-set defeat at the hands of Marat Safin.
He failed to venture beyond the fourth round any other year since becoming the youngest Open qualifier in history at just 15 in 1997. Hewitt will nevertheless be remembered and ranked among the modern-day greats of Australian tennis, up there with fellow former world No.1s John Newcombe and Rafter and behind only the legend after which the arena where Hewitt made his last stand was named.
'He's just been one of the greatest competitors I have ever seen in my life,' said world No.1 and five-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic.
'Tennis will definitely miss a great competitor, a great fighter.'
And after losing five straight games to drop the first set, and then needing treatment for a leg injury, Hewitt displayed all his trademark grit to conjure seven break-back chances in an epic game while trailing 4-3 in the second set.

## Title: I may be the world No1 but I know I'm not the best - Broad

I may be the world No1 but I know I'm not the best - Broad
Stuart Broad has looked to play down his newly acquired status as the world's No1 bowler in Test cricket, believing Jimmy Anderson still to be England's greatest and Dale Steyn of South Africa the standout among the current generation.
In leading Alastair Cook's tourists to a famous series victory on Saturday with a six-wicket burst in the third Test at The Wanderers Broad became only the second Englishman since Ian Botham 35 years ago to top the official ICC rankings, with Steve Harmison the other in 2004.
The 29-year-old, whose six for 17 paved the way for England take a 2-0 series lead with one Test to play, replaced Ravichandran Ashwin at the summit when the revised rankings were announced on Sunday; the Indian spinner had spent just over two weeks there after ending a near six-year spell of dominance by Steyn.
"When you consider that only Beefy in the 1980s and Harmy in 2004 have been No1 as English bowlers, it is a lovely achievement," said Broad. "It is not something to take for granted and it is a very special thing to have happened. It might sound odd but I'm not the best. Steyn is the bowler of our generation. You only have a look at his record, his wickets, his strike-rate, his average; he is the best bowler in the world.
"I've been very privileged to play with Jimmy for a long time and he is certainly the best bowler England have ever had in my view. I didn't see Fred Trueman and didn't watch much of Beefy live, so you have to judge it on who you've seen bowl.
"So I'm not going to walk away from this week thinking I'm a better bowler than Dale Steyn or Jimmy Anderson because that is not the case. But it is a nice feeling to have reached this mark through my performances."
While Broad has been the leading Test wicket-taker over the past five years with 231 victims, his magnanimity is understandable, with Steyn, who has missed the past two matches with a shoulder injury, taking 406 wickets in 82 Tests compared with Broad's 330 in 90.
Steyn's bowling average of 22.53 and strike-rate of 41.7 are far superior while Broad remains behind both Botham, on 383, and Anderson, 429, in England's list of all-time wicket-takers. It is his new-ball partner who must take some of the credit for his recent rise to the top, too.
Broad said: "We really are a partnership and we talk about it all the time. We're very fortunate to have played the amount of cricket we have together. There have been times when we could have been cast aside by selectors without doubt, but we've been given opportunities to succeed and we've done that nicely.
"We suit each other's style of bowling. We can be grumpy with each other, we can congratulate each other but we're always even, there is never a battle between us to get wickets.
"People talk about cricket being an individual game but I really don't agree; everything is done in a partnership. When Joe Root and Ben Stokes bat together, Stokes gets a bad ball because Root has seen off three good ones. Jimmy and I are the same. Generally the guy at the other end not getting the wickets is the one building the pressure and maybe even bowling better."
By virtue of beating South Africa away, England will move to fifth in the world rankings when they are published after the fourth Test at Centurion that starts on Friday. It is this chart that Broad is more interested in. He added: "Getting to No1 in the bowling is not the end goal and it doesn't feel like the biggest thing right now because there is so much more going on with the team. I'm not being aloof or disrespectful. There is such a determination in the side to get this team to No1.
"In saying that, when [head coach] Trevor Bayliss took over last summer, he did say that the only way to do that is for individual players to start climbing the rankings. We've had Rooty at No1 as a batsman recently, Jimmy and I have consistently been in the top five or six for a while now and Stokes is climbing highly in the all-rounders.
"There is such a goal for this team to become the best. We know it is still a way off just now, but give this team another year's experience and then it really becomes an exciting time."

IAAF scandal worse than Fifa's, says US great Michael Johnson
The corruption scandal plaguing athletics is worse than the one faced by football, says four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson.
Three senior IAAF officials were banned for life for alleged doping breaches.
And Russia is currently banned from all athletics competitions following accusations of widespread doping.
Asked how the scandal facing athletics compared to that of Fifa, Johnson told the BBC: "If you think about the victims, it is absolutely worse."
Fifa, the body that governs world football, is also in crisis following a series of damaging corruption claims.
Its president, Sepp Blatter, has been banned for eight years for breaching ethics rules.
In an interview with Mishal Husain, Johnson said that those athletes cheated out of medals by dopers "never had the opportunity to stand on the podium - and they should have".
However, he stopped short of backing an Olympic ban for Russian athletes later this year.
"Do you ban an entire country that ostensibly could include clean athletes, from participating in Rio" asked the American, who still holds the world and Olympic records for the 400m.
"That is a very difficult decision to make."
Johnson was also cool on the idea, floated by chairman of UK Athletics Ed Warner of resetting all world records so athletics could start afresh with a level playing field.
"It doesn't make sense to me how a reset of all the world records is going to deal with the issue of people cheating," Johnson said.
"It doesn't create a clean competition and that does not deter anyone from cheating." But he does believe the International Association of Athletics Federations must be "completely restructured".
"It is the governing body - and the very structure of the governing body - that has allowed this type of corruption," he said.
A report by the World Anti-Doping Agency's independent commission was scathing of former IAAF president Lamine Diack, whose 16-year reign came to an end in August 2015 when he was replaced by Lord Coe.
It claimed that "corruption was embedded" in the organisation and said it could not be ignored or dismissed as attributable to "the odd renegade acting on his own". It concluded: "The IAAF allowed the conduct to occur and must accept its responsibility."
Johnson said he hoped the crisis would be the catalyst for "a fresh look" at all the problems facing athletics and would help rebuild trust with fans.

## Title: Indonesia vows to strengthen anti-terror laws

Indonesia vows to strengthen anti-terror laws
INDONESIA: The Indonesian government has vowed to tighten anti-terrorism laws in the wake of Jakarta's deadly attacks but it faces a delicate task given the history of repression under the Suharto regime.
President Joko Widodo said there was an urgent need for police to be given more power to take preventative action.
No decision had yet been made but Mr Joko said one popular option was to strip Indonesians who commit a terrorist attack of their citizenship. Proposed changes include prohibiting Indonesians from joining radical groups such as Islamic State overseas and greater powers to detain suspects.
"We think there should be preventative and pre-emptive measures so that we will have authority to take action against those who return from Syria for instance," National Police spokesman Anton Charliyan said after the January 14 terror attack.
Under existing Indonesian laws it is not a crime for Indonesians to go to Syria and join Islamic State or to hold meetings in support of IS.
Terror suspects can only be arrested once they have committed a crime.
"Police must be able to arrest someone when there is even a small indication of a possible terrorist act," said Adhe Bhakti from the Jakarta-based Centre for Radicalism and Deradicalisation.
"For instance, a farmer who piles up five kilograms of nails, ten kilograms of sulphur and another ten kilograms of fertilisers at his house. What would a farmer do with nails and sulphur Right now, the police cannot arrest someone even though they find this stuff at his place. The police can only arrest him if he has put the stuff together into a bomb."
The head of Indonesia's National Intelligence Agency (BIN), Sutiyoso, also complained after the attacks that the agency didn't have the power to arrest or detain anyone.
However the legacy of the authoritarian Suharto regime means Indonesians are very wary of the degradation of civil liberties. "The deliberate degradation of the criminal justice system under Suharto meant courts became a branch of government and that people were often detained without a proper trial," said Tim Lindsey Director of the Centre for Indonesian Law, Islam and Society at Melbourne University.
"This meant that having an open criminal justice process and avoiding arbitrary detention were among the key demands that the reform movement made after Suharto. These are still issues of great sensitivity in Indonesia."
For this reason Dr Lindsey said he did not believe the Jakarta attacks would have as much effect on the government as people outside Indonesia expect they would.
"I don't think we should over-estimate the impact this will have on policy," he said.
Joko said the government would consult with the parliament and other state agencies before a decision was made.
"Everything is still under discussion," he said. "It could be a revised law, it could be a government regulation, it could be a new law on [terrorism] prevention."
Terrorism expert Sidney Jones said she believed a narrowly focused law banning support for IS, training in conjunction with IS and travel to IS-controlled areas would be preferable to amending the 2003 anti-terrorist law.
"I also think it would be more politically palatable," she said in Tempo.
Jones said the National Intelligence Agency should not be given arrest and detention powers.
"More actors will not improve counter-terrorism efforts but likely fuel counterproductive competition and duplication of effort," she said.
Eight people, including militants, died as a result of the January 14 attacks that began with a suicide bomb inside a Starbucks outlet in Central Jakarta. Of the 28 wounded in the attacks, nine are still in hospital.

Motor racing brothers Jaden Aaron
Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena, students of Gateway College, Negombo brought honour to Sri Lanka by winning the 2015 Asia Cup Road Race team championship of the Federation of International Motorcycling (FIM) held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Jaden GunawardenaAaron Gunawardena
The two brothers aged 12 and 13 years are the sons of inaugural Foxhill Supercross champion rider Shane Gunawardena. Shane is the coach, manager and consultant to these two champions. Jaden and Aaron created history by being the youngest and only Sri Lankans to win this prestigious racing title. The duo attracted world attention with their victory and placed Sri Lanka on top of the Asian racing map.
Jaden and Aaron earned a 10-point lead to become champions at the three-stage championship worked off in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan. They outclassed riders from Japan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Nepal to win the ACRR Championship.
The two riders have maintained a superb record so far in both local and international circuit and proved their potential to triumph against seasoned riders. 'Daily News' Sports interviewed the two star riders.
Q: What was your greatest inspiration to enter racing at a very tender age
J&A: It was our father. The two of us are lucky to have a dad who is passionate with motorcycles and racing. We basically grew up with bikes and started riding at a very young age. In fact photographs show that we rode motorcycles before we rode bicycles. The first motorcycle given to me (Jaden) fitted with guide wheels for my second birthday. I (Aaron) remember using the motorcycle but cannot recall how old I was when I first rode.
Q: How do you explain your very first racing experience
J&A: Jaden - I rode a PW 50cc in the under 10 event at the age of 6 and also rode a KTM 50cc in the under 13 and under 16 event the same day. I finished 4th in the under 10 event but crashed in the under 13 and under 16 events. Aaron - My first race was at 5+ on an extremely muddy track in Unawatuna. I tried my best to keep up with my elder brother and cousin Jacques, but cannot remember which place I finished.
Q: What is your favourite annual local event and why is it special
J&A: We enjoyed our motocross riding Foxill, Gajaba, Gunners, Sigiriya and Nuwara Eliya events back then, but after we switched to road racing we guessed it would be the Katukurunda race, as it is one of the glamorous meets. But sadly we could not continue with our local races, as we needed to focus on the Asian rounds. The bikes that we ride for the Asian rounds are different to the ones that are raced out here. Having to practice on two different types of bikes might be a bit hard as we only have Sundays to practice. We hope that Sri Lanka would accommodate the same events that are run in Asian rounds here, as it would benefit us as well as riders lined up to go for the Asian rounds.
Q: Who are the toughest contenders to compete with
J&A: Locally we would love to race with the riders who are champions as there is much to learn riding with faster riders. Internationally it is always a challenge and we are benefitted with our weight and probably our age too.
Q: How do you cope with the tension when competing with experienced and elderly riders
J&A: We simply love it, as the faster they go, the faster we go. Our dad has always told us that we have an advantage with our weight, and he does not see why someone could be faster than us. During practice and qualifying we generally leave the paddock first, so it gives us a chance to ride with or behind the best riders and learn their lines.
Q: Tell us about your international racing career
Jaden, Aaron and father Shane Gunawardena with the awards.
J&A: We have participated in nine Asian tours and one European tour. We have our eyes set on the Red Bull Rookies Cup in Spain. Jaden - I got an opportunity last year to participate in it, but was knocked out in the finals. Our dad has promised to take us to Spain during the August holidays if we do well in our mid-term exams, so we would be practicing on the same circuit the Red Bull Rookies Cup takes place in October this year. It seems that everyone who competes in the Red Bull Rookies Cup has had a pre-run on the circuit, so hopefully this time we'll have a chance.
Q: What made you the champions at Asia Cup Road Race
J&A: We guess we had luck on our side, as the Japanese riders were the fastest during qualifying, but on race day both riders crashed out in the same event and left the doors open to the other Asian countries to clinch the gold in the first race. Jaden - I charged from the back of the grid and clinched first place and Aaron who finished in the front bunch had to go back about 9 positions after a penalty for overtaking on a yellow flag. The second race at the opening round was scary as I had a nasty crash and had to be air lifted out of the circuit unconscious and with fractures to my collar bone. The gold for Sri Lanka seemed impossible after I crashed, but Aaron did the honours in a photo-finish beating the Philippine rider by one thousandth of a second.
Q:How does the father-son combination bring you success
J&A: I guess our dad would have to answer this as he puts us through a strenuous fitness program and spends most of his time setting our bikes up for our weekly ride. He is our greatest strength and his guidance led us to success.
Q: How do you explain the danger and thrill in racing
J&A: We have crashed many times and broken a few bones but I know for a fact my mum hates racing, we do not express any dangers of racing and there has not been any need to do so. Every ride is a happy moment and I am sure our dad enjoys watching us too. He always tells us that the day we do not enjoy what we do, it is time to quit.
Q: What are your future ambitions
J&A: When we were young we wanted to be astronauts and fighter pilots, but now our focus is on a World Championship. All we need is a circuit to practice and lots more young riders coming in, so hopefully the federation would help us.
Q: What are your other interests and talents apart from racing
J&A: Basketball has been another passion and the two of us have captained our school team for the past 3-4 years, currently I captain the under 15 team and my brother Aaron captains the under 13 team.
Q: How do you strike a balance between studies and racing
J&A: This is the hardest part we were okay with our racing, schools activities and studies until last year. Nine Asian tours and one European tour were too much for us. Although we had additional tuition to cover up the lost work, we could not catch up and maintain our positions in class.
Q: Any particular rider you admire the most
J&A: Valentino Rossi.

## Title: Pope Francis' Fiat up for auction

Pope Francis' Fiat up for auction
US: It was the tiny car that whisked Pope Francis around Philadelphia and wowed Americans reared on gas-guzzling automobiles. Now it's being offered for auction to lesser mortals with deep pockets.
At least one of two Fiat 500Ls, custom-made for the pope's visit to Philadelphia and fitted with Secret Service license plates, goes on sale January 29, kicking off the this year's Philadelphia Auto Show.
The second Fiat, which Catholic authorities said they may also sell at the same auction, will go on public display at the auto show which runs from January 30 to February 7.
The Max Spann Real Estate and Auction Company has valued the car at $30,000 but declined Wednesday to estimate what price it might fetch on the night.
Buyers can bid in person and online for the sale and the proceeds will benefit four charities run by the archdiocese of Philadelphia. "I think there's going to be tremendous interest," Max Spann, president of the auction company, told AFP.
"Being that it was used by the pope, there are intangibles. So it's really hard to predict" what price it will fetch, he said. Fiat Chrysler made two Fiat 500Ls for the pope's use in Philadelphia and the US Secret Service provided the vehicle identification numbers, the archdiocese said. Fiat Chrysler donated the cars to the church, it added.
The pope also used models of the same vehicle in New York and Washington DC during his September 22-27 inaugural US tour, drawing massive crowds and delighting Americans with his display of simplicity.
"When we learned that these vehicles would be given to us, we wanted to find some way for the public to see them and answer Pope Francis' call to love and care for the poor," said Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput.
Money raised by the sale of the car will go to charities run by the archdiocese that benefit the poor.
"The Fiat is such an icon of Pope Francis' visit," said Donna Crilley Farrell, executive director of the World Meeting of Families Philadelphia 2015.
"The good that this auction will bring to the Catholic Charities Appeal, Mercy Hospice, Casa Del Carmen and the Archdiocesan Schools of Special Education is simply incomparable," she added.

Sri Lankan Special Children bring international honour
Eight Sri Lankan special children (Intellectually disabled) participated in a South Asia Pacific Bocce tournament held in Brunei recently brought honour to Sri Lanka by winning three gold, 16 silver and five bronze medals.
Four boys and four girls accompanied by two coaches at the tournament. They have battled with contenders from nine South Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Brunei Darussalam, Bangladesh, East Malaysia, West Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Nepal.
After two days of qualifying round, Sri Lanka romped into semi-final round and managed to bag 24 medals.
Intellectually disabled people are categorised under differently able people. Even though they are capable of several activities, they are neglected, isolated and ill-treated. There are more than 660,000 Intellectually disabled people in Sri Lanka and that counts 3% of the population. We should recognise their abilities and give them a chance to come forward to associate with the community as normal people. There are three main aspects they can interact with the society. Those are through music, dancing and sports. Among them the sport is the main pathway for them to develop communication, interaction and self-caring.
Special Olympics Serendib is an organization working closely with a US based one of the world's largest charity organization, Special Olympics International which originated by the Kennedy family. Our responsibility in this establishment is to find new Intellectually disabled people and train them under their instructions. After selecting the capable athletes we send them for the Olympic Games which is a biannual international event . Other than Bocce we are participating in Swimming, Badminton, Athletics, Cricket, Volleyball, Football (Soccer) and Snow shoeing. Any Intellectually disable child have the opportunity to join and participate in Special Olympics game by registering with Special Olympics Serendib (Sri Lanka).

Team performance and commercial values not related
Ten Sports Taj Television CEO Rajesh Sethi said that performance and commercial values were not related to each other when they assess teams.
Tomorrow Zimbabwe can be the no 1 team but the commercial value of that team won't increase. Winning and losing and commercial aspects are not linked, its not linear, he said.
Replying to a question how his company rated teams when they had their highs and lows, Sethi said, The right spirit of partnership is that you have to be through with your partner through thick and thin and we follow that. There are times the sun is shining and they are doing great and there are days when it's a bit cloudy. You can't choose to alter your behaviour with your partner depending on the day you have to be with him through thick and thin.
Explaining what makes a company like Ten Sports so unique from other broadcasters, Sethi said, We take a 360 degree view of sports. We have a significant play into cricket where we work with big cricketing boards around the world and have very deep associations with each one of them. We have a significant play in football. We have a lot of football properties like the UEFA, French League, India's I league, Australia's A league. We have a very significant play when it comes to football.
Then we have a third segment called sports entertainment. We have a marquee property like WWE, we also have a significant play into what we call multi-sports events where we are the rights holders of Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, Tour de France, and have significant play into tennis as well. We believe in offering complete 360 degree experience to our audience wherein we don't constrain ourselves to any one property and we cover across the spectrum.
We are also ensuring that we provide multi-screen experience to our viewers. We have started doing streaming on alternative devices as well.
We are very boundary less as an organization and we believe in having an external focus. For us each and every one watching a TV channel is a stake holder, all the partners we have, all the cricket boards, are our stake holders. We are pretty grounded and to put it in a blunt manner we have our ears and eyes on the ground and very closely associated with each and every stake holder who is part of our overall universe, he said.
To get the combination working smoothly Sethi said they were all driven by a common threat which is passion for the game.
We all love sports, sports is all about celebrating life. We all get our adrenalin rushing and pumped up when you talk about any sporting event coming up. We love it and we love what we are doing and the love for the game brings us where we all are, said Sethi.
There are 200 people in our Ten Sports team and you will find a believer of each and every sport amongst these 200 people.
Explaining how Ten Sport picks their staff, Sethi said, You must have high energy and be passionate about what you are doing. These are the core fundamentals we look into at each person we hire in our team.
The person has to be passionate about what they are doing and have high energy and spirit of team work. Sport is all about team work. We have a great set of people together. We love and fight together, an absolutely fantastic team.
