Dharmaratne - coach of women's hockey team at South Asian games
Dharmaraja College, Mahamaya and St Anthony's Girls College hockey coach C C Dharmaratne is the hockey coach of the Sri Lanka women's team for the South Asian Games to be held in Guwahati India from next week onwards.
G G Dharmaratne affectionately known as 'GG' in the local hockey world is an Old Sylvestrian and is an experienced personality in the trade.
A very successful centre forward, he played for the Central Province Schools and the Sri Lanka Schools in many representative matches. He also turned out for the Kandy District in both Senior and Junior Nationals.
But it was as a coach he excelled most. He coached a school which was little known for hockey as table tennis, swimming and badminton were their forte. That was Mahamaya Girls College and within a short period they won the National Schools Games girls hockey championship. That was the only occasion in its history Mahamaya Girls College had on this prestigious title. They also won several of the titles in the junior age group in the earlier years.
But for some unknown reason this school shortly afterwards stopped playing hockey and a revival has been made a few years back.
Later he took over the coaching of Mahamaya St. Anthony's Girls College and this school won the National Schools girls hockey championship title in addition to winning several other titles. Last year they won the all island schools girls under 19 hockey title defeating Presidents College, Nawala 2-0 in the finals.
He also coached Dharmaraja College with tremendous success. Though they did not taste much success at national level but locally they were the undisputed champions. At one time the Rajans under his guidance won the under 15 title 9 years in a row and also the under 18 title for several years.

Hillary Clinton fails to rally women to her history-making bid

US: Hillary Clinton made the prospect of her being elected the first woman US president a centerpiece of her campaign, then lost a critical nominating contest to a 74-year-old man in part because women preferred him.
NBC News exit polls showed Clinton, a former Secretary of State, US Senator and First Lady, won 44 per cent of the women's vote in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary to 55 per cent for her Democratic Party rival, US Senator Bernie Sanders.
Young women contributed significantly to Clinton's loss, and the candidate acknowledged that she struggled with young voters.
"I know I have some work to do, particularly with young people," Clinton said during a concession speech. "Even if they are not supporting me now, I support them."
With women over 45, Clinton prevailed with 56 per cent of the vote, ABC News exit polls found, but Sanders won 69 per cent among women under 45. Among women under 30, Sanders won a staggering 82 per cent.
Unlike Barack Obama, who played down his African-American roots when elected the first black president eight years ago, in this election cycle Clinton, 68, has emphasized the breakthrough a Nov. 8 victory would represent for women.
At nearly every campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton or a supporter emphasized the role she could play as the first woman in the White House while Sanders galvanized young people with his promise to fix an economy he said was rigged in favor of the wealthy.
Clinton said she was trying to break the "hardest, highest glass ceiling." She campaigned alongside four women U.S. senators, New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan and Lilly Ledbetter, the woman for whom an equal-pay law is named.
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reprised her line that "there is a special place in hell for women who don't help each other" while introducing Clinton at a rally on Saturday.
Clinton told a young woman the same day that she has to walk a "narrower path" because she has "got to be aware of the fact that I'm trying to be the first woman president of the United States of America, and there has never been one before, and so people don't have, you know, an image."
The remarks by Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state, and others by feminist icon Gloria Steinem were assailed as disparaging by young women supporters of Sanders. - NDTV

'Human error' responsible for German head-on train crash
GERMANY: The head-on collision of two commuter trains in southern Germany that left 10 people dead and dozens injured was caused by "human error," a source close to the investigation said of the initial findings.
Who exactly was responsible for the crash on Tuesday was not immediately known.
Eighteen people were seriously injured and another 63 sustained minor wounds, police said.
One missing person was believed to still be among the wreckage. Police said there was little chance of the person's survival.
The accident, which occurred near the Bavarian town of Bad Aibling at 6.50am local time, saw two commuter trains carrying a total of 150 people collide at full speed on a single-track line in a partially wooded area.
Due to a curve in the track, the drivers had no visibility before the two trains crashed into one another, causing several compartments to derail, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in a news conference.

Prosecutors had said earlier that they were investigating the possibility of human error and of a technical fault.
One focus had been the system that causes trains to brake automatically when they are on the wrong track to prevent such head-on collisions.
A spokesman for rail operator Deutsche Bahn said the system was enabled at the time of the accident and had been tested about a week ago.
"It was frightening to see how the two trains drilled into one another - the second train was completely torn apart," Mr Dobrindt said, adding that he was in close contact with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer, who had both expressed their condolences to the victims' relatives.
As part of the rescue effort, as many as 15 helicopters transported people with serious injuries to nearby hospitals and were seen lifting victims to the opposite side of the river in body bags. Those with less severe injuries were being treated at the scene.
Federal and state police, paramedics, the fire department, the lifeguard service and the Red Cross had formed a rescue operation comprising more than 500 people.
A spokesman for the team of paramedics working at the scene said favourable weather conditions, the time of day and the fact that it is a holiday in Bavaria had helped to minimise losses in the accident.
Two black boxes from the trains were being examined for information about the reason for the collision. A third was still missing in the wreckage.
Deutsche Bahn said that two cranes had been ordered to remove the wreckage beginning on Wednesday and that the effort would take several days. - DPA
