Wedding Season: Deals hard to refuse

With the wedding season beginning months away, couples are already busy running around getting everything they need for their Big Day ready. And planning a wedding can be very hectic. Luckily now you got Wedding Planners to lend you a hand...but then there are the people who like to take care of their wedding all on their own. For those people, all they need is go to the their preferred venue and give their details.
Now restored and given a face lift yet keeping the original charm of the hotel, the Galle Face Hotel has unveiled a great line up of amazing wedding packages, a hopeful couple to be should check out.
Spoilt for choice
"Our packages are highest in the market but we have a lot of value additions that go with them and something which people are not talking about or know about", Galle Face Hotel Catering & Conventions Director Thakshila Galappaththy said. We are providing drummers, dancers, ashtaka, poruwa additions, jayamangala gatha, including the choice of transportation - horse carriage or BMW Six series, which are given at no additional cost. On top of that we are providing the Scottish Bagpipers as well which is something very new.
"At Buddhist weddings, people have to go here, there, everywhere looking for an ashtaka person, to get the nakath time, travelling back and forth which is a big force. If you are getting married all you have to do is give us your contact details. We give the information to him and he will be there at your doorstep - be it your home or office or the hotel at the time convenient to you. We are the only hotel providing this facility. With people having a hectic life this is a relief for them", Thakshila added.
"When someone is planning their wedding, they call all the hotels and ask how much a plate is. We don't sell plates - we are selling an Experience", he stressed.
They are also giving out amazing discounts for the couples and the bridal party too. There is a 15 percent discounts for weddings until March 2017. Bridesmaid's who plan to get married next year will get a 15 percent off as well if they provide a picture of themselves at the Galle Face Hotel until March 2017 and a 10 percent if they have scheduled their weddings for December 2017. Even Graduate professionals (doctors, lawyers, engineers) are eligible for the 15 percent discount till March 2017. Then there are deals for generation weddings, such as if your grandparents or parents got married at the Galle Face Hotel, then you are entitled to a 10 percent discount. The hotel has also partnered with some of the leading entrepreneurs when it comes to weddings and their package deal allows the prospective couple special discounts at these selected partners.
Complimentary wedding
Also, if you are lucky, you might just stand a chance to win a complimentary wedding courtesy the hotel. All you got to do is, pay an advance, fill up a card and enter their raffle draw and who knows...you might just walk away with a free wedding of a lifetime that includes the food, flower arrangements, vehicle, room and special discounts for jewellery.

When it comes to Muslim weddings, seating won't be an issue as they can facilitate up to 1000 guests in their ballroom. Plus they do serve Halal food. And for the Catholic weddings, where the main ceremony usually takes place in the church, the Galle Face Hotel will provide canaps for 150 guests. The wedding party will have to come pick it up from the hotel and then take it to the church. For the menu, guests can choose from their Jubilee experience and Imperial experience. The couple can also meet up with Executive Chef and fine tune the menu if they want.
"We are planning to organize a wedding show in a couple of months to come. From photographers to flower people to jewelers and hotel event coordinators - they will be there. Plus we like to let the people know that we are ready to provide the same facilities and services with a dedicated manager for every couple to look after all their needs. There is no discrimination here. Plus they are no hidden charges. You pay one price and you get everything for that price. You can choose from 10 varieties of Welcome drinks. We will provide one suite for the overnight stay and a changing room. Recently we launched a new deal where if a couple has their wedding here, they will be given a six pax dinner - (groom's parents, bride's parents and the couple) - creating the unity amongst the families. And we will give a 2 pax dinner on their anniversary", Thakshila stated.
Speaking about the venues, they have the Grand Ballroom, Jubilee Ballroom and also do outdoor venues such as the South Lawn and the Sea Lawn (edge of the beach) for the Poruwa ceremony. One of their highlights was their Destination wedding where they had people coming from all around the world. They had booked 130 rooms for four nights with ceremonies such as Sangeeth, Mehendi and Mandap and the Galle Face Hotel took care of everything.
It's an iconic heritage and one of the oldest hotels and so far, after the relaunch of the hotel, they have had around 80 weddings with amazing positive feedback. So I guess planning your wedding for 2017 will be just a breeze.

Weerawila (Palatupana) Crab Curry
[Ingredients]
2 live Mud Crabs (about 1.2kg - 2lb 12 oz each) 400ml (14 fl oz) Coconut milk 1 Ball of Tamarind (golf ball size) 1 tblspn Jaffna Curry Powder 1 tblspn Chilli Powder 2 tspn Cumin Seeds 1/2 cup Fresh Grated Coconut 1 tspn Black Pepper 1 tspn Black Mustard Seeds 1/4 tspn Ground Turmeric 50g (1 3/4oz) Ghee 1 Spanish Onion (sliced) 1 Sprig Curry Leaves (leaves picked) 3 Small Green Chillies (finely chopped) 1/2 litre Water 1 Sprig of Drumstick Leaves Juice of 1/2 limes
Method:
Put the crabs in the freezer for 1 hour to immobilise them. Pull off the top shells, pull out the spongy grey gills and remove the guts. Chop the crab into 6 pieces, then crack the large claws but leave them attached.
Roast the cumin seeds, coconut and pepper till the coconut is golden brown. Grind to a smooth paste and put aside. Heat the ghee in a large heavy saucepan over high heat, add the mustard seeds till they start to pop, then add the fennel for a few minutes or until the onions are golden.
Add the curry powder, chilli powder and turmeric mix in and add the crab and cook for another 3 minutes. At this stage you need to stir it a lot so the spices dont burn. Then add the coconut mixture, stir and add the water. If the curry is too dry add more water.
Cover and simmer 12 minutes or until crab is just cooked through and sauce has thickened. Stir in the drumstick leaves, lime juice and season to taste with salt.

Living a Spittel life

You know you are going to have one bumpy ride of a journey to your destination when you try to get into the vehicle and hit your head hard on the roof of the vehicle. This time, my destination took me to a little resident bungalow located in Nawalapitiya which was once the house of the renowned Dr. R L Spittel. It is known as Dr. R L Spittel's Harondale Estate Bungalow.
R L Spittel is known for his time spent with the Veddah community to learn about them and then writing many books such as Savage Sanctuary (1941), Vanished Trails (1950), Where the White Sambhur Roams (1951), Wild White Boy (1958), Brave Island (1966), Wild Ceylon (1924), Far-off things (1933) and much more.
The smooth uphill drive was one that never gets me bored. Greens of every shade surrounding you, the Kithulgala river telling you how bad the weather is (with the level of water you see from the top), and that fresh air you take into your lungs (telling that you should pack up from Colombo and move to one of these towns).
Taking the Awissawela route it's only about 5 hours to Nawalapitiya and I always say, you never feel the time flying when you are chit chatting away with your companions. As we left pretty late in the afternoon, we had stopped for a cup of hot plain tea with hakuru (jaggary) at one of the roadside kades (shops). Nothing like a hot kahata and hakuru at 5pm, to refresh your soul and mind after a good lunch.
Within an hour of having our tea, we come to Ginigathena where you turn off to Nawalapitiya. From there it was not so an easy ride to the bungalow. The road leading up to our abode for the night, (like I said in the beginning), was very bumpy. You might want to go in a vehicle that's like 3 meters high from the ground level. But this is also part of the experience of going there, the view is quite amazing, especially during sunset.
We were welcomed to R L Spittel's home by the present owners who bought the house 10 years ago. The first job of everyone who got out of the vehicle was to take out their cameras and start clicking away the property before the sun disappeared completely behind the mountains. While this took place, the cook at the property, Mary (known well for her Biriyani), brought out some hot milk tea - perfect for the somewhat cool climate. After taking some good shots and checking out the rooms, I happened to land in the room that was actually where R L Spittel stayed in and used to basically sit down looking out at the window and writing his novels. Yea, I was hoping I'll have a visit from him in the night to give me some inspiration in writing but nope, no Spittel came.
There are four rooms with three family rooms and 3 bathrooms (2 attached and one common). All the bathrooms are spacious with hot and cold water. There is one big living room with a TV and some of Spittel's books, so you can lie back on the arm chair and enjoy one of his books. Even the children have a collection of books to pick and read from the room.
Speaking to the present owner he said initially he didn't want to give it out to people. It was just him and his family coming here once every two weeks. Subsequently, I realized that because there was no one living here on a permanent basis, the bungalow was getting neglected. Then they started renovating it and last September opened it after a little bit of renovation for the public. They are now registered with booking.com as he wants to give it to out to foreigners who really love this kind of climate range and the nature surrounding it.
There was 2500 acres of land here, but the government took it over and finally they have 25 acres. It's known that Spittel first planted coffee here and it was subsequently changed to tea and in his book Bitter Berry, it tells all about his life.
For the package they offer, they give everything but request the guests to bring in their own towels. They can bring the dry rations and get Mary to make some amazing dishes her style. This property is ideal for large families and even if couples want to book it, they can do so but the price of the booking won't change for them. Plus if you don't want to cooped up in the bungalow all day, there are lot of things to explore nearby. There is the Handun Ella Water Fall, which is 30 Meters (100ft) and situated near Kithulgala joins the Kelani Ganga. This is just a 30 minute drive from the property after you get by the bumpy road. Then you have the Kitulgala Beli Lena Pre Historic Cave and Water Fall, which is about 8km from Kitulgala. Being one of the largest prehistoric caves on the island, this is where the 12,000-year-old skeletal remains of Balangoda Man (Homo Sapiens Balangodensis) was found.
Ever heard of the movie "the Bridhe on the River Kwai" well it was shot here in Sri Lanka and in Kitulgala itself. This Oscar-winning film location is one place you should definitely go to see when you are passing by or put on your trek list.
Love waterfalls...then you will surely love Laxapana Waterfall which is 126m high and the 8th highest waterfall in Sri lanka and 625th highest waterfall in the world. Located in Hatton/Norton Bridge area in Nuwara Eliya District, it's a one and half hour drive from the Bungalow.
There is also a man made pool with a waterfall that one should really check out. This is right near the property but you have to climb down to get there and it's best you go with one of the caretakers so you get your bearings right and make sure you keep an eye on your children.
All this trekking, climbing and driving makes one hungry. And there's nothing like a home cooked meal waiting for you after all that workout. Mary makes some amazing dishes. You should definitely add sprats, canned fish, some vegetables, dough for string hoppers and she will make some really mean dishes to satisfy your cravings. Do ask her for her Biryani - it's quite unique from the others.
So need I say more or do you want to go check this out. You can log on to http://herondaleestatebungalow.com and make your bookings. This season will be the ideal time to go there.

Sri Lanka has taken steps to encourage Chinese investors to promote investments in Sri Lanka through non-traditional financial methods by directing the relationship between the two countries on a new path. Accordingly, the proposal made by Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama, to sign the above MoU during the official visit of the Prime Minister to China, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Compensation payment due to land acquisitions
Objectives of the above project include flood control in Colombo metropolitan area and suburbs, infrastructure development and institutional development. Fifty six sub projects have been implemented under the said project. Most of the construction and rehabilitation work proposed under this project are to be implemented in main cities and in highly populated areas and it has also been planned to acquire private lands for the proposed project activities. The joint proposal made by Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake and Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, to adopt Land Acquisition (Payment of Compensation) Regulations published in Gazette Extra Ordinary No. 1864/54 dated 30.05.2014 for payment of compensations for affected persons by the above project, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Establishment of a Buddhist Revival Fund
Sri Lanka has about 12,150 Buddhist Temples and 750 out of them maintain Pirivenas. There are about 150 Forest Hermitages island-wide as well. These temples render an invaluable service to protect the cultural heritage related to Buddhist religious traditions and to promote the knowledge of the priests as well as laymen throughout the Pirivena education. However Bikkhus face many difficulties in rendering their social services and many of the expenses are unbearable by temples. Though the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Department of Buddhist Affairs and the Ministry of Education make a substantial contribution towards the management of physical resources, it is restricted to annual budgetary allocations. The Venerable Sangha have pointed out the need to establish and maintain a Fund that could be utilized under a formal methodology, to make use of various income and donations in addition to the direct contributions made by the government. The proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, to establish the above fund as a "Buddhist Revival Fund" and to facilitate selected Buddhist monasteries on a common policy, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

National Food Production Programme
The proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, on providing seeds and planting material for subsidiary crop production free of charge in the Yala Season, promoting toxin-free cultivation by encouraging farmers and facilitating the sale of their harvest, operation of the overall programme, supervision, follow-up and progress review at provincial, district and divisional level related to the activities to be carried out in 2016 under the National Food Production Programme, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

MoU between Central Bank and China Development Bank
The proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to sign the above MoU during the official visit of the Prime Minister to China in view of maintaining financial stability of the country, enhancing liquidity of the market and promoting the development of agriculture and infrastructure in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Criteria for consideration for appointment of a chairman and boards of directors of state owned enterprises (document no - 44)
The lack of clear-cut policy directives with regard to management of Public Enterprises, failure to delegate decision-making to senior management, absence in commercial consideration in business decisions, political interference in appointment of staff, failure to adopt practical guidelines for the selection and failure to adopt practical guidelines for the appointment of management level officers, have been identified as some of the key constraints to improve performance of Public Enterprises. Hence, it is a timely need to adopt a formal and transparent method in such appointments. The proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to adopt criteria on professional and management experience, maximum age limits, provisions for prevention of conflicts of interest, disqualifications, prepared by the committee appointed by the President in making recommendations for such appointments, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Signing of Paris Agreement on climate change
The Signing Ceremony of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is scheduled to be held on April 22, 2016 at the UN headquarters in New York.

Companies monopoly should be broken to save CEB - Handunnetti
The network of companies around the CEB has built up a monopoly and it should be broken to save the CEB, JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in the adjournment debate on the power crisis. Handunnetti observed the power crisis and the CEB crisis are intertwined. Explaining on the vicious cycle happening at the CEB, the MP said a solution to the power crisis could not be found without finding a solution to the CEB crisis.
The power crisis is created by the CEB engineers themselves and then they ask the politicians to go for power cuts. The minister holding the portfolio then looks for alternatives knowing the ill-effects of power cuts. The engineers then come up with the proposal to purchase power from the private sector and those companies are owned by them. I state with responsibility it is the CEB engineers who create this crisis. They propose the same option for every minister who is appointed to the portfolio. The minister becomes miserable when the power mafia creates a power crisis. The network of companies around the CEB nourishes while the CEB suffers, he commented.
The JVP member said a comprehensive audit is required over the private power purchases which is close to about Rs. 200 billion each year.
MP Handunnetti further observed there are 23 companies under the organisational chart of the CEB, which are not accountable to Parliament. The five main companies of them are the LECO, SL Engineers, LTL Holdings, TPC and LCC. There are many other subsidiaries under the Lanka Transformers Limited (LTL) and out of them they deliberately avoid mentioning the names of two companies namely the LTL Esot and LTL Project. The Director Board of these two are same. There are Mohomed Jalaldeen Marikkar, Ravindra Kumar Pitigala, and U. D. Jayawardena. These three directors are found in the director boards of all the 23 companies. What happens in the CEB is similar to a pyramid scam. There are organised corruption and crimes taking place in the CEB. The above companies are a network created for those organised crimes. The government should investigate on the links between the CEB and LTL Holdings, he noted.
He requested the government to find out the history of the officials who are behind the power mafia including the posts they held in the CEB, their current status and the initial status and their assets and liabilities.
Handunetti said LTL Holdings reluctantly appeared before Parliament recently but did not speak about the LTL Esot and LTL Project. The Chairman of LTL Holdings is also the Chairman of CEB. Sixty three percent of its ownership is for the CEB. But its chairman clearly does not stand for the CEB, he stated.
Power and Energy Deputy Minister making a clarification at this point said the CEB Chairman in his official capacity becomes the LTL Holding Chairman also. However, MP Handunnetti said that was the very reason why the system should change because it leads to conflict of interests.
Handunneti commenting on the recent proposal to purchase three power plants, pointed out the Chairman of Heladanavi is the current Chairman of the CEB and added that the COPE would present a detailed report on the CEB to Parliament in May.
Handunnetti also revealed that there are certain people who had not paid electricity bills for two and half years. Why the CEB is incurring losses while the consumers make regular payments for their bills As of December 31, 2014, the CEB has Rs. 4,132 million worth of bills older than two and half years. However, the supply to them has not been terminated he added.

No interim committees for sports bodies - Dayasiri
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament yesterday that there will be no interim committees for sports bodies as long as he is Sports Minister.
Participating in the debate on Regulations under the Convention Against Doping in Sport Act, the minister said that he had information of moves by certain persons to create interim bodies to govern several sports associations.
I would not let anyone set up interim committees for sports associations as long as I hold this position, he said. It is better that I tender my resignation and go home instead permitting the establishment of interim bodies. I would not let outsiders to meddle with the affairs of sports associations. All interim Committees have been dissolved. The cricket was adversely affected by the interim committee. There was an interference at many levels in sports bodies due to these interim committes. Sri Lankan Cricket had huge debts. We are now changing this. I had discussions with IOC and the main allegation was that there was a political interference in Sri Lankan sports associations. We are changing this situation. There are a number of problems in sports bodies. They make various objections when we do correct things. If these institutions function properly, we do not have to interfere with their affairs. We would hold elections for sports associations in due time. We are at the moment engaged in massive projects targeting the 2024 Olympic games. We strive to develop sports in the correct manner, the Minister said.

Power breakdowns due to poor maintenance - Ajith P. Perera
The investigations by the committees appointed to find out the cause of electricity breakdowns have revealed that the breakdowns were due to poor maintenance, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He said so far the final and detailed reports are not completed and submitted and added that there is a severe issue with the management.
Those issues should be addressed to in ensuring a good electricity supply to the public, the deputy minister said. But the government never sees privatisation of the CEB is a solution to these issues. The Prime Minister has instructed to take all means to solve this issue. Privatisation is against our policies, policies of the government and our conscience.
Perera said the governments wish is to adopt corrective measures with the support of all in the CEB and not to make the changes by force.
He made these observations yesterday responding to the adjournment motion moved by UNP Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma on issues relating to the electricity provision and breakdown of the electricity supply at three occasions in the recent past.
The water levels of the reservoirs have gone down unusually because of the lack of exchange of details between the irrigation officials and the CEB. Now we have to introduce a proper management mechanism between the resources of the CEB so that we can preserve needy resources, he said.
Perera said that he dares not to say that all CEB engineers are corrupt but some of them and added that the promotion process in the CEB is not acceptable as it is based on the seniority alone.
The CEB is not owned by its engineers or the staff but by the 21 million consumers, Deputy Minister Perera said. So that there should not be a monopoly of the senior officials. The consumers expect a round the clock power supply throughout the year. If the government failed to do so the public would lose faith in the government.
The deputy minister said the government would take all steps to secure an uninterrupted power supply for the country and added that the governments attention is drawn to generate environment friendly energy - the solar power, wind power and dendro power.
We also have means to use our own gas in future. The solar power is one of the most reliable sources. But the CEB officials say there is no stability in solar power supply. But we have to take policy decisions to make it a reality. he said.
Deputy Minister Perera said there is s possibility to make each house a solar power power plant in the future. The 65,000 houses that are planned to be set up in the North are will have solar panels on the roofs. He said that net metering and net accounting is to be introduced so that the hoses that have solar panels could earn an extra income and added that there are plans to generate 745 MW wind power and 1,100 MW solar power.

Two JO members appointed to COPE, COPA
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday announced that two members of the joint opposition have been appointed to the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and to the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA).
The Deputy Speaker announced that MP Prasanna Ranatunga and MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage of the joint opposition have been appointed to the COPE and COPA respectively.
Deputy Speaker Sumathipala announcing the Speakers announcements in Parliament just a minute before the lunch break, said that MP Abdullah Maharuf and MP Prasana Ranatunga have been appointed to the COPE in addition to those who had been appointed earlier.
Making another announcement Sumathipala said that MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage and MP Chandima Gamage have been appointed to COPA in addition to those who had been appointed earlier.
He made these announcements following a query by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena following the round of questions for oral answers on the appointment of the Joint Opposition members to the COPE and the COPA.
The Speaker had observed that he would appoint two members of the Joint Opposition to the COPE and the COPA to redress the issues faced by the same in Parliament, Dinesh Gunawardena said. We have nominated our members three weeks ago. The Speaker again promised at the Party Leaders Meeting to make those appointments. But even after weeks nothing has happened.
The Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the government is ready to accept them. Now for example 10 out of the 17 members of the Oversight Committees are from the Opposition, Minister Kiriella said. During the 2002 UNP regime then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed late Jeyaraj Fernadopulle as the COPE chairman.
At this stage Deputy Speaker Sumathipala observed that he would make a statement after discussing the matter with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.

More room for ministerial appointments - Gayantha
The government as a National Government consists of 92 cabinet, state and deputy ministers, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said there are 47 cabinet ministers including President Maithripala Sirisena, 20 state ministers and 25 deputy ministers in the government.
There is more room for appointment of new ministers and some other members from the joint opposition are planing to join the government. The government will consider their moves too in future, Karunathilake said.
The members of the joint opposition could find out as to what extent the number of ministers would expand by checking who have plans to join the government.
However, there is room for expansion as this is a National Government, Minister Karunathilake said.
He made these observations yesterday when Opposition Member Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena questioned as to who would reveal the statistics in relation to the number of ministers as promised by the government on Wednesday.

SAITM not bound to reveal A-L results, Z-scores of their students
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday told Parliament that the SAITM private institute in Malabe is not bound to reveal information on the A-L results and the Z-scores of the students admitted to its medical degree.
The minister was responding to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa. The minister said the government has no legal right to demand information on the students and teaching staff of SAITM as it is a private organisation.
We can only make a request. If they do not reply, then the government can do nothing. However, I will try to obtain the information requested by the MP, he said. However, the minister said there had been several incidents of enrolling students with lower qualifications to the SAITM during the first few years it started awarding medical degrees, but said it had stopped after the intervention of the UGC.
The MP asked if the SAITM is considered a private organisation, why a Director of SAITM is sitting in the UGC board. The minister replying to this query noted the said director had been appointed to the UGC board not representing the SAITM, but due to his professional qualifications.

Pre-propaganda documents sent to FCID
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera told Parliament yesterday that relevant documents and bills pertaining to the pre-propaganda and other purposes aimed at hosting the Commonwealth Games of 2018 in Hambantota has been submitted to the FCID to ascertain whether any finance misappropriation has taken place in the bidding process.
The minister was responding to an oral question by JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti. The Authorities has received Rs. 10 million from the Sports Fund, Rs. 100 million from the Sports Ministry and Rs. 577 million from the private sector for the pre-propaganda campaign and other purposes and the relevant audit documents have been sent to FCID now.

CEB management should accept responsibility
Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Patali Champika Ranawaka told Parliament yesterday the CEB management should accept the responsibility for the break down in the electricity supply on three occasions in the last few months.
Even during the war period, there were no such break down. There is no severe drought in the country. But generally a dry climatic condition in the months of April, May and June. However, there should have been no problem on the power supply because there was an ample rain last January. Eeven, when there was a water crisis, there was no power shortage like this.
We have an excess electricity production than the required electricity generation capacity. Therefore, authorities cannot say that they cannot provide electricity. There is minor clique sabotaging this purpose. If the solutions suggested in 2011 by myself were implemented, this situation could not have arisen today. If the proposals suggested regarding the power crisis of the Puttalam coal power plant were implemented, we would not have to purchase power from outside.
This has caused a loss of Rs. 400 million to the government. The agreement for the Lakvijaya power plant was signed with the Chinese company by the former Chainman and the project director of CEB and not the politicians.
Therefore, they cannot say now the plant has many faults. Today CEB Chairman get a monthly salary of over one million and the deputy general manager over 700,000 which is acceptable since they have work hard to serve the people.
But they should be dedicated and committed to provide uninterrupted power to the masses.

Minister should crackdown on sports mafia
UPFA MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said in Parliament yesterday that sports mafia which was under control sometime back has raised its head again.
The Sports Minister should crack down on the sports mafia while bringing necessary laws to uplift the sports sector.
He said so, while participating in the debate on regulations under the Convention against Doping in Sport Act.
During my time, there was a huge sport mafia. But I managed to control it. There was a Secretary of former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who was involved in athletics. But, I managed to remove him from that position. We did not dance according to the tunes of National Olympic Committee. We also removed Manilal Fernando from football and stopped the mafia in the sports. Why Minister Jayasekara is unable to control
the mafia We also had a programme to take sports to village level during our regime. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa allocated Rs. 4,500 million to implement this programme considering its importance. But, this government has so far no such a programme to develop rural sports even after the lapse of 15 months in power.
The government has not even been able to hold an election for many sports bodies even after the lapse of 15 months, he said.

Five ministries to manage Meethotamulla garbage dump
A special programme has been implemented jointly by five ministries to manage the garbage dump in Meethotamulla, Western Development and Megapolis Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said in Parliament yesterday.
Responding to a question by UNP MP S. M. Marikkar, the deputy minister said the recycling project of Meethotamulla garbage dump will be implemented as a public-private joint venture, adding that the project is earmarked for two years. He said when the UDA called for tenders for the project, 57 applicants had applied.
The project includes power generation. The lands required for the project have been released. A committee comprising of the Secretaries of the five ministries has been appointed to look into this project. In addition to these measures, the President has appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee and it is also deliberating on the ways and means of managing the Meethotamulla garbage dump, he said. The Deputy Minister said, as there had been opposition to the proposal to shift the garbage to Puttalam, attention had been paid on alternative proposals now. He said the residents in Meethotamulla who had been affected by the garbage dump would be compensated and given accommodation elsewhere in Kolonnawa with the coordination of the Colombo Municipal Council.

Seven army personnel, three sailors arrested under PTA
Seven Army personnel and three sailors were arrested under the provisions of Prevention of Terrorism Act as at January 14, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake said so in response to a question raised by Pivituru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Prabath Gammanpila for oral answers yesterday in Parliament. Another four Army personnel were arrested under provisions of other Acts other than the PTA. It also said that it was not ethical to reveal their names as the legal action in connection with these are not completed.

Sports sector highly commercialised
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday that the entire sports sector has been swamped by money today.
There is a growing use of steroids as sports has become highly commercialised today.
He said so, while participating in the debate on regulations under the Convention Against Doping in Sport Act. The sportsmen have become sick due to the usage of banned drugs. Some sportsmen appear in advertisements for various products. But this is damaging the image of sports as many products are not suitable for the human consumption. Therefore, there must be a disciplinary code for sportsmen that governs their commercial interests. There should be a unit to identify performance enhancing substances that are of Ayurvedic origin as well.

House at Wijerama reserved for former President
The house at No B-106 in Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 7 belonging to the Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry has been reserved as the official residence for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This was noted in a document tabled in Parliament by Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister Ranjtih Maddumabandara in response to a question by opposition member Udaya Gammanpila.
The document also said that the said residence were allocated with effected from August 28, 2015 following instructions dated August 26, 2015 from the Presidential Secretariat to allocate a residence for the former President.

Ministers, Deputies galore: Tylvin

Two more Deputy Ministers and a State Minister were appointed by the government on Wednesday. This is a very grave situation. The appointment of ministers has become a joke today. Even the government cannot give a proper count of the number of Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers because it is unpredictable like the weather pattern today, JVP Secretary Tylvin Silva said.
The government has been appointing new Ministers, Deputy and State Ministers at a rate since last August, the JVP Secretary said.
Addressing a press conference at JVP headquarters in Battaramulla, Silva said the government seemed to be acting against the people's mandate.
The number of Cabinet Ministers in the Rajapaksa Cabinet exceeded 100. The appointment of Ministers for the sake of stabilising the government's position is wrong. Ministers should be appointed according to the country's development needs, he said.
Earlier, civil organisations and the JVP opposed the culture of appointing ministers and said the number of ministers should be categorically spelled out in the constitution. This suggestion was accepted even by President Maithripala Sirisena at that juncture, Silva said.
Silva said when the 19th amendment to the constitution was adopted during the 100 day government, section 46.1 specifically stated that the number of Ministers should not exceed beyond 30 and State and Deputy Ministers should not exceed 40. But the government later circumvented this by adding a clause that Parliament can make a discussion on the number of Ministers when a national government is formed, he said.
Silva said today the prices of goods had sky rocketed during the New Year season.
"Instead of providing relief to the people, the government had started gifting Parliamentarians with ministerial posts," he said.
Silva said he wished to question the government about the scientific basis on which it appointed Ministers and Deputy Ministers.

Code of Ethics for MPs bars assault, intimidation

MPs have been barred from assaulting, harassing or intimidating another person in terms of the draft Code of Conduct ,distributed among the MPs yesterday.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced in Parliament that copies of draft Code of Conduct for MPs had been placed on the tables of all MPs. He asked the MPs to go through the draft and send their opinions and suggestions on it to the Office of the Secretary General of Parliament in writing within two weeks.
He said the Code of Conduct is accessible in all three languages. The Speaker, commenting on the protests of Joint Opposition MPs in the Parliament chamber on the previous day, also stated that such incidents belittle the dignity of MPs.
The introduction of a Code of Conduct for MPs was an election pledge of President Maithripala Sirisena and his Government.
According to the draft, all MPs are expected to act in a manner that is respectful of their fellow MPs and citizens including parliamentary staff with dignity and courtesy, without diminishing the dignity of the Parliamentary institution.
The Code comprises eight sections namely, purpose of the code, scope of the code, duties of MPs, general principles of conduct, rules of conduct, upholding the code, enforcement and making and updating the code.
MPs shall disclose sufficient information regarding their business relationships and financial interests, including information of close family members. This would increase the public trust in MPs and confidence that they will act to advance the public interest rather than private interests.
"Members shall fulfill conscientiously the requirements of the House in respect of the registration of interests in the Register of Members' Financial Interests. Each Member shall disclose to Parliament all relevant interests that a reasonable person might think could give rise to the perception of influencing behavior between the Member's duties and responsibilities and his/her personal interests (e.g. land and property assets, share-holdings, gifts, foreign travel, symbolic rewards (e.g. honorary degree), sources of income, remunerated employment, directorships, liabilities, hospitality and affiliations). This applies to items received and could also apply to items donated or given. These shall be disclosed immediately following election and continuously updated within a reasonable period specified by Parliament," the draft Code says.
"A member shall not vote in a division on a question about a matter, other than public money (ie government policy, not identifying any particular person individually and immediately) in which he or she has a particular direct pecuniary interest."
"Whenever a Member has a personal or specific pecuniary interest (direct or indirect) in a matter being considered by Parliament or a committee thereof, he or she shall declare the nature of such interest
notwithstanding any registration of his or her interests in the Register, and shall not participate in any debate taking place in the House or its committees before making such declaration," the draft says.
Under the principle of openness, the draft says: MPs should be open to the public as much as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands."
Under the rules of conduct, draft says: MPs shall act in good conscience; respect human rights and intrinsic dignity of all; act as to merit the trust and respect of citizens and community; give effect to the ideals of democratic government, abide by the letter and spirit of the constitution and uphold the separation of powers and the rule of law; hold themselves accountable for the conduct and duties for which they are responsible and exercise the privileges and discharge the duties of public offices diligently and with civility, dignity, care and honour.
"In upholding parliamentary democracy, every Member of Parliament has a responsibility to ensure that the executive government is accountable to Parliament," the draft of the Code says.
Every member shall attend every sitting of the House and meeting of the committees of which he or she is a member, in accordance with practice of the House, except with reasonable excuse or in the case of extended absence, if excused in accordance with the practice of the House.
"Any person or member can make a complaint relating to alleged unethical conduct of breach of the Code of Conduct by an MP or alleged incorrect information of a member's interests. Provided that if a complaint if made by any person, it shall be forwarded by a Member.
A complaint shall be made in writing and addressed to the Speaker, who may allow the Member to raise it at the appropriate time in the House. The Speaker, having gone through the motion may allow it to be referred to the Committee on Privileges and Ethics on a resolution moved and approved by Parliament, for examination, investigation and report.
The complainant must declare the identity and submit supporting evidence, documentary or otherwise to substantiate the allegations.
After investigation, the committee must present a report to the Speaker who must determine whether or not a breach has occurred and if a breach has occurred refer the report to the House for further proceedings in accordance with its rules.
"Where it has been found that a Member has indulged in unethical behavior or that there is other misconduct or that the Member has contravened the Code, the committee may recommend the imposition of one or more of the following sanctions (a) censure (b) reprimand (c)suspension from the House for a specific period not exceeding the limits set by the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act and (d) any other sanction the Supreme Court may prescribe on a matter that has been referred to the Supreme Court by Parliament under the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act," the draft Code said.

Sri Lanka to sign the Paris Agreement



Sri Lanka is to sign the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on April 22 at the UN headquarters, New York.

Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha is to sign the agreement on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The Cabinet approval was granted last Wednesday for the ratification of this Agreement and to assign Minister Premajayantha to participate in the high level signature ceremony on April 22 as of a proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena.

During this visit the Minister will also attend the UN General Assembly on the World Drug Problem and the High Level Thematic Debate on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Paris Agreement is a historic move to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. The main aim of it is to keep a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius in this century and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The agreement also aims to strengthen the ability to deal with the impacts of climate change by putting in place appropriate financial flows. It was an outcome at the 21st session of the UNFCCC held in Paris from November 30-December 11 last year.
