New Board  for SriLankan soon
The resignation letters of the Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines (UL) have been accepted and a new Board would be appointed shortly, said of Public Enterprises Development Kabir Hashim.
Addressing a press briefing convened at the UNP Headquarters he said the government has no intention of selling off Sri Lankan but added that they would welcome a Public Private Partnership (PPP).
He said during the Presidents visit to Qatar, he met the Emir of Qatar who had shown keen interest in Sri Lankan Airlines and had subsequently sent a high level minister to hold discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities in this regard.
The discussions were very successful and we are currently awaiting a response from them. We dont mind which international airline but we will negotiate with them and get the best deal for SriLankan. Some people are alleging that we are trying to close up SriLankan Airlines. But, I as the minister can assure that we have no intention of selling it off. But we need a good international partner to work with us. They will do the management but Sri Lanka will still hold shares in it.
In response to a question posed by a journalist on the Weliamuna report on Sri Lankan Airlines, the minister said he had made a request to include the recommendations of the Weliamuna report into the findings of the new committee report. What we want is transparency. The Weliamuna report had a lot of very constructive points which I requested to be included as well.
The minister said that within a few days a new Board would be appointed but declined to name the proposed named.
Meanwhile issuing a Communiqu SriLankan Airlines states that contrary to popular belief, the Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines have taken all action possible to address the internal and disciplinary issues highlighted in the J C Weliamuna Report.
In September 2017, a comprehensive docket containing the Companys responses in connection with the Weliamuna Report were submitted to the Chairman of the COPE Sunil Handunnetti, M.P. Most recently, a further update in January 2018 was submitted to Minister Kabir Hashim, Minister of Public Enterprise Development.
The release also states that in July 2016, Minister Hashim requested that a forensic audit on the financial transaction and affairs referred to in the Weliamuna Report be conducted by forensic accounting services but owing to the high cost involved, the decision was abandoned by the Minister.

People fund development projects, not politicians
Public funded projects do not belong to one party; allocations for them are made regardless of party politics, Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya said as he warned political parties not to mislead people by using public infrastructure projects.
He was addressing a media conference held at the Election Secretariat in Rajagiriya yesterday. The Chairman highlighted the responsibilities of public servants to remain apolitical in the upcoming polls.
Postal voting cards for many districts were sent. A few more will be sent today (19), Deshapriya said. He said postal voting for Police and officials at District Secretariats and election officers would take place on January 22.
Persons working in other government officers, army camps, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) depots and offices, provincial educational offices, national schools and provincial schools will vote on January 25 and 26, he said.
Those who are unable to vote on the dates, will be allowed to cast their vote on February 1 at the offices of the Elections Commission island-wide, he said.
Each party can send a party representative who does not work at any of these government offices to monitor the polls, Deshapriya said.
The Elections Commission has taken steps to send a list of candidates contesting for each ward along with the postal ballot papers. Deshapriya explained that though the Elections Commission is not bound to do this by law, they have adopted the measure to help the government servants take a more informed decision.
The Commission has taken measures to paste posters in government offices stating that staff of them need not be grateful or bound to any candidate for having undertaken public projects using local government funds, This is not an attack on any party but remember, the roads were built using public funds not party funds, Deshapriya said.
The Chairman noted that they have managed to control distributing goods using state resources but now find that candidates are distributing goods using their own funds.
Take the goods, but dont sell your vote. You are not bound to anyone, he said and added, Politicians have a very poor view of our people. They believe that they can win votes by giving a child school books. We ask the people not to be fooled, he said.
The Chairman of the Commission emphasised that its Extraordinary Gazette, Media guidelines under article 104b(5)(a) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka published on December 4, specifically asked that not only print, electronic and digital media, but also all propaganda to stop their political programs 48 hours prior to the election. It also applied to social media and telephone services, he said.
Teams have been deployed district wise to take down complaints and act on them, Deshapriya said. Hambantota and Tissamaharama had the highest complaints on illegal display of posters. We removed all of them, he said.
Political parties have been asked to use minimal decoration 400m from the area where political meetings are held and to have the major decorations and cut outs only at the meeting place.
This local government election has fared much better than the ones in the past when taken into account a few incidences of violence occurred in the period, Deshapriya said. He appealed to all citizens to report cases of violations and violence to help keep the election free and fair.
The Elections Commission works slower than God, but we will come after you, before or after the election and action will be taken, Deshapriya warned.

World Cups arrival will enhance popularity of football in Sri Lanka - Mukherjee
Sri Lankan Football fans will get the opportunity of seeing the FIFA World Cup with their own eyes when the World Cup 2018 arrives in the country on January 23 in a specially chartered flight from Russia.
The FIFA World Cup will be staged this year in Russia from June 14 to July 15 with the final scheduled to be played in Moscow.
The Cup was handed over to the host countrys football governing body FIFA on September 19, 2017 and was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin on behalf of the governing body in Russia. As a custom the Cup is taken on a tour which covers all five continents. The tour begins on January 23 and its first stopover will be Sri Lanka which makes history for Sri Lankan Football which has been in existence for over 75 years.
The sponsors of the World Cup 2018 Coca Cola Company in association with the Ministry of Sports, Football Federation of Sri Lanka and Tourism have made elaborate arrangements for this historic event. Vice President, South West Asia Operations  Coca Cola, Dababrata Mukherjee has done an invaluable service to make Sri Lanka as the first stop over for FIFA World Cups tour of its world tour.
A press briefing was held at the Sports Ministry Auditorium yesterday to officially announce the arrival of the World Cup to Sri Lanka. Addressing the media Mukherjee stated that it is an opportunity for all Sri Lanka fans to have a glimpse of a World Cup with their own eyes which will never go out from their memories.
He further said that Coca Cola is happy to be associated with a game that is known as the most prestigious and highly patronized sport in the world.
Mukherjee said that to make this event a great success he received the unstinted support from the Minister of Sports and FFSL officials. He also thanked the Minister of Tourism for coming forward to help the Sports Ministry and the Football Federation with the view of promoting the sport and also the tourism industry.
Mukherjee was of the impression that the World Cups arrival will enhance the popularity of football in Sri Lanka which could turn a new chapter for football in the island.
The organizers decision to touch Sri Lankan soil on the World Cup tour and also to make it the first stopover is something that we Sri Lankans can be proud of. It goes on to prove that Sri Lankan people are honored even by foreign sports organizations, said Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera.
Sri Lankan football and the present officials are working hard to resurrect the game but with many other issues they are not able to work out their plans in the right direction. With this sort of event taking place in Sri Lanka the public too might turn their eyes towards this and the possibility of their supporting the Federation in big way, the Minister further added.
The Minister paid a glowing tribute to President Maithripala Sirisena for consenting to be the chief guest to receive the World Cup on its arrival and also for extending the fullest backing for the event.
The World Cup on its arrival will be brought to Shangri-La Hotel where the President will unveil it in the presence of foreign dignitaries and other invitees. The public and football fans will be offered an opportunity to view the Cup at the BMICH on January 24 from 9.00 a.m.

Yan Oya expansion:
Affected families to be compensated
The families whose land and properties acquired for accommodating Yan Oya reservoir, are undergoing untold hardships due to the prolongation of the resettlement in new colonies.
The main dam of 3 km of Yan Oya reservoir in Anuradhapura north close to Wahalkada has been completed one year in advance before the targeted period and testing filling of this reservoir is being delayed due to the chaotic situation concerning the resettlement of a population of around 10,000 in 1,800 families. According to the Yan Oya reservoir project sources, 4,127 hectares are being submerged to reservoir including private property and forest reservations.
The number of plots of land is 3,816. These families have been living in the ancestral villages such as Puliyankulama, Puhudivula, Elapatthewa, Mawathawewa, Aliyakada, Marandanmadu, Mahasorowwewa, Kandamalawa, Kimbulpetiyawa, Hapetiyawa, Daburugaswewa and Dikwewa located in the 60th Horowpathana and Gomarankadawala DS divisions.
Although priority should have been given to resettle destitute families with housing and land compensation being paid before construction work, that procedure had not been followed. However, after a three year delay, housing land and compensation are being paid to 220 families.
Housing construction has been delayed since Forest Conservation authorities have refused permission to clear the thick jungle covering the demarcated housing landscape without the sanction of the Central Environment Authority.
A spokesman of the Yan Oya reservoir project said that even though the reservoir has been filled and resettlement scheme completed, there was no way to distribute water from the reservoir since construction at both left and the South canals are not over. Only the initial construction work at the 12 km long left bank canal is in progress.
The main component, which is the 22 km long left bank canal construction has not commenced still. This canal carrying water to Padaviya area is to feed around 20,000 acres of land. The sources indicate that the Chinese CAMC company which successfully completed the work at the reservoir including main dam and three saddle dams is being entrusted with the left bank canal construction.
Irrigation Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soyza will submit a cabinet memorandum requesting approval to pay compensation for cultivation seasons being deprived of to all families at the rate of Rs. 35,000 per acre from 2017/2018 Maha Season, until they have been offered alternative muddy land and the first harvest yielded.
The project management has taken action to pay those families who have put up new houses in the new colony reserved for them, a monthly life supporting allowance of Rs 8,000 as a temporary relief measure.

The Bollywood film breaking the taboo around periods

The world's first feature film on periods is set to be released in the UK. Can a comedy help break the taboo of female menstruation
It's a scene that captures the 20-year struggle by a poor school drop-out from southern India to buy sanitary pads for his wife - and ended up changing the lives of millions of women around the world.
Arunachalam Muruganantham - played by Bollywood star Akshay Kumar - cycles through his local village waving cheerfully.
Unbeknown to his neighbours, he is testing the effectiveness of his new invention by wearing pink pants and a home-made sanitary pad which is slowly filling with goat's blood from a football bladder tied around his waist.
But behind the laughter of the comedy- Pad Man - is the true story of how Muruganantham invented a low-cost machine thatrevolutionised women's healthcare.
It started in 1998 when newly married Muruganantham noticed his wife Shanti hiding something.
"It was a nasty rag cloth - she was going to use it during her menstruation. I wouldn't even use it to clean my vehicle," he tellsthe BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
"So I decided to gift her a sanitary pad. The shopkeeper gave it to me as a smuggled product. Out of curiosity I opened the packet. The cotton product was sold for four rupees (4p) - 40 times what it cost to make."
Muruganantham, now 55, threw himself into researching a cheaper alternative.
Period poverty leaves an estimated 300 million women in India without access to sanitary products - making them vulnerable to disease, infertility and even death.
He began analysing pads from Western companies, canvassing opinions - and used napkins - of female medical students and, finally, tested his inventions out himself.
"I wanted volunteers to try my new pads and give me feedback - but not even my wife was ready."
It all came at a cost.
"My wife left, mother left. The whole village thought I had a sexual disease," he explains.
But he persevered, and in 2006 launched not-for-profit Jayaashree Industries, which supplies machines making Muruganantham's sanitary pads at cost-price to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and women's organisations across India.
Today it reaches an estimated 40 million Indian women, and there are plans to take the machines to Kenya, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Bangladesh.
Twinkle Khanna, Pad Man's co-producer, spotted his story online and says she was immediately gripped by the magnitude of what he had achieved.
"I thought this was a remarkable story which really needed to reach every household in India, and globally, because I think the taboo around menstruation is not just in India, it's a global problem."
Khanna's husband, actor Akshay Kumar, immediately signed on to play Muruganantham.
The 50-year-old, who is a popular and powerful role model in India, has a history of political message projects and is calling for sanitary pads to be made free for all women in India.
"Tackling the taboo is very important to me, because I am only now learning about the extent of the crises that countries around the world have been suffering with," he tells the programme.
"I'm ashamed to say how little of all this I knew, which is why this issue has become so close to my heart.
"The conversation is starting though - I've seen men talking about pads on my social media account.
"After Pad Man starts the conversation, it will be up to audiences to take it forward and help to end all of the taboos around periods worldwide."
But period poverty is not only a problem affecting women in India.
In the UK, one in 10 disadvantaged girls below the age of 21 cannot afford sanitary products, according to charity Plan International UK.
Manjit Gill, who co-runs London based charity Binti - which campaigns against period poverty - says the film is a watershed moment for "smashing shame around periods".
"We have worked with Muruganantham for a few years now - we use one of his machines in India - and he really does have a halo," she says.
"The conversation has definitely been started around this film - the words 'pad' and 'periods' have been used more in the last month than in the last 10 years."
The potentially revolutionary nature of Pad Man lies not only in how it tackles a subject that is still considered unmentionable in many countries, but also in the vote of confidence from distributors Sony Pictures in giving a foreign language film about periods a worldwide release as a major motion picture.
The real 'Pad Man', who now has a daughter with his wife after she came back to him, feels "happy" about seeing his life on the big screen but prefers to throw a spotlight on the women taking the movement forward.
Despite his success, he owns no shares in his company and earns roughly 70,000 Rupees (790) a month - enough for him to cover the storage and transportation for the raw material he imports from the US and Germany.
"A school drop-out, to a rural innovator, to now [there being] a movie, shows the power of dreams," Muruganantham says.
"My vision is to make India into a 100% sanitary-pad using country. Menstruation is no more a taboo."

CEB strike called off
The Ceylon Electricity Board Workers Unions called off the strike action they launched on Wednesday to prevent the workers from being inconvenienced further.
Secretary of the National Workers Union Ajith Devapriya said they called off the strike pending a decision by the authorities regarding their demands.
He said they did not want the workers to be further inconvenienced as the workers who participated in the protest on Wednesday had been brutally attacked by the Police Special Task Force (STF) and the Riot Police without any provocation, while they were engaged in a peaceful protest demanding for their rights.
He said if a favourable response was not received, they would bring all the CEB workers to Colombo in a massive protest by February 7 or 8.

Citizens' Mail
Swallowed up by cost
I am compelled to write this story to this column to make public aware of a transaction done in a certain leading private bank best known for offering pride of place to the Buddhists.
On December 31, 2017, I tried withdrawing cash through the ATM in Rambukkana around 6 p.m. The balance of my savings account, I was certain, was placed at Rs 37,000. I keyed in the amount I require as Rs 25,000. But then what went on the screen made me gasp with surprise. Funds not available, it read, and vanished in a few seconds. I tried three times only to get the same results.
The security guard was witness to this scenario and demanded an explanation. Following my brief explanation, he suggested to request the amount in small portions because the machine is to be reloaded. I requested for Rs 10,000 in a hurry.
The machine responded to my request. I hurried out because I was a bit concerned about the expanding queue outside. In leisure I started counting the notes to find out that I had been issued only Rs 4000 (five notes of Rs 500 and 15 notes of Rs 100). I reported this immediately to the security guard who consoled me promising that the bank would credit the balance in a day or two.
As the following day was Duruthu Full Moon Poya, I could not submit the perfected form to the Rambukkana branch. I submitted the same to the Galewela branch of this bank on January 2. I had been assured that my request would be immediately forwarded to the Rambukkana branch.
After the lapse of two days, I inquired from the Rambukkana branch. The case had been referred to the head office, I was informed. On January 10, I was called by the Rambukkana branch to be confirmed that the account balance as well as the monies I had been issued stands accurate.
That explanation was not convincing enough! The lady officer shot a few questions to ascertain my workplace and the notes I had been issued from the machine. Finally, she promised to contact me after getting in touch with the Head Office.
I rang her the following day. The lady offered me the same conclusion adding that she needs to check the CCTV camera system to check how much I counted at the ATM door. In case the cameras failed to detect how much I had counted, I have to bear the brunt of that loss.
Who is at fault now The faulty, outdated, ATM systems of this so called super bank or otherwise
Let me pose this question to the administration of this bank that claims to present our future in their motto: Is this the way you treat the poor customers struggling with their hard-accrued money

Opportunities and challenges of Sri Lankan economy:
Clear-sighted growth
This essay, extracted from Island of the lion and land of the dragon sixty years of Sino -Lanka Relations published by Pathfinder, was authored by Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy before assuming duties as the Governor of the Central Bank.
The Sri Lankan economy is at an inflection point. There is considerable potential to place the economy on a path of accelerated growth and development. Equally, there are challenges which need to be addressed.
The opportunities are based on Sri Lanka's resilient economy; policies supportive of growth and employment; its educated workforce; strategic location and connectivity; preferential access to large markets; fast developing infrastructure; and the increasingly vibrant business environment.
The challenges include moving Sri Lanka out of the unsustainable twin deficit (budget and current account of the balance of payments) category through: fiscal consolidation; developing a new growth model which fosters sustained expansion of economic activity and employment generation; an improved investment climate and trading environment which improves productivity/competitiveness; and skilling of the workforce to support a rapidly modernizing economy.
Stabilising the economy
The budget deficit has been the main source of instability in the system in the post-1978 era. The current account has been in deficit in every year since 1987. This has led to an accumulated debt problem which has increased the risks associated with the Sri Lankan economy. The country has been able to live beyond its means as it was a donor darling, which had access to large quantities of highly concessional official development assistance (Foreign aid). Today, there is a new paradigm as it is a lower middle-income country which is no longer eligible for highly concessional assistance. There is also increased exposure to rating agencies and intentional capital markets. This places a very high premium on sound macroeconomic management.
In the past, excess demand pumped into the economy by the Government's fiscal operations has fuelled inflation and exerted pressure on the balance of payments. This has inevitably led to an overheating of the economy and subsequent compression of domestic absorption through a stabilization programme. The consequence has been repeating cycles of stop-go policies. The post-1978 economy can be caricatured as a high fiscal deficit, high inflation, high nominal interest rate and over-valued currency economy. This is diametrically the opposite from the successful economies of East and South East Asia.
Sri Lanka's persistent fiscal deficits have resulted in fragile debt dynamics. Debt as a percentage of GDP amounts to 76% (215). The corresponding figures for comparator countries are Malaysia: 56.4% Philippines: 37.1%; and Thailand: 43.1%. The median figure for peer countries with a similar rating is about 40%. Not only is Sri Lanka very much an outlier in terms of the size of its debt stock but the composition of the debt has also changed, thereby increasing vulnerability.
The share of external debt has increased and within that there is also a relatively high level of short-term debt. Total debt servicing now accounts for over 90% of revenue and there has been a primary deficit. The external debt service ratio (as a percentage of export earnings) is 27%, above the prudential norm of 20%.
There is neither fiscal space nor a cushion terms of external reserves. Resilience has to be built through fiscal consolidation: increased foreign exchange earnings (exports of goods and services) and larger non-debt creating foreign inflows, particularly FDI.
The Government has embarked upon concerted remedial measures. Fiscal reform is at the centre of the Government's stabilization programme and revenue growth is at the heart of the fiscal reform. The reform programme is being supported by an IMF Extended Fund Facility (USD 1.5 bn). The EFF provides some financing but more importantly, it catalyses other bilateral and multilateral funds, as well as providing increased access to international capital markets.
There has been a sharp fall in total revenue from over 20% of GDP to 11.4% in 2014 and 13% last year. The corresponding figures for comparator countries are Malaysia 22/2% of GDP: Philippines 19.4% and Thailand 22.6%. Priority is being attached to strengthening revenue mobilization. VAT has been increased from 11% to 15% and some exemptions have been eliminated. The Government plans to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act. The intention is to move to a simpler and fairer system which widens the tax base. There is expected to be a shift from the current 80-20% indirect/ direct tax mix to a 60/40% outcome. The complex regime of tax relief is likely to be replaced by up-front investment-linked incentives and a low tax regime. Improvements in tax administration are also in the pipeline. The key components of this will be grater digitalization through the Revenue Authority management information System (RAMIS) and the greater decentralization of tax collection.
A number of measures are also expected to be introduced to strengthen public expenditure management, including the adoption of ITMIS next year. The overall level of expenditure is sustainable at 20.3% of GDP in 2015. The corresponding figures for comparator countries are Malaysia 25.3%), Philippines (19.4%) and Thailand (22.3%). it is noteworthy that Malaysia has a deficit of 3% of GDP and the other two countries balance their budgets. On the expenditure side, the focus is expected to be on improving its quality and composition, while mainstreaming sustainability; Social inclusion and gender parity.
In the current constrained fiscal environment, has been announced that there will be greater recourse to PPPs (particularly BOT) and alternative off-balance sheet financings, such as securitisation and structured financial instruments.
The Government has also embarked upon a programme of SOE reform. Sri Lankan Airlines is being restructured and expressions of interest have been received from potential strategic investors. A number of non-strategic assets (hotels and commercial real estate) are in the pipeline for divestment. Other loss-making SOEs are being restructured, including through improved corporate governance. There is also the intention to establish a holding company similar to Temasek (Singapore) in order to drive the increased commercialization of the SOE sector.
The trajectory of fiscal consolidation envisages the fiscal deficit to be 5.4% of GDP in 2016; 4.7% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2020. The EFF performance targets (budget, inflation and net international reserves) have been met for June and September 2016. The authorities have indicated their confidence that the IMF Executive Board Review, in November 2016, will result in the programme being kept on track.
Fiscal consolidation is expected to make the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies less challenging. It becomes easier to deliver low and stable interest rates and a competitive and stable exchange rate when the budget deficit is not pumping excess demand into the system.
On monetary policy, the authorities have indicated a move to a forward-looking monetary policy which is set within a medium-term framework. It has also been announced that a flexible inflation targeting regime will be adopted reflecting a shift from a system, which is currently focused on monetary aggregates. In addition, it is important to maintain a competitive real effective exchange rate in order to support the export expansion, which is necessary for boosting growth and employment, as well as servicing external debt.
More stable fiscal outcomes also make it easier to have greater predictability and consistency in the overall policy framework. Ad hoc changes in policy have been driven by cash flow challenges confronting Government fiscal operations. It is encouraging that the fiscal targets have been met so far, in 2016, despite the VAT disruption.
The external account has been characterized by deficits in the current account of the balance of payments. Unlike the successful countries of East and South East Asia. Sri Lanka has not been able to drive sustained growth through surpluses in the current account.
The major weakness has been the structural deficit in the trade account. Sri Lanka's export performance has been disappointing. Exports were USD 1.9 bn in 1990 and amount to USD 10 bn today. During the same period, Vietnam's exports increased from USD 2.4 bn to USD 162 bn. There has been a lack of product and market diversification and little progress has been made in boosting the complexity of the export structure. The large trade deficit has been offset by increased earnings from tourism and remittances (almost 10% of GDP). The current account deficit is expected to be 2.5% of GDP in 2016 and 2% next year. Reserves continue to be too dependent on borrowed financing.
New growth model
Robust macroeconomic fundamentals are essential for sustained growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. As argued above, stabilization based on fiscal consolidation is crucial to achieving this. However, stabilization is a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustained growth. One also needs to strengthen the supply side of the economy to accelerate growth; create one million livelihoods and increase the incomes of the people.
In this connection, the Prime Minister's Statement (October 27, 2016) spells out a vision which involves the private sector being the locomotive for growth and employment creation. Exports and FDI will be key pillars of the new model for increasing growth, employment and incomes. Previously, the main impetus for economic activity was based on foreign commercial borrowing financed public investment in infrastructure development. This model has run out of headroom due to a lack of fiscal space and the fragile debt dynamics. The new approach, which gives priority to exports and FDI, is being promoted in the context of the new mediocre of low global growth and sluggish international trade. However, Sri Lanka's strategic geographical location and excellent international relations, including with the capital surplus countries in East and South East Asia, offset the less than promising global economic context. In this connection, it is pertinent to point out that Sri Lanka is 20 miles from India, the fastest growing large economy in the world, and in the middle of China's maritime silk route.
There are pragmatic economic justifications for adopting a development strategy which prioritises the private sector, exports and FDI. The lack of fiscal space and the public debt burden rules out a statist approach. Private investment, domestic and foreign, has to take the lead in transforming the economy while the State plays an important role in setting the rules, regulations and standards; as well as ensuring the inclusiveness and environmental sustainability of the development path.
In addition, a domestic market of 21 million persons cannot support the growth of 7% plus on a sustained basis. Sri Lanka has to be more successful in penetrating international markets, including global and regional value chains. It is important to earn rather than borrow foreign exchange to meet our import needs, service debt and build the international reserves required as a buffer (insurance) in an uncertain world. All the successful East and South East Asian countries adopted an export-led growth model. It is noteworthy that the World Bank's Systematic Country diagnostic found that the Sri Lankan economy is as closed today as it was in 1970. A significant amount of the opening of the economy which had taken place has been reversed in recent years largely through a plethora of para-tariffs. These need to be eliminated over the medium-term while managing the impact on Government revenue.
Increased FDI is necessary as the country needs more non-debt creating foreign inflows to fill the savings-investment gap, which amounts to about 5% of GDP (USD 4 bn). FDI also brings in technology, markets, branding and know-how. Sri Lanka is attracting less than 1.5% of GDP as FDI, even seven years after the end of the conflict. Countries like Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have attracted three or four times that.
One may conclude that a private sector driven development model, with exports and FDI as key pillars is the most appropriate option given Sri Lanka's specific circumstances. It offers the best prospect for achieving the Government's target of creating one million livelihoods.
Inclusion can be promoted by empowering people through education, training and skills development so they can participate in the new growth sectors in the economy. Promoting SMEs and increasing agricultural productivity is also an important part of this narrative.
This can be supported by a well-designed, targeted and technology-driven social safety net to protect the poor and vulnerable through income transfers rather than subsidies which distort relative prices and lead to a misallocation of financial and human resources. The National Identity Card scheme, very high mobile penetration and the number of persons with bank accounts provide a sound foundation for the biometric card is driven system which is being proposed.
Sri Lanka is a signatory to the SDGs and the Paris declaration. Hence, it is important to mainstream sustainability and poverty elimination into the planning and budgetary processes.
Fostering a competitive economy 
Improving the investmentclimate
Sri Lanka is ranked 110 in the World Bank's Doing Business Index (DBI). Priority needs to be attached to improving performance in areas, such as enforcing contracts (163); paying taxes (158); registering property (155); and getting credit (118). The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is coordinating a process which involves 10 Task forces each of which comprises all the stakeholders for the different pillars of the DBI. The target is to raise Sri Lanka's ranking to 70 by 2020.
Investment promotion
A one-stop-shop has been established at the BOI and performance improvement is being driven through a set of TORs developed with the assistance of the World Bank. There will be a focus on both attraction and facilitation. There is also a review of investment laws and incentives.
The country is seeking to implement a development programme designed to meet the multiple objectives: economic prosperity, social justice, environmental sustainability and gender empowerment. The key challenge will be effective implementation. It is important to build a national consensus and involve all stakeholders. Sri Lanka was second to Japan in Asia on most indicators at the time of independence. Today, it has slipped behind several other countries. Many opportunities have been lost during the last 68 years. The current historical conjuncture holds considerable promise. The opportunities have to be grasped. That is the challenge for all Sri Lankans.

Conflict within govt. harmful to economy: Muzammil
The conflict between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) factions in the government is harmful to the national economy as this would reduce foreign investment, said National Freedom Front (NFF) Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil yesterday.
He said the conflict between President Maithripala Sirisena-led faction and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe-led faction would lead the country to severe political instability.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the NFF party office in Pitakotte. Muzammil said the SLFP faction in the government attempts to win the impending local government election alone while the UNP attempts for the same. He added that this was nothing but a play that would last until February 10 and then they would go together.
He added that only the English copy of the report of the Presidential Commission on the Bond issue had been handed over to the Speaker and it cannot be presented to Parliament until the Sinhala and Tamil translations are handed over to the Speaker.
"So this matter cannot be taken up before Parliament soon," Muzammil said.

Corruption case against ex-CJ Peiris
The Bribery Commission yesterday filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court against former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former LECO Chairman M.M.C. Ferdinando.
This is over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO).
Accordingly, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara issued summons on the three accused to be present in Court on March 8.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this case against the three accused under Section 70 of the Bribery Act. The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had committed this offence on or around December 1, 2010 and December 30, 2010 while Mohan Peiris was serving as the Attorney General and A.H.M.D. Nawaz was functioning as a Deputy Solicitor General at the Attorney Generals Department. Third accused M.M.C. Ferdinando was the former chairman of LECO.
The Bribery Commission maintained that two committees appointed to look into the alleged misappropriation of funds at LECO had recommended to institute legal action against the perpetrators under the Penal Code for misappropriation and under the Bribery Act for corruption charges.
The Bribery Commission alleged that contrary to the recommendations made by two committee reports, former Attorney General Mohan Peiris and A.H.M.D. Nawaz had made recommendations not to institute criminal investigations against the perpetrators, in a manner of conferring a wrongful or unlawful benefit and favour or advantage to the perpetrators.
It is learnt that several complaints had been made regarding an incident on alleged misappropriation of Rs.260 million at LECO when purchasing properties to the LECO.
The Bribery Commission has listed 15 persons as witnesses and 19 documents as production items of the case.

Dead army officers claim doubtful: CID
The Army Intelligence Officer who had committed suicide by hanging himself in 2016, having written a letter taking responsibility for the killing of senior journalist and Sunday Leader Chief Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, had in fact spent that day in the Kegalle area, the CID informed the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday.
This revelation is based on the officers telephone records, unearthed by the CID.
The army intelligence officer, who was a resident of Kegalle had written this letter claiming responsibility for the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunge and hung himself thereafter.
However, the CID notified court that while the handwriting on the letter belongs to the said intelligence officer, the details in the letter are contradictory to the details of his phone records.
The information gathered by CID investigators were presented to the Magistrate revealing that the suspects who were arrested on suspicion of having carried out the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunge, had in fact been loitering near his home.
The case was taken up before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate, Mohammed Sahabdeen.
Further revealing the information uncovered through the investigations before court, the CID said the two youth identified as the owners of the motorcycle on which they had allegedly come to assassinate Lasantha, were found to be residents of Vavuniya.While Wickrematunge was assassinated on January 8, 2009, these two youths had been killed and their bodies had been burnt a few days prior to his assassination on January 1, 2009 by an unknown party and their charred bodies were found in the Anuradhapura area.
The Criminal Investigation Department informed court that the investigation into the murder of Wickrematunge began in March 2015 and officials have recorded statements from 950 persons regarding the incident.
It was also disclosed that 295 out of 950 such individuals are army intelligence officials.
The Department also informed court that the fingerprints found in the car of Lasantha Wickrematunge at the site where he was murdered did not tally with the fingerprints of intelligence officials of several army camps including the Tripoli Army Camp.
The Court was also informed that investigations into the vehicles that were following the Lasantha Wickramatungas car on that fateful day are continuing. The CID also informed court that they are investigating as to why 17 officials of Tripoli Army camp who were arrested in connection with this murder were released.
The CID also informed court that they handed over the CCTV footage of the route on which Wickrematunges car was plying from his wifes residence to office on this day, to the Moratuwa University for further study.The university had informed investigators that they are unable ascertain facts with regard to the CCTV footage.
The CID told court that they would hand over the investigation into such CCTV footage to another institute.
It was also revealed in court that the mobile phone of Lasantha Wickrematunge has been imported to the country in 2008 and the relevant phone and the SIM card have been sold to him by one of the three dealers of the Softlogic company. The CID told court that they are yet to identify the dealer who sold the particular phone to Wickrematunge.The notebook and other items which were in possession of Wickrematunge at the time of murder had been named as court productions by Sub Inspector Weerasinghe of the Mount Lavinia police.
The CID had found that these items had gone missing and the relevant page in the Police Record Book containing the details of these items had been replaced with another page.
The Criminal Investigation Department also informed court that the investigations reports conducted by the Mount Lavinia Police and the Terrorist Investigation Department into the murder have been destroyed.
The Sergeant Major who was arrested and remanded in connection with this murder was produced in court yesterday. Senior Lawyer Athula S. Ranagala appeared for the aggrieved party. The case was put off for March 15. The Magistrate ordered the CID to produce the progress of the report on the investigations

After the Political Lamp, the cloud lamp that reacts to the tweets from Donald Trump, this new creation by Parse/Error explores the connection between the human and the planet Earth, as a tangible interaction, and crystallizes our fear and our fascination for the power of nature.
Behind its appearance of a beautiful object, with a clean and simple design, the Earthquake Lamp unveils its true nature when it responds in real time to earthquakes from around the world with light pulses and a disturbing rumble.
A hidden face that immediately changes the observers behavior, between anxiety and fascination, but also invites him to contemplate the reality and beauty of a living planet, constantly in motion.
This creation is inspired among others by the great earthquake of Tohoku, in Japan in 2011.

Emirates to buy more A380s in $16bn deal
The $16bn (11.5bn) deal amounts to a reprieve for the A380 after Airbus threatened to stop making the jet if it could not come to a deal with Emirates.
Emirates is the only airline to have put the A380 at the heart of its operations and had been expected to place an order for more of the jets at the Dubai Airshow last November.
However, it then ordered 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners instead.
Emirates said it had now made a firm order for 20 of the A380, the world's largest passenger airliner, with options to buy a further 16. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2020.
Emirates is already the largest customer for the plane, with 101 currently flying and 41 more firm orders previously placed.
On Monday, Airbus sales director John Leahy said the company would have to halt the A380 programme if Emirates did not place another order.
This is a vital order for Airbus, which has been struggling to get airlines to buy its troubled superjumbo. It has been forced to slow production right down, from 27 aircraft annually a couple of years ago to 12 this year. It expected to deliver just eight in 2019.
Emirates is far and away the biggest customer for the A380. Without its backing, Airbus would eventually have had to close down the production line in Toulouse altogether. Now the programme has the life support it needs.
Airbus says today's order underscores its commitment to produce the A380 for at least another 10 years. By that time, growth in the aviation market may have recreated a business case for it.
The A380 was designed to carry large numbers of people between heavily congested hub airports, where take-off and landing slots are at a premium. In recent years, it hasn't been needed, because airlines have focused on using smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft to carry passengers, often on direct routes between secondary airports.
But if the market continues to grow rapidly, airport congestion may well become a serious issue again, particularly in Asia. At that point the A380 could come into its own.
The A380 project was first conceived in the early 1990s as an eventual successor to the Boeing 747, with development work beginning in earnest in 1993.
The plane has twin decks of seats, and is designed to incorporate amenities such as bars, lounges, beauty salons and duty-free shops, according to customer specification.
Before this latest deal, there had been a total of 317 orders for the A380 since its launch in 2007.
It made its debut commercial flight in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines flying from Singapore to Sydney.
Qantas took orders of the plane in 2008, flying the route between Melbourne and Los Angeles. Air France and Lufthansa have also flown the Airbus A380, but its largest customer over the years has been Emirates.

RS 12 BN PTL ASSETS ALREADY FROZEN:PMs address to the nation:
Govt. will recover Rs. 9.2 bn from Perpetual Treasuries
No financial loss will be caused to the government on account of the Central Bank Bond issue since the government will recover the Rs 9.2 billion involved from Perpetual Treasures Ltd. according to the procedure recommended by the Presidential Commission.
The Central Bank functioning under the Ministry of National Policy has already blocked and retained a fund of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasures Ltd from which this money could be obtained Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in a special address to the nation broadcast over the Electronic media last night. The Prime Minister said, we came to power on a mandate to eradicate bribery and corruption.
We pledged to punish people engaged in corruption irrespective of their position or party applications. Shortly after we assumed power an allegation was made regarding the issuing of Central Bank bonds.
We never tried to sweep it under the carpet. Within two weeks we appointed a committee to investigate the allegation.
The Central Bank Governor kept away from his post during the investigation period. We informed the Parliament about it and I requested that a Parliamentary Select Committee be appointed to probe it if needed. The investigations report was submitted to Parliament.
Continuing the Prime Minister said in the past the President of the committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) was a member of the government. But the Presidents post in COPE was given to an opposition member for the first time in the present Parliament. COPE investigated the issuing of Central Bank bonds and tabled its report in Parliament which debated it.
This report was sent to the Attorney General on October 31, 2016 for necessary action.
COPE had recommended further investigations about it specially about Perpetual Treasures Ltd. Accordingly the President after discussions with me (the Prime Minister) appointed a Presidential Commission to probe it. We too assisted the Commission in its investigations. Ministers in the government and I personally appeared before the Commission.
No past government has acted in this manner to investigate an allegation made against it. We held three separate investigations.
Several allegations of this nature were made during the past regime. But steps were never taken to investigate any of them.
Nothing was reported to Parliament, either, in the past. Questions raised in Parliament regarding them went unanswered
In Sri Lanka control of finance belonged to Parliament. But Parliament had forgotten this power vested in it. It is to stabilise Parliamentary control over finance that we entrusted this responsibility to COPE and Parliament. That responsibility cannot be taken away. We saw the Bond issue as an instance where Parliament exhibited its power over financial control properly. This was the best example which showed that the government was acting in a transparent manner.
The Commission report had stated that Perpetual Treasures Ltd had earned unconscionable profits amounting Rs 9.2 billion from the issuing of these bonds. This can be recovered from the funds amounting to Rs 12 billion belonging to Perpetual Treasures Ltd retained by the Central Bank.
If any group of officials are found guilty of this fraud legal action will be taken against them too.
The Prime Minister said, we rendered our maximum support to conduct investigations from the time the allegation was made against the issuing of Bonds. Our Ministers resigned for breaching accepted traditions. The law took effect and the Courts took independent decisions without any outside interference or influence. Apart from this we have appointed a committee chaired by Minister Tilak Marapane to conduct investigations against any party member against whom any allegations had been made by the Bond report and recommend suitable action against them. We will take action in keeping with recommendations made by this committee.
The Prime Minister said this is the normal UNP tradition. We will develop and rebuild the country in keeping with our party tradition and the Yahapalanaya vision. We will rebuild the villages and usher in a better tomorrow for the whole country and nation. The Prime Minister said: we will effect the change people expected on January 8 and create a better tomorrow for the whole country. But this cannot be realised overnight or within a day or two. We can consider the Bond Commission investigation as a beginning towards achieving this goal. We will pay equal attention to the past and present and march forward along the correct path by correcting our mistakes and fulfilling shortcomings.
The actions taken upto date from the time the allegation was made against the Bond issue proved that we have made a proper beginning. We will not only probe acts of corruption and fraud of the past regime but also investigate and take suitable action against corruption and fraud allegations made in the present day too. Our objective is to ensure a better future for the country and nation. Our prime goal is to transform this country into a rich and economically strong country. Let us join hands and work towards achieving that goal. Let us overcome all challenges and create a powerful and strong Sri Lanka.

The great Climb!
The Climb Everest with Johann Campaign was launched at the Hilton Colombo on January 17, 2018 and was graced by the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe and Prof. Maithree Wickremasinghe.
Conquering Mount Everest is a dream of many but a feat completed by few. The accomplishment of this great challenge brings great prestige to those who succeed. Having reached the height of 8400m, a mere 448m shy of the peak, Johann Peries made the wise decision to turn back owing to a technical malfunction however nothing seems to be keeping this man down. Resilient, passionate and beaming with positivity, Johann Peries is ready to take a second crack at the great Everest and this time, every Sri Lankan can partake of the exertion.
The Climb Everest with Johann Campaign was launched on January 17 so that every Sri Lankan can be a part of his great journey. For Rs. 100/= every Sri Lankan can sponsor a step that Johann takes on his ascent and descent of Mount Everest. The total cost of the expedition amounts to USD 58,600 and all contributions made, go towards financing the journey and all the associated costs. Technically equipped and heart ablaze for the journey ahead Johann, who has been training since December 2016, is to commence his second attempt in April 2018.
Johann is no stranger to the tedious excursion ahead. In April 2016, Johan Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level. Owing to a technical malfunction with his oxygen cylinder, Johann Peries was forced to refrain from proceeding to the peak and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala became the first Sri Lankan to scale the summit.
This time around Johann will not have the companionship of Jayanthi but he is by no means alone. He will be a part of a larger team led by International Mountain Guides (IMG), a globally renowned mountaineering company and will have the support of every Sri Lankan who wishes to share steps in his journey.
The website for this campaign is www.johanneverest2018.com and the trending hashtag via which to follow Johanns journey is #climbeverestwithjohann
Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala addressed the crowd describing the tremendous excursion undertaken by both her and Johann in 2016 explaining the misfortune faced by Johann at the malfunction of his oxygen cylinder and his wise decision to descend rather than risk his life any further. Detailing the gravity of the situation especially in the Death Zone area of Mount Everest, she described the harsh conditions that even resulted in the deterioration of their bodies. Explaining that she would not be accompanying Johann on his expedition, she wished him more and more strength and courage, hoping that he would finally be able to fulfil his dream and finish what he started. She would remain with him in spirit and support him from Colombo  her base camp.
Johann Peries then addressed the press and guests regarding his decision to reattempt the conquering of Mount Everest. Explaining that he was filled with a multitude of sentiments as he set about fulfilling his goal and finishing what he started. More than anything else he emphasized the strength he draws from his spiritual beliefs and is confident that this time he will succeed. Laughing he assured his audience that he would continue to make the right decisions. Thanking the press for their continued support, he urged the public to join him on his expedition. He then invited the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe to sponsor his first step.
The Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe placed a pin at the top of the picture of Mount Everest to symbolize his donation and then addressed the gathering. He explained that he had position his pin at the peak in the hopes that Johann will get to the top this time round. Laughingly he asked Johann, Why on earth would you want to do it again He encouraged Johann to overcome the challenge and urged him to become the 2nd Sri Lankan to conquer Mount Everest and make it to the top. Professor Maithree Wickremasinghe too made a donation and placed a pin at the bottom of the picture of Everest at Johanns first step up the mountain.
Among those who attended the press conference were current Prime Minister's Spokesperson, Rosy Senanayake, renowned hairdresser Ramani Fernando and Managing Director of Hameedia, Fouzul Hameed.
In a brief Q&A session following the Press Conference, Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala fielded questions from the audience. Addressing a question on the loneliness that one feels hiking up a lonely mountain, Jayanthi responded saying that they had each others company to tide them over the first time. Johann agreed that this would be one of the obstacles that hed face but acknowledged that the loneliness would be easier to bear with the presence of his team.
Responding to questions regarding the physical demands of the journey, Johann explained that he would have to repeat the to and fro process of ascending and descending the mountain multiple times before he finally reaches the peak. He pointed out that under such punitive conditions, even putting on ones shows takes 15-20 minutes. The geological changes and changes in weather patterns would be a concern and he emphasized that merely because he has been through it before, it is by no means any easier. Jayanthi pointed out that Johanns preparation for his second attempt had commenced a mere couple of months after their return and he was definitely ready for another crack at it.
Their message to anyone who wishes to attempt conquering Mount Everest is train as much as possible, preferably in the Himalayas as conditions from mountain to mountain are incredibly diverse. They commented on their happiness at the levels of interest towards mountaineering that they have witnessed in the youth of Sri Lanka. Education is the key, being versed in the rules and getting accustomed to the conditions that one has to be face.
Johanns primary focus will be on the victory. He is not dwelling on the possibility of failure. Having seen four people die, on his previous trek, the experience shattered him. He is aware of the mental and physical strain that the journey will bring but relies on his positivity and spiritual beliefs to see him through and knowing that Sri Lanka will be walking with him through his campaign is of great encouragement to him.
Make the Right Decision
When asked what she believed would be Johanns greatest concern by the Daily News, Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala commented that she felt that he should most definitely double check his oxygen cylinder. The first time, fatigue had caused them to skim over the checking of their cylinders and it was misfortunate that Johann was forced to turn back. He had made the wise decision and as a result was quite lucky and hopes he will continue to make the right decision. She will continue to support him and stressed that the priority is his safe return.
Passion and Positivity
Being a hairdresser by profession and an adventurer by choice Johann is driven by his passions. Having successfully climbed Island Peak in Nepal and Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, Johann is certainly prepared for another go at Mount Everest.
Johann explained the source of his inspiration to pursue mountaineering was his father who took him on regular explorations of the Knuckles Mountain range in Sri Lanka. He is happy to say that he lives life to the fullest, driven by his passion and has his eye focussed on reaching the peak. His message to the younger generations who would be inspired by him is to follow ones dreams. Everyone faces hardships. The key is to remain passionate and positive.

Sri Lanka v Pakistan ICC U19 Cricket World Cup:
Its a must-win clash for both countries
Its a clash of the subcontinent giants in Group D at the Cobham Oval on Friday (19 January) when Pakistan and Sri Lanka face off against each other for a place in the quarter-finals.
Both teams have followed the same script, winning against Ireland and losing to Afghanistan, and know that victory will secure a spot in the last eight. Pakistan have a slight advantage with a higher net run rate and with some rain around in Whangarei the weather could add some drama to proceedings.
Pakistan didnt have the best of starts to the tournament, losing to Afghanistan by five wickets in their opening fixture, but three days later they got back on track with a comfortable nine-wicket victory over Ireland. In the earlier warm-up games, they beat Namibia by 190 runs, while the game against Bangladesh was washed out.
Sri Lanka also registered a comprehensive win against Ireland, prevailing by seven wickets, but were beaten by Afghanistan by 32 runs on DLS method. In their warm-up games, they lost to Australia by 53 runs while their fixture against England was abandoned due to rain.
In six previous ICC U19 CWC meetings dating back to 1988, Pakistan have the upper hand with five victories, including at the 2014 and 2016 editions. In all U19 cricket the two countries have met a total of 34 times, with Pakistan winning on 18 occasions, 13 victories for Sri Lanka and three no results.
Pakistan are the third-most successful team in ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup history, having taken home the title twice, in 2004 and 2006, behind only India and Australia. They have made the final on a further three occasions, including at the first-ever tournament in 1988, with a team including future legends Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed.
In 11 previous appearances, Sri Lanka have reached the final once, against India on home soil in 2000, only to lose to a team that included Mohammad Kaif and Player of the Tournament, Yuvraj Singh. They have reached the semi-finals twice since, in 2010 and 2016.

England top Group C with win over Bangladesh
Captain Harry Brook scored a fine century as England defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets at the John Davies Oval in Queenstown today to put themselves in line to top Group C in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup.
Brooks 102 not out was supplemented with a fine all-round effort of 48 not out and three for 26 by Euan Woods as the 1998 champions completed a second straight win. England are at par with Bangladesh on four points and a win over Canada on Saturday will enable them to top the group with six points, also making Bangladesh as the second side to qualify for the Super League quarterfinals.
Canada remained in contention for a place in the Super League quarterfinals from Group C when they defeated Namibia by four wickets at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Christchurch. However, to reach the Super League quarterfinals, they will have to convincingly beat England so that they can improve their net run-rate, which currently sits at -0.277 as compared to Englands +3.27 and Bangladeshs +0.43.
While Canada are still in the running for a place in the Super League quarterfinals, Namibia, who had qualified directly for the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2018 as the highest-placed Associate in 2016, will now play in the Plate Championship after succumbing to their third straight defeat.

Joint Opposition denied its rights: Vasudeva
The Joint Opposition (JO), the largest opposition group in Parliament, has been subdued and denied its rights, Ratnapura district Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He was addressing an awareness programme attended by JO supporters at the 3rd floor of Dias Bookshop in Ratnapura on January 17.
The TNA and the JVP have obtained opposition posts after abusing democracy. The JVP contests the election separately supporting the government. The people should use forthcoming local election to defeat the coalition government, he said.
Nanayakkara said the UNP-led government was following the Western Multi National Company network and had bequeathed a ship-to-mouth existence to the people of the country.
The countrys economy was destroyed by bringing laws enabling foreigners to grab peoples lands, he said.
The government are selling out national resources to foreigners to overcome its economic bankruptcy. They had mortgaged several future generations to foreign capitalists.
The governments imminent defeat at the forthcoming election would see some of the people hanging on to ministerial privileges leaving it like mice escaping from a sinking ship. It was a national duty of the voters to ensure the victory of the Pohottuwa at the forthcoming election, he said.

Kandy expressway to be ready before next general election
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe predicted that the Kandy - Colombo expressway will be completed before the next general election yesterday.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the maiden rally organized by the United National Party under the leadership of the party leader to support UNP candidates contesting the forthcoming local government elections in Kandy.
While noting that the previous Rajapaksa regime had left Sri Lanka in a gigantic debt trap Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed that the present Government will not hand over the countrys debt to the future generations.
He said during the past three years the government took efforts to provide the infrastructure, reduce debt burden and stabilize the economy. Now we have the ability and strength to go forward, he added.
The UNP leader said that the country received US$ 1500 million worth foreign investments last year alone and predicted there will be a much bigger amount of FDIs this year.
While noting that the present government has been able to lay the foundation for unprecedented economic and social development both at national and village level the Premier requested the voters to give the UNP the power at the upcoming local government elections to show how local councils can be developed.
We ask the masses in this country to give the power of the local councils to the UNP to show how they could be developed, the Premier said to the applause of the massive crowd present at the city centre near the Kandy public market.
Although Rajapaksa ruled for nine years he could not build this road. When I became the Prime Minister in 2015 I came to this exact location and promised to start the construction of the road soon. We have kept that promise he recalled.
The UNP leader went on to say that it was not only the plans to construct the Kandy  Colombo expressway which had been thrown in the dustbin during the 09 year Rajapaksa rule but they had also thrown out the window dreams of the countrys youth for a prosperous future by leaving the country in an unbearable debt trap.
Rajapaksa held the Presidential election in 2015, two years before his term expired because he knew the countrys economy was on the verge of collapse.
The Premier said the present governments first challenge was to find solutions to get the country out of this debt trap.
He said the government had been able to increase debt servicing (loan installments and the interest) steadily and had stabilized the economy. He said the previous government had launched massive development projects without any strategy to turn such giant entities in to profit making ventures.
Highlighting projects such as Mattala Airport, Hambantota harbor, Suriyawewa Cricket stadium etc the Premier said the current government has made arrangements to convert these projects into profit making ventures under the Public Private Partnership concept and thereby relieve the people from the debt burden.
While the government is taking untiring efforts to convert these white elephants into profit making institutions, and generate income and employment for the youth in the country, we have not forgotten about other development work and social uplift of our citizens. We have reduced the cost of living, provided jobs, strengthen education and health facilities he added.
The Premier noted that the country will have two fully-fledged and busy international airports by the year end due to these efforts.
He also pointed out that the government has initiated a number of trade and tourism zones in the country to support economic development.
We have initiated new free trade zones in Hambantota, Kalutara Kurunegala,Colombo, Gampaha and also initiated tourism development zones in Galle and Chilaw,the PM said.
The Premier said the government plans to develop both a trade zone and a tourism development zone in Kandy shortly.
He said the current government is engaged in a mission to bring investment to the country thereby generating employment and income to the country.He urged the public to vote for the UNP and usher a government which could develop the villages.
UNP Chairman Minister Malik Samarawickrema, General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Rajitha Senaratne, Rauff Hakeem and other leaders were present.
UPFA candidate Gemunu Bandara contesting the forthcoming election for the Ududumbara Pradeshiya Sabha pledged support to the UNP at the meeting.

King Kohli crowned ICC cricketer of the year
NEW DELHI, Thursday: Virat Kohli on Thursday was crowned cricketer of the year by the sports world governing body, capping off a strong innings for the Indian skipper across all three formats of the game.
Australian captain Steve Smith was named Test player of the year as the International Cricket Council unveiled its annual awards.
Kohli is just the fourth Indian to win the prestigious Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, following in the footsteps of batting greats Sachin Tendulkar (2010), Rahul Dravid (2004) and teammate Ravichandran Ashwin (2016).
Its the first time winning the Garfield Sobers Trophy, and its a huge honour for me, Kohli said in a statement.
Its probably the biggest of all in world cricket and two Indians getting it back-to-back makes it more special.
Kohli was also crowned the worlds best one-day batsman, winning that title for the second time since 2012.
During the voting period from 21 September 2016 to end-2017, Kohli scored 2,203 Test runs at an average of 77.80 including eight centuries.
He accumulated 1,818 runs in the one-day format including seven centuries.
The 29-year-old was also bestowed a rare honour -- selected to captain the ICCs Test and ODI sides, a team in name only that comprises the best players from around the globe.
India emerged as the worlds best Test side in 2017 under Kohli, with an unbroken series winning streak at home. He also leads the ODI and Twenty20 teams for the subcontinent.
But it has not always been smooth sailing for Kohli, whose men were defeated 2-0 in a Test series against South Africa that wrapped up Wednesday, prompting criticism about his team selection and Indias poor Test record away from home.
Smith meanwhile, who sits atop the Test batting chart, had little competition this time around for the prize he also won in 2015.
The Australian captain played 16 Tests during the 15-month voting period, scoring 1,875 runs at an average of 78.12, with eight hundreds and five half-centuries.
Ive had a really good year. I think Ive scored six hundreds in the year and more importantly led the team to an Ashes victory, which is something that is really important to me, said Smith.
I am incredibly humbled and I love playing Test cricket. Its the game that challenges your skills and your mind the most.
The Australians have taken home the award in four of the last five years, with Mitchell Johnson winning in 2014 and Michael Clarke in 2013.

Kulathunga Rajapakse confered  with Hall of Fame award
DSI Samson Group Managing Director Kulathunga Rajapakse is no stranger to Sri Lankas industry and entrepreneur circles. As Managing Director of the DSI Samson Group, the countrys premier business conglomerate and leading manufacturer of footwear and bicycle tyres in Sri Lanka, he overlooks 32 companies while occupying patron level positions in National organizations for industries.
His invaluable contribution in shaping Sri Lankas industry economy and leadership in addressing key issues on behalf of entrepreneurs gained recognition recently at the 22nd Sri Lankan Entrepreneur of the Year Awards organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL). Kulathunga Rajapakse was awarded the lifetime Hall of Fame award by President Maithripala Sirisena.
When asked what it meant to win the Hall of Fame award, Rajapakse stated that the award stood as a statement to his contribution to the industry and thanked the FCCISL for choosing him as its recipient.
Describing the beginnings of the DSI Samson Group, the Managing Director explained, From our very inception and throughout the development of DSI, we have continuously transformed challenges into opportunities and taken risks by venturing into territories others have not considered. These two features have been our keys to success. Our first factory was established in 1962 to overcome the restrictions posed by the Government on imports.
Nonetheless, this challenge led us to re-look at our own products, the productivity of our manufacturing lines by increasing the TAT, as well as our designs, since we had to compete with foreign products. It was actually a blessing in disguise because we improved significantly during this time, said Rajapakse.
In 1980, a new brand Ranpa was born as a result of the political threat faced by the network within the electorate and the Business Acquisition Act. Rajapakse explained how the company considered moving out of the electorate and founded a new footwear manufacturing plant in Colombo, under a different name and a new Board of Directors.
This threat resulted in the DSI Samson Group enjoying a higher import quota and a substantial share of the market as both factories were manufacturing the same product. The organization also launched their very own ultra-modern Design Department, to tackle increasing competition.
Strategically we practice umbrella branding through our corporate brand, DSI. This enables us to defend the market segment. Individual and sub branding is used for our diversified products. Our CSR brand remains Samson, in honour of our founder and Chairman, my father, the late D. Samson Rajapakse. We also have international brands such as Fila, Clarks, Puma, Reebok, Raleigh, Jac, Garware, Vardhaman, Next and Migrow, from all industries. These enhance our brand portfolio, replied Rajapakse to a query about DSIs maintenance of its consolidated brand image.
The veteran businessman believes that Sri Lanka has enormous potential but is not interested in creating a conducive environment for entrepreneurs. He explained that the present banking system, though one of the most developed in the region, still prefers financing the trading sector to industries.
The Managing Director of the DSI Samson Group was adamant in his belief in the importance of the presence of start-ups for the development of the countrys economy. Start-ups and advocating of entrepreneurship from the initial stage are very important to the industry economy of any nation. New entrants face many challenges, as there are no venture capital agreements or rebates provided by the government. The development of technology has to go hand-in-hand with this, since we are in a world that is governed by ICT.

Let the dust settle
Saner counsel, it appears, has prevailed in the end. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has informed the UNP membership not to criticize the President in public for whatever reason. Presiding over a UNP Working Committee meeting, the Premier informed UNPers to desist from attacking the President, and, that, they could come to him if there was any problem. Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told the post-Cabinet media briefing that the President, on his part, too had given an undertaking to rein in SLFPers who were attacking the Prime Minister.
These attacks, and, counter attacks had been a feature since the formation of the Unity Government, following the August 2015 General Election. It must be said that the UNP acted with great restraint, at the outset, amidst pot shots directed at the party by SLFP MPs, particularly at it's leadership. It is understandable that they could no longer hold onto their fire when the pot shots turned into frontal assaults on the Prime Minister, particularly from the likes of Susil Premajayantha and Dilan Perera. Things deteriorated to such an extent that the public began wondering if the SLFP was acting towards undermining the UNP led administration rather than being a party of the Unity Government. The differences were also seized upon by the Joint Opposition to make political capital out of the initial cold war that eventually degenerated into direct combat.
It is significant that the fusillade directed at each other became pronounced with the announcement of LG elections and there was natural curiosity if all this was a contrived exercise. It has to be borne in mind that, both, the UNP and SLFP, although cohabiting in government, are traditional foes. To act otherwise and appear to be chummy on the electoral battlefield is not going to do either party any good in terms outdoing each other (at the poll). They have to appear to be rivals, if they are to galvanize their respective grassroots supporters to put in their heart and soul into the campaign. Victory must be the bottom line. However, there will be those who will contend that the differences are for real, particularly, given the harsh words directed at the President by certain UNP backbenchers and the not so complimentary remarks made, targeting the Prime Minister, by some SLFP stalwarts.
Now that the guns have, hopefully, fallen silent it is important that the cohabitation arrangement of the once bitter rivals is put back on track and both parties rule in unison to realize their common goals to take the country forward for which they have signed an agreement, underwritten by the late Ven Sobitha Thera.
Besides, being at constant loggerheads is going to send the wrong signal to the general public of disunity and destability. Both parties are without working majorities in parliament to form governments on their own and bickering can only lead to complete derailment of the administration that could seep down to the second tiers, leading to chaos and dislocation. The lack of unity will also pave the way for anarchic forces to gain the upper hand and dictate terms to the government. As this is being written the CEB trade unions have threatened a countrywide strike and the doctors are once again set for their ritual work stoppage over the SAITM matter. All that these saboteurs need is a government in disarray, with the UNP and SLFP factions going for each others' jugular, to make the achievement of their sinister political agendas that much easier.
Besides, this will be a big let-down for those disgusted with the acrimonious political culture in post independence Sri Lanka and who may have breathed a sigh of relief when the two arch rivals joined together to govern in unison, to see the arrangement disintegrating before their eyes, due to the immature conduct of elements on both sides.
The President and Prime Minister, hopefully, would put things right in their respective houses, that would see an end to the petty squabbling that had been a feature between the parties in recent times that also has detracted from the main tasks they have undertaken on behalf of the country. Like the President had already reiterated, he did not set up the Bond Commission to target any individual or political party, but in furtherance of the promise made to the people to eradicate corruption. The UNP should take the President's statement in that spirit and act with due circumspection. The SLFP, on the other hand, should not unfairly target the Prime Minister and the UNP, in general, since this will only reflect badly on the party.
The Blues came second best to the UNP at the hustings and would have been relegated to the Opposition if the Greens cobbled together the numbers to achieve a simple majority and govern without the help of the SLFP. In that event, all those SLFP MPs and ministers now shouting from the rooftops accusing their partner of all things and ills besetting the government would have been left high and dry, sans their present portfolios and the perks and privileges that go with it.

Accordingly, the prohibition on selling liquor to women and employing women in places where liquor is manufactured or sold has been re-imposed under Excise Notification No 04 of 2018 signed by the Minister Mangala Samaraweera today (January 18).
The other Gazette Extraordinary containing the Excise Notification No 03 of 2018 has re-introduced the previous business hours for liquor establishments.

Liquor purchase ban on women  unconstitutional - Verit Research
Think Tank, Verit Research says that the ban on the sale of liquor to women by the Finance and Mass Media within the premises of a tavern by the Cabinet is unconstitutional.
The Minister of Finance and Mass Media issued a notification on January 10 amending the Excise Notification No. 666 of December 31, 1979, removing the ban on the sale of liquor to women within the premises of a tavern. This was subsequently revoked by the Cabinet.
According Article 12(1) of the Constitution it states that all persons are equal before the law, and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Moreover, article 12(2) states that no citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds ofsex. Therefore, acts that discriminate against women on the grounds of their sex violate their fundamental rights, and are thereby unconstitutional. Article 16(1) of the Constitution states that all existing written law and unwritten law shall be valid and operative notwithstanding any inconsistency with the preceding provisions of this Chapter (emphasis added). Article 16(1) only applies to written and unwritten law enacted prior to 1978. Thus any law that is enacted today must be compliant with the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution, and cannot discriminate on the grounds of sex.
Verit Research further states that the Cabinets decision therefore discriminates women on the grounds of their sex.

Love, friendship shatters on stage
Blood Brothers is a beautiful, evocative and fascinating play that addresses the issue of Nature Vs. Nurture when it comes to human behavior. This play was performed recently by the Students of the Overseas School of Colombo. It was a play that was done exceptionally well and a play that tackled the issue of Nature Vs. Nurture in a manner that captivated the audience. The Overseas School of Colombo speaks to Daily News on their outlook on the drama and their recent endeavour.
In an act of desperation, because of extreme poverty, Mrs. Johnstone (Sarah Shea) gives away one of her twin children Edward (Aamir Akbarally) to the extremely well do to and wealthy Mrs. Lyons (Diana Elizabeth Phillips) keeping her other twin child Mickey (Seth Keerthiratne) with herself. This act of Mrs. Johnstone would forever change the lives of the twin brothers. One would lead the life of the wealthy and the affluent and the other would be condemned to a life of extreme poverty.
Later on in life, fate plays its part. The two brothers meet each other one day completely unaware of their lineage. They become friends Blood Brothers. This chance encounter results in Edward Lyonsvisiting the part of the neighbourhood his twin brother Mickey Johnstone lives in, and meets his true mother Mrs. Johnstone who instantly realizes who this exactly is.
Mrs. Lyons gets to know of the friendship between the two boys in a similar way and forbids Edward Lyons to associate with his twin brother Mickey Johnstone. However the bond between the two boys endures only to be ruined by the actions of Mickey Johnstone who slowly falls into the darkness because of his poverty and his circumstances and starts to despise his twin brother/friend Eddie Lyons.
The play reaches its climax following Mickeys stay in jail due to his involvement in a crime. Mrs. Lyons craftily informs him of a situation that tears him apart with anger and sorrow  she tells Mickey that Edward is in a relationship with Mickeys girlfriend.
This results in Mickey confronting Eddie with a gun. In a moment of fury Mickey shoots Eddie, and then the police shoot Mickey. And the story ends in tragedy.
The fascinating point to ponder on is if their roles had been reversed would the outcome have been the same or different Nature Vs. Nurture
Drama Teacher at OSC, Rachel Jackson, feels that drama allows a student to broaden their horizons taking risks.
Drama gives you confidence and the ability to stand up and perform before a group of people. It strengthens the individual and helps outside of school as well. I think it is hugely important that students have access to the performing arts. It allows them to be creative and use their imagination, rather than sitting in front of a desk and a computer all the time, said Jackson.
Asserting that drama gives you the ability to work closely with others, she pointed out that it also helps you listen, collaborate and negotiate.
Trae Hicks was a co-director, so I need to mention his valuable contribution to the success of the play. When the children came into the Blood Brothers production, some did not know each other very well. Some were new to the school. By the end of it they were all close to each other. We became a family and I was told by one child how much she missed those good times. They all formed strong bonds and they really enjoyed the experience, stated Jackson.
The children were admirable in handling different scenes. All credit should go to the students for their maturity.
There were tears at the end, when it was all over. But there was no negativity, because they all put in so much of themselves into their role, explained Jackson.
Musical Director for Blood Brothers and Head of Arts at OSC, Loretta Duncan,said in this day and age being able to perform presentations in front of a group is vital. You need to be able to present your ideas clearly. Many jobs after university require that from you. Drama certainly increases your competency. Blood Brothers was a musical, so it was very attractive to the kids. The reason we chose the play was because it allowed for deep characterization, Duncan said.
It was a challenge for the actors who played Mickey and Eddie because they had to change from the mindset of a seven year old to an adult character. But they pulled it off brilliantly. It allowed deep insight into the character and we wanted to give them the opportunity to experience those roles. I had many solo rehearsals with the kids meeting them individually to rehearse those particular songs. One thing we can learn from Blood Brothers is that the choices you make are important. You need to control your emotions and make the right choices in life, she said.
Sarah Shea feels that doing drama has been a process of discovery for her in terms of her emotions. Through the different roles she has enacted she has been able to explore a range of emotion that she has never experienced. It also has made her more self- confident and empathetic towards others.
At first I didnt think Mrs. Johnstone was making the right choice because my family values are different from hers. I think that parents should never give up and should love their children unconditionally. Throughout my process of developing Mrs. Johnstone I now believe that I think she made the best decision she could have, given the circumstances. I honestly think that Mrs. Johnstone did all that was in her power and could not have changed the outcome. She is a woman who was trapped, economically and socially. She did not have the freedom that most of us have to follow through with certain decisions. However, she supported the rest of her children with care, said Shea.
Shea pointed out that she thinks Mrs. Johnstone is a very powerful woman, strong, emotional and very caring. She is very interesting to portray as a character because she is very complex says Shea. Shea points out that her character was beaten down by life.
I had to explore her moments of intense joy, ranging between anger and despair and what caused such emotional extremes. I liked the challenge of playing a character that is very different from me. I had to explore a different range of thoughts and feelings. Besides this, I also really enjoyed the singing and dancing involved in her role. I really liked performing in this production with the amazing cast and crew. We have been so supportive of each other and I couldnt ask for a better group. I also loved our directors, Trae and Ms. Jackson and the music director, Ms. Duncan. They were so helpful to me in doing justice to the character of Mrs. Johnstone, explained Shea.
Aamir Akbarally pointed out that Drama has been a huge part of his life ever since he was a child and it has shaped how he speaks, thinks, spectate theatre and how he holds himself.
It has provided me with an escape as I delve into my characters on-stage, leaving behind my own personality, to experience moments as someone else completely. It truly is a freeing process and a constant process of discovery  discovery of my abilities, what I find enjoyable, what makes me uncomfortable, what it is about the stage that I love and find so familiar, said Akbarally.
Commenting on the Nature Vs. Nurture aspect, Akbarally stated that the journey of these two individuals which lead to the outcome, would have changed monumentally if their roles were reversed.
If Mickey had stumbled upon money or had become successful, he would never have gotten into business with Sammy, this would have prevented his drug addiction and his falling out with Linda, and possibly, Edward. However, if Edward somehow ended up in Mickeys poor financial situation, I feel that his lovable personality would not have let him react to the situation as Mickey did, causing the brothers to not fall out and further preventing their deaths, he said.
I think of Edward as respectable, and innocent in a specific way due to his sheltered upbringing, this can be considered as ignorance to some level, in the case of money. Edward is loveable and relatable in so many ways and his sacrifice to see his friend happy with someone he loved is something I find beautiful, yet undeserving for his character. His ability to completely forego his financial background and class-level when choosing Mickey as his best friend is beautiful, Akbarally explained.
Diana Elizabeth Phillipsfeels that there is more to Mrs. Lyons than what meets eye. She feels that there is more depth to the character.
Although Mrs. Lyons appears a strong character, her sanity begins to chafe away as the play unfolds. She is portrayed as a lonely housewife and her husband spends long periods at work away from home. Most importantly, she is unable to provide a child for him, despite the arduous hours he spends at work to provide for her. As a result, loneliness and insecurity overwhelms her and drives her to growing extremes, until finally, she loses her mind, said Phillips.
Phillips stated there are valuable lessons we can learn from Mrs. Lyons. She states that we should all recognize that if we fail to control our demons, they will control us.
Personally, I can say that by doing drama, my creativity has expanded exponentially from being trained to interpret play texts from various angles, learning improvisation and developing characterization. So of course, drama has had a huge influence on my personality, said Phillips.
To me, her character is a highly vulnerable woman. I think that things would not have ended so tragically for her if her husband had been more understanding regarding her medical predicament. Relationships crumble in the absence of compassion and sensitivity, explained Phillips.
Seth Keerthiratne said that Drama was not really his cup of tea but that in time he grew to love it.
I actually hated drama when I was younger. I liked Shakespeare so I auditioned to be in the Tempest and got the role Caliban. After that performance and everything I did as being a method actor, I fell in love with theatre and all its components. So, I decided to study it further and I believe I have come a long way, and I love it, as it really is another world to the one we know and it truly is great, said Keerthiratne.
Keerthiratna pointed out that Mickeys circumstances were not his own doing, yet there are so many people in our society who succeed in life regardless of the background they come from.
Of course, there are situations like that, but to get out of it you need to have 10 per cent luck and 90 per cent hard work. The hard work factor as you can see, Mickey is not willing to take the effort. Mickey had no control over what his mother did and her life choices but he could have worked harder to get himself out of his financial situation and he could have paid more attention to his own education, where in the play you can see clearly that he neglects it.
The part I enjoyed the most was playing Mickey as a kid. This has been the most fun play and interesting production I have been a part of. The directors, the cast and the whole Blood Brothers crew are like one big family and I loved it. I miss it so much, said Keerthiratne

Maintaining quality standards must  for cinnamon  value chain
IPS research officer, Dilani Hirimuthugodage, speaking on cinnamon production, recently highlighted the importance of maintaining quality standards at each level of cinnamon value chain.
Lack of proper production infrastructure and technology in meeting required quality standard at the producer level, less concern in assuring the quality of cinnamon and lack of awareness of international standards and specification at the collector level, high cost in maintaining quality standards and at the exporter level were identified as the main constraints in the production process.
Hirimuthu Godage made these observations while presenting on the topic Analyzing Quality Constraints in Cinnamon Value Chain in Sri Lanka at the 11th Annual Research Forum of Sri Lanka Agricultural Economic Association (SAEA), on Natural Disasters, Risk, and Agriculture, held in Kandy on January 13,2018.

Meet amazing baby elephant Donald Trunk
The Galle Art Trail launches on January 24 with nearly thirty amazing artists from all over the world coming together in pop up exhibitions inside the Galle Fort and around the area. So drop everything, pack your trunk and book a ticket for the exciting Donald Trunk book launch and amazing elephant exhibition, which is being held at the legendary boutique hotel Jetwing Lighthouse from 3.30 to 5pm. This amazing high tea, with adventures of Donald Trunk cake and book reading, is the start of the action packed five day Fairway Galle Literary Festival and inaugural Art Trail- a fantastic event that brings together authors and artists from all over the world to talk, debate and discover exciting new things, like the fact that elephants can swim.
Donald Trunk, not to be confused with the whistle blowing Donald Trump book, is a new style childrens tale of the unexpected with stunning illustrations by artist Janet Anderton. It is an in depth story that reflects a deep respect for Sri Lankas amazing wildlife, rich and historic culture, and most importantly, despite all the country has been through in recent history, its wonderful sense of fun. Like all young people, Donald is a mischievous baby elephant who wants more from life than a 9 to 5 job. He is born on a cinnamon plantation in Galle, and is misled by his friends into believing that the real paradise is somewhere else, The Great Nicobar Islands. Slinky Satarnia, a sly cobra and just one of the many colourful characters in the book, slithers up to Donald, not unlike the story of the Garden of Eden, to tempt the youngster into running away from his family, So youre thinking of swimming away are you, you great hunk You can take it from me, if you swim east across the sea from Trincomalee, you will find paradise where everythings free. Donald was seduced at once by her rhyme and because the thought of lugging wood for the rest of his life caused his trunk to sag and drag uncontrollably he set about planning his escape.
This childrens story is the first in a series of books that tries to bridge the growing gap between the philosophies and ways of thinking between the East and West, and in the process it is hoped that the storyline will inspire deep respect from young people who travel through this amazing island. It is also aimed at Sri Lankan children to help them appreciate how lucky they are to be born in Sri Lanka and teach them to celebrate and protect the unique and very privileged eco biosphere they come from. The aim of the launching team is to make the book a game changer. It is also hoped that it will become a film that will further our understanding of the largest land animal, the elephant, which is highly revered in Sri Lankan culture and indeed advice was gathered from several wildlife experts, ranging from when elephants start to grow tusks to how they protect themselves from the tropical sun. You can learn more about this by coming to the exciting action packed launch and high tea at the Jetwing Lighthouse Hotel, Galle on January 24 at 3.30pm to 5pm. Tickets are on sale for adults at a cost of Rs. 2,000 and two children can come along free.
Astronomers, I learn, suggest that our birthplace is not a question of luck but destiny and Sri Lanka as an island is rich in this way of thinking and so they believe it is no co-incidence this book has come out at this auspicious time. In complete contrast to the way the West has, from the industrial revolution to the computer era, developed in its thinking of what is truly important. In many ways, the West has left behind the natural world from where we all come from, replacing farming with interactive phones and iPad games on manufacturing virtual food and is struggling, as a result, to find its purpose, having lost its direction and its ability to create or be in tune with other planets magnetic forces. The book is the result of a series of incidents in 2017, when not one but two Sri Lanka elephants hit international headlines when they were found by the Sri Lankan Navy, swimming out in the ocean about 10 to 15 kilometers off Trincomalee. Inspired by this phenomenon, an English artist called Janet Anderton, amazed by this extraordinary series of events, decided to illustrate the amazing adventures of Donald Trunk, Sri Lankas swimming elephant with grandiose dreams of escaping to the Nicobar Islands, the real paradise, or so he thinks.
Janet Anderton who is from Bolton, a place that celebrates the importance of the elephant by putting it in its coat of arms, received a B.A. in Fine Art from Loughborough Art College in 1985 and, while Janet works primarily in watercolour and ink, she also creates paper cuts and collages using unloved books. She puts every written page to good use and shows the importance of recycling and the art and power of books on the minds of children.
Janet reads to kids in the local library and seeing the world through their eyes helped her to create 28 amazing images for this book, including a map showing the voodoo of the location. Some say the power of her work comes from her day job, which is being a librarian and having a Mary Poppins-like following of readers. Janets 2016 exhibition, Fairy Tales and Fantasy, composed entirely of paper cuts, was on show at Leicestershires Sock Gallery.
The work explored her deep love of childrens stories, which she feels are key to any persons ability to dream big and use their imagination in innovative and interesting new ways. She is really looking forward to doing some art talks with the kids in Galle schools during her week promoting the book and learning more about an island she has totally fallen in love with.
Janets paintings have always been described as illustrative, so when she had the opportunity to depict the story of Donald Trunk, Sri Lankas very own swimming elephant, it felt like a natural extension to her fairytale work. Her paintings leave people utterly entranced. Janet has beautifully illustrated the array of wonderful characters of all shapes and sizes  a butterfly-like Jiminy Cricket, a scary matriarch of the elephant herd, an Eden-like sly cobra, a singing mermaid called Donna, the unique Nicobar pigeon, a blue whale, dolphins, tropical dancing fish  all within the context of Sri Lanka with its incredible festivals of colour and beauty, and its sense of community.
The Donald Trunk book launch sponsored by Jetwing Hotels will be in the Anchor Bar at Jetwing Lighthouse, Galle on Wednesday, January 24 from 3.30pm to 5.00pm. Email [emailprotected] to book a ticket or call the Jetwing Lighthouse.
The Galle Art Trail exhibition from the book will go on for the whole week of The Fairway Galle Literary Festival and Art Trail from January 23 to 30.

MullenLowe, Quantum to reveal Top 10 consumer  trends for 2018 at CIM Talking Point
Leading integrated communications agency MullenLowe Sri Lanka and premier consumer behaviour specialists company Quantum Consumer Services are set to present a list of key consumer trends that marketers should look out for in 2018 at the CIM Talking Point forum to be held on January 29 at the Hilton Colombo Residences (JAIC Hilton).
Abhishek Hariharan, Associate Vice President and Head of Strategic Planning, MullenLowe Sri Lanka and Chitrangani Herat Gunaratne, Senior Consultant, Quantum Consumer Services will be elaborating on these trends which highlight some expected shifts in consumer behaviour that are set to have an impact on how brands interact with their consumers in the year ahead.
The research was born from MullenLowe Sri Lankas acute understanding of market and consumer trends and Quantums extensive experience in researching human behaviour. MullenLowe works across multiple categories giving them the width and knowledge they need to plot trends and converting them into communications that engage consumers in a unique and exciting way.
Quantum has extensive experience in the identification of deep human truths and its translation into brand strategy.
The collective expertise and the collaborative nature of these two organizations have made this release possible which can immensely help brands and organizations in 2018.
These trends are the result of hours of work by the two organizations analysing data and arriving at predictive summaries. The continued rise of technology, a changing consumer culture and priorities that occurred through 2017 will influence the way consumers make choices this year and these trends reflect those possible changes.
Commenting on the release of the 10 trends for 2018, Thayalan Bartlett, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MullenLowe Sri Lanka, said, The process of intrinsic understanding of people's behaviours, their values, including the way they think and eventually act in engaging with products and services is an integral part of our communication process. The subtlest of shifts could impact brands, positively and negatively by the millions in a very short time. We are pleased to be working with Quantum on these predictive trends for 2018 which will benefit brands through this year.
Roshani Fernando, Partner, Quantum Consumer Solutions said, All trends have two sides to it, we see its manifestation in terms of particular behaviours. It is important to realise that these behaviours are rooted in deeper anxieties, where the behaviour is a coping mechanism or is a means of realizing an aspiration. We at Quantum are committed to enabling brands build genuine empathy triggers.

New books by Darshana Ashoka Kumara
The two books written by Darshana Ashoka Kumara titled Kav Silumina and Non-Buddhist Views and Asian Perspectives in Communication will be launched at the National Library and Documentation Services Board Auditorium, Independence Avenue, Colombo on January 26 at 3.30 pm.
The event will be chaired by former Head of Philosophy and Psychology University of Peradeniya Prof. Desmond Mallikarachchi. Professor Walter Marasinghe, Senior Lecturer Sumith Chaminda and Hashitha Abeywardena will also speak at the event.
In his project, Darshana examines an Asian Communication Model which can be used in the context of media practice in Sri Lanka that helps to minimizeethnic tension. In this study, special focus is given to oriental concepts in communication.
For example, concepts in rich philosophical oriental traditions in Asia including Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism were taken into consideration when the Asian Communication Model was built.
Darshanas other book Kav Silumina and Non-Buddhist Views explores about the socio-cultural and religious perspectives of Kav Silumina, which is considered to be one of masterpieces of the Sinhala poetry that came into existence in the second century. Kav Silumina is based on a Buddhist Jataka story Kusa Jatakaya.
Though the original Jataka story is into elucidating the moral precepts of Buddhism, Darshana in his work makes an attempt to deconstruct the ideologies that essentially deviated from original Buddhist thought attached with Kav Silumina.
In his argument, though Kusa Jatakaya is aligned with the Buddhist ideology, king Parakramabhahu IIs Kav Silumina is alluded to Hindu, Tantric and other non-Buddhist oriental teachings.

Old Shoes and Boots..!
Now, Im not one to panic over small sounds coming out of nowhere, but these here voices were coming from boots and even a pair of shoes in my room, Bob,write about us today please!
You dont disobey shoes and boots considering they can bite, and bite quite a lot of feet away, so its shoes and boots today, and why not, theres lots about them Id like to say.Like last week in the bitter snow of Chicago, I stepped into a mall, and felt like a tramp or some vagabond; bitter snow or cold outside, the shoes worn by others were good, fancy ones and as I looked at my own, old pair, I realized that whatever the situation outside, I needed to put my best foot forward, suited and booted and looking fighting fit!
Or the time, I looked at the pair of canvas shoes that lay among my fathers belongings after his death; I saw a splash of fresh paint on shoe. My father had been an artist, and for executing some of his work, he had to climb a small ladder, due to which some paintmust have fallen as he climbed, holding paint tin and brush and himself. That shoe lay by my bed for many years, reminding me it was never too late to work! Keep going Bob! was what dads shoe always said to me.
And then the time when a friend of mine, who Id helped in his time of need, and when I say need, it was much he needed, and one day, while sitting with him, he handed me a pair of old boots, This doesnt fit me! he said, I think its your size, take it!
I looked at the pair of old, scratched, worn out pieces of leather, and was about to refuse in righteous indignation when I realized he was reciprocating my own gesture of giving, from his meagre bounty. I took the shoes, tried them on, and wore them, always reminding myself that even the less fortunate had a pride and dignity you had to keep alive for them!
I look down at the floor, and swear I can see my shoes and boots grinning at each other, Lots of memories Bob
Yes! I whisper, but theres one memory that stands out and that was the time when I was dead broke, it was around Christmas many years back, and I looked at a pair of new shoes through a shop window, No money Lord! Id whispered.
That evening my brother came home. I opened the gift he left behind, it was the same pair of shoes Id seen at the window!Ill provide them Bob! I seemed to have heard a whisper from above and thats what Hes done every day of my life!
I hearshoes and boots, slowly returning to their old silence, theyd surely reawakened a host of lovely memories..!

Ordeal in Malaysia
Ever since Kumara Dissanayake (31) returned from his job in Malaysia, he has had memory problems and mild mental retardation. His family claimed that this was not the same Kumara who went to work abroad.
Pitigala Mudiyanselage Dharshana Kumara Dissanayake, a resident of Yaddhessawa, Atharagalla, Galgamuwa, flew to Malaysia with aspirations of creating a better life for his wife and his little eight-month-old child.
The plight he faced in Malaysia came to light only a few months after he returned home. His family members lamented that they began to see significant differences in Kumara in every way.
There was a cut on his head and it was clear that some sort of surgery had been performed on him and as a result he had lost much of his memory, except for being able to recall a few major incidents.
In March 2016, Kumara went to Malaysia to work at a house, but due to some issues in his passport, he had to return to Sri Lanka in June 2016.
After spending two days in the country, he left to Malaysia again, to the same house, using the tickets he had.
Mystery in Malaysia
It has been five months since I got back to Sri Lanka. My memory fails me every day. Therefore, with whatever my wife tells me, I figure out what has happened in my life. I do not remember what happened to me after I left for Malaysia for the second time. But when I was there, I have had situations where I would feel that I had woken up from a deep and long sleep.
One day, when I opened my eyes, I was inside four glass walls and it looked more like a hospital. Then my head started to hurt and it became unbearable, he explained.
He said a short while after he became conscious, his employers had visited.
They told me that I had fainted and that they had immediately admitted me to the hospital. They further assured me that I was doing well and said that we could go home now.
Later I remember them taking me home. I do not remember anything that happened afterwards, he said.
Kumara does not remember who brought him back to Sri Lanka. He is aware that some person accompanied him to the airport but does not remember who it was.
As far as I remember, afterwards another man took me to the airport in Malaysia. He kept a folded white sheet in my hands and put my passport in the pocket, tapped my shoulders and said that we could go home now.
Then I remember getting on the plane. Yet, I do not remember what happened till I got down in Sri Lanka.
When I got back to Sri Lanka, I could not even recognize my parents and siblings. It was after an operation at the hospital here that I have this memory power. There was a hole cut in my head and that is very visible, he said.
V.A.P. Susilavathi (51), Kumaras mother, understandably, has been very disturbed by the whole incident.
Kumara is my oldest son. The stability in the house is lost due to my sons situation. All what we need is to cure my son. When he went to Malaysia for the first time, he sent us money and spoke well. After he went for the second time, he only spoke to us for about a month and assured us that he was doing well, she said.
Susilavathi said that there was no news from her son for more than a year and she did not know what had happened to him until he was found in town.
Kumara returns
Then for about a year or two, there was no news about him. Though the number he was using there was working, nobody answered the call. Until my son returned home, we did not know where he was. He was wearing torn clothes when he returned, he was not in his senses. His beard and hair were overgrown and we could not recognize him. He did not speak a word and did not remember what happened to him. Then we took him to a hospital here, she explained.
P.M Dissanayake, his father, said he prayed that the tragedy which befell Kumara would not happen to anyone else.
The man who went to work returned losing his memory. Now he is recovering, thanks to God. When we inquired what happen, we found that some person had brought him to Sri Lanka.
They had taken the train to Ambanpola from Colombo. One of our local authority councillors identified him while he was roaming around the railway station and shops in Ambanpola. Yet, we could not get any information from my son in that situation. It was with great suspicion that we brought him home, because even we could not recognize him, he said.
He said that doctors revealed that his head had been cut and improperly stitched.
When we took him to the Thambuththegama hospital, they said that my sons situation was serious and he was transferred to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Tests conducted revealed that his head had been cut and the stitches were improperly placed. The doctors said that an operation needs to be done in two days or my sons life would be in danger. But we could not afford to collect Rs 50,000 at that time. Then they sent him to the Colombo National Hospital and the surgery was done. He is recovering now. He still hasnt got his full memory, but is improving, he said.
Dissanayake said that doctors had said that they needed Rs 300,000 to do the second operation. My wife and I cannot find that amount to conduct the operation. We are into agriculture and we do not earn a huge profit, he said. When some incidents appear on my mind, I cry aloud and scream. I am helpless today, Kumara said.
Further, according to Kumara, his passport too had been altered.
When I left for Malaysia, I had a passport valid for 10 years, but the passport that I used to return has been issued on January 24, 2017 with expiry on April 24, 2017, he said. Further, the picture on the passport was not of him and it had been replaced with another.
Kumara said his employers in Malaysia had taken all his documents including his certificates, receipt issued by the agency and his identity card. Due to these incidents which occurred over a short period of his life, Kumara lamented that he felt like a mentally retarded person. My wife said that one day when she called my number, a woman had answered the phone and said that I was dead and cremated there. She was sure that the woman who spoke on the phone was a Sinhalese person, he said.
The mystery of what happened to Kumara Dissanayake in Malaysia continues with very little hope of finding who is responsible. Kumara, in the meantime, is worried that his family was suffering because of him. The breadwinner is now a burden, he said.

Over 40% of Lankas merchandise exports are to EU-Amar Breckenridge
The UKs euroscepticism did not start with Brexit, and has been present in Britains domestic policy circles since the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957 said Amar Breckenridge, Senior Economist at Frontier Economics (Europe),
He was addressing a Foreign Policy Round Table on The Progress of Brexit: Implications for Sri Lanka and the Region at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI).
It is still too early to accurately predict what the future trading arrangements between the UK, EU, and the rest of the world will look like after Brexit.
Sri Lanka needs to move away from its dependence on preferential trading access and towards increasing the competitiveness of the domestic economy, he added.
The round table was attended by representatives from the British High Commission, US Embassy, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Sri Lankas Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as representatives from nonprofits and think tanks.
The round table was moderated by Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, LKI Executive Director, and Adam Collins, Research Fellow of LKIs Global Economy Programme was a discussant.
Takeaways from Breckenridges Presentation
 Giving up full access to the customs union and the single market (a so-called Hard Exit) could result in annual losses of around GBP 70 billion to the UK economy.
 Estimates from standard economic models of trade suggest that these losses cannot be fully compensated with the signing of free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries.
 As a result of leaving the single market and customs union, the UK has to bear the financial and administrative burden of implementing new customs regimes previously fulfilled by the EU.
 The need to continue to align these regulations with EU standards could also place additional constraints on the UKs trade agreements with other countries.
Economic Implications for Sri Lanka
 Forty percent of Sri Lankas merchandise exports are to the EU; a disproportionate share of which, is to the UK. These goods currently benefit from preferential tariff rates thanks to the EUs GSP+ scheme. It remains uncertain whether the UK will continue to offer preferential access to the exports of Sri Lanka and other developing countries.
 If the UK were to standardise its GSP schemes by introducing a single preferential tariff rate for developing countries, Sri Lankan exporters will face an increase in competition from other developing countries vying for the British market.
Implications for the Global Trade System
 Growing worries of greater trade protectionism, particularly by the US, have prompted some European leaders to advocate for a policy shift towards greater liberalisation within the EU, and the employment of protectionist policies targeting imports.
 These could take the form of more aggressive anti-dumping regulations, as well as more stringent labour and environmental standards on imports from outside the EU.
 The EU employing more protectionist policies could potentially impose impediments on Sri Lankas trade with the EU in certain manufacturing and service sectors, and threaten to offset the benefits from Sri Lankas competitive advantage derived from low-cost labour.
 The UK has historically preferred greater global trade liberalisation. Its absence from the EU is likely to weaken the chances of the EU significantly reducing trade barriers with the rest of the world in the future. This will be crucial at a time when the EU has to re-certify and negotiate its commitments under the WTO.
Key Points from the Round Table Discussion
Looking Beyond Preferential Market Access
 It is important that Sri Lanka looks at what sort of preferential access other countries would receive as a result of future FTAs between the UK and other states.
 It is highly unlikely that Sri Lanka will be approached by the UK to form a bilateral FTA, given the size of Sri Lankas economy and the reciprocal nature of FTAs.
 Sri Lanka will, in time, lose its preferential access to the EU market when it moves to an upper middle-income country, and therefore, needs to look at other ways to increase its role in the international trade system.
 Sri Lanka should pay attention to its domestic industrial policy to increase its manufacturing base, and representation in global value chains.

PCA offers soothing drama therapy
The Psychological Counsellors Association (PCA) is the alumni of the diploma holders of Psychological Counselling of the Institute of Human Resource Advancement (IHRA) which is under the University of Colombo.
Its advisers are two well-known personalities in the counselling and psychology field - Prasanna Kamalasiri Perera, a very popular and a qualified Psychological Counsellor and a Motivational Trainer much sought after by the corporate and the government sector, was the coordinator of the counselling diploma programme of the IHRA.
Dr. Niel Fernando, a much respected Psychiatrist, a Senior Lecturer and Head of Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Medicine of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) in Ratmalana, was formerly the Consultant Psychiatrist of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and a visiting lecturer at the IHRA who lectured the members in their particular study program.The energetic PCA membership is now involved in varied fields around the country from counseling to medical and health, service, education, training and human resource.
In its quest to uplift the knowledge and standard of the members and enhance their experience in counseling, the PCA headed by Founder President Damith Perera, regularly holds training workshops in Colombo and reaches out to the general public by accepting public counseling assignments. Since 2016, the PCA partners with Future Minds  Higher Education and Career Exhibition, an annual three-day educational event at the BMICH, by solely managing the career guidance counseling unit through its members. There the widely experienced PCA membership counsels treating more than 1,000 individuals on a daily basis.
In keeping with its Vision of being active in order to create mental well-being to make people happy, the members travel far and wide in the country to offer counseling in all forms from first aid counseling to drug and alcohol counseling; marriage and family counseling, child and teenage counseling; educational and career guidance counseling, grief and trauma counseling etc. When a need arises, the association offers free counseling sessions in distant village schools and temples as a social service responsibility to the people of Sri Lanka. Counselling is done in many ways.
An interesting, fun and a stress-free way is through aesthetics using music, art and drama. Counsellors often use this non-verbal therapeutic technique to get through to many deeply grieved individuals to open up and get over their psychological issues.
This year as a fund raiser to expand the services offered by its membership to the community, the PCA will stage the well known and the award winning Sinhala stage drama Nethuwa Beri Minihek (A man much needed), produced by Raitha Dissanayake. He is an acclaimed leading playwright who has been in the field from the 90s to date producing many popular and award-winning plays such as Weeraya Merila, Sihina Horu Aran, Apahu Herenna Be, Bakamoona Veedi Basi and Adara Wasthuwa.
The drama, winner of seven awards at the State Drama Festival 2017 tells a satirical story of Jayantha, a Sinhala businessman, in a dilemma after a change in the political stage and how that change affects him and his family.
The cast of Nethuwa Beri Minihek comprises of Dharmapriya Dias, Shyam Fernando, Nadeeshan Peliarachchi, BimsaraPremaratne, Pasan Ranaweera, Anuradha Mallawarachchi, Nalin Lusena, Charindra Chandrasena and KasunChathuranga.

## Title: PERCY Abeysekera - the cheering mascot

PERCY Abeysekera - the cheering mascot
The Lion in the fluttering Sri Lanka Flag during Sri Lanka cricket matches comes alive and commands the attention of all fans. This LION speaks with an authoritative tone and becomes virtually the mascot for the Sri Lanka team. It has entered into Sri Lankan folk lore. This Lion by another name is PERCY ABEYSEKERA.
ABEYSEKERA is already a LEGEND. When foreign teams started visiting the country and playing what was termed whistle stop games because they were one-day hit abouts, a young guy started his cheering career, that has now reached, if one was to use cricketing parlance world class.
Whistle stop games
Those games were termed whistle stops because unlike today when teams jet from country to country, in the good old days teams visited by ship, they broke journey and indulged in a game to stretch their sea weary legs.
At the start of his now glittering cheering career that has spanned decades, ABEYSEKERA has left a niche that no other country could produce a traveling cheer man of ABEYSEKERAS class to cheer and inspire their cricketers.
Opening his cheering innings, ABEYSEKERA used to run round the Colombo Oval where most games were played shouting encouragement to local cricketers. He had a voice that would resonate and which inspired the local cricketers. But when the need arose he would not hesitate to castigate the local players.
International greats
But he did not forget the international greats who played here. He cheered them too. But once the country attained the elusive Test portals which saw teams playing here regularly ABEYSEKERAS popularity began to grow.
But while shouting inspiration, he needed a partner and that partner came in the form of the Sri Lankan Lion Flag which has now become his cheering partner and like Mary and the little lamb everywhere that ABEYSEKERA goes his flag was sure to go.
ABEYSEKERA endeared himself to all local and visiting international cricketers. To many his cheering was a revelation and they watched in amazement as he found the energy to run round the fields and cheer locals and international cricketers for their outstanding deeds with bat or ball or when a brilliant catch was held.
Without scoring
When a batsman was out without scoring, a catch was grassed or a bowler takes a battering, he would shout words of encouragement to them and won their hearts.
Of the many jibes that are well remembered are these. When the Australians played here and when their opening batsman David Boon was going into bat minutes before lunch ABEYSEKERA shouted  Come on Boon, you Tasmanian goon, come back soon, before noon.
And true to his words Boon actually got out soon and as furious as he often is, returned to the pavilion cursing. Percy went up to say bad luck. A livid Boon chased after PERCY to hit him with the bat. But PERCY was lucky as Boon tripped and fell.
Several jibes
But of the several jibes that evoked laughter was this one. India were playing a Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground and ABEYSEKERA was at his best shouting encouragement to the Sri Lankans who were dominating the game.
Watching the action were President J.R.Jayewardene and President of the Cricket Board Gamini Dissanayeke from the VIP enclosure. A spectator adjoining that enclosure shouted PERCY go home. His witticism was top class as he replied your wife at home. President Jayewardene, Dissanayeke and others in the VIP enclose burst out in loud laughter.
Heres more  when the England spinner Geoff Cope had been hit all round the ground by the Sri Lankan batsmen at the Oval PERCY shouted. Cope, theres no hope, until you call the Pope.
Receiving end
South African born England captain Tony Greig too was at the receiving end. Hey Greg, youve got your height, Ive got my might, I will send you up like a kite, if the air is right, then I will have you for a bite, especially if I am tight.
Sanath Jayasuriya was batting and one heckler tried to humiliate PERCY saying  Hey PERCY pinna (one who gets free meals, drinks etc)- only to get a cracker of a reply. Mamma pinna bat karanne Sanna, umbae amma gonna. The heckler beat a hasty retreat.
Russel Arnold, now a leading TV commentator was having a bad patch with the bat during his tenure with the Lankan team. PERCY met him when he was having a net and Arnold said. Uncle you are now boring. That is because you are not scoring, Arnold went dumb.
Calypso music
To former West Indies captain Alvin Kallicharan, who is said to be an ardent lover of calypso music PERCY sang Jamaican Johnny style - Lets put mann and woman together, to see which one is smarter.
Some say mann, but I say no, woman is smarter not so long ago. I had a girl called Caroline, she called me honey boy all the time, when I went home late last night, she was ding dong bell with a friend of mine.
Another Calypso from PERCY singing while the papare, papare band played. A cricket crazy son asks.
Father, father what is that hanging like a cricket bat  then the father answers, sanna, sanna, that is what, which made your mamas tummy fat, to loud laughter by the spectators.
Not so long ago PERCY was one of the mourners at Sports Journalist Ranjan Anandappas burial at the Kanatte cemetery when Anandappas former Editor-in-chief of the Sunday Observer Dinesh Weerawansa in the company of the writer and Fr.Felician Perera, Parish Priest of St.Marys Church Bambalapitiya who officiated at the funeral service seeing PERCY asked.
PERCY wheres the flag. PERCYS witty reply In the bag. There was no loud laughter, because it was a solemn occasion. Another one from PERCY went like this.
An England cricket fan told PERCY that they have a cheer squad known as 'BARMY ARMY'.and wanted to know whether Sri Lanka had one too..
'Yes.said PERCY we call them 'APPUARMY'. PERCY have you a DEGREE asked another fan. 'No' said Percy.But I come from good PEDIGREE.
Non-playing captain
PERCY is at times referred to as the non-playing countrys captain, because when he sees a cricketer or the captain not performing correctly he would shout sound advice and how it should be done which was graciously accepted.
PERCYS greatest moment and which he still reminisces with great joy was to be present proudly waving the lion flag when Sri Lanka captured crickets Mount Everest by winning the World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan in 1996 beating the mighty Australians in the final.
PERCY and LIONEL who were the cheer leaders were pelted with oranges and other rubbish by some of the spectators. But fearless and undaunted they took the rubble and had the last laugh when Sri Lanka won the final.
Life in danger
There was a moment when PERCYS life was in danger. I was there at the Melbourne Cricket Ground covering the tour for the DAILY NEWS and SUNDAY OBSERVER. PERCY led the cheering in Bay 13 with a packed Bay of Sri Lankan supporters, heckling Shane Warne and Mark Waugh who were alleged to have been involved in match fixing.
Unable to take the heckling the drunken Aussie louts in the adjoining Bay became furious and when things seemed to be getting out of hand the Police came up to Percy and escorted him out to prevent what could have been a nasty incident.
At 80 PERCY ABEYSEKERA is, to use cricketing parlance still keeping his end up at the wicket and says that until the Greaty Scorer raises his finger ruling him OUT, he will faithfully support Sri Lankas cricket.
When lesser and dubious mortals are showered praise and honour, it is time that Sri Lanka Cricket and the Country honour the great man for his loyalty to the game for over 50 years by naming Maitland Place where Sri Lanka Cricket is situated as the Percy Abeysekera Place or Mawatha as a tribute.
SPORTS LEGENDS come in many forms. ABEYSEKERA a former cricketer at St. Aloysius College Galle was a left hand bat and a leg spin/googly bowler like the writer. He is best described as a CHEER LEGEND of world renown. Keep batting PERCY.

Proper system will be in place to protect Treasury: Minister
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said a proper and systematic mechanism will be implemented to protect the Treasury while streamlining the process of the Central Bank under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Amaraweera was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo, yesterday.
Minister Amaraweera, referring to the Treasury Bond issue, added that a proper mechanism should be implemented to protect the Treasury. Accordingly, the Governor of the Central Bank will not be a political appointment hereafter, he said.
He added that the report on the Treasury Bond issue, indirectly signifies that there should be such a mechanism to protect the Treasury and not allow anyone to misuse the Treasury and public assets.
Minister Amaraweera praised the measures taken by President Sirisena to mitigate fraud and corruption, especially to end monetary irregularities by appointing the Special Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond issue. People in the country may not place their trust in Commissions unless the President appointed the Presidential Commission. The appointing of the special Presidential Commission is a novel feature in the countrys political arena. Moreover, it can be considered as a forward and fruitful measure to end corruption, he said.
Both politicians and state officers will think not only twice but many times when committing illegal financial transactions, he said.
When asked how long it would take to take action against the responsible parties of the Treasury Bond issue, he said legal action relating to the issue should be taken promptly.
It is significant that people are not familiar with such a powerful and impartial Presidential Commission, which investigates into allegations without considering the positions of anyone. For the first time in the countrys history, the Commission has suggested that any losses be claimed from the responsible parties, Minister Amaraweera said.
As per the directives of the Commission, further action will be taken by the relevant parties.
Another Commission to inquire into Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines will be appointed by the President in future, he noted.
The Minister, while refusing the allegations levelled by the Joint Opposition that the Government is selling state properties, said the government put an end to the trend of selling state properties. The last state property was sold during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to a Chinese company. It was the land belonged to the Army Headquarters, he said.
After that, no state property was sold, he said.
Speaking on a news report which appeared on a daily Sinhala newspaper, that salaries of Parliamentarians and provincial councillors will increase in the future, the Minister said parliamentarians have not received a salary increment for around 10 years. Responding to parliamentarian Mahinda Yapa that no rice was imported during the Rajapaksa regime as there was bumper harvest and the country had a self-sufficiency in rice, Minister Amaraweera said Yapa didnt know that the former Trade Minister Johnston Fernando imported 250,000 MT of low-quality rice. Those loads of rice could not be sold even as animal food due to poor quality, he said.
It is significant that Mahinda Yapa as the then Agriculture Minister, didnt know that 250,000 MT of rice was imported by then Trade Minister Johnston Fernando, he said.
Minister Amaraweera said there is a hidden conspiracy to dismantle the Government. This is observed in the behaviour of the JO and the UNP parliamentarians. Both the JO and UNP members are asking SLFP parliamentarians to quit the Government. Considering this situation, it can be considered that both segments want to dismantle the Government, he said.
Speaking on the price of rice, the Minister said it is up to the Consumer Affairs Authority to conduct raids against errant traders who sell rice at high prices as there is no rice scarcity now.

Regulations for private hospitals from Feb. 1
The Health Ministry will commence regulating private hospitals from February 1, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, an international organization named KPMG has already gathered information of the prices charged by all private hospitals in Sri Lanka for various services and forwarded a report to the Health Ministry.
After studying the report presented by the KPMG on the prices, arrangements will be made to establish a system to regulate private hospitals. The objective of the process is to offer a quality health service to the people at a reasonable price, according to the Minister.
The Health Ministry will also check on private hospitals which did not provide information for the survey conducted by the KPMG.
The price of expensive drugs will be reduced after introducing the regulating system for private hospitals. The Health Ministry sources said the Ministry had received several complaints from the public on charging unreasonable prices for various services offered to them by various private hospitals.

Secret world of the planets smallest feline revealed
The diminutive rusty-spotted cat is so small that it can sit in the palm of the hand and weighs little more than a bag of sugar. What the elusive wild kitty lacks in stature it makes up for with cuteness and incredible sense of adventure.
Delighted wildlife filmmakers are flagging the shots being aired in episode one of the primetime natural history series as some of the most intimate images ever filmed of a species rarely seen by human eye.
The BBCs crew teamed up with conservationists in Sri Lanka to find a young male on the point of going it alone in the world for the first time at a remote rainforest sanctuary.
Up close and personal scenes show the wide-eyed cat, looking all the world like a tabby kitten, padding his way across the jungle floor, passing fallen leaves that almost cover his body.
Forever daring and intrepid, the youngster is not fazed when it reaches a stream, bravely swimming across and, unlike the average moggie, showing no signs of an aversion to water.
Camera operator Ian Llwellyn says: Rusty-spotted cats are a beautiful, yet elusive mammal. Filming them was incredibly challenging both technically and logistically. As the smallest of the cat family, rusty-spotted cats are quick and unbelievably nimble; two factors that make them very hard to capture on film. Coupled with intermittent monsoon deluges, the deep shade of the rainforest canopy and lots of leeches, it made for a very interesting shoot.
However, with typical BBC Natural History Unit dogged determination we managed to film a sequence which I very much hope will shine at least some light on these incredible cats.
Illuminating the worlds cats great and small has been a two-year challenge for the wildlife documentary makers who excelled last year with the superlative Blue Planet 2 series.
Filming felines, famed for their power, cunning and mysterious behaviour, has been a challenge as teams travelled to 14 different countries, tracking down 31 of the known 40 species of felid, a feat no previous crew has ever achieved.
Besides scenes of lions, tigers, snow leopards and cheetahs shot with the latest camera technology, Big Cats also delves into the world of such little studied species as Pallass cat from Mongolia. A spokesperson for the show says: If you think you know cats, youre in for a surprise: theres far more to this charismatic and misunderstood family than just being the worlds top predators.
Cats have their tender side  they are emotional and intelligent  in this landmark three-part series we uncover their social side, their complex communication, devoted parental care, courtship, and reveal how cats survive and thrive in all four corners of the globe. From the frozen north to the oldest and driest deserts, from the most remote, unexplored landscapes to the very heart of our modern world.
Big Cats is the ultimate, definitive celebration of the entire cat family. The planets top predators and everyones favourite animals, as youve never seen them before.

The shortage of real leaders
Our world looks in vain for strong leadership. Politicians and Religious leaders no longer seem to offer it. Our world looks in vain for strong leadership lamented the commentary for a new report by the World Economic Forum about the global outlook.
The Geneva-based foundation, best known for its gatherings of world leaders, surveyed 1767 experts about the major trends likely to keep troubling us in the year ahead. We need more and better leaders to tackle the pressing issues of our times. The picture such data and opinions keep painting for us is that of a leadership vacuum, a dangerous shortage of strong and effective leaders that governments and companies are struggling to fill. Compare that picture with the growth of the leadership industry. That is, the sprawling global industry encompassing leadership institutions, publishers, magazines, start-ups, think-tanks, foundations, agencies, corporate universities, consulting firms, training outfits, freelancers and so on, dedicated to the development and maintenance of leadership, the models and images of what leaders and leading look like; and to the development of leaders, the selection, training, mentoring and endorsement of those who aspire to lead.
Since 2010, while confidence in leaders has remained at historical lows, effective leadership is one of the most elusive keys to organizational success. While a number of organizations worldwide have successfully cracked the code. However, todays flatter, faster, more flexible organizations, facing intense competition in a global market, require more dynamic leadership. Those organizations that are most successful in developing their executives and senior managers carefully assess the performance and capabilities of these leaders and potential leaders, provide them extensive development and coaching, measure their progress, and then reward them. They also focus on enhancing the self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and social skills of their leaders, what we refer to as emotional intelligence.
Leadership capacity
Leadership bench strength, the leadership pipeline and leadership capacity are popular metaphors for the underlying issue of ensuring that an organizations leadership is adequately developed to face current and future challenges. Regardless of the term that is used, the particular concept emphasizes that leadership is not centralized in a single or small number of individuals. It begins with the belief or organizational norm that leadership is everyones business and required to move an organization forward. Why Because the kinds of challenges faced in todays globally competitive environment are far too complex for any individual to figure out alone and then deal with the complexities. In order to survive and thrive, successful organizations must be keenly aware of their leadership talent and how to best develop it across all levels. Succession planning and leadership development are key processes in assessing and developing an organizations leadership talent. Therefore an overall systems-wide perspective on leadership development helps to build a broader leadership capacity and a deeper pipeline of solid leaders. The focus is not just on those at the top but includes most or all management levels. There is a related tendency to focus attention on high-potential employees. This makes sense in terms of potentially maximizing the return on investment (ROI) from developmental efforts. On the other hand, an unintended consequence is that it allows a significant part of the organization to weaken.
From classroom to work related
Leadership development efforts too often are like focusing on the whitecaps in the ocean and entirely missing the unseen force of the deep blue sea .The most effective succession planning and leadership development initiatives are connected across levels in a coherent way. Therefore a roadmap for the development of the required skills, competencies, attitudes and perspectives must ensure that leadership skills developed at one level are built upon at a higher level. By being systematic, the development initiative builds explicit linkages across leadership levels.
Readiness of leaders
Succession planning also incorporates diagnostic tools and methods for assessing the developmental readiness of employees for particular roles. Overly generic leadership development initiatives lose sight of the universal importance of individual differences in developmental readiness. People differ in the extent that they are ready for developmental stretch assignments that are at the core of many of the most effective leadership development initiatives. When it comes to succession management, Jack Welch a former CEO of General Electric (fourth-largest company in the world among the Forbes Global) was probably the best-known CEO champion of tailored succession management. His Chief Learning Officer at the time (Steve Kerr) claimed that Welch knew intimately the career paths of more than a thousand employees in GE and would spend fully one quarter of his time on the GE succession planning process. This level of CEO involvement in succession planning is extraordinary and probably unlikely in most other organizations. At minimum, however, every managerial employee should have an individual development plan and be held accountable for making progress on it every year. Leadership development is not an isolated event. Rather, it is a significant part of ongoing work-related experience. Research shows that executives find learning from work-related experience to be a more powerful force for their development as compared with classroom-based learning.
Therefore, developmental experiences focuses much more on helping leaders learn and develop from their work experiences rather than taking them away from their work to attend classroom training. In the final analysis like the WEF report highlights the need for a new breed of leaders, leaders with skills better suited for the digital age: a global perspective combined with the ability to collaborate across sectors, communicate honestly, plan for the long term and keep the public interest in mind. One could not possibly disagree looking at what is happening around us.

SL has negative outlook as  of January 2018 - Moodys
Moodys Investors Service says that Sri Lanka has a negative outlook as of January 2018 out of the 24 sovereigns that have being rated rate in Asia Pacific. Of the 24 countries rated in Asia Pacific, 21 had a stable outlook, while Indonesia and Vietnam held a positive outlook.
According to their 2018, Asia Pacific rating outlook Report, Moodys opines that capital outflows are a channel of vulnerability in countries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Mongolia, adding that frontier markets are vulnerable to interest rate and currency shocks.
Moodys last month affirmed the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings at B1 and maintained the negative outlook.
The decision to maintain the negative outlook reflects Moodys view that persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks continue to pressure Sri Lankas credit profile and specifically that measures to build reserves and smooth the profile of external payments may be insufficient to stem imminent government liquidity and balance of payments pressures starting in 2019, when large international debt repayments come due and Sri Lankas three-year International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme concludes.
Government debt is high for frontier markets such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka (B1 negative), Mongolia, the Maldives and Japan (A1 stable) and Japan, while corporate and household debt poses broad contingent liability risks for emerging markets and advanced economies, Moodys says in its 2018-Asia Pacific rating outlook report .
Our outlook for sovereign creditworthiness in Asia Pacific (APAC) in 2018 is stable overall, reflecting our expectation for the fundamental credit conditions that will drive sovereign credit over the next 12 to 18 months, Moodys says.

SLR conducts Rugby Coaching Programme in Kuliyapitiya
Sri Lanka Rugby conducted a Rugby Coaching Programme in the Kuliyapitiya district on the 15th January with over 900 girls and boys participating in the event. It was a resounding success and it was nice to see the Minister of Sports gracing the occasion and encouraging the children.
Sri Lanka Rugby has a big plan to take the sport to the rural areas and they are targeting to take the sport to every educational zone.
Their initial plan is to cover all 25 districts by identifying one Educational Zone in the district. The idea of picking a zone is to create a competition within the zone without having to travel far and also to keep the costs down.
SLR has been conducting training programs for Coaches, Referees, Medics and Match Officials in order to help and support the development programs.
They have a very steep target of increasing the number of players in Sri Lanka to 30,000 within the next three years and this development has been well supported by the Education Ministry and the Sports Ministry.
Sri Lanka rugby are also planning to take the game to the North and the East and hoping to conduct Rugby Coaching Programmes in those provinces within the next two months.

We have already established Local Government Network or LGN which integrates all the government establishments in the country for effective communications is another clear example of the way forward. Today all the public and private enterprises are beginning to embrace hosted managed services and Cloud services because it promises increased agility in addition to making a saving in OPEX and CAPEX.
SLTs Data Centres and Cloud platform is a scalable and cost effective alternative to dedicated computing resources deployed in-house by companies and includes managed virtual data centres, virtual private servers, and virtual LANs to assure customers of high availability.
Adding thoughts on the initiative SLTs Group Chairman, P. G. Kumarasingha said, The functions of SLT are based solely aligning to the GoSL development and digital roadmap and also on the needs of the consumer and as a vital player in the backbone of Sri Lankas ICT industry, SLT is dedicated to developing the countrys ICT infrastructure in every way possible. The capability of providing high speed connectivity is essential to our business, so it makes perfect sense that the data centre is meshed into our national backbone network and MPLS network for seamless delivery of hosted applications.

Sri Lanka sweat over Mathews fitness ahead of Bangladesh ODI
DHAKA, Thursday: Skipper Angelo Mathews is doubtful for Sri Lankas second one-day international in the tri-nation tournament in Bangladesh after the allrounder sustained a suspected injury on Thursday.
Mathews, who was in action during Sri Lankas opening loss to Zimbabwe on Wednesday, was under observation ahead of the crucial game against the hosts on Friday.
I think he had hurt his hamstring. We are not sure if its hamstring or cramping and (were) waiting for the specialists verdict, batting coach Thilan Samaraweera told reporters in Dhaka.
Middle-order batsman Dinesh Chandimal is expected to lead the side if Mathews is ruled out.
Mathews, who returned as the teams limited-overs captain ahead of the tri-series, made a valiant 42 before the islanders went down to Zimbabwe by 12 runs.
It was Sri Lankas fourth defeat against the southern African side in the last six matches. The struggling team won only five of their 29 50-over matches in 2017.
In a bid to re-build the Sri Lankan team ahead of the 2019 World Cup in England, the islanders have appointed former opener Chandika Hathurusingha as head coach.
We had a bad year last year but now under Chandika we are trying to step up as a different team. We hope we can change the situation this year, said Samaraweera.  AFP

SriLankan Airlines clarifies position on Weliamuna Report, aftermath actions
The Corporate Communications Division of SriLankan Airlines in a statement issued to the media on Thursday had clarified the actions taken by its Board of Directors in the aftermath of the Weliamuna Report.
In early 2015, Attorney-at-Law J. C. Weliamuna was appointed head of an investigation into issues regarding abuse of power, irregularities of airline procurement and leasing, due process, and external interferences.
The SriLankan Airlines said its Board of Directors have, in the three years since, taken all action possible to address the internal and disciplinary issues highlighted in the J. C. Weliamuna Report.
Statement in full:
Due to numerous Newspaper articles and other interested parties who have referred to the J.C. Weliamuna Report many a time, this response is to put things into perspective, which we hope will clarify the position of the actions taken by the Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines Limited.
The then Minister of Ports, Shipping & Aviation, Arjuna Ranatunga in February 2015 appointed a Board of Inquiry headed by Attorney-at-Law J.C. Weliamuna and the terms of reference of the Board of Inquiry was to conduct a preliminary investigation and ascertain whether there was prima facie evidence of the following:
(a) Abuse of power by the Board of Directors and the Senior Management of SriLankan Airlines prior to the appointment of the current Board of Directors in February 2015.
(b) Irregularities in the procurement/or leasing of Aircraft.
(c) Whether due process has been followed in the procurement of goods and services by SriLankan Airlines valued at over LKR 25 MN.
(d) Whether there have been external interferences adversely affecting the smooth functioning of the Airline.
At a Cabinet Sub Committee on Economic Affairs Chaired by the Prime Minister in July 2015, it was explained that the Ministry of Aviation has sought the opinion of the Attorney General on the J.C. Weliamuna Report and that some of the cases reported had been referred to the Bribery Commission, CID and FCID. At that same meeting, Chairman of SriLankan Airlines was instructed to submit a report to the next meeting, on the actions that has been taken by the Board of Directors to address the internal issues and disciplinary issues highlighted in the report.
On the instructions of the Cabinet Sub Committee, a comprehensive response to the J.C. Weliamuna Report on the actions taken by the three member Board Committee in respect of the observations and recommendations made in the Report, was submitted.
The comprehensive response to the Weliamuna Report was also submitted to the President; the Prime Minister; Kabir Hashim/Minister of Public Enterprise Development; Eran Wickramartne, Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development; Ravindra Hewavitharana, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development; ;D. Swarnapala,Secretary, Ministry of Aviation and R Paskaralingam, Advisor to the Ministry of National Policies & Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance & Planning.
In September 2017, a comprehensive docket containing the Companys responses in connection with the Weliamuna Report were submitted to the Chairman of the COPE, Sunil Handunnetti, MP. Most recently, a further update in January 2018 was submitted to the Minister Kabir Harshim,Minister of Public Enterprise Development.
It is to be noted that whilst simultaneously the internal investigation were being carried out by a three member Board Committee of SriLankan Airlines, some of the employees were also summoned to the PRECIFAC (Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and abuse of power, state resources and privileges), CID (Criminal Investigation Department), FCID (Financial Crimes Investigation Division) and the Bribery commission (Commission to investigate allegations of Bribery or Corruption) to provide Statements and submit documents and information and to this date, investigations continue with the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission. The external investigations on the matters referred to above are not within the capability or the mandate of the Board of Directors.
In July 2016, Kabir Hashim, Minister of Public Enterprise Development, requested that a forensic audit on the financial transaction and affairs referred to in the Weliamuna Report be conducted by a forensic accounting services but owing to the high cost involved, the decision was abandoned by the Minister.
Contrary to popular belief, the Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines have taken all action possible to address the internal and disciplinary issues highlighted in the J. C. Weliamuna Report.

Understanding national reconciliation:
The tie that binds us together
January 8 -14 was declared a National Integration Week by the Government. It was supposed to drive home the imperative need for national reconciliation for development. However, except for reported speeches of the President and the Prime Minister and isolated references by few religious dignitaries in their sermons nothing much was observed. Even the media stood aloof.
Our Honourable Members of Parliament thought its better to engage in fisticuffs and exchange un-parliamentary compliments rather than think of reconciliation. Perhaps the politicians were more concerned with electoral battles for local (or national) governance. In the context of elections most of them were promoting not national reconciliation or integration but their conflict and separation.
What is reconciliation Cambridge Dictionary defines it as a situation in which two people or groups of people become friendly again after they have argued. With a history of several decades of distrust, intolerance and prejudice between principal national communities inhabiting the country and the ugly experience of a fratricidal war which lasted almost three decades, it is obvious that Sri Lanka is in dire need of a process that could restore trust, tolerance and fraternal relations between all its communities.
Institutional structures
Though everybody acknowledges the latter objectives quite the contrary is observed in practice in numerous instances, established customs and certain institutional structures and among various groups of people.
Reconciliation is one of building trust among people as members of a common species humans, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, politics and cultural beliefs. It is unity in diversity that should be strived for and defended. It is such unity in diversity that is abundant in inanimate nature as well as in fauna and flora. Should humans, as part of nature, be different
Trust could be built only on the basis of recognizing the equality of reconciling parties. Hence, notions and practices of superiority or dominance of one over others is inimical in building trust. Similarly all parties should have equal rights. There can be no privileged parties.
In the case of nations and nationalities a sine qua non for reconciliation is the acceptance of their equality. There cannot be superior and inferior nations and nationalities. Similarly all languages and cultures should have equal status.
Equality also implies equal access to state services and opportunities for development. The ideal to be ensured is equity or social justice, which means that historical wrongs have to be corrected and special efforts should be made to remove anomalies in the provision of access to and opportunities for services.
Actually, national reconciliation is a process that includes among others seeking the truth of what happened, identifying and ensuring justice to those victimized by conflict including reparations, guaranteeing rights of all and ensuring non-recurrence of wrongs through institutional reforms.
Needless to say that that this process cannot be achieved overnight. As a preliminary there should be an attitudinal change amongst the public. Marx used to say that an idea would become a material force once it is grasped by the people. Hence, the necessity of an awareness campaign amongst the masses about the need and benefits of national reconciliation.
Administrative procedures
Reconciliation is not only a political necessity but also an economic necessity for national discord and strife would destabilize the country and no development would be possible. Investors would be reluctant to come to Sri Lanka. It would also lead to internal disturbances including the breakdown of industrial peace.
One could also begin with confidence building measures such as ending discriminatory practices, improvements to administrative procedures, enhancing accountability of state institutions to improve the atmosphere for further progress.
For example, such measures could include strengthening the civil administration in the North and East, restoration of the powers of provincial and local government representative bodies, return of private lands taken over and presently occupied by security forces to their former owners, re-settlement of the displaced and provision of means of livelihood to them, ascertaining the fate of the disappeared, release of prisoners of conscience held under detention for long, ending the culture of impunity for miscreants and strengthening the rule of law. The annulment of repressive legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and certain Emergency Regulations are also tasks to be carried out in the short-term.
None of these measures involve any threat to the security of the state or the territorial integrity of the country as alleged by opponents of national integration.
On the foundations laid by the confidence building measures one could advance further towards sharing of power by presently estranged national communities in various fora including representative bodies. Such power sharing should include not only devolution of power to the peripheries but also power-sharing at the center. The latter would act as a deterrent to divisive or separatist tendencies as it would give the formerly marginalized a stake in central power.
However, the final objective of national reconciliation is the revision of the Fundamental Law of the land or the Constitution to guarantee a society in which all communities could live in peace and harmony with dignity and equality, participating in economic, social and cultural development of the country.

Two Koreas to march together
SOUTH KOREA: North and South Korea have agreed to march together under a single flag at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, in the latest sign that the crisis on the peninsula may be easing.
The decision comes after months of tensions over Pyongyangs nuclear and missile programme, the latest phase in the turmoil that has persisted since the start of the Korean War.
Here is a timeline of relations between the two Koreas, who remain technically at war:
In June 1950 fighting broke out between the communist North and capitalist South, sparking a brutal war that killed between two and four million people.
Beijing backed Pyongyang in the three-year conflict, while Washington threw its support behind the South -- alliances that have largely endured.
The Koreas have been locked in a dangerous dance ever since that conflict ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a formal peace treaty, leaving them technically at war.
Pyongyang has tested the fragile ceasefire with numerous attacks.
The secretive nation sent a team of 31 commandos to Seoul in a botched attempt to assassinate then-President Park Chung-Hee in 1968. All but two were killed.
In the axe murder incident of 1976, North Korean soldiers attacked a work party trying to chop down a tree inside the Demilitarized Zone, leaving two US army officers dead.
Pyongyang launched perhaps its most audacious assassination attempt in Myanmar in 1983, when a bomb exploded in a Yangon mausoleum during a visit by South Korean President Chun Doo-Hwan. He survived, but 21 people, including some government ministers, were killed.
In 1987, a bomb on a Korean Air flight exploded over the Andaman Sea, killing all 115 people on board. Seoul accused Pyongyang, which denied involvement.
The Norths founding leader Kim Il-Sung died in 1994, but under his son Kim Jong-Il, it continued to prod its southern neighbour.
In 1996, a North Korean submarine on a spying mission ran aground off the eastern South Korean port of Gangneung, sparking 45-day manhunt that ended with 24 crew members and infiltrators killed.
A clash between South Korean and North Korean naval ships in 1999 left around 50 of the Norths soldiers dead.
In March 2010, Seoul accused Pyongyang of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46 sailors. Pyongyang denied the charge. November that year saw North Korea launch its first attack on a civilian-populated area since the war, when it fired 170 artillery shells at Yeonpyeong. Four people were killed, including two civilians.
North Korea has steadfastly pursued its banned nuclear and ballistic missile programmes since its first successful test of an atomic bomb in 2006, as it looks to build a rocket capable of delivering a warhead to the US mainland.
Progress has accelerated under leader Kim Jong-Un, culminating in Pyongyangs sixth and biggest nuclear test in September 2017.
Kim has since declared the country a nuclear power.
Despite the caustic effect of clashes and the battery of conventional weapons that the North has amassed at the border to threaten Seoul, the two nations have held talks in the past.
Then-North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il held two historic summits with counterparts from the South in 2000 and 2007, which eased tensions between the neighbours.
Lower-level talks since then have been much hyped but have failed to produce significant results.
Next months Winter Olympics in the South have given the neighbours a pretext to reopen communications after a two-year hiatus.
A special cross-border hotline buzzed into life this month for the first time since 2016, in response to a suggestion by Kim Jong-Un that Pyongyang could send a team to the Games, which the South has billed as its Peace Olympics.
After a series of meetings, both Koreas agreed not only on Pyongyangs participation, but also announced that their athletes will march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month in Pyeongchang, South Korea - AFP

Several other religious leaders too were present to wish him well.
So, we have two radiant bishops currently from the seat of priestly dominance which is Moratuwa with the enthronement of Bishop Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando and Roman Catholic Bishop Valence Mendis from the Diocese of Chilaw, who are both scholars chosen by God to guide His flock to greener pastures.
The newly consecrated Bishop is very humane, brimming with simplicity and one who is able to reach the poor and humble; keeping with the example set by Jesus, removed from pomp and pageantry.
Chief Sanganayake of the Salpitikorale Ven. Mahagalkadawala Punnasara Nayake Thera wishing the newly elected Bishop
He has absolutely no qualms about his mission as a crusader for the Lord. What he was as a priest, he will be as a Bishop without withdrawing from different classes of people. Like our own Bishop Delo Canagasabey to whom every single person, Christian or not, matters on equal terms with no barrier built around him. Bishop Keerthisiri will draw his inspiration from him.
I know for sure nothing is ever going to spoil or distract his sacred mission. Having an excellent rapport with all other religious leaders and their followers, Bishop Keerthisiri has the spiritual power to bring everyone onto to one platform of peace, unity and love.
The ability to co-ordinate with one and all and make all feel the same in the presence of God, is mightier than the sword in hand.
Early life
Born to believing Christian parents who nurtured him towards a brilliant academic career of his choice, they were rewarded with the 'Prince of peace' when they found their wondrous son had decided to dedicate his life to God. He commenced schooling at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa, never imagining it was the foundation laid for his spiritual career.
The excellent education and spiritual background that lay within the portals of this magnificent school was the primary backing to what lay ahead in serving God.
Eminent scholar
With schooling done, he entered the Theological College of Lanka at Pilimatalawa. Still later, he was reading for the Bachelor of Engineering in England in the year 1985 with a vision of being an engineer. This was followed by the double M. Phil. qualification in Sri Lanka reading for his Ph.D.
The engineering field in Sri Lanka lost an eminent Engineer while God's pathway gained much for His sheep. Bishop Keerthisiri had absolutely no hesitation in choosing the right one.
Therefore, the elevation of Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando as the sixth Bishop of Kurunegala was a blessing from above for someone who as a deacon in 1989 rose to such heights in a span of few years. That is how God rewards his chosen children.
What he gave the Christian world
When he preached of the limits and infinite intensity of the Christian heart and attempted to explore that which is spiritual that cannot be described to precision, he turns spiritual because there is something of an urgency in the scriptures to fulfill God's highest purposes and ever since he pledged his life for God, Bishop Keerthisiri's heart was filled with the incredible truth from God's Word.
He was ordained the arch-deacon of Nuwara Eliya and continued his services while being attached to the Department of the Education Ministry, being a member of the Advisory Board which compiled Christianity textbooks.
He was also Chaplain at Hillwood College, Kandy, Theological College of Lanka and the Denipitiya Missionary Medical Institute, among many others.

Vote for UNP in order to see development - MP Imran Mahroof
United National Party Parliamentarian Imran Mahroof said that those who cannot light up the electric lights in the Kinniya Bridge again ask for power. He said this while speaking at a public meeting on Wednesday night (17), supporting candidates for the UNP in Kinniya Pradeshiya Sabha.
He said, twenty years later, the United National Party has come to power. That is why we are slowly leading to the development of the country. This is why it is interesting to raise questions about what the United National Party has developed for the minority parties in the government.
The last time the local councils were with them, and they also held many ministries in Parliament. Yet they could not even light up the panels on the Kinniya Bridge. Those who do not even have the power to light up a Bridge have come under your power to be elected to come back to power.
For Trincomalee I am the only MP who represents the United National Party. There is no MP or member of local government. So now let us show these powers by voting for the UNP, the ruling party, to show everyone what it means to develop.
Today, Ministers who criticise our state were ministers of the Mahinda Government. Yet, they did not carry out development they claim today.
Everyone should realise that Ranil Wickremesinghes government is needed to keep their ministrys work running properly and develop Mahroof said.

Workshop for schoolchildren on bribery and corruption
A countrywide programme of workshops targeting schoolchildren has been launched by the Bribery and Corruption Commission as a long-term programme to completely eradicate bribery and corruption from the country.
Arresting people involved in bribery and corruption and taking legal action against them would not help eradicate this social problem unless people are trained to eschew bribery and corruption from childhood, Bribery and Corruption Commissioner Neville Guruge said.
As such, the countrywide workshop programme had been launched targeting children from their school days.
The first two workshops under this programme were held at Thalawa and Kebethigollewa under the theme Supiripana Wedamuluwa, he said.

Zimbabwe opposition figure Roy Bennett dies in US helicopter crash
Prominent Zimbabwean politician Roy Bennett has been killed with his wife in a helicopter crash in North America.
The couple died along with three others when the aircraft crashed on Wednesday in a mountainous area in the US state of New Mexico. One person survived.
Bennett, 60, was a former white farmer who became a stalwart of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
His MDC party colleagues have been expressing their shock on social media.
After the deaths of Bennett and his wife Heather were confirmed on Thursday, prominent Zimbabwean opposition politician David Coltart tweeted his sympathy to the couple's loved ones.
A spokesman for the MDC party, Obert Gutu, later said in a statement that Bennett was a charismatic and extremely popular grassroots politician and a successful commercial farmer.
"Roy was a resolute and committed fighter for democratic change in Zimbabwe," Gutu said.
The private helicopter crashed in north-eastern New Mexico at about 18:00 local time on Wednesday (01:00 GMT Thursday) but the deaths were confirmed by authorities on Thursday.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Thorn in Mugabe's side
Bennett, a controversial figure, entered politics in 2000, winning a parliamentary seat for the newly formed MDC.
A former coffee farmer, he was fluent in the local Shona language and quickly rose within the party.
Bennett earned the nickname Pachedu ("between us"), which is a colloquial reference to childhood secrets.
His popularity as an MP led to President Robert Mugabe's governing Zanu-PF party holding him in particular disdain.
In 2004, he famously lost his temper in a parliament brawl with Zanu-PF Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa.
Bennett pushed Chinamasa to the ground in a row over a land redistribution programme that saw most of the country's 4,000 white farmers lose their land.
As a result, Bennett was imprisoned for several months - an experience he described as a living hell.
In 2009, as he was due to take up his post in a new power-sharing government, he was accused of involvement in a plot to overthrow Mugabe. He was cleared of treason charges the following year.
Bennett left Zimbabwe for exile in South Africa, where he continued to oppose Mugabe.
His death comes as Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa is promising a break with the past.
