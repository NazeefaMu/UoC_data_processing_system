Ven. Battaramulle Seelaratana Thera yesterday filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order preventing authorities from taking further steps in the procurement process relating to the development of a 300 megawatts combined cycle power plant at Kerawalapitiya.
The petitioner stated that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has invited interested local and foreign companies to submit proposals for the aforesaid project. "Therefore initially over 30 interested companies have obtained the Request For Proposal from CEB. However, only eight bidders have submitted proposal when the deadline for submissions expired on April 21, 2017," the petitioner added.
The petitioner further stated that among over thirty interested parties only eight bidders submitted proposals which would ultimately minimise the competitiveness for an enormous project. The petitioner further said that the CEB as the procurement entity has personal interest in the procurement process that will have a huge impact on the transparency of the procurement procedure. The petitioner cited CEB, members of National Procurement Commission, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy and several others as respondents. This petition was filed through counsel Pradeep Kumarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeep Associates.

CB Governor hopeful of IMF third tranche approval
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy expected the third tranche of the IMF US$ 1.5 billion 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to be approved once the new Inland Revenue Bill is tabled in Parliament.
The new Inland Revenue Bill was gazetted on 19 June and can be tabled in Parliament after 10 working days.
There is only one prior action that needs be completed and that is the tabling of the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament. After that we satisfy all requirements, said the Governor addressing the media at the Central Bank yesterday.
He further explained that the IMF board was expected to meet during the second week of July and the expectation was that it would be approved then. The IMF thus far has released two tranches of USD 168 million each and the third tranche of USD 168 was expected by April 20. The Governor however noted that the IMF did not require that the government to enact the Bill into legislation as a prior action to receive the tranche,
The government has committed to several prior actions and one of it is to only table it in Parliament; not pass it.
The IMF understands that as a sovereign country we have every right to decide what the Inland Revenue Bill should look like and they will understand that there will be a debate and various steps that are associated with legal enactments of legislation,Dr. Coomaraswamy added.

CB removes cap on credit card interest rates
Move to discourage rise in personal borrowings:
The removal of the cap on credit card interest rates is expected to help slow down the rising levels of personal and household debt in the country.
Central Bank Governor, Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy addressing a media briefing at the Central Bank yesterday said one of the reasons why the Central Bank felt comfortable about removing the cap was because they have seen a significant increase in personal borrowings.
The indebtedness in households has been increasing to the point where in our view, there were grounds to put some sand in the wheel and slow that down a little bit, he added.
It is up to the Banks the Governor said to set the interest rates in their own products and given that there were 26 licensed banks in the country, he expected enough competition in the market to have a competitive rate.
This is not very productive lending and if the price of that goes up, money can be redirected to more productive activity and it will be better for the economy, he added.
Sri Lankan Banks in the meantime have increased the interest rates by as much as 4 percent since the Central Bank directive and the interest rate for credit cards at present stands at 28 percent per annum.
The interest rate cap of 24 percent was lifted from credit products such as credit cards and housing loans among others. The new rates will come into effect from July 1 2017.
It is possible to argue that the sharp increase we see is because we interfered with the pricing of risk by putting a cap on it. The risk premium attached to that borrowing came down and you saw a significant increase in unproductive lending, said the Governor as he explained the logic for the removal of the cap.
Rising household debt has been a major issue in the country over the past couple of years with the war torn economies of the North and East being the most affected. The Governor in May stated that the Central Bank would undertake a study on the growing indebtedness of households in these provinces who are struggling to rebuild their lives stuck under a mountain of debt and poverty.

CMC now says no more dumping of garbage
Meethotamulla tragedy :
Supreme Court refused interim order in Nov 15:
FR was filed calling for immediate stop:
40 death certificates presented to court:
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) for the first time since the Fundamental Rights petition was filed in November 2015 calling for the immediate stopping of the dumping of garbage, informed the Supreme Court that it has ceased dumping garbage in the area. The Fundamental Rights petition filed by residents of Meethotamulla was filed in November 2015.
The Petition asked the court for an interim order prohibiting the dumping of garbage. However, the interim order was rejected although leave to proceed with the application was granted.
During the successive court dates, the Colombo Municipal Council presented proposals and reports on alternatives. The Supreme Courts continued to grant dates.
The garbage dump collapsed on April 14, killing 40 people and displacing hundreds.
The counsel who appeared for the petitioners tendered in court 40 death certificates pertaining to the persons who died owing to the tragedy.
This petition was filed by seven residents of the Meetotamulla area citing Colombo Municipal Council, Urban development authority, Western province waste management authority, Central Environment Authority, Kolonnawa municipal council and the Attorney General as Respondents.
In the petition filed around 15 months before the tragedy, the petitioners proposed means of disposing the garbage among others.
The petitioners sought a declaration from Court that the proposed expansion of the said dumping site is an imminent infringement of their Fundamental Rights.
The Petitioner states Kolonnawa city is a highly residential area, with high population density and laments in the middle of this highly residential area is a huge and growing garbage dumping site, with a huge mountain of garbage, which has now grown to over 18 acres in extent.
They state the garbage from the Colombo Municipal limits is brought and dumped into this mountain of garbage and that approximately 750 to 1,200 tons of garbage come into the site on a daily basis.
They allege the stench was becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there is a tremendous and serious health hazard, with around 30 people of the area having died due to germs and dengue, rat flu, skin deceases, kidney diseases. Hundreds of other families are affected and the affected numbers are growing daily.
They maintained there are other sustainable solutions (other than the dumping of garbage in the aforesaid manner), which could bring an end to this problem, but that these measures are not being taken by the Respondents.
They allege the Respondents are taking immediate measures to demolish another 100 houses to expand the site for a further 3 acres.
They stated that if the proposed expansion takes place there will be serious, immeasurable, irreparable and disastrous ramifications. They stated there are persons and companies who are interested in purchasing the garbage (for money) and who will recycle the said garbage at their own expense in an environmentally friendly manner.

Coleman off mark at US trials
Sacramento,Friday: Rising sprint star Christian Coleman made an explosive start to his US World Championship trials campaign on Thursday, romping into the 100m semi-finals in under 10 seconds as fastest qualifier.
The 21-year-old prodigy from the University of Tennessee shrugged off searing temperatures of around 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) at Sacramentos Hornet Stadium to advance in 9.93sec.
Coleman already owns the fastest time in the world this year over 100m, scorching to 9.82sec at the US collegiate championships.
I felt pretty good. I just wanted to come out here and get through the rounds and execute and do the best I can, said Coleman, who eased up significantly in the closing stages of an easy win.
I feel like I still have something, he added.
Isiah Young was second fastest in qualifying, clocking 9.97sec while evergreen veteran Justin Gatlin shrugged off niggling injuries that have disrupted his season to be third quickest in 10.00 sec.
Track is fast, said Gatlin. Its a surreal time for me. This is the most injured Ive ever been but Im just fighting through man.
But there was an early exit for another veteran, Tyson Gay.
The 34-year-old American record holder is competing in Sacramento just eight months after the shooting death of his teenage daughter in October last year. Gay, who has dedicated this season to his daughters memory, could only finish third in his heat in a time of 10.17sec, 15th overall.
In the mens 400m meanwhile, Texas A&M star Fred Kerley served notice of his talent with a nonchalant win in his heat.
Kerley, 22, astounded the track world last month with the seventh fastest 400m in history, a world-leading 43.7sec.
Few would bet against Kerley adding another fast time this weekend after his performance on Thursday when he coasted over the final 30 meters to win in 45.13.
Ive got plenty of gas in the tank, Kerley told AFP.
Ive put in the work. With practice you can do anything. My goals this season To win. Win everything Im in. Every level.
In the womens 100m, US track queen Allyson Felix made a rare appearance over the shortest sprint distance to advance in 11.03sec.
Felix, who is already assured of a place in the US team for London by virtue of her status as the reigning world 400m champion, is using the 100m and 200m in Sacramento to improve her speed.
I plan to run the 100 and 200 here, Felix said. My focus at worlds is on the 400 for sure. Well see what happens as far the relays go, added Felix, the only woman track and field athlete to win six Olympic gold medals.
The top three finishers in each event at the four-day meeting in northern California will qualify for the US team for the World Championships in London in August, providing they meet qualifying standards.
Meanwhile the brutal temperatures did not deter US 800m runner Alysia Montano -- five months pregnant -- from racing. Montano, 31, finished last in her 800m heat in 2min 21.40sec, but was all smiles afterwards as she revealed that her decision to run had been partly inspired by the hit Hollywood superhero movie Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot.
I feel amazing, said Montano, who ran in a vest emblazoned with the iconic comic book character.
I thought it (Wonder Woman) was amazing, Montano said. And then I found out that (Gadot) did half of the movie five months pregnant so I thought I will definitely be signing up for US Nationals. AFP

The Auditor Generals Department pointed out that only 33 files have been received so far in response to the order given to submit 597 files and in addition to that any of the information asked for has not even been submitted, the report stated.
The Committee has directed the Chief Accounting Officer to submit a report within a month indicating the methodology adopted to trace the remaining files and a specific time line in that regard.
The COPA has found out that an officer involved in the questionable activities has been appointed as the Head of the Committee appointed to investigate the disappearance of vehicle files.
The Motor Traffic Department was summoned before the Committee for four times in the year 2016 due to poor performance. The Committee has warned that it would report to the President and Prime Minister if the Department failed to show positive developments.
The COPA has also revealed that the information of 164 vehicles do not match with the documents of the Customs. Inquired by the Committee on the incident of registering seven new Prado Jeeps in a fraudulent manner using the Customs Notes for importation of hand tractors, Accounting Officer has stated that the advice of the Attorney General has been sought to cancel the registration of aforesaid vehicles. The COPA has given directions to complete the disciplinary inquiries against the officers who are connected to this incident within one year.
The COPA in its report also observed that a loss of Rs.7.7 million had been incurred to the Government due to the undervaluing of two BMW M-5 vehicles with a cylinder capacity of 4395 CC. The Department has informed that an inquiry in this connection was in progress and had agreed to submit a report in that regard to the Committee.
The Committee also observed that the tax loss caused by the import of 407 Prado type vehicles was approximately Rs.3 billion. However, the Accounting Officer of the Department had denied the occurrence of any loss, adding that a special committee appointed by the President was investigating on the matter.
The Committee has also found a large number of questionable financial transactions in Provincial Councils and Local Government bodies.
Alagiyawanna presenting the report in the House urged serious attention to the recommendations in it and take steps to debate the report in Parliament.

Ensure release of fishermen, TN CM tells Indian PM
India's Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in securing the release of four Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu allegedly arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on Wednesday night for straying into its water.
Dashing off a letter to Prime Minister Modi, Palaniswami told him that long periods of impoundment and idling of the fishing boats without care will make them unworthy of sailing and unusable for fishermen.
He also complained that traditional and historical rights of the fishermen are continuously being denied consequent to the unconstitutional ceding of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka and the consequential loss of traditional fishing grounds of the Palk Bay area.

Faith in human resources
According to the governments economic policy statement issued recently and related speeches made by PM and others, Lanka envisions achieving environment friendly sustainable development while linking the country to global supply chains and increasing trade. The government hopes to create more exposure and opportunities for entrepreneurs and skilled professionals in various sectors, including the digital economy, tourism and commercial agriculture and to attain the status of a modern manufacturing economy. However all this should be done with the responsibility towards damaging and wasting of ecological resources.
In addition, social and economic rights of humans should be protected. In this context, quality higher education and training are crucial if the Lankan economy is to move up the value chain, beyond the simple production processes and delivering products.
Lankas human capital is the essential primary resource in achieving the envisaged development goals and transforming the economy into a modern manufacturing system with relevant social responsibility. Thus, it became important for the country to be equipped with new technological innovations oriented and an educated workforce with such skills. High-quality human resources with expertise in science and technology and a skilled labour force are necessary, especially conscious of environment and eco friendly to compete globally. Even lower-skilled jobs increasingly require talent and knowledge.
Vocational training and secondary education
As such, vocational training and secondary education need to prepare prospective employees for a complex, digital work in an environment friendly background. Today, Lanka faces a major challenge in catering to these emerging skill requirements. It is necessary to explore some policy options to bridge the skill gaps to achieve the governments stated objectives.
With the environment consciousness and human social rights awareness, one has to look at World Bank proposals. World Bank study on Building the Skills for Economic Growth and Competitiveness in Sri Lanka based on a survey of employers perception of skill demand against the skills available in the workforce reveals 56 percent of employers consider that high-skilled workers should have passed A/Levels, while 70 percent of employers consider that low-skilled workers should have passed O/Levels. But the real situation is, of the age 20 and above population, only 17 percent have passed A/Levels and another 17 percent have passed O/Levels (calculations based on LFS 2014 data). This means that there is a significant gap in meeting the skills demand. In addition social and ecological consciousness should be taken into account. Today there is a rapidly growing demand for soft skillsespecially English literacy and IT prowess. Individuals competent in English have access to better quality jobs with higher salaries and benefits in the domestic labour market, as well as internationally. Also they easily enter into the discussions and seminars in the open society. The study mentioned above reveals that about 80 percent of employers expect higher-skilled workers to know English and 40 percent employers expect similar soft skills from less-skilled workers.
Higher-skilled workers
Similarly, 75 percent of employers expect higher-skilled workers to possess computer skills and 38 percent of employers expect similar soft skills from lower-skilled workers. However, calculations based on the Census of Population and Housing show that, of the age 15 and above population, knowledge in English literacy has not reached that level. Hence more resources should be allocated to improve this ability (ability to speak, read and write) and computer literacy.
While Lankan bourgeoisie is looking towards the west for modernization world got shocked when President Trump announced the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. This virtually coincided with the Global Foot print Network (GFN) announcement that Earth Overshoot Day 2017 will fall on August 2.
That means, from January 1 to August 2, the worlds 7.5 billion people will have used as much of Earths biological resourcesor biocapacityas the planet can regenerate in a year. During the remaining five months of 2017, our human consumption will be drawing down Earths reserves of fresh water, fertile soils, forests, and fisheries, and depleting its ability to regenerate these resources as well as sequester excess carbon released into the atmosphere.
In other words, humans are depleting living Earths capacity to support life. With the GFN methodology one can also generate an ecological footprint for individual cities, states, and nations, based on the burden each generates relative to its local biocapacity. It can also compare a personal footprint generated by a distinctive lifestyle to both national and global averages. The U.S. and developed countries claim that they have relatively abundant per capita biocapacity compared to most developing nations. However US are one of the worlds highest per capita consumers. Consequently, the net outcome is a total national biocapacity deficit second only to that of Chinaa country with a population roughly four times that of US. Knowing that, collectively, the world is consuming far more than the planet can sustain, how do we bring ourselves into balance with Earths capacities
According to western authorities there are four critical global priorities, firstly Decarbonisation. Humanitys carbon energy use accounts for 60 percent of the global ecological footprint. By GFNs estimate, Reducing the carbon component of the global Ecological Footprint by 50 percent would get us from consuming the resources of 1.7 Earths down to 1.2 Earths, or move the date of Overshoot Day forward by 89 days, or about three months. Accordingly that would place Overshoot Day on October 30.
Secondly they say population control. We cannot ignore population growth if we are truly committed to people having secure lives in a world of finite resources, noted Susan Burns, GFN co-founder. She urges empowering women and assuring that every child is wanted. This is highly debatable question. In Lanka recently doctor that persuaded this policy was arrested by the police. Racial suspicions can grow over this issue. However by GFNs analysis, reducing the current global average family size by half a child would push back Overshoot D by 31 days.
Gross domestic product
Thirdly they say food production should cover total consumption. By GFNs calculation, sourcing food locally, avoiding highly processed foods, reducing meat consumption, and cutting food waste by half could move Overshoot Day forward by 11 days. This does not challenge the expectations of third world countries. Lastly they say improvement in urban built environments could help the balancing. GFN estimates that increasing the energy efficiency of the urban built environment through measures such as efficient mass transit could advance Overshoot Day by 2 days.
If all four of these priorities are achieved, they say, humans could bring overshoot Day to December 13 and almost be in balance with Earths capacity to sustain all of us. There is considerable truth to the saying that one can manage only what one measures. Measure the wrong thing, and the consequences can be catastrophic. Unfortunately, governments currently invest heavily in reporting financial indicators, such as gross domestic product, that tell the masses little either about actual human well-being or long-term viability on Earth. In measuring the right things, one could say that GFN shatters the illusions of such measures and analyses. Still, one needs a clearer and more complete and coherent reporting and analysis of the global footprint measurements than the GFN offers.
The responsibility for such statistical gathering and reporting should fall, not to small non-profit social organisations, but rather to the United Nations and the statistical services of the worlds national governments. Producing detailed global footprint measurements, reporting, and analysis should be among the top priorities of such official agencies. That will be a far greater contribution to national and global well-being than the grossly misleading economic indicators to which they now devote the bulk of their resources. This situation can arise if the United Nations becomes a properly organised democratic world government.

GMOAs anti-social move
Dengue has reached epidemic proportions, with over 63,000 persons infected this year alone. Over 200 dengue-related deaths have been reported so far. The dengue challenge has been complicated by the emergence of a new strain for which much of the population has no immunity. This is truly a crisis for which immediate solutions have to be found.
One tends to think that the Government doctors would be in the vanguard of efforts against the dengue crisis, treating patients, educating the public and engaging in research on treatment and prevention. Alas, in this country the doctors are far too busy striking work apparently in support of anti-SAITM university students who broke into the health Ministry premises and vandalized buildings and vehicles the previous day. All patients, including dengue patients have been left to their own devices, the only silver lining being that all other health workers from attendants to nurses are working 24/7 to address the crisis.
The doctors action led by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), which is increasingly looking like a political party with a hidden agenda rather than a pure trade union, is wrong on several counts. First, the country is facing a serious health problem vis--vis dengue. Doctors perform an essential service and have to be on duty in hospitals at least during their roster times. Second, the students were wrong to forcibly enter the Health Ministry. University students, or anyone else for that matter, cannot take the law into their hands. The doctors must acknowledge this fact. By taking the side of the students, the doctors have shown their contempt for the laws of the land.
Third, all doctors take the famous Hippocratic Oath whereby they pledge to be in service of patients at all times. Named after Hippocrates, the father of medicine in modern Western culture, the oath binds doctors to various ethical standards and commitments. By shirking their responsibilities in this hour of need, the Government doctors have indeed violated this sacrosanct oath. Fourth, there are no reports to the effect that doctors are not doing channeling or private practice in view of their participation in the doctors strike. This means that only the poor patients get no access to the doctors, whereas the rich can consult them in private hospitals. This is indeed a serious breach of public trust on the part of the doctors.
There are also disturbing reports that the STF personnel who were injured during the melee at the Health Ministry had to be transferred to the Police Hospital as they had not received proper treatment at the National Hospital, Colombo. We cannot comment on whether this was intentional or whether the STF personnel were among the victims of the overall strike, but either way, it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. The Armed Forces, Police and the STF sacrificed life and limb to give us a better tomorrow and this is certainly not the way to treat these heroes.
The average men and women interviewed by TV stations were highly critical of the doctors, who had benefitted from free education funded by the public through taxes. The general consensus that emerged through these viewpoints was that enough is enough. It is time to take stern action against the striking doctors and Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne has indeed promised tough and unprecedented action. Police too have launched an investigation under the direct supervision of Colombo DIG regarding the forcible entry made into the Health Ministry premises on Wednesday.
The Government should perhaps also consider a ban on channeling in the evening for Government doctors who strike work in the morning. If a private university is not good enough, the same logic should apply to private hospitals too. If the present laws are not adequate, new laws should be formulated to prevent strikes by Government doctors at least in an emergency situation.
The question arises as to who is going to pay for the damage caused to the buildings and vehicles at the Health Ministry. Minister Senarathne says the renovation of the damaged property would be undertaken by the Health Ministry through its annual budget. Again, these are funds paid for by the public and should have instead been utilised for the benefit of poor patients. The culprits who led the attack should be identified and punished. We do not know whether it is possible with present laws, but damages should rightly be claimed from the vandals themselves.
It is crystal clear that there is an unseen political hand (or hands) behind the attack on the Health Ministry and the doctors strike, even though only the Peratugamis have been blamed at this point. There are sinister political forces, which had previously been rejected by the public, at work to destabilise the National Unity Government. They will leave no stone unturned to return to their usual style of Governance rife with corruption, nepotism and authoritarianism. It is disheartening to note that even unions such as the GMOA have fallen into this trap. The GMOA must rethink its strategy or face the danger of losing the public trust completely.

Harmer takes 14 wickets to secure win for Essex
LONDON, Thursday - South Africa Test spinner Simon Harmer claimed a career-best 14 wickets in the match as County Championship leaders Essex dealt bottom club Warwickshire a fourth innings defeat of the season.
Resuming on their overnight score of 27-2, the Bears added 20 runs before six wickets went down for 35 before lunch, five of them to Harmer. After a delayed lunch, he took the last two to end with 8-36, also a best. Warwickshire were bowled out for 94 to lose by an innings and 164 runs.
Harmer's 14-128 was Essex's best bowling figures in a match since Mark Ilott took 14-105 against Northamptonshire at Wardown Park, Luton in 1995.
Essex, chasing their first Championship title since 1992, extended their Division One lead to 14 points with their fourth win of the season. And they will be boosted by the addition of Pakistan international Mohammad Amir for their next game - the day-night fixture against champions Middlesex, which starts on Monday.
Durham secured their first Championship win of the season by beating Glamorgan by nine wickets at Chester-Le-Street.
Four wickets from Barry McCarthy helped the hosts dismiss Glamorgan for 263 in their second innings to give Durham a target of 158 to win. Opening batsman Stephen Cook scored an unbeaten 89 from 78 balls to guide them to victory.
It was Durham's first win since the county were relegated from Division One and handed a 48-point penalty by the England and Wales Cricket Board in October 2016.
Joe Clarke hit his second century of the match and Daryl Mitchell also made a hundred as Worcestershire pulled off the third biggest run chase in their history to beat Kent at New Road.
Mitchell made 142, his fourth century in five Championship matches, while Clarke was unbeaten on 110 as the hosts reached 401-6 to win by four wickets.
Kent spinner Yasir Shah (5-132) caused a wobble with four quick wickets. But Ross Whiteley (29) plundered vital late runs to see his side home.
England seamer James Anderson, who took 3-5 on the third evening, finished with figures of 4-20 as the Red Rose skittled Hampshire for 168 on day four.
The visitors had resumed on 50-5, still trailing by 148, and were unable to make Lancashire bat again.
Dane Vilas' 244 had put the home team in control earlier in the match.
Alex Davies and Ryan
McLaren also chipped in with centuries to give Lancashire a big first-innings lead, but it was their impressive bowling display in Hampshire's second innings that ensured victory.
England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson was playing in his first match after a month out through injury, with his country's first Test of the summer against South Africa starting on 6 July.

I dont blame uni. students for politically indecent groups activities: President
President Maithripala Sirisena says some politically indecent groups are trying to show the country that the government is acting to emasculate the free education by depriving the opportunities of the students of the medical faculties in government universities.
They are misleading the university students. I dont blame any university student for the actions of those who conspire to use students as tools. These are done by undisciplined political groups, he said.
The President was speaking at a ceremony held on Thursday (June 22) at the Lankapura Maha Vidyalaya, Polonnaruwa. He said nearly 2,50,000 students sit for AL Exam annually, and 90,000 from them are eligible for university education but university admission is offered only for 25,000 students.
To make the dreams of the rest of the students a reality, state and private universities with higher standard should be established. We cannot limit the educational rights of any child at any time in the country, he said.
The President said nearly 80,000 people are going abroad for higher education annually. He said it is a matter to be worried that the children of low-income families are going abroad for education by finding money through pawning their houses and lands.
The government has taken the policy decision that the private sector university or educational institute should provide education according to the rules recognised by the government, he said.
The President vested the new two storey building of the Vijitha Primary School in Pulathisigama with students.
North-Central Province Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathne, Provincial Minister Sampath Sri Nilantha and the Principal of the school Sarath Hemakumara participated.

Injured Svitolina could miss Wimbledon
Birmingham: World number five Elina Svitolina said she could miss Wimbledon with a heel injury, after slumping to a second-round defeat by qualifier Camila Giorgi in Birmingham on Thursday.
The 22-year-old Ukrainian was clearly struggling as she slid to a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 loss to a player ranked outside the top 100 at the Wimbledon warm-up event.
Afterwards she suggested she would consider pulling out of the third Grand Slam tournament of the year, which starts on July 3.
"There is a question about it," she admitted. "I will talk with my physios. The season is very long and I must look at the bigger picture.
"The heel feels painful and is very sensitive. I am disappointed I am out of the tournament but I am not disappointed with my performance, because I could not show even 50 percent.
"Also the court was slippery which is bad for the foot."
The lush grass in the English midlands is utterly different to the clay on which Svitolina won the Italian Open and reached the French Open quarter-finals, where she missed a match point against eventual runner-up Simona Halep.
Combined with a sudden change from Wednesday's fierce heat to drizzle and damp, it became hard for the stricken Svitolina to cope.
Giorgi adapted to the slick surface very well, hitting some raging forehand drives, finding some good angles, and occasionally coming to the net effectively.
The Italian played close to the standard that two years ago took her to 30 in the world.
With Dominika
Cibulkova having already lost in the first round, the two leading seeds have both departed early, following belated withdrawals from four other top-10 players.
Giorgi will have a quarter-final against another surprise survivor, Ashleigh Barty, a 21-year-old Australian making her first appearance in the main draw.
Later Thursday, fourth seed Johanna Konta, the highest-ranked British player for more than 20 years, was overwhelmed 6-1, 6-3 by Coco Vandeweghe, the tall American who reached the top 20 for the first time this year, and whose powerful game is ideally suited to grass. AFP

Kingston: When Usain Bolt hangs up his running spikes after the World Championships in August, the athletics world will bid farewell to arguably the greatest sprinter the sport has ever seen.
But while athletics contemplates life without its biggest superstar, Anthony Davis will already be working hard to unearth the next young Jamaican sprinter capable of following in Bolt's blisteringly fast footsteps.
Davis is the director of sport at Kingston's University of Technology, or UTech, the de facto sprint factory which produced Bolt and virtually every other major Jamaican sprinter of significance.
The modest facility's alumni reads like a who's who of Jamaican sprinting, including Bolt, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Asafa Powell, Nesta Carter and Elaine Thompson, the 100m & 200m 2016 Olympic champion.
"Everybody wants to be the next Usain Bolt because he is a superstar," Davis told AFP.
Jamaica is considered the sprint capital of the world following a decade of dominance at successive Olympics and World Championships, a success which belies the Caribbean nation's population of just 2.7 million.
Sprinter Tyquendo Tracey attributes Jamaica's success to national character.
"Most of us are born with sheer determination. It is hard to beat a Jamaican," Tracey said.
"The determination comes from the high level of competition including high school. We always have this level of competitiveness."
In fact Jamaica's success can be traced back several decades, from the moment that Herb McKenley won gold and three silver at the 1948 London and 1952 Helsinki Olympics.
McKenley served as coach
of the Jamaican national team from 1954 to 1973 and was awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 2004, three years before his death.
However it was through the work of Dennis Johnson that the seeds of Jamaica's sprinting dynasty were sown.
Johnson, who equalled the 100-yard world record three times over a six-week stretch in 1961, had been schooled in the fundamentals by legendary US coach Bud Winter at San Jose State in California.
Upon his return to Jamaica, Johnson set out to create a US-style collegiate programme in his homeland, helping found the University of Technology in Kingston.
It was a historic move that would earn him the title the Godfather of Jamaican track.
"We have tried to import the NCAA model to Jamaica," said Davis who was hired in 1971 by Johnson.
"Before Dennis, the students would play all different sports because it was primarily recreational.
"Now the athletes focus on specific sports and he designed a programme that would last for 10-11 months per year."
The programme's breakthrough came at the 1975 Pan-American Games in Mexico as Jamaica won one silver and three bronze.
Davis said in the past Jamaican athletes heading directly to US colleges from high school would often struggle to adjust to life in America.
"You leave high school where you are instructed to do everything and you have to become an adult overnight," he said.
"Some athletes would arrive in the US and find out they are only receiving a half scholarship that doesn't cover the cost of books and accommodation. AFP

JHU condemns Udaya Gammanpilas behaviour
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) condemned the behaviour of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader, Parliamentarian, Udaya Gammanpila who insulted the JHU Leader, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU Office in Battaramulla, JHU National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Gammanpila insulted JHU Leader Patali Champika Ranawaka by calling him different names and even criticised his parents for giving his name.
The reason for insulting and immoral behaviour of Gammanpila is questionable, as he is a person with a good family background.
His father was a Principal and the mother was a teacher, Warnasinghe said.
He said Gammanpila is a person who betrayed his party and enjoyed benefits.
Presenting audio evidence in which former MP Sajin Vas Gunawardane mentions about a secret meeting he had with Gammanpila, JHU Deputy General Secretary Anuruddha Pradeep said Gammanpila stopped criticising former MP Sajin Vas after releasing the audio evidence. It proved the hidden agendas of Gammanpila, he said.

The Joint Opposition yesterday urged Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha in a written request, to take speedy measures to hold the Local Government Elections as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, the JO along with several ex-local government councilors launched a protest in front of the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry urging the Minister for immediate conduct of the LG election.
The protesters, who were supported by several JO members including Parliamentarians Gamini Lukuge, Prasanna Ranathunga, Rohitha Abeygunawardana and Ranjith Zoysa claimed that the Government is afraid of conducting the LG election since the Government is suffering from election phobia. When the protesters made a huge cry for the LG election, ten persons was allowed to enter the Ministry for discussions with Minister Musthapha.
MP Gamini Lokuge told the media that Minister Musthapha was requested to present the Local Government Act to Parliament as an urgent Act. Besides, the Government has also been requested to forward their amendments to the Act if there are any amendments.
Responding to the JO representation, the Minister said that he is also against reducing the total LG seats by 50 per cent.
The Minister has pointed out that the Elections Commissioner has requested 55 days for conducting the LG election after the Act is passed in Parliament.
Lokuge added that the JO is ready to render their fullest support in this regard since the Minister said that the LG election will probably be held in coming September.
Addressing media Lokuge said that they will come back to the Ministry in another 55 days.
At that day we wont go back unless the Government holds the election he noted.

Lankas economy improving:CB Governor Stronger Macroeconomic fundamentals :
The Sri Lankan economy is improving and its fundamentals have got better, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said yesterday.
The Central Bank Governor said the country recorded a 3.8 percent growth in GDP during the first quarter of 2017.
Given the severity of the droughts followed by the floods, the Governor expected to end the year with a 4.5-5 percent growth in the economy.
Addressing a media briefing on the monetary policy review at the Central Bank, Dr. Coomaraswamy further explained that the Macroeconomic fundamentals was becoming stronger, the government fiscal consolidation programme was on track up to now, though the floods will have to be accommodated, the exchange rate was gradually becoming more competitive and foreign reserves had increased to over USD 7 billion by mid-June, the Central Bank Governor sdid. By end of the year it is expected to increase to USD 7.2 billion,he said.
We cant be satisfied with the reserves, they are largely borrowed reserves and we must earn reserves but that will take time,he said.
The Governor added, We feel that the current monetary policy stance will bring in inflation within our target range.
Inflation is projected to be moderate to mid-single digits by the end of 2017 and stabilize thereafter, Dr.Coomaraswamy said.
He hoped that exports would pick up with the GSP Plus concessions being granted and explained that for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2007, all major economies were seeing synchronized expansion and positive growth.
With the US and Europe being our key markets, it will give some tail wind to our exports, Dr.Coomaraswamy said.
Growth this year has been led by industry activities which grew at 6.3 percent with construction at 16.1 percent and textiles and apparel at 0.6 percent. The services sector had moderate growth at 3.5 percent; with the highest being in the financial services activities at 14.9 percent. Agriculture on the other hand recorded a contraction of 3.2 percent with greatest in rice at -53.1 percent.
The trade deficit in the meantime continues to grow; with it increasing by 11.9 percent in April 2017 (y-o-y) to USD 795 million. Import expenditure had increased by 9.8 percent to USD 1,604 million. This was a 13.7 percent increase in imports (y-o-y) with a large majority being spent on fuel imports for electricity generation, given the drought. Rs 1.2 billion was spent this year on fuel; a 76 percent increase from last year.
Worker remittances in the meantime, has declined by 6.3 percent this year and the Central Bank noted that if the recent diplomatic fallout with Qatar continued, it could have a serious impact on remittance numbers,
At present, there is no significant slowdown in the Qatar economy. They have massive reserves to cushion them for some time and it all depends on the intensity of the crisis and how long it will continue.Hopefully, there will be some resolution.
Remittances have come down overall, it is mainly due to a reduction in housemaid numbers which is partly policy induced as the government introduced conditions for female migrants. There has also been an impact due to the overall slowdown in economic activity in the Middle East due to subdued oil prices, the Governor said.
The Governor however stressed that they were concerned with the growth rate.
In the past we artificially pumped it up or we reduced interest rates or both and then two years later, we have high inflation and a balance of payment crisis. But this time we are trying to maintain discipline; to keep fiscal consolidation on track, monetary policy forward looking and make sure we are sticking to our inflation target, the Central Bank Governor added.
He stressed that the next step would be to Take advantage of a better foundation to improve the investment climate, get into trade agreements and implement government development programmes efficiently so that you get good quality growth which can be sustained for 3-4 years and not relax policy to create a sugar high in terms of growth.

New Zealand honours its favourite son
TE KUITI, New Zealand -- The signs started popping up about three kilometres outside Te Kuiti. Sir Colin Meads is in town...now! Take a break, read the first. Then came the more succinct Welcome to Meadsville.
Rora Street, which runs through the heart of Te Kuiti -- a small town an hours drive south of Hamilton in the heart of King Country -- was shut. The high street was a hubbub of activity; police stood at the top of the street, camera crews were taking their positions, chairs were laid out for rugby royalty and a looming object stood covered by a black tarpaulin.
Attached to each shop on the road were temporary wooden placards replacing the painted or metal-plated signs for the shops or businesses, each referring to their most famous resident. Pie-ne Trees Place, Meadsville Scourers, Eyes on Meadsville, Meads Peas in a pod, Mead-acine were just some of the temporary signs. Even the toilets had one: Meadsville comfort stop.
This was a festival, a celebration of arguably the greatest All Black of the lot, Sir Colin Pinetree Meads, as the town and his old teammates prepared to unveil the 2.4m statue of the man voted New Zealands player of the century.
Photographs of Sir Colin from his playing days were in the shop windows, with the silver fern standing stark against the black jersey and in the towns i-Site was the most remarkable of tributes to Sir Colin and his brother Stan.
The museum had been lovingly assembled by Sir Colins daughter-in-law Jo, who is married to his son Glynn. It painted the picture of a man who is a husband, father, son, farmer, humanitarian, ambassador and rugby immortal.
The story of his rugby life was captured across the walls; rugby shirts and blazers from both Stan and Sir Colins careers sat behind glass, each showing a history of wear -- the blazers were lucky to survive as Sir Colins wife Verna used to cut the badges off some of them and donate them to the local charity shop.
British & Irish Lions captain Willie John McBrides jersey was also there, but the newspaper clippings on the wall painted a remarkable portrait of his playing days, while giving insight into his other life as a farmer.
One section was dominated by reaction to the broken arm he suffered while playing Eastern Transvaal back in 1970. A headline screamed Meads breaks arm but plays on, with another following Doctors tell Meads: Rip off plaster and play.
Then there was an exhibit focusing on farming, with one introduction painting a delightful picture of the man: Colin Meads, in dungarees and a tartan shirt, excused himself as we shook hands in the kitchen of his King-Country farm-house. He explained that he had been crutching sheep in the wool-shed -- his hands were not as clean as he would like.
The two halves of his life came together in one small item in the corner of the room. His All Blacks kitbag was sat by the shirts, but Jo told us how they had to ferociously scrub it to make it presentable as it had doubled up on the farm as a place to store equipment needed for lamb docking.
What was most touching, though, were the accounts of his charity work and the family aspect to the exhibition. There were letters from his children to him when he was overseas touring with the All Blacks, one dated from Jan. 12, 1968, telling him: I am knitting a dolls cardigan and Mummy washed her hair today. Then there was a poster listing New Zealands 1963 tour fixtures, with results filled out by Verna and Colin written next to the games he played in. It was all deeply touching.
As the crowd assembled outside, and some of the greats of New Zealand rugby took their seats, there was suddenly spontaneous applause as Pinetree arrived alongside Verna.
They moved slowly to the front by the statue, the eyes of the crowd following their every move in awe, respect and affection. He sat next to his brother, Stan.
Its great to see the two blokes locking again, said Keith Quinn, the legendary New Zealand commentator.
The extended Meads family were there; he has five children and 14 grandchildren. Tributes were paid to the great man. Maurice Trapp, the NZR president, said he represents the true values of New Zealand rugby and New Zealand -- strength, passion and competitiveness. He followed up by wondering whether sculptor Natalia Stamilla had been able to build a heart bigger than the man.
Sir Brian Lochore, his teammate and friend, paid tribute to Pinetree, by saying What he has done for Te Kuiti is amazing, but what he has done for New Zealand is unsurpassable. He followed it up with an anecdote about how on one trip to France, he and Sir Colin were befuddled by the bidet in their bathroom, and thought it was a foot wash.
John Spencer, 1971 Lion and current tour manager, passed on tributes from Gareth Edwards, John Dawes, Barry John, Willie John McBride, JPR Williams and Bill Beaumont while hailing him as a legend and warrior. All the while Sid Going, Bryan Williams, Earle Kirton, Tane Norton and Bill Bush sat, applauded and reminisced.
And then it was Pinetrees turn. With the help of his brother Stan, who described his older sibling as a bloody good bugger, they hauled the cover off the statue and after photographs were taken, it was Sir Colins turn.
There were doubts just a day before if he would be fit enough to attend, as he continues to battle cancer. But as he spoke, quietly, the whole crowd hung with his every word. Im sorry Im not as fit as I used to be, he opened with.
When the statue was originally suggested, he had his doubts. He is a humble giant, the limelight was thrust upon him rather than asked for, but he was taken aback by the adulation and fondness from those around him.
Theres nothing much one can say on an occasion like this, he said. But he was fond of his mirror image in bronze form. Well, its amazing how much detail shes gone into to get it because, I was just saying, even me bootlaces are done up how I used to lace them up too.
We had already heard how he usually turned down champagne for beer, but his intake has curbed with the illness. I wont be able to have many beers afterwards, but Ill try to have a few.
His body may be a little weaker than it used to be, but the aura remains. It was a day where the beating heart of New Zealand rugby moved to the small town of Te Kuiti to acknowledge and pay tribute to their greatest warrior.
Husband, father, son, rugby player, farmer, captain or idol, he is the man who has given so much to New Zealand. He will now forever stand, a giant of man, on the high street of the place they call Meadsville.

Present fielding coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team Nic Pothas is expected to take over as the interim head coach following Graham Fords departure from the country at the end of the ICC Champions Trophy.
It is learnt that Ford had sent a letter stating he has issues with newly-appointed Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha and has had a lengthy discussion with SLCs top brass before he left the country.
Earlier, SLC sources had stated that Ford was off for a short vacation, but it has later turned out to be that he has more or less gone for good.
Sri Lanka has hit a new low at the moment being eighth ranked in ODIs and facing the danger of losing automatic qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.
Sri Lanka are currently preparing to take on Zimbabwe in a five-match ODI series followed by a one-off Test.

Pakistan, Lanka against terror, hegemony
Pakistan's Interior Affairs Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Thursday, said that stronger Pakistan-Sri Lankan partnership was key to promoting greater cooperation in the region and strengthening regional platforms.
During a meeting with former Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his delegation, he said that the Pak-Lankan partnership was also a bulwark against the challenges facing the region including terrorism and poverty besides warding off any self-assumed notion of hegemony.
Former Foreign Minister Gamini Lakshman Peris, Dullas Dhaham Kumara Alahapperuma, Wimal Weerawansa, Lokubandara Udith Sanjaya and Yoshitha Kanishka Rajapaksa were part of the Lankan delegation.
Welcoming the delegation, Nisar remarked that Mahinda Rajapaksa was known to Pakistani people as one of their true friends.
During his tenure, the former Lankan president not just added great strength to the bilateral relations but was also instrumental in diversifying this equation in all possible areas of mutual cooperation, he said. Expressing satisfaction over the steady and upward trajectory of economic, political, socio-cultural and defence cooperation, he observed the relations spanning over six decades were characterised by sincerity, friendship, mutual respect, understanding and cooperation.
The minister said that Pakistan and Sri Lanka faced challenges of similar nature and the strategic friendship between the two countries was critical not only to ward off hegemonic intentions in the region but also to fight the mutual challenges and issues. If poverty, natural calamities and socio-economic conditions pose challenges to our ordinary people, the issues of terrorism, volatile regional peace and instability threaten us at the state level, thus impeding our march towards progress and securing brighter and secure future for our people, he added.
The Interior Minister said that the tenure of former president had provided the two countries with a solid base to further build on gains of the past and broaden the scope of the existing relations by exploring new avenues of cooperation especially in the areas of economy, security, border management, capacity building of law enforcement agencies, fighting illicit drug trade and human trafficking.
The two leaders also discussed the regional situation. There was unanimity of views that Pakistan-Sri Lankan relations and bilateral cooperation need to be further strengthened. Rajapaksa thanked the Interior Minister and the government for the warm welcome that was extended to him and his delegation during his visit.

Pakistan youngsters showed they are world class
What a time for Mohammad Amir to produce one of the great opening spells in the history of one-day cricket. Seven years on from that day at Lords, what a story.
To remove three of the tournaments in-form batsmen  Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan  in the blink of an eye was special in its own right.
To do so after being given a second chance by the sport adds the kind of twist to the narrative that Pakistan cricket seems to specialise in.
I still remember that Lords Test in August 2010, when it emerged that Amir had deliberately bowled no-balls in a betting spot-fixing scandal, and especially the reaction of Michael Holding. Two of the subjects that stir Mikeys emotions the most are young fast bowlers and corruption, and that day they collided in the worst fashion imaginable.
It is why, when word spread that something was amiss, I said: Please dont let it be the young lad.
So to see him bowl beautifully, once more on the world stage, against Pakistans biggest rivals and some of the best batsmen in the world... I take my hat off to him.
Since he returned to international cricket, he has had catches dropped off his bowling, and he must have thought Here we go again when Azhar Ali at slip put down Kohli.
But Amirs great talent is creating chances, partly because of the left-arm angle. Kohlis very good at moving across his stumps when he faces right-arm bowlers and working to leg. He tried the same here  but was done by the angle and got a leading edge to backward point.
Those two balls summed up Pakistan cricket in all its incompetence and brilliance. You just cant take your eyes off these blokes for one minute.
The guy who took the catch was Shadab Khan, an 18-year-old who typifies the faith Pakistan have placed in youth.They have gone for lads who bring a buzz to their side, and it has worked a treat ever since they were brushed aside by India in their opening group match.
Look at the way Fakhar Zaman has come in for Ahmed Shehzad and batted with the freedom that Pakistan were missing in that game.
They have always had the bowlers to trouble the opposition, but Fakhars flair gives them the basis of a strong batting unit too. Hasan Ali has also been a revelation. When you have got him coming on after the two left-armers, Amir and Junaid Khan, plus the leg-spinner Shadab, you have a serious bowling line-up.
I hope this result puts into perspective some of the rubbish that was spoken after Pakistan beat England in the semi-final. It was disrespectful to suggest that result had anything to do with the pitch.
The fact that Ben Stokes failed to hit a boundary in 64 balls showed how fine Pakistans bowling was. This game was a glorious reminder.  Daily Mail

SAITM would be brought under a Management Committee and would be introduced to the Share Market, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He assured that SAITM education would be standardized and made available to students to continue with their education. He added that Dr Neville Fernando could only remain as the Chairman. The SAITM would be managed under a board of professionals which would have financial control. He also said that admissions to the SAITM had been halted temporarily.
The Minister also assured that the Unity Government would not do anything that would affect free education, including medical education. He added that the government would guarantee education to all.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday in response to the Adjournment Motion moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. "Under this unity government, not only free education is guaranteed, but free health as well," Minister Rajitha Senaratne said. "Under this government in which the UNP is a co party, limits to treatment in public hospitals have been lifted unlike during other previous governments in line with their pledges.
"He also said that socialism is commendable, but should be tolerable in the country. He added that socialism should be modernized in such a manner as that of Latin American Socialism.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne also said that there was no standard even to medical faculties of government universities.
"It was me who took measures to draft a standard to the medical education in the country," Minister Senaratne said. "I received it two days ago from the Sri Lanka Medical Council and I asked them to hand over a copy to the Legal Draftsman's Department as well."
He also said that when the standard of medical faculties are concerned, the standard and facilities of some government medical faculties are far below than that of SAITM. He admitted that there were less patients at the SAITM hospital though it has commendable facilities. "It should be the government's responsibility to grant a hospital to them," Minister Senaratne said.
He said this government would take measures to strengthen free education. "By 2018, all university students would be given hostel facilities," Minister Senaratne said. "Kuliyapitiya and Sabaragamuwa hospitals would also be given medical faculties. The intake of the Karapitiya Medical Faculty would be increased fro, 150 to 300. The Moratuwa Medical Faculty too has requested for a medical faculty," he said.
He added that the first Batch of the North Colombo Medical Faculty in Ragama has produced 13 leading professors of medicine.
"So we cannot belittle the abilities of students of private medical faculties," Minister Senaratne said. "The KDU Medical Faculty had nothing when it was granted approval. Within 45 minutes, approval was given. It had only two chapters. It was given due to the intervention of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa."
He added that the Medical Faculty in Chittagong, Bangladesh, where our students study medicine has minimal standards. "Its a pathetic situation," said Minister Senaratne.
"We have made health service available free for patients. Cancer Hospital patients are given free medicine unlike before. Free drugs were provided for less than Rs 1.5 million. Stents and the eye lenses are provided free to patients."
He also warned the JVP not to stop talking of taking clubs and poles into their hands against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine as such action would pave way for Frontline Socialist Party members to take T56 rifles into their hands.
AITM will be taken over and converted into a dengue hospital: Minister Kiriella
The Government would take over SAITM and convert it into a Dengue Hospital, said Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He said that whatever the Joint Opposition says, the government would not take over the SAITM. He also thanked MP Dinesh Gunawardena for moving the gazette during the previous regime to set up the SAITM.
"It was set up during the last regime as an institution which conducts courses for MBBS," Minister Kiriella said. "The Mahinda Rajapaksa Government granted a loan of Rs 600 million. But now MP Gunawardena is speaking against the same. However we thank Dinesh Gunawardena for setting up the SAITM." He made these observations in response to the Adjournment Motion moved Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Minister Kiriella said the Supreme Court case was to be taken up on Thursday. The students protested and the GMOA staged the strike to influence the Court and the Court order. "But this will have a boom-rang effect on those who protested and staged the strike," Minister Kiriella said.
He also stated that Dinesh Gunawardena said that student representatives went to the Health Ministry for discussions. "But there were around 1,000 students with iron poles in hand," Minister Kiriella said. "We saw it on television.
They destroyed the iron gates. Students cannot decide the education policy of the country. It is decided by the government. The Last government took a policy decision to set up SAITM. It was Dinesh Gunawardena who presented the gazette of SAITM on December 11, 2013. We appreciate it and thank Dinesh Gunawardena for it."
Minister Kiriella said that a secret vote was taken in two medical faculties last week, while 99 percent of the medical students voted for following lectures. "Then who does them" questioned Minister Kiriella. "The Sri Lanka Medical Council only takes decisions on medical studies. The GMOA is a trade Union."
Minister Kiriella also said that the doctors' strike was a failure. "The people would provide their answer to the doctors in a few days if the strike continued," Minister Kiriella said. "Some people have answered to some doctors in Chilaw. This would happen everywhere in the country."
He added that the government would takeover the SAITM hospital and convert it into a Dengu Hospital.
He also said that whatever the Joint Opposition says, the government would not take over SAITM. He made this statement while Sriyani Wijewickrama was speaking joining the debate.

SAITM issue: Government's Battle of Waterloo near at hand:Handunnetti
The day the country's youth take to the streets with iron bars would not be far if the Government does not shut down the SAITM in Malabe, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said in Parliament yesterday.
The MP speaking at the Adjournment Debate said the JVP would give leadership to a broader alliance comprised of different political parties and professional unions against SAITM. He predicted that those in the Government too who hold dissenting views would also join with this coalition against the SAITM.
We vow to take this struggle forward until the Government shuts down the SAITM. If the Government hesitates to do so, it will be sent home. The Battle of Waterloo marked the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte despite many of his successful campaigns prior to that. Likewise, the SAITM struggle would mark the end of this Government. Now this is a battle being fought on the streets, he warned.
IUSF Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara has been arrested. He was demonstrating unarmed, but the day the protestors bear iron bars and clubs would also not be far, he stressed.
The MP said the internal differences of the Government would reach a climax with the SAITM issue. Not all in the Government hold the same position with regard to SAITM. There are a considerable number of Ministers and MPs holding different views. However, a few in the Government, who take arbitrary decisions, try to control everything. It is the Government that pushes the doctors to strike, he added.
JO warns impending recurrence of 1988-89 riots if students are further suppressed
Joint Opposition members yesterday, warned of a recurrence of the 1988-89 riots in the country if the Government continued to suppress the student community by using force.
Joint Opposition members who took part in the Adjournment Debate in Parliament yesterday on the SAITM issue, expressed their displeasure over the Governments reaction to the students protests last Wednesday and the subsequent strike by the doctors.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena moving the Adjournment Motion urged the Government to engage with the doctors and students without suppressing them by force.
As a result of the clash between the Police and the students, over 88 students were injured. The Medical Faculties are not functioning for over 6 months as over 8,000 medical students have been boycotting classes. The quality of medical education is important than the business of one or two individuals. You cannot allow SAITM to produce half-baked doctors. I ask the Government to be fair, he said.
He also shirked the responsibility for the Gazette he presented to Parliament as the Chief Government Whip of the previous Government to confer the degree awarding status to the SAITM.
The Gazette was signed by then Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake. As the Chief Government Whip, I presented many documents to the House. It was Minister Dissanayake who messed up all these, he said.
MP Gunawardena also stressed that the Neville Fernando hospital had not been recognized or registered as a teaching hospital, adding that a medical college could not operate without a teaching hospital.
The MP also brought the attention of the House to a letter sent by Higher Education Ministry Secretary to SAITM Chairman last month over an appeal submitted by the Parents' Association of the fourth batch of SAITM students regarding an attempt of conducting an invalid MBBS examination by SAITM for the fourth batch.
JO MPs Dr Ramesh Pathirana and Jayantha Samaraweera taking part in the debate warned of an impending dark era similar to that of 1988-89 due to creating students unrest in the country.

## Title: Politics is infected with Dengue and Garbage
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Politics is infected with Dengue and Garbage
The whirligig of politics has brought to the fore two matters of health and social management that poses many threats both to governance and the lives of people. A country and people that defeated the major threat of terrorism is today faced with the dual threats of dengue and garbage, moving away from the rivalry of party politics to the major issue of competent and capable governance.
The disastrous floods in the past month certainly contributed to the wider spread of dengue, which problem is made worse by the new strain of the dengue mosquito Aedes aegypti and its new breeding grounds. The situation is more serious with the overall failure of successive governments to come up with effective waste management, and the contribution that uncleared waste and a dirty environment makes to the further spread of dengue. The situation is such that facing up to the threat that society is faced by dengue and poor garbage disposal has emerged as the major political issue before the government, accepting the situation as a major threat to social organisation, in fact displaying the nature of a war waged by the weapons of deadly infection and environmental pollution.
The government shows signs it is moving fast to face the new and wider threat of dengue. The relief given to people by the reduction of the cost of blood tests is most welcome. But it has to face the larger issue of overcrowding in both government and private hospitals. It will have to look at expanding facilities to handle dengue patients in state hospitals, looking at it as an emergency move, seeing whether there are any unused areas in state hospitals that can be converted for dengue treatment. The Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila, which is faced with a vast number of dengue patients, (I am personally aware of the fight the medical and nursing staff there carry out with limited facilities) could possibly benefit if a newly constructed wing that is unoccupied for some time, possibly for another purpose, is swiftly converted for the treatment of dengue. There may be other places too, where necessary and speedy changes could help combat the rising tide of dengue.
Image of politicians
The fight against dengue is an opportunity for politicians, especially in government, with some commitment of service to the people, to break the image of politicians being those who exploit and live upon the people, to show a difference in service to seriously fight this major health hazard. There is much that genuine politicians could do to bring about good public awareness of the fight against dengue, by community participation in anti-dengue activity that is not any media hype. This opportunity is also available to politicians in the opposition. It would be good for the politicians of today to look back at how the politicians of the past, even before the country gained independence, fought against the British rulers and also made major contributions to the fight against malaria.
The government will of course have to face the constant criticism that the blame for the current situation on dengue and garbage is due to the continued delay in holding the Local Government elections. However much that is denied, and with whatever evidence to suit the governments position, the public certainly has the impression that the absence of functioning local authorities are part of, if not entirely, the cause of these problems today. As the fight against dengue takes a more serious strand, it would be best if the government takes steps to hold the Local Government polls, and not make any further excuse for its delay. Whatever the political outcome of the LG Polls, it will produce local politicians who will have to be active in carrying on the fight against both dengue and garbage, whatever their political colours may be.
As the Ministry of Health takes many measures to bring better life and meaning to the fight against dengue, it gained a major publicity advantage against the GMOA and the Inter University Students (that crawls behind the GMOA) in the clash between the students who broke into the Ministry of Health, against Court orders, as well as against the normal laws of trespass, with the Police, that saw both students and police injured. The sudden one-day token strike by the GMOA, the very next day in protest at the police action against the students, made a huge mockery of the GMOAs claims of service to the people. That token strike took place when most state hospitals are teeming with dengue patients; and the death toll from dengue is rising.
This certainly gave President Sirisena the opportunity to make a statement in support of private sector or public-private participation in the training of doctors, and not leave it as a monopoly of the state universities, which unquestionably helps richer students who are able to go abroad for medical education and training, with no GMOA or Inter University Students protesting. The Presidents statement was timely, even though delayed in the context of the long drawn out SAITM issue.
Politics of garbage
While Health is on what could be the verge of a national emergency due to the spread of dengue, garbage is creating much more than mere ripples of politics. The garbage dumps in the cities may be cleared with special action initiated by the Prime Minister or any other political authority, but the larger issue of provincial and local government inaction or failure in action, remains a reality, with the results extending to the Central Government.
There is little purpose in trying to use the garbage issue to gain political advantage by blaming the previous government for inaction. The reality is that two or more of the previous governments and the present government too, have been wholly inactive, and wrongly functional in handling this matter, or often evading action in what is certainly no easy task. An observer of the recent Grenfell Tower fire disaster in London, UK referred to it as corporate manslaughter. It would not be wrong for the Meethotamulla disaster to be described as governance manslaughter - by central, provincial and local authorities. It is difficult for those who try to pass the blame to the previous government, to get themselves a clean sheet on this, because most of those who try to pass such blame were holding ministerial positions in that government.
Statements by the Colombo Municipal Council that it had only 50 garbage trucks and those also old, and not having enough staff for garbage clearing and handling, is hardly the stuff the public needs to hear as the garbage issue gets worse each day.
There is a clear demand for very clear and firm political action on a commitment to enable this country handle its garbage in the most modern and scientific way available, with the maximum use of local resources and any foreign assistance to carry out the work.
The cartoon in The Island (22nd) titled People ready to segregate garbage had an impactful drawing of people ready to remove the segregated political garbage from the Parliament. That reflects the public feeling on the garbage issue, especially when local authorities and ministers state that the best way to get rid of garbage is to segregate it. If so, why not give the public the means to segregate their domestic garbage Is it so very difficult, especially for politicians and senior bureaucrats who spend so much time abroad to see how garbage is segregated and removed in all the western capitals of this world
As the garbage issue gets more closely involved with the spread of dengue, the politicians and government too will certainly have to be ready to provide the best answers to the issue of garbage handling  with the proper scientific approach on the subject and the necessary environmental protection. Going back to 40 year proposals by foreigners may be interesting, but why not look at the more modern approaches that deal with the current situations
Unless an effective political leap is done over the rising garbage issue, governance will be trapped in the continuing muck of a garbage crisis.
Northern calm
Calm has been restored in the politics of the North. The motion of No Confidence against Chief Minister Wigneswaran has been removed, and some understanding has been reached between the TNA and Sampanthan and Chief Minister Wigneswaran.
The situation that arose after the Chief Minister decided to take disciplinary action against four ministers who had allegations of corruption and fraud against them, has moved away from crisis, but the situation gives a new indication of the politics in the North. It is now clear that the public in the North is prepared to move into mass action on issues of politics and provincial governance, of course involving key personalities, as in this case. One hopes that this readiness to act will also be seen on matters of development and social progress in the North, where much is still needed to be done.

Privatisation of Railways an option, warns govt.
The government will have to consider an alternative solution to improve the railway service if strikes continue causing an inconvenience to train passengers, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The railway service will lose if people start using other alternative transport modes due to the continuous railway strikes. Hence, we have to find solutions to make the institution profitable.
Since the Railway Department incurs a whopping loss amounting to Rs. 7,000 million, we will be compelled to opt for privatisation as an alternative measure. Therefore, it is our responsibility to prevent that from happening. We would also not hesitate to import driver-less trains which already have been developed in many countries.
Since we are ready to listen to the grievances of the Trade Unions, they must also be flexible without always resorting to strikes. It is our duty to improve rail transport which renders a great service to the public.
The Minister was speaking at a ceremony celebrating the 94th Anniversary of the Sri Lanka Railways Station Masters Union and the 78th Annual Conference held in Colombo yesterday.
He said plans are afoot to develop the quality of train service in order to provide a better service to passengers. The Kelani Valley railway track will be rehabilitated and converted to a dual line to provide an efficient service to the people. Unauthorized construction along the railway lines is the main obstacle delaying the development of railway lines. Therefore, an estimated Rs.10 billion has been allocated for the provision of alternative houses for these residents.
Even though, railway station masters wear clean, white suits, most of the railway stations across the country have poor cleanliness. We have been striving for many years to achieve complete sanitation of railway stations.
Open defecation through railways, unclean toilets, clogged basins, litter in bogeys and along tracks are the cause for complains by train passengers. It is the main responsibility of station masters to keep their stations clean by improving the sanitary facilities and safety of passengers.

Sanchez makes history as Chile draw with Germany
Kazan: Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez became Chile's all-time top-scorer with his 38th international goal in Thursday's 1-1 draw with Germany at the Confederations Cup.
The Gunners' star, the man of the match, wrote himself into the record books by capitalising on an early mistake in the German defence.
"I'm very happy to be Chile's top-scorer now, our dream is to win this tournament and we feel we have a chance," said Sanchez, who refused to be drawn about his Arsenal future.
"We played well in the first half, but Germany adapted very well to how we were playing.
"Now we need to rest up for Sunday's next game."
Lars Stindl netted his second goal of the tournament to equalise for the world champions just before the break.
"We knew they would come at us with a lot of pressure and power," said goal-scorer Stindl.
"But the result is not undeserved. We now know we can stand up well against great opponents." The result leaves South American champions Chile top of Group B on goal difference from World Cup winners Germany.
With both teams on four points, three ahead of Australia and Cameroon who drew 1-1 earlier, they are in pole position to reach next week's semi-finals.
Germany play Cameroon on Sunday in Sochi while Chile face the Socceroos in Moscow.
Despite leaving all his World Cup-winning stars at home, Germany's head coach Joachim Loew still managed to name four of his first-choice team.
He started with wing-backs Jonas Hector and Joshua Kimmich with Liverpool's Emre Can and Paris St-Germain's Julian Draxler, who all impressed in Monday's 3-2 win over Australia.
"Overall, I am very happy," said Loew.
"It was a very high level match, and a tactical challenge for a young team like ours."
Chile boss Juan Antonio Pizzi started with an experienced side, including nine of the team which beat Argentina on penalties in the 2016 Copa America final.
"It was a very high-level game with two teams playing very aggressively going forward, which was very attractive for the fans," said Pizzi.
"Both teams are very ambitious, so sometimes they neutralise each other.
"The result reflects the high level on the pitch."
After their opening 2-0 win over Cameroon, Chile took the lead with just six minutes gone. There was nothing on when goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen harmlessly rolled the ball out towards Joshua Kimmich.
However, Kimmich's
Bayern Munich team-mate Arturo Vidal reacted fastest, deflected the ball into Sanchez's path and the striker fired home off the inside of the post.
"Unfortunately we went behind after a bad pass, that kind of mistake is punished, but the team's reaction was very good," said Loew.
"As the match went on, we got forward with more and more boldness."
Despite Loew's positive appraisal, Chile could have been 2-0 when Eduardo Vargas rattled the crossbar on 20 minutes with Barcelona goalkeeper Ter Stegen beaten. AFP

Schoolchildren affected by dengue increase by 20%
The Health Ministry yesterday said that there is a significant 20% rise in schoolchildren infected by the current dengue epidemic.
The Health Ministry requests all parents of schoolchildren to apply mosquito repellants on the skin of their children before sending them to the school or tuition classes. The Health Ministry said that the surge in the increase of schoolchildren infected by dengue is due to the dengue mosquitoes being active from 6.00 am and 9.00 am during the day.
A school cleaning programme has already been initiated from 11.00 am to 12.00 noon every day by the education Ministry and the Health Ministry.

Sri Lankan baby elephant gets international attention
The elephant donated to South Korea by the Sri Lankan government in 2010 got quite a fright when her baby fell into a pool at the Grand Park Zoo in Seoul, South Korea.
The footage recorded by the zoo shows the curious one-year-old elephant  christened Korilanka to mark the ties between Sri Lanka and Korea  getting close to the waters edge and accidentally tumbling in.
Fortunately, the baby elephant was not actually drowning, says Joyce Poole, a National Geographic explorer and co-founder of Elephant Voices: When elephants swim, they put their trunk out of the water and continue to breathe.
In the video, the National Geographic reports, the baby can be seen doing this snorkeling behaviormeaning it was in no imminent danger.
Even though the family knows the baby can swim, they are still clearly alarmed it has fallen in without meaning to, as evidenced by their quickly flapping ears, says Poole.
Even the elephant in the background of the video, separated by a fence, starts rapidly pacing back and forth.
Elephants are drama queens, especially the females. If anything kind of dramatic events happens in the family, it is cause for great excitement, Poole explains. It is part of the bonding process.
The uniquely close family bonds and capacity for empathy of elephants is evident in this display. Only one of the female elephants that helps the baby is its parent, the mother. The other larger, older elephant that springs into action to help,a 36-year-old, is a bonded family member that gets just as worried about the infant as its own mother.
National Geographic points out that in the wild, the older female elephant would likely be a grandmother or aunt of the baby, but in captivity, unrelated elephants are housed together and still form close bonds.
In the video, the two bonded females are clearly close as they coordinate to help the baby out of the water and back to the safety of dry land, the National Geographic reports.

Stiff race to get hands on Womens World Cup
Sri Lanka take on New Zealand today:
With history set to be made and the joy of the ICC Champions Trophy still fresh in mind, excitement could barely be higher for the start of the 11th edition of the ICC Womens World Cup.
And with eight teams locked together and vying for success on the world stage, the competition could hardly be tighter between captains desperate to get their hands on the trophy at Lords from today.
But before that, there is lots of cricket to be played with all 31 matches being streamed live from Bristol, Derby, Leicester, Taunton and Lords, including 10 on television.
As current ICC Womens World Cup holder and six-time champion, Australia enters the competition as favourite, but faces stiff competition.
With Meg Lanning at its helm, Australia boasts the only player to have 10 Womens One-Day International centuries, while also being part of the successful side in India, four years ago.
Weve got pressure on ourselves to perform well, we hold ourselves to very high standards and we want to uphold them. The pressure is on us but its also on a lot of the teams around the competition, she said.
West Indies also comes into the tournament with plenty of confidence having lifted the ICC Womens World Twenty20 just last year, as part of a hat-trick that included the ICC World Twenty20 won by the mens team and the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup taken home by its colts.
Captain Stafanie Taylor leads the side in this competition for the first time, with history behind her after becoming the only womens player to reach ODI and T20I world No.1.
She said: When it comes to 50 overs, its all about a different mindset. You have to be patient, its a longer format, and you do have time.
India and host England get the competition underway in Derby, on Saturday, the same day New Zealand and Sri Lanka face off in Bristol.
England possesses an impressive record at a home ICC Womens World Cup, winning the competition on both the previous occasions in 1973 and 1993, as well as in Sydney in 2009 with eyes on Heather Knight and her team, bidding for a fourth crown.
However, with India eyeing up its first victory, the challenge wont start off in easy fashion  particularly with the experience of Mithali Raj, the worlds second highest-capped batter behind Charlotte Edwards.
Alongside Australia and England, New Zealand will be embarking on its 11th World Cup in 2017, keen to lift its first 50-over trophy away from home.
Victorious in 2000, New Zealand finished second the last time it played in the competition in England, while the experienced side also has an ace up its sleeve in 16-year-old leg-spinner Amelia Kerr.
One of four teams to progress via the World Cup Qualifier, the experience in Sri Lankas team could prove vital  with nine players aged 31 or over.
On the other end of the spectrum, South Africa has no players in that age bracket, with the honour of captaincy falling on 24-year-old Dane van Niekerk.
She became just the seventh player to reach 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in womens ODIs in February, becoming the first South African to reach the latter figure.
Pakistan will be led by Sana Mir, who could reach 100 ODI caps this tournament, while her haul of 104 wickets is the most by any Pakistan bowler in its history.

Strike to go on, SAITM issue has reached its final stage: GMOA
The members of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will continue the island wide strike they launched on June 21,Wednesday night. Issuing a press release, following a media briefing, the GMOA said that the SAITM issue has reached its final stage.
The issue surrounding SAITM has reached its final stage. The Government has to take action immediately without complicating the situation any further and agree to the five step process formulated by Deans of Medical faculties, Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTAs) and the GMOA on the issue the statement read.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday the Secretary of the association Dr. Nalin De Silva said that one or two Ministers cannot do what they want and rule the country.
If the Health Minister can take stern and unprecedented action against the strike, the GMOA also can make the trade union action tougher, De Zoysa threatened.
De Zoysa reiterated that the differences on the issues exists only between the Minister of Health and the GMOA. He said that the President and the Prime Minister had both agreed and hold the same view the GMOA holds.
Dr. Zoysa questioned whether the Health Minister is Minister of Health or Minister of SAITM. Responding to Senarathnes assertion that the strikers werent doctors, De Zoysa that they could retort saying that Senarathne is not a doctor and only a dentist.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the Health Minister boasted about controlling dengue but he could not do it and it is same with the strike. Todays trade union actions not like early days and cannot be stopped by arresting people he said. He further said that Senarathne has attempted to suppress their voice through violence but insisted that the Ministers attempts would not succeed.
Speaking at the media briefing Dr. Nalinda Herath said that still the Government has the chance to solve the issue without letting it to become more complicated. He insisted that the GMOA is apolitical.

Taliban suspend hostilities to watch Pakistan beat India
Very rarely has global sport experienced an upset like Pakistan's amazing victory over bitter rivals India on Sunday.
The brilliant Indians were out-and-out favourites. The chances of Pakistan, who only just scraped into the tournament and were ranked eighth out of eight qualifiers, had been written off by most if not all. The BBC were particularly contemptuous.
'Pakistan are usually good for an upset, but not this time,' said Test Match Special's Phil Tufnell, who added they would be 'outclassed in every department'.
Tribesmen watch the final in the mountains beyond Peshawar in the north of Pakistan.

Then the magic happened. Out of the depths of despair and humiliation, greatness emerged.
We shouldn't have been surprised. Pakistan's triumph reminded me vividly of the 1992 World Cup. Back then Pakistan looked finished.
Then Imran Khan called his troops together and famously urged them to fight like 'cornered tigers'. The rest is history and Pakistan blasted away England, with Graham Gooch and Ian Botham, in the final.
But Sunday's victory was even sweeter. Imran's team contained world-class players.
Apart from the skipper, it had Javed Miandad, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed and the incomparable Wasim Akram. This Pakistan team pulled together by captain Sarfraz Ahmed was full of unknowns.
The opener Fakhar Zaman had hardly played an international game, having quit the Pakistan navy to play cricket. Shadab Khan, the leg-spinning hero, is just 18.
Pakistan pluck their cricketing geniuses almost from nowhere. Drive down a street in the commercial capital, Karachi, and you find yourself weaving your way between improvised matches featuring cricket fanatics. Travel to the mountains of the north and every patch of flat land has been colonised by young cricketers.
As someone who loves Pakistan and adores the country, I can testify to the raw quality and enthusiasm you find everywhere.
It used to be said if you wanted to find an English fast bowler, you whistled down a mine shaft. In Pakistan there's a cricketing genius lurking in every remote village.
Take the story of Mohammad Amir, the brilliant fast bowler whose match-winning opening spell took out the top three in the Indian batting order, including captain Virat Kohli.
Aged 19, Amir was caught deliberately bowling no-balls in the spot-fixing scandal of 2010. He was jailed and then faced five years of exile from all forms of cricket.
I travelled with the young man to his home village near Rawalpindi and he told me of his deep contrition. Now he has destroyed Pakistan's greatest rivals.
This team has come from nowhere. Look at the bowling attack. Not one of them has taken more than 100 Test wickets. The tournament star, the chest- thumping Hasan Ali, had played one Test and a handful of one-day games. But together these largely unknown bowlers produced a superbly disciplined performance.
In the semi-final they strangled England, regarded by many as the best one-day team in the world.
This triumph is especially pleasing because Pakistan cricket has suffered so much in recent years. The Test team have been unable to play at home since a terrifying terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan team in 2009. They play their 'home' matches in beautiful but bleak stadiums in the UAE, with almost no supporters.
Their cricket administration has often been in turmoil. In one year, it changed hands four times because of legal and political wrangles. The team have overcome problems, particularly corruption, crime and terrorist threats, which established teams like England and Australia can barely imagine.
The team was on the verge of collapsing altogether seven or eight years ago.
That would have been a disaster for world cricket. For all its difficulties Pakistan have brought enormous joy to cricket lovers everywhere.
My own special hero is Abdul Qadir, the charming genius who reinvented the art of leg spin when he bamboozled England's batsmen 40 years ago.
Pakistan have also brought us figures like the stately Imran, who went on to be a formidable politician. In recent times, Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan gave Pakistan joy on the field and moral leadership off it.
Let's have a word for Pakistan's green-clad supporters. With their cries of 'Pakistan Zindabad!' they bring such excitement and commitment to the game. Without exception they gloriously fail the test set by politician Norman Tebbit who insisted that immigrants should support their host country  England  and not the land of their birth.
As for the cricket fans back in Pakistan, they bring an entirely new dimension to world cricket.
On Monday the photographer Rahat Shinwari published a photograph of tribesmen watching the final in the mountains beyond Peshawar in the north west frontier.
There were approximately 40 of them surrounding the TV, powered by a car battery because there is no electricity.
Even hardened Taliban fighters suspend hostilities for the day when Pakistan play cricket and celebrate by firing guns into the air when their national team win.
The celebrations in Indian- occupied Kashmir were tumultuous. In the Gulf states such as Bahrain and Dubai, huge parties followed the triumph.
There is a shortage of good news in Pakistan, but on Monday the whole nation came together and threw a party, with the front pages of the newspapers dominated by the story. Cricket is a national obsession and the nation keeps throwing up cricketing prodigies capable of taking the world by surprise.
The victory will have special savour because India were the losers. The cricket rivalry dates back to a hard-fought Test series in 1952, not long after independence.
So much is at stake in these contests that the two teams fought out a series of 13 consecutive draws, including the first ever 0-0 five-Test series. There was no cricket played between Pakistan and India from 1961 to 1978, a period when the two went to war twice.
Renewed tensions mean Pakistan have not played a bilateral series against India since 2009.
This has caused great damage to Pakistan's cricket finances. The Indian players are not to blame and captain Kohli won many Pakistan hearts with his gracious speech in defeat. I am a loyal and passionate English cricket supporter. Yet I love Pakistan as well. They bring something unique to world sport.
They have produced some of the greatest moments in sporting history, and Sunday was a vivid example of the joy Pakistan bring to sports lovers around the globe.  Daily Mail

Three-quarters will decide fate of final
Isipathana take on St. Josephs:
Isipathana College and St. Josephs College will feature in their Milo inter-schools Division one Presidents trophy knockout rugby tournament final match at Racecourse international Stadium in Reid Avenue today at 4.15 pm.
The Isipathana lads have brought in former fly half Randy Silva to play in the pivotal position of centre at the expense of skipper Sumudu Rankothge who is expected to play in the second half as centre if needed.
In the pack, Devin Gunaratne will play as number eight alongside their flankers Sudeera Gaynath and Umesh Jayamanna in the third row. Vikasha Madawa will be moved up to the front row to bind down with Ramash Sachintha and hooker Kushmal Ratnaweer.
Rival aptains Sumudu Rankothge (Isipathana) and Vinul Fernando (St Josephs)  
The forte of both teams has been their speedy three quarter line. The Pathana line especially with acting skipper Chamod Fernando is expected to give a terrific display in the open play with his sweeping running moves.
If they get their act together to proceed with the famous Fijian style running rugby that they normally play, then Isipathana will have a chance of pulling off this game.
However they face a huge challenge from the Joes three quarter line spearheaded by their full back Gamunu Chethiya who will be ably supported by fly half Chathura Seneviratne, centres Sameera Viranga and Shan Akila along with wingers captain Vinul Fernando and Sachith Silva.
In the set scrums the experienced St. Josephs hooker Sven Muller will get the better of his vis-a-vis young Kushmal Ratnaweer, while the line outs should be shared between the Joes solitary jumper Shehan Kalaniyagoda and Isipathana line out jumpers Sudeera Gaynath and Ravindu Anjula.
Isipathanas new halves combination comprising experienced Harith Bandara and Anjana Kulathilaka are playing together for the first time this season. All will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Pathana will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum playmaker Harith will pair off well with his new fly half Anjana.
Meanwhile for the Isipathana lads in all probability, their young scrum half and playmaker Harith Bandara should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Nadeesha Chaminda and Ramith de Silva together with their young Manelka Ruberu. This is in addition to the experienced centre Randy Silva who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank with speedy full back Chamod Fernando there to join the line and form the overlap.
They will hope that their halves combination of Bandara and Anjana will hit it off today. The halves combination of these two players will have to give a very good performance if Isipathana are to emerge victorious.
Teams:
Isipathana (Probable XV): Vikash Vimadawam, Kushmal Ratnaweer, Ramash Sachintha, Sudheera Gaynath, Ravindu Anjula, Umesh Jayamanne, Nasran Nilamudeen, Devin Gunarathne, Harith Bandara and Anjana Kulathilaka, Nadeesha Chaminda, Manilka Sulakshana, Randy Silva or Sumudu Rankothge (captain), Ramitha De Silva, Chamod Fernando
St. Joseph's (Probable XV): Tehan Seneviratne, Sven Muller, T. Santhush, Hashan Salgado, Shehan Kelaniyagoda, Nimesh Kavinda, Tharindu de Alwis, Gihan Perera, Channa Asoka and Sameesha Virangana, Vinul Fernando (Captain), Chathura Seneviratne, Shan Akila, Sachith Silva, Gemunu Chethiya.

Trump in reverse gear
On June 16 President Donald Trump announced a series of measures that roll back the positive developments in relations between the United States and revolutionary Cuba that took place during the final days of President Barack Obamas presidency.
Among the measures announced were the prohibition of economic, commercial and financial relations of US companies with Cuban companies, related to the Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, prohibition of individual travel by US citizens in the category vi-to-people exchange, and revision of subversive programmes against the Cuba to make them more effective. President Obama also recognized the independence, sovereignty and self-determination of Cuba. This was also repealed by President Trump. However, he stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations which in any case had not yet taken off the ground.
Obviously Trump has gone back on the policy initiated by President Obama. His new measures indicate a set-back in Cuba- United States relations and a return to the policies of the Cold War. It affects US commercial interests and the freedom of US citizens more than it affects Cuba. The latter has developed for over six decades despite US hostility, aggression, subversion and a criminal blockade amounting to genocide according to international law.
However, President Trumps new move is not likely to gain popularity. A recent survey has shown that 73 percent of Americans support the lifting of the blockade against Cuba. Further, 63 percent of them are Cuban Americans. Also 62 percent of the Republicans (to which Trump belongs) support the lifting of the blockade. Similarly 75 percent of US citizens favour the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States.
Responding to President Trumps new measures Cuba has reiterated its principled position that it is always ready to normalize relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and the acceptance of its dignity, sovereignty and right of self-determination.
La Rpublica en Marche stuns France with historic victory
President Macrons La Rpublica en Marche party has swept the Parliamentary polls in France with a stunning historic victory. Though only a year old it together with the MoDem party won 350 seats, in the 577 seat Legislature. According to the final results the Republican Party and its allies received only 137 seats instead of the 200 they had in the earlier Parliament. The Socialists and their allies could only win 44 seats. Communists and their allies won 27 seats. Noteworthy is the huge setback for the ultra-right National Front which won only 9 seats.
However, President Macron has a difficult job reconciling the diverse and often contrary interests of his Right Wing and Left Wing allies. He has vowed clean Government. Already the MoDem Party has withdrawn three Ministers from the Government on account of investigations that have been initiated against alleged misdeeds of those ministers. Despite such set-backs President Macron has a strong position in the Legislature that he would be a formidable President even much more than legendary General De Galle. Even in the international arena, France is likely to see a rise in its stature under President Macron. A strong supporter of European unity he has the backing of European nations with different policies, for example of Britain and Germany. This places France in a strategic role.
US-Russia relations take a nose-dive
Relations between the United States and Russia took a nose-dive in June. They reached the lowest depth since the birth of new Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.
Resurgent Russia under President Putin has gained much of its former strength and glory witnessed during the Soviet era. It has become an indispensable player in world developments. It has already shown its capabilities in the Syrian conflict by consolidating stability in the region with its resolute action against ISIS terrorists.
Despite hiccups experienced earlier its relations with key players in the conflict zone in West Asia and Mediterranean nations have improved. Relations with Turkey are an example. It is largely due to the support extended by Russia that a domino effect in the region could be saved by preventing the fall of Syria following the debacles in Iraq and Libya. It has also succeeded in halting the expansion of NATO to the Black Sea.

Villagers demand protection against wild elephants
It was brought to the notice of the officials in Ampara District that wild elephants have found their way interior to the villagers of Thirukkovil Irakkamam, Ampara, Valathapiddy, Kuduvil, Dheegawappiya, Nintavur, Pottuvil, Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Alayadivembu. Residents in these areas live in fear.
The standing crop of paddy, home gardens and other arable crops have been badly damaged. As a result, the daily income of the people has reduced.
Wild elephants have entered the premises of a farmer and caused damage to paddy bags stocked in the verandah of the house, household goods and the bounty parapet walls.
Some wild elephants have entered Sambunagar and Meelath Nagar in Addalaichenai DS Division and damaged the standing crops and up- rooted grown plants recently. The people in these areas have found shelter in other places to spend their nights. Schoolchildren are unable to concentrate on their studies. Repeated requests to higher authorities have proved futile. A protest was held recently by the villagers in the Thirukkovil DS division demanding protection from wild elephants.
