United action needed to make SLFP victorious
United action is the need of the hour if the SLFP is to be made victorious, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister and SLFP Assistant Secretary Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
United action rather than division is the need of the hour if the SLFP which is the most powerful party in the national political movement is to be made victorious at the forthcoming local government elections, Samarasinghe said.
The minister was addressing a meeting of Kalutara district local government delegates held at Kalutara on January 25.
Samarasinghe said January 25 was a day of great significance to him as it was on such a day that he left the UNP and joined the SLFP 10 years ago to take oaths as a minister. Therefore he considered the opportunity he got to summon a meeting of SLFP local government delegates on January 25 to ensure party unity as a quirk of fate.
Fielding a question by media, Minister Samarasinghe said if a member of the SLFP obtained membership of another party disciplinary action would be taken against such member according to the party Constitution.
He said the meeting was summoned to build a strong organisation needed to ensure an SLFP victory at the forthcoming local government election.
If any division was caused within the SLFP the entire national political movement would suffer a tragic breakdown giving the benefit to sections bent on cliquish and communal lines. Parliamentarian Malith Jayathilleke, Provincial Minister Ranjith Somawansa, Former Minister Reginald Cooray and Provincial Council member Sumith Lal Fernando were also present.

Chord with the right touch
It was an evening of pure enjoyment. It was an evening that saw some stunning performances from the soothing sounds of the 'Three Guitars (Athraja De Silva, Praveen Jayaweera and Thaksala) to the powerful rock of Andrew Obeysekara of Stigmata.
Guitar Fest 2016 saw a spectrum of guitarists, each with his or her different and varying styles. This Sixth festival of Guitar Music was held from January 24 - 27 at Colombo, Kurunegala (25), Jaffna (26) and Rajarata University in Mihintale (27).
Guitarist from those localities gathered together to give some superlative performances under the theme of uniting all people through music. This is a completely voluntary effort by the artists with no pay.
The festival will continue in the future so that young artistes can discover and display their talents alongside other artistes and thrill and regale crowds with some wonderful music. That is the purpose of the festival - to celebrate music and celebrate our diversity.
The Daily News visited Royal College Nawa Rangahala on January 24 and tasted the resounding success of the evening which saw a house full.
The fact that there was an abundance of young talent was evident starting first with the Three Guitars, a trio that was very melodic and mellow.
Vngrumso Raman from India struck a chord with the audience by his evocative music that stood out with his inimitable charm and grace.
Ken Gonzo Sugamata of Japan was the other extreme. His performance really went down well with the crowd. He was at once humorous and playful with the audience. His playfulness however does not indicate that he is a mere windbag. His music really was first class.
Andrew Obeysekara of Stimata was undoubtedly the best part of the evening. The raw energy and power he displayed was incredible. Of course it is no surprise that his performance was so brilliant. Obeysekara of Stigmata fame is well known to Colombo crowds because of the overwhelming success of the rock group Stimata. Obeysekara's abilities have been forged by so many performances on the stage.
The North Indian Raga Music was performed by Nimal Jayakody, who played the Sarodh was accompanied by K. Thilakaratne on Tabla. This was a very special performance because the Sarodh is categorized as a rare musical instrument. It is popular in Indian music and it has its origins in Afghanistan and Central Asia. The meaning of Sarodh is 'beautiful sound'.
"I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome our Director of the Indian Cultural Center, Rajashree Behera who is present here. In her capacity she helped us to have an American Classical Guitarist to come to Sri Lanka and perform," said Mohomed Iqbal of the Organizing Committee.
One performance that cannot be ignored was Anslem Fernando on the harp and Ravi Perera on Key board. They performed their first number - the Latin American song 'Paharo Campana' followed by a composition of their own called 'Ocean Waves'.
"At one of the workshops I met Anslem Fernando. He came to the workshop and told me he was keen on promoting the musical instrument the harp," said Iqbal.
The Daily News also managed to chat with Andrew Obeysekara who really energized the evening.
"I have been honored to have been a part of Guitar Fest for the last six years from its inception and I was invited by Iqbal back in 2011. So since then I have been encouraging and being a part of the guitar association in taking the guitar music to the public. My performance today was a bit of a spontaneous one and I enjoyed it. I am really happy that it has expanded to three other cities," said Andrew Obeysekara.
Andrew who also delivered the vote of thanks paid tribute to the many people who worked so hard day and night to make the festival a success.
"I must thank Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya for accepting our invitation and being present here. I also thank Cuban Ambassador Florentino Batista. I also wish to acknowledge the Indian Cultural Center Director, Rajashree Behera, who has helped us to develop classical guitar music in co-operation with the Guitar societies in India. A special word of thanks to Department of Cultural Affairs Director Anusha Gokula Fernando. It is her word of encouragement and support in organizing transport to all cities. I must also thank National Unity and Reconciliation Director Chandrasena Maliyadde for being present here and giving a valuable contribution to this festival in Colombo, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Mihintale. A special word of thanks to Ken Gonzo Sugamata who is a true friend of the Guitar Association. He came down in 2013 and 2015 and we wish to see him again next year and future events. All musicians have come here to perform without any payment. And let's keep it this way so guitar music reaches all walks of people! "
No doubt crowds that visit Guitar Fest 2016 will return again to enjoy some world class music and with many memories of an evening which was so very worthwhile.

Festival of three plays by Rajitha at Wendt in January
A festival of three popular plays, written and directed by well-known dramatist Rajitha Dissanayake, will be staged at the Lionel Wendt Theatre on January 29, 30 and 31 at 7 pm.
The three plays, 'Apahu Herenna Behe', 'Siriwardana Pawla' and 'Sihina Horu Aran', have drawn crowds and critical acclaim in performances in Colombo, around the country and even overseas.
The festival starts off with 'Apahu Herenna Behe' (Jan. 29) which is being staged after a lapse of six years. In 2009, it won awards for Best Play, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress at the State Drama festival, and it was also performed at the Cairo International Theatre Festival in 2010. The play deals with the relationship between the state and the public in the dissemination of information during a time of war, and also a man's dilemma in keeping certain aspects of his personal life a secret from his family.
'Siriwardana Pawla' (Jan. 30) is Rajitha's newest play, and this festival will mark the first year of its run since premiering in January 2015.

The festival ends with 'Sihina Horu Aran' (Jan. 31) which has run continuously for 12 years and still features the original cast, except for one character. 'Sihina Horu Aran' was staged at the Bharath Ranga Mahaothsav in Delhi in 2006, and the same year it toured five European countries (France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy). In 2005 it won State Drama awards for Best Original Play, Best Script and Best Actress.

Iraq doesn't need foreign troops to fight terror - FM
IRAQ: Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari has announced that all counter-terrorist operations in the country will be carried out by Iraqi troops, without international help. However, "certain advisors" will remain, he added.
Only national troops will be employed to fight Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) on Iraq's territory, the foreign minister said, according to the ministry's website.
Actual control of ground operations and those of any other kind targeting terrorists in Iraq will only be carried out by Iraqi forces, he announced on the sidelines of Arab-India Cooperation Forum (AICF), in Bahrain's Manama. Interference of other countries, except for assistance from certain advisors, will be regarded as a violation of Iraq's sovereignty, he emphasized.
Al-Jaafari also hopes that national troops will be able to exterminate all IS militants on Iraqi territory by the end of 2016. There are currently around 3,600 US military personnel in Iraq, in training and military support roles.
Currently, US troops continue to provide support to the Iraqi military.
"Attack, fighter, and remotely piloted aircraft conducted 20 strikes in Iraq, coordinated with and in support of the Iraqi government," the US Department of Defense reported on Saturday.

The Artist Jayani Pinnawale says: "When I look back after so many years at painting. I get quite a satisfaction and contentment from my creation of Art. I feel proud and honored when critics on Art say that I have excelled in both painting and writing."
Jayani has always attempted to create an enchanting world through her painting which would bring happiness to the Art lovers. Her painting speaks of beauty of life, the serenity of environment, the unforgettable expressions of people, the lovable and graceful existence of animals and birds and the beauty of flowers.
Jayani's use of vivid colours and shadows enhance the depth and the natural image of the painting 'Blues and Blues' one of her new paintings. She has used mostly blue colour and without using green which she thinks is a good experience.
The whole painting including water, trees and bushes are painted only in blue.
In some paintings she uses only a few colours, sometimes two colours, sometimes two or three colours to complete the creation. The colours used in the background of painting 'In sorrow' brings out the feeling of sadness . 'Helplessness' is a painting of an elderly woman which was done during the Tsunami disaster.
When traveling to other countries she takes her time off to visit museums, and places that display painting.

Petitions against three Bills
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament that petitions have been filed before the Supreme Court against the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, Theravadi Bhikku Kathikawath Bill and Micro-finance Bill. He observed that the three Bills cannot be taken up in the House until the Supreme Court comes up with its determinations on the the Bills.
The Speaker said two petitions have been filed against the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, one against the Theravadi Bhikku Kathikawath Bill and three against Micro-finance Bill.
Foreign service to gain strength
The government is in the middle of restructuring the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said joining the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday.
It meets the challenges of the modern world. We have lot to do. When this government came into power, quality and quantity were in a crisis, he said. Minister Samaraweera said the Foreign Ministry had over 100 vacancies. Ministry exams were not held regularly. Most foreign ministries have intakes every year. But in the last 10 years, there were only two intakes.
Within six months of office, we recruited 25 new officers through open competitive exams. We hope to hold these exams annually. Even the approved cardre is insufficient. We have 67 missions abroad. Before January 2015, out of the 67 embassies, there were only 15 SLFS heads of missions. Others were political appointees selected by the Head of the State," he said.
The minister said many of them were relations of the first family of the country. They were indulging in their private businesses. Some of them sold buildings belonging to the Foreign Ministry. Investigations are continuing. The SLFS has 34 competent and efficient foreign service officers, he said.
Professionals go unhindered by ETCA - Harsha
Professionals will have no adverse impact from the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA), said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
He said the government will enter into the agreement in a manner that would benefit the nation.
Foreign investors have to build up confidence on us for them to come and make their investments, the Deputy Minister said. In 2011, a number of institutions were acquired by the government. But nothing was given to the owners of those institutions as compensation, he said.
Regaining investors confidence is a tall order - Mangala
Regaining investors' confidence after five years of waste and corruption will not be an easy task, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera told in Parliament yesterday.
"One quick and important way of demonstrating our good faith and that Sri Lanka is open for business is by signing investment promotion and protection agreements," the Minister said. These agreements ensure that there is a transparent and level playing field for all investors. There is nothing to fear from these agreements. All they do is to protect investors, he said.
Minister Samaraweera was joining in a debate on agreements Sri Lanka entered with several
other nations during the adjournment motion debate. The government was elected to create one million jobs within five years by increasing investments and boosting exports. It is the responsibility of the government to make that vision a reality, he said. The Prime Ministers economic policy statement on November 5 outlined plans to boost investments, exports and growth. The country can meet this target by 2020, he said. There was no job creation during the previous regime. There were no investments. According to the cooked up statistics of the previous regime, the growth was fueled by unsustainable and poorly negotiated borrowings, he said.
Minister Malik Samarawickrema will soon make a statement in Parliament about the kind of response the country received at Davos when a Sri Lankan delegation went there recently. Sri Lanka is considered as a frontier market. "We will have to stand out and compete harder and smarter than others. In such a difficult domestic and international climate, the question for the government is how we attract investments and generate jobs while ensuring that we reduce our dependency and risk," Samaraweera said.
Foreign investors come to Sri Lanka after new change - Ajith Perera
Foreign investors come to Sri Lanka as new change was brought about on January 8 last year putting a full stop to corruption, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera.
He made this observation yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday.
We are working with China and India. We work with them in the same manner that Mahinda Rajapaksa did during the previous regime," he said.
He said the previous regime reached the decisions on development projects keeping an eye on the commission.
The failures of the Norochchole coal power plant were not due to the China's faults, but due to the political decisions taken by the Sri Lankan side, the Deputy Minister said.
We would launch the development of power plants in the country in a transparent manner," he said. He said the government does not give bribes to any other country. The government does not deal with the other countries on the terms of the previous government, but on those of this government which would benefit the people, Minister Perera said.
Conflicting views on War Tribunal - Namal
The President's statements contradict the Foreign Ministry's views on the War Tribunal, said UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
He said the Foreign Ministry has promised the European Union that foreign judges would be used in the war tribunal while the President told the foreign media that war tribunal would consist of the local judges.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
Rajapaksa said the Prime Minister realised that Sri Lanka can get valuable support from China although they made objections against it during the previous regime.
He said the government has realised that the Port City Project is important.
We maintained that we have to build up new relationships to develop economy of the country. That is why we built them up. We had different views within the Cabinet. But they were not personal, Rajapaksa said.
Stable economy needed to woo investors - Dinesh
UPFA Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane told in Parliament yesterday that a country should have a stable economy to attract investors. Sri Lanka is experiencing an economic crisis. Sri Lankan Rupee has been depreciated.
He made this observation moving the adjournment motion in Parliament. The Foreign Ministry recently came in to agreements with countries such as Thailand, Qatar, Kuwait, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.
The safety of foreign investment should be guaranteed through the enactment of a two-thirds majority in Parliament as the Constitutional Guarantee of Investment Protection Agreements.
Under article 157 of the Constitution, no legislative, executive or administrative action can be taken to contravene the provisions of a bilateral investment agreement.
He said foreign missions should contribute to uplift the countrys image in the international arena. They should take measures to find better market opportunities for main export crops; tea and rubber in the international market.
Though the Yahapalana government promised to ensure the foreign service free of political interferences, they failed to keep that promise. By appointing a member of the UNP executive committee to the foreign service, the government has breached that promise, he said.
He said the President and the Foreign Ministry have conflicting views on the Geneva agreement. Expressing his views to the BBC, President Maithripala Sirisena said foreign judges should not intervene in hearing Human Rights allegations and foreign specialists or a special court to hear the allegations are not needed. These controversial ideas will badly affect to the country, Gunawardane said.
Govt should submit draft of Indo-Sri Lanka economic agreement to Parliament
The government should submit the draft of the proposed Indo-Sri Lanka economic agreement to Parliament, UPFA Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said joining the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday. MP Nanayakkara said the Foreign Affairs Ministry acts as a separate State. Conflicting ideas of the ministry and the President on the Geneva agreement have proven this.
The world has a suspicion over the relations maintained by the Foreign Minister with Israel, the MP said.
He said a recent statement on the Geneva agreement made by the President Sirisena to the BBC has proved that the President has betrayed the UNP.
No trouble for professionals
The government will not put professionals into difficulty by signing the CEPA agreement, UNP Parliamentarian Mujuber Rahuman said.
He made this observation yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has assured that the government would not deprive the opportunities of the country's professionals. But there is an attempt by some groups to spread adversarial attitudes among the people against India," Rahuman said.
He said communist parties have joined capitalist parties and formed governments. They have betrayed communism, he said.

Regressive forces stalling new constitution: TNA
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) expressing its concerns on the delay to pass the resolution in Parliament to set up the Constitutional Assembly said regressive forces must not be allowed to scuttle the project to introduce a new Constitution.
Addressing a press conference at the Opposition Leader's Office in Colombo yesterday, TNA spokesman and MP M.A. Sumanthiran urged the government to follow through the important step it took to draft a new Constitution. "The debate on the resolution has been put off because the President wants a consensus in Parliament with regard to the mechanism for the drafting of the Constitution. However, that concern of the President should not be used by those regressive forces to scuttle this project.
We have continuously supported the move, but we do not want any dilution in this exercise. The whole exercise is aimed at changing the governance culture of this country and that change must be genuine and have a positive impact in the country. Therefore, it is important that the objectives stated in the preamble of the resolution be achieved and the government move forward without any further delay to set up the Constitutional Assembly," he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist, Sumanthiran stressed that the best way to ensure that the country does not divide is to have a power sharing arrangement that is consistent with the principles of federalism.
"The person who introduced the concept of federalism to this country was S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1926. Therefore, there is no foundation to say Sinhalese people are opposed to federalism in this country. The reason perhaps why the 'Unitary state' is favoured now, is because some people think that is the only way to prevent the country from dividing. We say that it is an arrangement on federal lines that will best ensure that there will not be a call for division in this country. There won't be a necessity to divide, if the people in all parts of the country have an access to the powers of government," he said. However, Sumanthiran said they were more concerned on the content of the power sharing arrangement than its label.
He said it was possible to have discussions based on the draft Constitutional Bill presented with the consensus between Prof. G. L Peiris and Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam in August 2000.
"That particular Bill was approved by the then Cabinet which included Mahinda Rajapaksa as a minister. He did not object to it. Even the UNP at that time did not object to its provisions related to the sharing of powers. They objected only for the continuing with the executive presidency for a further period of time. Therefore there was adequate consensus from both major parties as to how the Constitution should be," Sumanthiran said. Sumanthiran stressed the political aspiration in the people in the North and East is not separation, but to live in one country with some arrangement by which they can also have a share in governance.
"The issue of sharing of powers of the government is not something new. A change in the governing structure was called for in December 1949 when the ITAK was formed. It has taken all this time and so much of bloodshed for the realisation that we need a new Constitution that shares powers of governance with all the people of this country. Our identical position on political solution has been approved by our people at several elections since 2010. Particularly in August 2015, when we presented our manifesto, we asked our people to treat it as a referendum and give us a mandate to work for this political solution," he said

SLFP requires MR's support to win forthcoming LG polls - Dilan
Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) requires the support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to win the forthcoming Local Government election.
Minister Perera was speaking at a press conference at the Information Department yesterday.
He said the cooperation of Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena is required to win the forthcoming election
"There are parties who want to create rifts within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Those in the United National Party like to see division in the SLFP," he said.
The minister also added that there is a question with regard to the impartiality and legality of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). He said that there can not be an institution within the Police Department which does not come under the purview of the National Police Commission. Perera insisted that the FCID should be brought under the National Police Commission forthwith
"We had a question over the FCID from the beginning, but, we are seriously concerned about its impartiality and legality after the NPC was setup," he said.
He said that former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa has awoken up after a long slumber. Perera added that the 1982 referendum was defeated because of Basil Rajapaksa.
The minister said that the former Economic Development Minister did not strive for the party's well being. "He worked for his well being," he said. "No one knows whether Basil Rajapaksa has struck a deal with the aim of making the UNP victorious at the forthcoming election," he said.

There will be no room for another Somarama or Buddharakkitha: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that his government would not leave any room for the creation of another Talduwe Somarama or Mapitigama Buddharakkitha among the Maha Sangha.
Joining the debate on agreements Sri Lanka entered with several other nations at the time of adjournment, the Prime Minister said that an unfortunate incident occurred in the country on January 26 at the Homagama Magistrate's Court where Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was remanded till February 9.
"This is a court order. We should respect the law and a court order. A group of monks staged a demonstration opposite the Homagama Magistrate's Court. It is not certain whether all of them were bhikkhus or posing as bikkhus wearing robes.The police acted on the instructions of the Magistrate. There is a law in the country and all are equal before the law. The law has to be implemented against all equally," the Prime Minister said.
A warrant was issued by the Homagama Magistrate's Court for the arrest of Gnanasara Thera on the charges of allegedly threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, at the court premises.
The Prime Minister said he had instructed the police to have a full scale investigation into the conduct of Ven. Gnanasara Thera and submit the report to the Mahanayakes of the Malwatte and Kotte Chapters for further action against Ven. Gnanasara Thera.
"I am a Buddhist and I am ashamed of what happened at the Homagama Magistrate's Court premises," he said. He added that the present government would not leave any room for the creation of Somaramas or Buddharakkithas again.

We must delink religion from terror: Swaraj tells Arab League
BAHRAIN: Strongly pitching for delinking terrorism from religion, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said India and the Arab world must join hands to eliminate the menace as she warned that those who silently sponsor terror groups could end up being used by them.
"Those who believe that silent sponsorship of such terrorist groups can bring rewards must realise that they have their own agenda; they are adept at using the benefactor more effectively than the sponsor has used them," Swaraj told the Foreign Ministers of Arab League states.
Speaking at the first First Ministerial Meeting of the Arab-India Cooperation Forum which she described as a "turning point" in India's ties with the Arab world, she made a strong pitch for delinking religion from terrorism, saying the only distinction is between those who believe in humanity and those who do not.
"Terrorists use religion, but inflict harm on people of all faiths," said Swaraj, who arrived here yesterday on a two-day visit.
She cited "India's model of unity in diversity" as an example for the world to counter indoctrination and radicalisation.
Swaraj's citing of India's religious and cultural diversity at the world stage assumes significance as it comes in the backdrop of the intolerance debate that had raged recently in the country with many writers, artists and civil society members expressing alarm over the issue.
"We in India have citizens who belong to every existing faith. Our Constitution is committed to the fundamental principle of faith-equality: the equality of all faiths not just before the law but also in daily behaviour.
"In every corner of my country, the music of the azaan welcomes the dawn, followed by the chime of a Hanuman temple's bells, followed by the melody of the Guru Granth Sahib being recited by priests in a gurdwara, followed by the peal of church bells every Sunday," she said.
"This philosophy is not just a construct of our Constitution, adopted in 1950; it is the essence of our ancient belief that the world is family," she asserted.
Swaraj, in her speech, also quoted from the Quran, saying that faith harmony is the message of the Holy Quran as well.
"I will quote only two verses: La ikra fi al deen (Let there be no compulsion in religion) and La qum deen o qum wa il ya deen (Your faith for you, and my faith for me)," she said in her address to the key Arab nations.
She stressed that dangers of radicalisation and indoctrination cannot be ignored.
"We have seen repeatedly that terrorism does not respect national borders. It seeks to subvert societies through its pernicious doctrine of a clash of civilisations," Swaraj said.
"The only antidote to this violent philosophy is the path of peace, tolerance and harmony, a path that was illustrated centuries ago by Buddha and Mahavira and which was taken into the modern age by the Father of our nation Mahatma Gandhi. As he famously said, 'an eye for an eye ends up making the whole world blind'," she said.
