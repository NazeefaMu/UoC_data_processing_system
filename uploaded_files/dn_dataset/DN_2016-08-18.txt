SRKs and Imtiaz Alis film gets  a tentative title - The Ring!

Shah Rukh Khan and Imtiaz Alis first collaboration is being looked upto with great enthusiasm by fans. It seems the working title of Shah Rukh Khans next is Production No. 52. The Imtiaz Ali-helmed project is Red Chillies Entertainments 52nd project, hence the title. But weve come to learn that the film also has a tentative title: The Ring. Thats what a trade source told us on condition of anonymity. The story behind the title Still unknown.
The film, which sees SRK opposite Anushka Sharma, is a love story but as the superstar revealed recently, Imtiaz has a different language of love. I told him I wanted to do a happy love story. And this is one, but keeping my age in mind, its not an upbeat, young love story. But, Imtiaz has a nice take on it. And hopefully, people will like it.
Anushka and SRK fly to Budapest later this month to begin filming for the romantic flick. Shah Rukh will start filming with Anushka Sharma in Budapest, Hungary. The director has wanted to work with the superstar since a long time. King Khan also revealed in an interview that Imtiaz has always discussed films with him even though he was not a part of those flicks. The coming year is an action-packed one for the actor. The release of Rahul Dholakias Raees will be early in the year and he also has Aanand L Rais next. The actor will also be seen as a psychiatrist in Gauri Shindes film with Alia Bhatt.

Lankan Olympic hopes fading

RIO DE JANEIRO, WEDNESDAY: Sri Lankas hopes of winning a medal is fast fading away with its last two Olympians down to compete in athletics  mens javelin throw and mens marathon, in the 2016 Olympic Games now in progress here in Brazil.
Hurdler Sumedha Ranasinghe is down to take part in mens javelin throw qualifying round in the early hours of Sri Lanka time (5 am) and veteran marathon runner Anuradha Indrajith Cooray is due to run in the mens marathon to be worked off on the final day of the 207-nation Games  on Sunday (21).
Sri Lanka has won only two silver medals in the 120-year-old summer Olympic Games history. Although Sri Lanka has been a long-standing member of the International Olympic Committee and has competed in every summer Olympic Games since 1948, except in 1976 Montreal, the island nation has found places in victory podiums only on two occasions.
Since the late Duncan White gave the country its first ever Olympic medal at the 1948 London Games Susanthika Jayasinghe is the other medallist for Sri Lanka when she won the womens 200m silver at the Sydney 2000 Games. Although 16 years have passed since then, a third Olympic medal still looks a distant dream for Sri Lanka.
With seven of its nine competitors for the Rio 2016 Games fading away, Sri Lankas chances of a medal at Rio Olympic Games looks rather slim.
Nevertheless, veteran marathon runner Cooray is working hard at his event. Cooray, Sri Lankas flag bearer at the Rio 2016 Games, is a seasoned campaigner competing in his third Olympics. The UK-based long distance specialist, having competed at the Athens 2004 and London 2012 Games, is determined to shatter the Sri Lanka marathon record here.
But he will find it tough with the hot weather that is prevailing in the morning, especially the hot sun. The hot weather is set to give a testing time for all marathon runners. Sundays mens marathon could well turn out to be a direct battle between two African nations  Kenya and Ethiopia which has jointly produced the top five runners who have registered the best timings this season.
Meanwhile, some of the Lankan Olympians to Rio have already left the Olympic Village. Among them are the two Lankan swimmers Matthew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem.

Avishkas second century: gives Lanka clean sweep of ODI  series

CANTERBURY: Another brilliant hundred from opener Avishka Fernando saw Sri Lanka pull off a 24-run win over England in the third and final Under 19 Youth ODI to make a clean 3-0 sweep of the three-match series at St Lawrence ground here on Tuesday.
Fernando slammed 15 fours and four sixes in his knock of 138 which came off 134 balls to follow his as Sri Lanka batting first hit up a challenging total of 300 in 49.1 overs. Fernando and fellow opener Dilan Jayalath (67) gave Sri Lanka a flying start by sharing an opening stand of 149 off 26 overs that laid the platform for Sri Lankas total.
At one time Sri Lanka were cruising at 256-1 in 42 overs before they lost their last nine wickets for 44 runs. England tried hard to chase down the runs but apart from half centuries from George Hankins and Ollie Pope no one else made any worthwhile contribution as the Lankan spinners once again took control.
Sri Lanka U19 : 300 in 49.1 overs (Dilan Jayalath 67, Avishka Fernando 138, Charith Asalanka 30, G Panayi 2/50, B Twohig 2/58, B Green 3/59)
England U19 : 276-9 in 50 overs (G Hankins 79, Z Malik 20, O Pope 87, D Bess 34 n.o., Lahiru Kumara 2/70, Hasaranga de Silva 3/39, Damitha Silva 2/47)

Police celebrate 150 years

This year marks the 150th anniversary, of the policemen who over the years have produced many top sportsmen and they are quite rightly celebrating it with sporting activities. This is one department which has given the best for every sport and in connection with the celebrations there was a series of sporting events at every town.
Kandy under DIG S.A.D.S. Gunawardene, SSP Division Edmund Mahendera, and HQI Nipuna Dehigama along with the rest gave a big hand in conducting sporting activities. It was due to the efforts of I.E. David, one-time IGP, who initiated the Bambalapitiya Police grounds in 1812 that helped policemen in a big way to promote sports. It was a crown land, of about 6 acres.
Then in the year 1928 the pavilion was built by Sir Henry Leyard Dowbiggin the then IGP. In 1954 the cricket scoreboard came up that was during the time of IGP W.T. Brindley. In 1993 the grand stand was built during the time of E.E.B Pereras term as IGP. The two left and right wings were completed in 2003 when. T.E Anandaraja was the IGP.
The first sport the policemen took up was gymnastics in 1877 due to the efforts of Major S. Nolis, who also helped at cricket, boat racing and football The first football match was played in 1896 on March 2 against St Josephs College. The cops were led by A.S. Thawson. Then the Police Football Association was formed in 1897.
At cricket, the first ball was bowled on September 24, 1898, against Royal College, where the Royalist was able to score 175 runs and the Policemen made 80 runs.
The first Inter Divisional Athletic meet was held on March 1, 1902, at Havelock Race Course Ground. The first Gun Shooting contest of Police was between Galle and Ambalangoda in 1903. Boxing was another popular sport at Police, thanks to I.E. David who was the IGP between 1910 and 1913, gave a big hand for boxing and introduced the game. That was the time where a mob of gangsters, armed with weapons such as kris-knives, daggers were operative in several places in the island sometimes, challenging even the police officers.
To face this situation, boxing helped the policemen to knockout the thugs. Basil Henricus became the first cop to win a gold medal in the bantam weight in 1948 at the Imperial Athletic Meet in Australia. This is known today as the Commonwealth States Athletic Meet. The Police had some top boxers like H.P Jayasuriya, his brother C.P.Jayasuriya, Dharmasiri Weerakoon, Sumith Liyanage and Nimal Lewke.
Rugby was started in January 1881 when a team of police officers participated in a rugby game at the Kew Garden Park in Malay Street, Slave Island. In 1961 Police SC together with Division B teams from Air Force, Army , Navy and University were permitted to play alongside the Division A clubs, CR &FC, CH&FC, Havelock SC, Kandy SC, Dimbula A & CC , Dickoya MCC, Uva and Kelani Valley Club in the Clifford Cup competition.
It was in 1967 under the leadership of S. Siva Sivendran Police became B division champions and were promoted to A Division the following year and in their first year entered the Clifford Cup finals. Police won the Clifford Cup outright for the first time in 1972 under Anton Benedict when they beat CH&FC 129.
Police SC went on to win six consecutive league titles from 1984-89. During this period the club won numerous Sevens wins and clinched the triple crown twice.

Getting injured  was a blessing in disguise  -Kaushal Silva

For Sri Lanka opener Kaushal Silva getting the webbing of his left hand split proved to be a blessing in disguise as it enabled him to get out of a rut and score a long overdue Test century.
Silva batted six hours to score 115 runs and place his team in a position to push for a rare 3-0 whitewash over the worlds no. 1 ranked Test team Australia.
My injury required six stitches and the coach asked me whether I could go out and bat. I took the challenge and from that moment I wanted to bat well, said Silva. It was a blessing in disguise that I got injured. It prevented me from driving. I had got out a lot trying to drive. I changed a few things by playing on the leg-side.
It was tough initially as I had a split-webbing. That actually helped me. If you see the first few innings I got out, I was chasing balls wide outside the off-stump. I thought lets play the balls that are coming to me and lets focus on that, he said. Normally when you have an injury you tend to concentrate more. That helped me a lot and gave me the guts to go out there and show how capable I am and what I can do when the chips are down.
Silva said he was batting in the nets with a couple of pain killing injections when coach Graham Ford wanted him to go and bat at the fall of the first wicket.
My fingers and arm were numb. I didnt feel the bat. Since we lost a wicket early, the coach wanted me to go and bat.
That gave me the confidence and courage, said Silva.
Even against spinners I was just punching. When I forced I felt the pain. I didnt feel anything with the injection. But after the power of the injection went off, I was feeling the pain. Cant say I batted one handed, but it was really tough.
Silva rated Tuesdays innings as his best and added, It was challenging. It was mainly to prove myself that I can do it. Yes, I had a bad patch, but I had a good tour of England. I just need to get 20 runs or so and I knew once I got there I would go all out.
Silva said he drew inspiration from his dad who offers him a lot of tips as well as scolds him when he gets out chasing balls wide outside the off stump.
My dad has always encouraged me. Not to forget my family. Its good to see that I am now better placed than I was two weeks ago, said Silva. The team was amazing. They supported me and the selectors backed me and told me not to worry.
All the innings I was getting out for less than 10. I wanted to score more than 20 because after that I knew how to build up the innings.
Silva said facing a bowler like Mitchell Starc was very tough especially with the new ball. You have to use the heat advantage. You bat longer and take him into his fourth or fifth spells, thats what I did today.
Starc took only one wicket on Tuesday (Kusal Mendis) with the majority of the wickets - five going to the spinners.
There are rough patches on the pitch and it wasnt easy and the spinners we have like Rangana (Herath) and Dilruwan (Perera) will have a good effect on this wicket, said Silva.
we can attack them more and get wickets. We are keen to win this game.

Kusal Mendis  century was the  turning point - Mathews

Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews credited young Kusal Mendis for his brilliant century (176) in the first Test at Pallekele for the series turnaround of his team that enabled them to complete a comprehensive 3-0 whitewash of the Australians at the SSC grounds yesterday.
After Sri Lanka was shot out for 117 in the first innings, Mendis knock in the second innings lifted the spirits of the team to go and complete a stunning 106-run win which was just the ideal tonic to dominate over Australia for the rest of the series.
It was a great turn around. The key point was Kusal Mendis that was the turnaround for the whole series, said an elated Mathews after laying his hands on the Warne-Muralitharan trophy for the first time.
After getting all out for 117 at Pallekele it was a special effort by young Kusal Mendis getting us on track and to a winning track. From there on it really kicked off. The confidence levels were sky high. We worked very hard and actually we worked harder than the first two Tests ahead of the third Test as we were desperate to finish this series 3-0, he said.
The credit should go to all who supported us from SLC president to office bearers, the selectors for having the patience, the support staff and the team they were fantastic. Not to forget the fans. We have had a tough few months and we thank all of them.
Mathews rated the win over Australia on par with the series victory they achieved in England two years ago.
I would say that England and this series where we created history are marked very high. Those series wins are the standouts for me as captain so far. A captain is as good as the team. The credit should go to the team for their fantastic effort, said Mathews. As a team we played better cricket than Australia. Regardless of them having a bad record in Asia they are still the number one ranked team. To beat them it has to be a special effort and I can tell you we had to work really hard. They are going to come hard at us in the one-dayers.
Mathews paid tribute to young players like Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva and Kusal Perera who made a big impact in the series.
It's just pure talent. They have not played that many first-class games. Dhananjaya has but not Kusal. You have to take that chance with some players at some time. It paid off, said Mathews. You saw how they played in extreme conditions. It was turning square. They had Lyon and O'Keefe and then Mitchell Starc, who has been outstanding in the series. They are an outstanding lot and we have to work harder. The calmness and the composure shown by Dhananjaya batting at number seven was great. He handled pressure well. With Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera our future is bright.
Paying a tribute to his match-winning bowler Rangana Herath, Mathews said, He was fantastic. As I said at the post match interview, he was bowling off one leg. He got hit while batting and then he had a groin strain. He couldn't run and he couldn't jump. He was just landing the ball on one leg and he is unbelievable.
He has taken 28 wickets in the series, one of the best I have seen. The batsmen are having a nightmare facing him no matter how well they play spin. Credit should go to this man. He has been a great team man as well.
Mathews said that his team will be partying in a get-together organized by Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday night. We will have a drink just after the press conf as well. It is unbelievable. The feeling is great.

We have been outplayed in  every facet of the game: Smith

Australias disenchanted captain Steve Smith was at a loss for words to explain his teams 0-3 whitewash at the hands of seventh ranked Sri Lanka.
Its a hard one to grasp really, its been a very tough series again, this is our third straight whitewash loss in the subcontinent, lamented Smith at the post match press conference.
What we are doing isnt working, batters arent adapting to the conditions, spin bowlers arent adapting to the conditions, I cant fault our quicks, they did a great job, particularly Mitchell Starc, but our batters and spinners are the ones who have to step up and we havent been able to do that.
We have been outplayed in every facet of the game, our plans havent worked as individuals or as a collective group, we havent been able to put Sri Lanka under as much pressure as we would have liked, he said.
In these conditions it is the spinners job to get the majority of the wickets as the Sri Lankan spinners did, we just havent been able to do that.
Smith was full of praise for Rangana Herath who took 28 wickets in the series and played an integral part in their defeats.
Hes a very tough character to face, hes always at you, hes always at your stumps, he changes his pace beautifully and bowls from different parts of the crease, changes his angles up.
You never really get a freebie off him or an easy boundary. You always have to work for your runs, which is important as a left-arm finger spinner to the right handed batsmen in particular. He is a terrific bowler in these conditions and he has had a magnificent series.  ST

Aussies didnt have  a plan against  spin  Herath

Man of the Match and Man of the Series Rangana Herath said that the Australians didnt have a plan for the spinners in the series and that he was not surprised they lost.
After 2011 this is the first time they have come here. They have played only ten Tests in Asia since then. They play a lot in their conditions. They have to have a better plan to play spin. I thought they didn't have a plan for the spinners in this series, said Herath who bagged a mountain of wickets finishing with a rich haul of 28 at a cost of only 12.75.
To take 28 wickets against the world's number one ranked team is a massive thing. The most wickets I have taken in a series as well. It feels great.
I have played six series against Australia. Except for one series where I was a substitute, we have lost all other series. Even in this series they are the number one ranked team but we were confident about our ability. With the starts Kusal (Mendis) gave us we had our confidence sky high. This is a huge win. I don't think that we ever imagined that we could achieve a 3-0 whitewash, he said.
Herath said that there was nothing special about his bowling that confused the Aussies.
Because of the injury (groin), I had to vary a few things but nothing other than usual. The first two games I was going well but this game was tough. As Angelo said there are certain things you have to put through pain. All the players in the team contributed, that's the reason for us to win.  ST
