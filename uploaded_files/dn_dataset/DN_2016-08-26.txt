Smith returns home, Warner to captain

Cricket Australia announced yesterday that Steve Smith is leaving for Australia today to prepare for the next series after a short rest and that vice-captain David Warner would be taking over as captain for the remainder of the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka.
We had a discussion with myself, Darren (Lehmann, coach) and (chief selector Rod (Marsh) and we also consulted the selectors. It took a bit of convincing to get me over the line. In the long run but a little bit of break would do me a lot of good, said Smith yesterday.
Its been a disappointing tour and for me as captain its been a learning experience. Its been incredibly tough, weve been outplayed in the three test matches and its never easy coming to the subcontinent, he said.
Australias next series in five ODIs in South Africa in September which will be followed by home Test series against South Africa and Pakistan before a tour to India. - ST

'DILSCOOP' Dilshan brings curtain down on career
A rare cricketer and a trulygreat all-rounder - Jayasuriya
Tillakaratne Dilshan has finally decided to end his career as a cricketer once and for all and according to him he will not want to be involved with the game he bestrode for over two decades any longer in whatever capacity.
I have taken this decision after consultation with my family members. I think this is the right time for me to retire and I have no other ambitions of prolonging my career any further, Dilshan told the Daily News.
Dilshan will make his final One-Day International appearance for his country in the third ODI against Australia at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium on Sunday August 28 and his final T20 International appearance also against Australia at the R Premadasa Stadium on September 9.
I want to catch up on the lost time with my wife and three kids and want to give them the best of fatherhood which they may have missed by my being away from home with the Sri Lanka team, Dilshan said.
The 39-year-old right-handed opener retired from Test cricket in March 2013 and concentrated on playing One-Day Internationals and T20 Internationals. He said at the time that he would call it quits when he no longer enjoys the game.
It seems the time has arrived for him to take a final decision on his career. Dilshans current form would also have been a factor towards his final decision. He scored 22 and 10 in the first two ODIs played at the R Premadasa Stadium coming out of a knee injury which he sustained during practice. He also missed Sri Lankas last ODI and T20I series in England citing personal reasons.
Chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya said that he and his committee were unaware of Dilshans decision to retire as they had already picked him to play in the third and fourth ODIs in Dambulla.
We picked the side during the second ODI and we learnt of Dilshans decision only yesterday, said Jayasuriya.
He denied that there was any pressure brought on Dilshan to retire. The decision he took was purely his own, we were keen to play him.
Paying a tribute to a former team mate Jayasuriya said, Dilshan was truly a great all-rounder for Sri Lanka. He could bat, bowl, field and even keep wickets very rarely do you find a cricketer who is so versatile in every department. What is so great about him is his commitment to perform well even at this late age. Sri Lanka cricket will certainly miss him.
Will Dilshan be lost to cricket forever
I have no plans to play any further cricket or be involved with cricket. Its a decision that I have taken, said Dilshan.
Although I am not considering taking up any positions connected to cricket or play cricket of any format my name I am sure will remain in the game as the inventor of the Dilscoop, he said.
The Dilscoop became famous during the ICC World T20 in England in 2009 when Dilshan used it frequently to become the leading run-getter in the tournament with 317 runs (avg. 52.83) and a top score of 96 not out  a performance that took his team to the final against Pakistan at Lords and gave him the Man of the Series award.
According to Dilshan he started practicing this stroke against a bowling machine during his tenure with Delhi Daredevils in the 2009 Indian Premier League (IPL) held in South Africa. It was used so successfully by Dilshan during the World T20 that former Australian captain Ian Chappell who commentating during the tournament aid that he had never seen any batsman play the ball straight over the wicket-keepers head as Dilshan does.
Dilshan appeared for Sri Lanka in 97 Tests 11 of which he captained and in 329 ODIs (26 as captain). He also captained in five of 78 T20 Internationals he has played to-date.
Making his ODI debut in December 1999 in Zimbabwe, Dilshan turned out to be one of the most successful cricketers in the shorter format scoring over 10,000 runs and capturing over 100 wickets. He is also one of the few batsmen to score over 1000 runs in T20Is and also a century. He made 1000 ODI runs in a calendar year on four occasions, the last one being in 2015 when he amassed 1207 at an average of 52.47.
Despite his age Dilshan remains one of the best fielders in world cricket especially at his pet position at cover point where he has brought off numerous catches and saved several runs for his team. His best performance on the field was during the VB final against Australia at Adelaide in 2006 when he ran out four batsmen with some slick fielding that enabled Sri Lanka defend a target of 275 and win by 22 runs.
Sri Lanka Cricket in a media release stated that they would dedicate the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Australia to be played at Dambulla Stadium on Sunday to honour Dilshan for his invaluable contribution to the game and country.
I together with my committee wish to extend our sincere appreciation and wish him the very best in his future endeavors, said Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala.

Thisara Perera fined,  Starc reprimanded by ICC

Sri Lanka all-rounder Thisara Perera has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee while Mitchell Starc of Australia has received an official reprimand for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct in separate incidents during the second One-Day International in Colombo on Wednesday.
Perera was found to have breached Article 2.1.7 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman, while Starc was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.1, which deals with conduct that is contrary to the spirt of the game.
After the conclusion of the match, which Sri Lanka won by 82 runs to level the five-match series, both the players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by Javagal Srinath of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. As such, there was no need for formal hearings.
The charges had been laid by on-field umpires Michael Gough and Raveendra Wimalasiri, third umpire Aleem Dar and fourth umpire Ranmore Martinesz. The incident involving Perera happened during Australias run-chase when the fast bowler, after dismissing David Warner, used language and displayed actions which could have provoked a reaction from the Australia opener.
As regards Starc, the incident happened earlier in the day in Sri Lankas innings when the left-arm fast bowler, after completing his third over, threw the ball in the direction of Dinesh Chandimal who was inside the crease at the strikers end and not attempting a run.
