Swift construction progress places Astoria towards timely completion
The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Global 500 company with its subsidiary company, AVIC International Hotels Lanka Limited had recently produced a progress update with regards to the upcoming formative construction project of the AVIC Astoria in Colombo 03.
The AVIC Astoria, which is scheduled to be unveiled to the public before the end of 2017, is set to be a high-rise building will comprise of 4 towers totalling 608 apartments.
A focal and much anticipated feature of the upcoming Astoria will not only be the enormity of the project being constructed in a central location with close proximity to the city and all other influential landmarks of Colombo being close by but also the amazing view being that of the sea as well as the surrounding area of the city limits itself.
Another major attribute about AVICs involvement with the construction phase of the Astoria is the swift implementation of the build-up by the labour force as well as the use of state-of-the-art and leading edge technology from China. The use of aluminium formwork has been much talked about and is known to be the first time this is being incorporated into a construction project in Sri Lanka.
Astoria also ensures that the surroundings for future residents will not be compromised in terms of the view.
Irrespective of the apartments position from any of the four upcoming towers, residents are guaranteed to experience not only breathtaking views but also soothing breezy days and nights.
To arrange a viewing of Astorias mock apartment or to seek further information, contact the AVIC Astoria office at Deal Place, Colombo 03.

Tech-savvy toddlers are sleeping less than before
While the Internet boom is inevitable and so is the need for new gadgets, children of tech-savvy parents are learning to use them even before they can say their first word.
A new study reveals that while using smartphones may improve their motor skills, they are sleeping less and it can affect their health.
According to a report in BBC, infants spending time on touch screen depend on the number of hours. More the number of hours spent, the child tends to sleep 15 minutes lesser than the last time. About 75 percent of the toddlers use smartphones on a daily basis and that affects their sleeping pattern in the long run slowly reducing the number of minutes by the hour.
Interestingly, the toddlers tend to sleep more in the day than the night because of the shifting patterns. While the use has to be reduced so that it doesnt affect the development of the child.

The Teeth of the Comb Osama Alomar SWAMP
I turned into a swamp of inactivity, and because of this no one was able to see the gems in my depths.
ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID
An enormous garbage bag, seeing the social pyramid shimmering in the sunlight, wanted to reach the top. He made great attempts to climb up, but every time he would slide back down. After many failed attempts, his efforts finally brought success. He sat regally at the top of the pyramid out of breath from the fatigue and the intoxicating joy of victory. The thrill of his accomplishment caused him to forget the suffering he had endured.
But within moments, the apex of the pyramid had pierced a hole in the bag. Soiled water mixed with garbage poured down the four sides until the whole structure was covered in a monstrous pile of refuse whose terrible smell spread far and wide.
QUICKSAND
Its rare that anyone gets away from me, the quicksand said in a voice filled with confidence.
But the quicksands of life answered her scornfully, saying: How many people keep flailing and thrashing in me all through their life, and they neither get away nor drown entirely!
THE FINGERNAIL
The fingernail clipping looked up at the crescent moon with sadness.
When will our Lord know our sufferings she asked herself, When will he come down from his ivory tower and hear our complaints How great is the distance between us and him! How must the world look from his position! No doubt its beautiful  terrifyingly beautiful!
TWO CARS
Two cars stopped at a stoplight, an old model and a new one next to each other. The new one looked at the old one with amazement. Her eyes had rarely seen this kind of car which no longer existed.
I pity you, she said. You were made by a primitive hand lacking a scientific, creative touch and the power of inventiveness! Look at me  Im a miracle in motion.
Feeling insulted, the old car answered her, saying: You may enjoy the benefits of advanced technology on the inside, but your body is weak and fragile and cant take even the smallest shock.
My strong body has the power to withstand any shock. Going on, she added in a deep voice: Youre like a modern human: a weak body and an utterly complicated inner life full of complexes and negativities and bad tendencies.
Me, Im like a premodern human possessed of a pure and simple soul, living in the heart of nature, eating from its goodness. Humans back then were built strong with a constitution that could resist disease. But the new car didnt even hear the last sentence. As soon as she saw that the light had turned green, she started off as fast as possible, leaving behind her old colleague who was trying hard to keep up with the rest of the new model cars. -Paris Review

The Time I Spent the Night in Hamlets Castle M L Rio
I spent the last anniversary of Shakespeares death in a Danish castle, the first person to do that in a hundred years (or two hundred, depending which tour guide you ask). This is undoubtedly among the strangest things Ive done in my life, and because my memories of it have the chimerical quality of dreams, sometimes it doesnt seem real. But every now and then my friend Margaret and Iwho went along as my plus onewill look at each other and one of us will say, Remember that time we went to Denmark and slept in a castle We really did. And it was wild.
Every time I try to explain how this whole thing came about I get the details mixed up, because it was a long, bewildering series of events. The short version is that I won a contest hosted by Airbnb, where entrants were invited to explain why they wanted to spend the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeares death at Kronborg Castlebetter known to the English-speaking world as Elsinore. At the time I was just about to finish my masters degree in Shakespeare Studies, so I had plenty of answers for that. (They can be summed up as follows: I am a huge nerd.) I wrote my application in iambic pentameter (because I am a huge nerd but also a showoff), hit SEND, and promptly forgot about it. Two weeks later my phone rang and it was Denmark on the line. Another two weeks later, Margaret and I were emerging from a wind-blasted train station to startling sunlight and the frankly mind-boggling shape of the castle across the water.
What we didnt fully appreciate until we were on the ground in Denmark was the scope of the events planned. We were taken on a private tour of the castle, interviewed by several different news crews, and escorted to the penultimate performance of Globe to Globe Hamlet in the Kronborg banquet hall, with Queen Margrethe II sitting in the front row. And that was just the first day. On Day Two, between more interviews and scrambling to get our term papers (due the same week) done and dusted, we ran around our hotel room, throwing clothes on and off and asking one another, What the hell are you supposed to wear to a Renaissance banquet in an actual castle (A ruff. The correct answer is a ruff.)
When we arrived, we were relieved to find that there seemed to be no dress codesome people were in black tie, some in full Renaissance regalia, some in lavish costumes that didnt have anything to do with Denmark, Hamlet, or the Renaissance (from what I could tell). We wandered through the winding, labyrinthine halls of Kronborg until we found ourselves once again in the banquet hall, where eight or ten long tables cluttered with glasses and silver and piles of Shakespearean paraphernalia were waiting to receive us. (I stole a paper doll of the Danish prince. Im not proud of this but I dont regret it either.) We sat elbow to elbow with Rufus Gifford (the US Ambassador to Denmark and unbeknownst to me until that point, the runner-up in the Airbnb contest) through seven courses of real Renaissance recipes (including gargantuan white asparagus and what might have been quail eggs; Im still not entirely sure what we ate since the entire menu was in Danish) and at least that many rounds of wine, the meal interrupted every quarter hour or so for musical interludes, speeches in English and Danish, a fencing match, and a performance by the Danish Royal Ballet. By the time the last flights of desserts were being cleared away, the whole banquet hall had filled with music and the lights had been lowered, so everyone could carry on partying like it was 1599.
I have no idea what time it was when we finally stumbled up the spiral staircase to the tower where we would be sleepingwith no electricity, no running water, and not another soul about except the security guard in the anteroom below. We went through the incongruously mundane motions of brushing our teeth and putting our pajamas on, but in a castle. For a while we sat down on the foot of our beautiful four-poster bed and just looked around the roomthe somber stone walls, the long beautiful windows, the dark shadow of Sweden across the water, the by-now-familiar skull on the table, the candles flickering in the fireplace. There had been no shortage of jokes about ghosts on the battlements throughout the day, and in our dazed (and I will admit, more than a little drunk) condition, it was impossible not to wonder whether the place really was haunted.Shakespeare is literally everywherein rap lyrics and soft drink slogans and James Bond movies.
I decided it probably was and, unperturbed by that, slept like a baby. I woke up to the gold gauzy light of dawn streaming in through those magnificent windows, faintly surprised to find that I hadnt just imagined the whole thing, like the lovers waking in bewilderment at the end of A Midsummer Nights Dream.
It was early stillwe had a train to catch at about 6 amand I got to watch the sun rise over the water, the shadows of the castle towers shifting and changing shape on the ground below. Even in the moment it felt unreal, and the idea of returning to my all-too-real everyday life as a graduate student in London was almost painful. - Lithub

Traditional paddy cultivation methods to be revived
Traditional paddy cultivation methods are to be revived in Sri Lanka. The farming community would be encouraged to grow more traditional high-quality strains of paddy under the programme, agriculture officials said.
According to Agriculture Ministry sources, over 3,000 acres of land had been brought under the plough through these methods. Neither chemical fertilisers nor pesticides are utilised in these cultivation activities. Paddy cultivators are made aware of the significance of using organic manure and compost, rather than chemical fertiliser.
Cultivation instructions, novel agriculture technology, and all other facilities in this regard, would also be provided to farmers by the Agriculture Ministry. It is targeted to bring about 100,000 acres of land in the country under paddy cultivation using traditional methods, soon, agriculture authorities added.
The enhancement of the production of high quality varieties of rice in the country would be the aim of these endeavours, agriculture project officials added.

Turkey supports 3,000 Jaffna children
The Turkish government handed over school bags and stationery to 3,000 children in Jaffna on April 22.
The event was held at the Velanai Central College. The project was initiated by State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran and financed by the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TKA), the official aid agency of Turkey.
Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tunca zuhadar said, This donation may be a small drop in the ocean, but it can have a remarkable impact on the childrens enthusiasm to study. This event also reflects the Turkish peoples solidarity with the children of Sri Lanka, as it coincided with the April 23 Sovereignty and Childrens Day in Turkey.
Turkey has been providing humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka for more than a decade. In 2006, Turkey funded a large-scale housing project in Midigama, Matara, where 450 houses were built for the victims of the devastating Tsunami. In 2015, Turkey helped build the 'Sri Lanka-Turkey Friendship Village,' with 100 houses for the IDPs in Mannar.

Unbeaten Charlo KOs Hatley to keep crown
NEW YORK AFP April23, 2017Unbeaten Jermell Charlo knocked out Charles Hatley just 32 seconds into the sixth round Saturday to retain his World Boxing Council super welterweight title in an all-American showdown.
Charlo landed a flurry of punches to open the sixth round, the decisive one a stunning right hook to the chin that caused the challenger to fall forward to the canvas, prompting an immediate stoppage.
I knew Charles Hatley goes down sometimes and gets back up -- he's a warrior and won't go down easily, Charlo said. I knew I had to be a lion in there. Charlo improved to 29-0 with 14 knockouts while Hatley fell to 26-2 with one drawn.
Asked after the triumph whom he might like the fight next, Charlo said was interested in a unification bout against compatriot Jarrett Hurd, the International Boxing Federation champion.
Charlo's unbeaten brother, Jermall, vacated the IBF crown in the 154-pound weight class two months ago to advance into the middleweight ranks, Hurd winning a February fight to claim the crown.
Charlo, making his first title defense, had not fought since last May, when he won the crown with an eighth-round knockout of US Virgin Islands fighter John Jackson.
The bout was a matchup of Texas rivals, but Houston's Charlo, 26, dominated Dallas-based Hatley, 31.
Charlo, who suffered a cut over his left eye in a second-round clash of heads, knocked Hatley into the ropes with a hard right at the end of the round and flattened the challenger once before the knockout blow. Hatley, who saw a nine-fight win streak snapped, had not fought for 17 months, since knocking out Australian ex-champ Anthony Mundine in November 2015.
The fight was on the undercard of an all-US welterweight matchup at Barclays Center between former champions Shawn Porter and Andre Berto.

For your eyes only
I am driving along the Colombo-Hatton road, under a gray, April sky, in the company of a falsely exuberant radio announcer who breathlessly unfolds a long list of names of listeners, eagerly waiting for a certain song. The loving messages sent by, loving husbands and loving wives, loving aunts and loving uncles to each other through the announcer (why isn't it a better idea to whisper their message of love straight into the loved ones ear instead of broadcasting it into the ears of thousands of unwilling listeners) refuses to warm my heart, till finally the tunes of a familiar song drifts towards me...George Michael singing Careless Whispers. The music takes me back to my teenage-self, to the pages of my diary in which I had so zealously recorded how, one day I hoped to meet the idol of my dreams to help him put his broken heart back together again...Soon I am so wrapped up in my thoughts, the long forgotten past become more real than the gray present under a gray sky...
I remember my teenage daydreams so clearly because recently I have been reading my diaries of ten, twenty thirty years ago. From worries about the O/level Art paper to the first session of ragging I endured at Uni to that fateful day when I met a cousin of a friend who, to my horror had never read a book in his life, all I have to do is open an old diary to rewind my life... School. Uni. Loves. Devastations. Doubts. Adventures..they are all there, packed into a sheaf of handwritten pages.
Positive impacts
I didn't know it then, but it appears I have been doing the right thing. There is increasing evidence to support the notion that keeping a diary has a positive impact on physical well-being. University of Texas at Austin psychologist and researcher James Pennebaker contends that regular journaling strengthens immune cells, called T-lymphocytes. Other research indicates that journaling decreases the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.
Not surprisingly, journaling (or keeping letters or diaries) is an ancient tradition, one that dates back to at least the 10th century. Successful people throughout history have kept journals. Presidents have maintained them for posterity; writers for inspiration. For some like Oscar Wilde it was a source of entertainment.
"I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read on the train," said Wilde. True, neither Winston Churchill nor Barack Obama would have recorded their brushes with love or musings on listener's request pro grammes on the radio, but if they did, it would have been okay.
After all, that's the beauty of keeping a journal: there is no wrong way to do it. And you are the only one who is going to read it, anyway. Perhaps over and over some day in the future, perhaps, never.
Empty chair technique
Just ask Freud - bottling up emotions and feelings is bad for you, and one of the best ways to treat numerous psychological conditions is to just let them out so that you can deal with them and move on. Techniques recommended by psychologists often include things like the 'empty chair' technique where you imagine a chair has someone on it and then tell them your problems/how you feel about them.
By using a diary or a journal you will be able to do this yourself on a regular basis and thus ensure that you are not bottling things up which might ultimately come out in damaging ways. This allows you to start each day feeling refreshed and energetic with no psychic garbage left over from the day before
I know what you are thinking: "So writing a few sentences a day may keep me healthier longer, but so will eating red rice and spinach! Why should I bother journaling when I have already got too much on my plate" Hold it. Don't abandon hope all ye. Here's why:
Scientific evidence supports that journaling provides many unexpected benefits. The act of writing accesses your left brain, which is analytical and rational.
While your left brain is occupied, your right brain is free to create, intuit and feel. In sum, writing removes mental blocks and allows you to use all of your brainpower to better understand yourself, others and the world around you.
If you have always thought, journals are places for wired people to record their deepest, darkest confessions or reveal the most vulnerable parts of their inner selves, think again.
In reality, journals are simply receptacles for to-do-lists, future goals, spur-of-the-moment ideas, and random insights that you want to remember later. By writing down this kind of information, you will be able to better order your life and hold yourself accountable even when you are at your busiest.
Pacifying the monkey mind
Journals can also be vessels for celebratory accounts, as they can remind you of past achievements and milestones. If you are feeling low, you can easily boost your self-esteem and paint a picture of your own awesomeness by paging through your accomplishments and moments of greatness.
Keeping a diary will make your mind, quieter, too, because offloading your racing thoughts onto a nonjudgmental medium that isn't attached to punishment will allow you to get off the rat-race and onto a more mentally healthy track. Countless medical professionals and institutions have endorsed journaling as a method to pacify the monkey mind. That is, as a way of managing overwhelming emotions and reduce anxiety and stress.
And, as you do so, you will end up getting to know yourself more. This is because journals can also act as profound pools of personal reflection. Taking time to shut out the loudness of the outside world and reconnect with your thoughts can lead to incredible self-discovery. The process of pouring out your unadulterated ideas onto a blank page may very well reveal some diamonds in the rough that would otherwise have been swept out the door with the ordinary dust of the filtered mind. Finally, by continually journaling, you give yourself the privilege of tracking your own evolution and the power to acknowledge how you have changed and grown.
More conquerable
Moreover, while journaling may inadvertently help you find solutions to troubling problems, one of the more important functions it serves is granting you the ability to gain perspective on your thoughts and feelings. So rather than fixing emotional challenges straightaway, writing about them simply changes your relationship with these life hurdles, which can make them more conquerable in the long run.
Plus, you will also lose weight. Not literally (sorry if I got your hopes up), but you will feel lighter. Journals have long been touted as platforms of cathartic release, and as social psychologist James Pennebaker has proven, writing expressively about traumatic events or situations can uplift both your mind and body.
So, if you want to have any idea about the life you are living right now, keep a diary. If not, when the days of your life are gone from you, who will give them back Who will tell you your own stories Who will add colour back into your life when all you are left with is black and gray
If you are not doing it already, start journaling right now. And, if at first, you can't think of what to write, do what Ernest Hemingway did. "I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, 'Do not worry.
You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence that you know.' So finally I would write one true sentence, and then go on from there. It was easy then because there was always one true sentence that I knew or had seen or had heard someone say."
Here are five reasonswhy you should keep a journal:
1. Your journal has the potential to be both therapist and a dear friend who listens without judging or interrupting and is open 24 hours a day. You can tell your journal things you wouldn't dare verbalise to someone else. Writing it down takes the edge off more toxic feelings and emotions and helps you better understand what you are feeling, freeing up thinking space to gain clarity on what to do next.
2. By getting into the habit of consciously and attentively looking back over your journals, you are able to track your personal patterns of behaviour that help you achieve goals and respond effectively to challenges. You are also able to see the patterns that get in the way of personal and professional growth, and healthy relationships with self and others. By becoming mindful with what you are discovering, you can move yourself from knowing into a doing state.
3. Journaling is inexpensive, accessible and is easily self-managed. It carries very few side effects and can be applied almost anywhere.
4. Journals are creative portals. Because you are in dialogue with your inner life when you write in a journal, you solve problems and get creative. Keeping a journal can be both a clearing-house and become an incubator where you tap into your imagination and unleash your creativity and ideas. Writers like Virginia Woolf, Maya Angelou, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Sylvia Path and Alice Walker along with hundreds of writers across time who all kept diaries and journals which has informed their writing and creative productivity.
5. You give yourself permission to write yourself into history
Journals give voice to your dreams and aspirations but are also safe spaces to release negative feelings, hurts and disappointments that could get in the way of those dreams and aspirations being realised.

Yams are a widely used culinary favorite in Sri Lanka due to its taste and its added health benefits. It is an inclusion in any menu, be it at a wedding or a house party or a simple homely meal. Garden Talk speaks to Homagama Agriculture Instructor H.A. Indika Gunasena on this food item that is in high demand in our society.
"Sri Lanka is a country rich in floral diversity and this has a considerable number of edible and non-edible roots and tuber varieties. This important resource is commonly known as 'yams.' These include roots and tubers indigenous to the country as well as some varieties introduced and naturalized in the country. All these root and tuber plants also had a number of unique characters in cultivation including disease resistance and the ability to flourish in low fertile soils and not much attention is required. The traditional knowledge of the cultivation of these roots and tubers passed on from generation to generation.
These edible roots and tubers were an important food source and was a component of the diet of the community in the past. Some of these roots and tubers possess special characteristics such as certain medicinal values and food qualities which were identified in the time immemorial and passed from generation to generation. In general, these plants are high in proteins, calories, minerals and vitamins. They are low in fats and sugars. This however varies, depending on the varieties," said Gunasena.
There are yams which grow above the earth and that which grow below the soil. Udala is a variety that grows above the soil. All other varieties of yams grow below the soil.
"In Sri Lanka there are more than 50 varieties of Yams. Most of these are traditional Yams. These are Yams that are found in forests but introduced to home gardening by farmers and cultivated in home gardens
H.A. Indika Gunasena
Now Potato is Yam which is an upcountry vegetable, that was introduced to our consumption from abroad. It is an introduction. And it has become highly successful. It is very popular and is grown and produced widely in Sri Lanka. It fast grew in popularity, even more than Manioc and Sweet Potato. It goes with so many other foods. It is also genetically enhanced when it comes to size and yield. It is in high demand in Sri Lanka. The up country climate is also suitable for potatoes. It is a crop that is high yielding. It is also easily cooked with a delicious taste of its own," explained Gunasena When it comes to Potatoes, the climate in Sri Lanka is ideal in the up country. It is highly suitable for Sri Lanka.
Yams can be divided basically into two - Traditional Yams and Popular Varieties.
"These Traditional Yams are found mostly in rural areas but are not cultivated widely. We have grown to like Potatoes. It can be easily cooked. You can even make potato chips! It has a taste of its own. When you take traditional yams, they are only found in rural divisions. They are not done on a large scale because it is difficult to find planting material. They are only done on a home gardening level. It is for home consumption. It cannot be grown on acres and hectares because you simply cannot find planting material," pointed out Gunasena People are used to eating mainly Potatoes. That is the main Yam. When it comes to Traditional Yams farmer are not inclined to produce on a large scale. Farmers are not interested - because the yield in popular varieties is higher and the planting material is also more. Traditional yams are mainly used for home consumption.
"When you take Traditional Varieties (Yams), they can be done on a large scale, but farmers are simply not interested. When it comes to cultivation, cultivating popular varieties is much easier as you can find planting materials," added Gunasena
These traditional yams are found mostly in the Wet Zone and in the Dry Zone, though they may not be endemic to Sri Lanka. You don't find traditional yams in the market, because the cultivation is low. When it comes to popular varieties, the cultivation is easier with a high yield.
"When it comes to traditional it is difficult to sell because people are not used to it. People may not even know what 'Raja Ala' is. It is good for high blood pressure, it gives good muscular strength. It is good for hair. It reduces obesity. It is good food for babies. It is good for pregnant mothers," informed Gunasena
When you take traditional yams since it is not done on large scale cultivation the planting material is less. When you take popular varieties since it is done on a large scale the planting material is more.
Health Benefits of Yams
* Yam is a good source of energy- 100 g provides 118 calories
* Dietary fiber help reducesconstipation, decrease badcholesterol levels.
* Lower colon cancer risk
* Being a good source of complex carbohydrate, it regulates steady rise in blood sugar levels.
* The tuber is an excellent source of the B-complex group of vitamins.
* Fresh root also contains good amounts of antioxidant vitamin, vitamin-C - Vitamin-C plays some important roles as anti-aging, immune function booster, wound healing, and bone growth.
* Tuber is one of the good sources of minerals such as copper, calcium, potassium, iron, manganese, and phosphorus. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids which helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure by countering hypertensive effects of sodium. Copper is essential for the production of red blood cells. Iron is required for red blood cell formation.

Government did its best in Meethotamulla incident
Doing media shows and playing blame games during an incident to achieve petty political targets have now become a tradition; but the government has done its best in the Meethotamulla tragedy, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing a meeting held recently to review the progress made in providing temporary accommodation for the displaced of the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Each citizen should be thankful to the tri-forces, the Police, and the Sri Lanka Civil Security Force, who are still playing a significant role in assisting the victims, he said.
The building used to store paddy was abandoned for a long time. Ven. Vitiyala Kavidhaja Thera and the IGP took steps to use this building to provide temporary accommodation for the displaced. The government is taking necessary steps to provide compensation and shelters for the displaced. Until then, they will be given temporary accommodation with the maximum facilities, he said.
He said Sri Lankans are very sensitive as a nation in a tragedy and tend to assist without any discrimination.
In the recent past, some individuals try to accomplish their political needs in such situations. It is not acceptable, he said.
I saw people brought bodies of the deceased to the road even after everything was arranged at the Kolonnawa temple. It was clearly a political need, the Minister said.

Indian economy to expand at 7.5%
Indian economy will grow at a clip of 7.5 percent this fiscal, up from 7.1 percent in the previous year, and remains resilient with low inflation, fiscal prudence and low deficit, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said.
Participating in G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting, he said emerging economies have become increasingly important in driving global growth, accounting for more than 75 percent of global expansion.
Among emerging economies, India has been a major driver of global economic growth with an expected growth of 7.5 percent for 2017-18 against 7.1 percent in 2016-17, an official statement quoted him as saying.
Indias growth, he said, remains resilient with low inflation, fiscal prudence and low current account deficit (CAD), talking about robust structural reform measures.
Addressing the meeting yesterday, Jaitley said India is on course to introduce the goods and services tax (GST) from July this year. GST, he said, will eliminate the multiplicity of taxes and make India a single common market.
As per IMF projections, Indias medium-term growth is poised to go above eight percent, Jaitley said.

President walking political tightrope
President Maithripala Sirisena is today walking a political tightrope by finding solutions to the peoples problems while protecting SLFP policies and the unity of the two parties strengthening the National Unity Government at the same time, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing a meeting of the Badulla Electorate SLFP Bala Mandalaya held at the Badulla Postal Department Auditorium on April 23.
The Minister said the people are not accustomed to the system of national government even though the two main political parties have joined together to experiment it successfully. One had to admit that President Sirisena won the presidential election with the support of UNP votes because a vast ratio of SLFPers did not vote for him at that time.
Today, the President had been able to safeguard and strengthen the SLFP and find solutions to the peoples problems by protecting the two party unity, he said.
Minister de Silva said the SLFP Central Committee after President Sirisena won the election unanimously decided that the party should join the government. After that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the party chairmanship to President Sirisena as everyone knows.
Minister de Silva said they could not leave the party once President Sirisena took over the SLFP leadership because they have always stood by the party and its hand symbol.
We will be in the SLFP till death do us part, he said.
This did not mean that they opposed any individual, he said.
He said that in 1956, the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike broke the shackles of feudalism and formed a peoples government. As products of the 1956 revolution, they would never change the party because they never desired to break it up. It was the duty of all to rally round the SLFP and protect and safeguard it.
Solutions could never be found to problems by leaving the party and forming other parties or groups, he said.

3-D printing revolution: How Sri Lanka can get ahead in the curve
Ever wonder what would you do if you lose bricks of your LEGO play set. In the past you would have ordered new brick set from a supplier. But, with the advances in additive printing (3-D printing) technology you would be able to manufacture them at your own home. What you need are three dimensional design of the brick developed using a suitable software, a 3-D printer, and the correct material for fabrication. In the 3-D printing a 3-D software generated model of the object to be manufactured is inserted to the 3D printer and the printer deposit material layer by layer to manufacture the object. Unlike molding with a die, 3-D printing can manufacture objects of arbitrary complexity.
It has been shown that 3-D printing can be used to manufacture jet engine parts, automobile parts, medical devices, optical components, medicine, houses, human organs, and even food among other things. With the development of technology, similar to the personnel computers, 3-D printers have grown better and cheaper. Nowadays it is possible to buy a reasonable quality 3-D printer under 1000 USD. Even though 3-D printing cannot compete with traditional manufacturing in the mass scale production, it has a cost advantage over traditional manufacturing due to low capital investment needed. It is possible to manufacture complex structures using 3-D printing which otherwise are impossible with traditional manufacturing. So in the near future the commercial applications of 3-D printing would be in niche, low volume, and high value products. But with the development of the technology, 3-D printing can enter into volume production. It is predicted that by 2023 3-D printer speed will increase up to 90% from today's speed. As a result, the manufacturing will be decentralized and a relevant information economy will be created. It is predicted that by 2025 the estimated economic impact of 3-D printing will be around 300 billion USD.
In every major technological leap in the human history, be it automobiles, computing, internet, electronics, or nanotechnology, the countries that have benefited most economically are the countries that have invested in those technologies at the inception before the other countries enter into the landscape. Therefore, in order to economically benefit from the up and coming manufacturing paradigm shift due to additive (3-D) printing, countries need to invest fast and invest smart in the technology. Sri Lanka, a country which strive to become one of the developed countries in the world need to ride with the waves of new technology. Due to the demographic situation in Sri Lanka, mass manufacturing will not be the path to development, because many other countries can do it more economically.
A technology confined to a small group of people in a country will not bring economic benefit to that country. In order for a technology to be a useful tool to bring economic benefit, it should be naturalized among a critical mass of young people. Sri Lanka benefited from the internet/computing revolution because of critical mass of youth entered into that technology landscape at the beginning and started doing new things. This group started new companies and contributed to the Sri Lankan economy enormously. Sri Lanka did not benefit from electronic revolution because very few Sri Lankans had the know-how of the technology at the inception. As a result, other countries with that advantage surpassed Sri Lanka in that technology and reaped enormous economic benefits. Riding in successive technological revolutions successfully can bring a country to the developed state.
In order for Sri Lanka to successfully ride in the 3-D printing revolution, it should create a critical mass of people who have the technological know-how. Best place to start that process in my opinion is at the grass root level of the education. That is the school. While universities and technical collages can introduce this technology simultaneously, maximum impact will come if the technology is introduced at the school level.
Advanced level technology stream is the foundation over which technologist for various fields are trained. 3-D printing will be used in many diverse fields as mentioned earlier. As such advanced level technology stream is the best starting point to introduce 3-D printing technology in Sri Lanka. In order to introduce 3-D printing to the technology stream curriculum it would cost up to around 400,000 LKR per school. This includes printing unit, necessary training, software support, and consumables.
This is an upper estimate. Bulk purchasing could bring cost further down. The cost of introducing this technology to 250 schools would be around 100 million LKR. If a school can introduce 20 students to this technology per year, it would be 5,000 people per year with a certain know-how of the 3-D printing technology. Some of them will further study this technology and provide the critical mass of people necessary to sustain 3-D printing related industries. Above is a rudimentary budgetary and impact estimate. A thorough budgetary and impact estimate is outstanding.
In summary, 3-D printing has the potential to be the next big technological revolution. In order to reap maximum economic benefit from the technology it is necessary to train critical mass of people in the technology. That can most successfully be done if it is introduced at the school level. The cost for such program is well within the affordable limit of Sri Lanka.

Henry H. Lemij
Outstanding leader
News reached that Henry H. Lemij passed away on November 10, 2016, just short of his 89th birthday. He was the first Refinery Manager of CPCs Oil Refinery.
Henry Lemij will be remembered for his outstanding contribution to the Initial operation of CPCs Oil Refinery in Sapugaskande, and for also laying the foundation for its sustained operation in the future. The refinery is in operation to this day, some 48 years later, thanks to the sound foundation he initiated.
Henry Lemij was born in Breslau, in 1927, and survived his teen years in Amsterdam, during the time of the German invasion, and miraculously escaped detection.
We next hear of him entering the University of Delft, where he graduated in Chemical Engineering in 1955, and in the same year, joined the precursor of the Royal Dutch Shell Group. His intellectual ability and sound work ethic, combined with strong leadership qualities, saw him rise up rapidly in the Shells Pernis Refinery, and lastly, as Head of the Shell Manufacturing Development Division in the Hague.
In 1966, CPC Chairman K. Alvapillai negotiated the contracts for the establishment of our first oil refinery, a 38,0000 barrels per day hydro-skimming refinery.
Snam Progetti, an Italin Govt-owned entity was awarded the contract for the lump sum turn key project. Universal Oil Products was selected for the design of their licensed units, and Snam as responsible for the detailed design and procurement and erection of all plant and equipment, including a 5 MW Power plant, and a water treatment plant. The project was planned for completion in 1969.
Chairman K. Alvapillai also concluded important agreements with the Shell Group, a five year agreement for the supply of Crude Oil, including takeover and commissioning of the Refinery and its commercial operation included was contract for a Technical Assistance Team, who would takeover and operate the Refinery, and also train and develop local staff.
Henry Lemij arrived in Colombo, in January, 1969, and led a team of Shell Expatriate staff about 50 in number, who comprised hand-picked persons from the other Shell Refineries. Some 140 local refinery operators were also recruited by PC, including 40 management trainees destined to occupy executive positions. He approached his task of commissioning the Refinery and training of Local staff with considerable zeal and energy.
Henry Lemij presided over daily meetings, between Snam Project, UOP, dors reps, overseeing complex tasks engulfing the takeover and initial operation of a Refinery with great skill, and was a hard task master setting project mileposts, of which he sought a high degree of compliance. Finally, the Refinery was brought on-stream in August, 1969, meeting all specified design criteria and processing 38,000 BPSD. Henry Lemij was the first Refinery Manager, and headed Shells Technical Assistance Team, which set about its task of training Sri Lankan staff Assiduously, One of Henry Lemijs dictums was there were no reserved seats, and each person had to earn his position by due performance. Senior Staff were assigned to key positions under expatriates, and their capabilities evaluated.
Henry Lemij devised the Refinery Organisation according to the best Shell practices, and paid great attention to sound safety practices, which became ingrained in operating staff, resulting in the Refinery winning several awards for safe operation in the ensuring years. From day one, he sought to optimize refinery operations, seeking to increase through put by debottlenecking constraints to increased production. Attention was paid to minimizing refinery losses, and this was closely monitored on a daily basis. The refinery Organisation was devised to establish sound operating and maintenance practices.
Henry Lemij initiated the practice of regular meetings between operating and maintenance staff, and planned maintenance was instituted from the beginning. He presided over the Monday morning management meeting each week with much aplomb and kept everyone on their toes. The success with which he conducted his assignment resulted in the takeover of operations by CPC staff in 1972, about two years earlier than planned.
In 1994, the Refinery celebrated 25 years of operation, and Henry Lemij was a distinguished invitee to attend the celebration event, a deep recognition and appreciation of his monumental contribution to the Refinerys initial operation.
The then Chairman, Anil Obeysekera felicitated him at special dinner during this visit, at which some Refinery Senior Staff who worked with him were present. The Chairman extolled Lemijs contribution to the Refinery Operations, and wished him a happy retirement. It was, indeed, a happy re-union and a wonderful opportunity to recall pleasurable times working together.
We pay a tribute to his outstanding contribution, and convey our sincere condolences to his wife Audny, his sons, and their families.

Nanda Maitipe
Soft-spoken teacher
The saying goes:Teachers are visible gods. The validity of this saying became veritably palpable not only to me, but also to all the numerous near and dear ones who rocked to show their empathy to our beloved friend Gernal Mayakaduwa on his wifes unexpected demise. Tranquility in the picturesque idyllic hamlet of Balangoda, a few miles off the City of Galle, was veritably stirred when the versatile teacher of high calibre Nanda Maitipe went on the flight of no return.
The symbiotic relationship among plants and animals, I have observed many a time. Yet, on January 25, only I breathed a great lady of sterling qualities had such a relationship with nature.
In a nutshell, her ladylike decorum won the laurels of all and sundry in the vicinity. The boughs of the trees saluted her bending towards her little abode; her feathered friends virtually sang a sorrowful semitone as a token of gratitude for feeding them ever lovingly in her diurnal journey with mother earth.
The blue sky seemed to having a plot with the wind, and the sun to bless her with quietude on the day of this profound mourning. People from all walks of life made a beeline to Mayas house in no time. They got the errand from the kids who ran round the village, in the alleys, in the valleys, even on the untrodden paths, to give the news of the expiry of their community leader.
She graduated from the University of Colombo as far back as 1975, and she also earned her post-graduate qualifications of teaching from the same university. She cut her teeth as a well-qualified teacher immediately after her graduation, and it was proverbially like duck to water. This full-fledged visionary teacher of high calibre was posted to Balangoda Maha Vidyalaya as a graduate teacher, and she proved her mettle by lending her hand to numerous children who came to her feet, enabling them to come off with flying colours.
Teaching was her forte. What I realized from this great teacher is that as doctors, teachers are also not made, they are born. This soft-spoken lady with a great mission in her mind was exemplary to the hilt. Her gait, decent, dress-sense, her witty utterances, and to cap them all, her preparation for lessons made her the epitome of a modern teacher for our era. I humbly feel that it was a great luck bestowed on us to be living in her age.
The teacher is a purveyor of knowledge. Nanda was one of them. Her specialty was Sinhala. She deserves the nations salute for guiding a lot of children in good Sinhala. How she taught Selalihini Sandeshaya was par excellent. She illuminated the posterity under her tutelage like no other. I fail in my duty if dont quote a few lines composed by one of her students in his eulogy for solemn lament.
Selalihiniya hari rasata gayanna
Tawa eka serayak evidin yanna
Another heart-rendering verse is as follows:
Jeevitha pothata ekkarana varatawak
Nivanata yanna pera evidin wathawak
Jataka pothe hari lassana kathwak
Pahada denawa data waeka wathawak
Her visit to Dambadiva, she always said was a dream came true. Her religious fervour was repleting. She breathed the cherished history of her motherland in every inch from Dondra to Point Pedro.
With his soul mate spouse Maya, English teacher methodologist of O/L TV English telecast, presently attached to ACBT and other apex institutes of English teaching at tertiary level.
Her Sinhala expertise blended with Mayas Anglophone disposition made an indelible impact in the locality even their garden creatures would testify.
Ven. Baddegama Samitha Theras one-time bhikku parliament, gushing eulogy condensed the fulfillment of her life and drove home the idea that an epitome of a teacher ought to be of a Nanda
She was born with a silver spoon in the mouth. So, avarice was quite alien to her. She enjoyed in spending for the uplift of the village through generosity. The late M.L. Appuhamy, her businessman father with many a land or her mother, E.J. Kumari Siriwardene, would never have thought that their daughter would have bought such glory to their lineage. When she bade adieu to her impeccable teaching career from Sri Rathnasara College, Baddegama she was only two years shy of four decades of service to her motherland, teaching was her first love.
When I go down memory lane, I could still remember how she treated us many a time on our visits to her simple home with her peculiar smile. She was the tower of strength behind her beloved husband.
When she was born, she was chrysanthemum
When he married Maya, she was chrysanthemum to him
When she ceased to be, she was chrysanthemum to him.
On this eulogistic epitaph let me carve out death not be proud because,
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

Nihal Perera
Man of the people
Nihal Perera was born on June 20, 1944, in Colombo. He had his education at St. Thomas College, at which he excelled in his studies and other activities. He was one of the youngest to enter the profession of Chartered Accountants at the age of 24a remarkable achievement in the 1960s. Thereafter, he became Chief Accountant of the Bogala Graphite Company.
In 1971, during the time of the JVP insurrection, he arranged a series of meetings with the then cabinet ministers Dr. N.M. Perera, T.B. Subasinghe, and Colvin R. de Silva, which finally led to the nationalization of the Graphite industry in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, he was appointed the competent authority of the newly formed state Graphite co-orporation. Using his management skills, he managed to improve its production and exports remarkably, within a very short period. Further, he took action to improve the health and living conditions of the previously neglected nine workers and their families.
Being an intellectual of a rare calibre, Nihal held many prestigious positions at a very young age. He was appointed the Chairman of Bank of Ceylon at the age of 29, and soon afterwards, he was appointed the State Graphite Co-orporations Chairman.
In 1974, Nihal married Sweenitha Subasinghe, the eldest daughter of late Minister T.B. Subasinghe.
Later, he entered active politics, and in 1988, farmed Desha Vimukthi Janatha Party which was considered as one of the radical left parties at that time. Although an Accountant by profession, he was a committed socialist, who was inspired by the teachings of Lenin and Mao Tse-tung. He was a friend of China, Cuba, Libya, Palestine, and many other socialist countries. In fact, he was an internationalist to the core.
During the time of the infamous seventeen-year rule of the United National Party (1977-1994), Nihal was in the fare front of the Pelawatte struggle, anti-water tax campaign, the campaign against the establishment of an Israel Interest section in Sri Lanka, and many other protest campaigns. His involvement in the trade union action in the graphite industry and plantation of agriculture of service sector is noteworthy. During that period, Nihal joined other progressive forces to fight against state oppression and to win back democratic rights of the down-trodden masses.
But quite unexpectedly, his active political life came to an end when he faced his untimely death on March 30, 1994.
Nihals simplicity, kindness, and delight...sense of humour marked every phase of his life. His sudden departure was a personal and political loss to many of us, but he left an indelible mark, and that makes his memory more fragrant.

Yasodha Weligamage
Affectionate soul
She was Yasodha Weligamage. My Loku Aiya s eldest daughter and the eldest niece in our family. To say in short, she was everyones the pet. With happiness, I recall the day she was born. I was at the hostel of Matara convent. My mother came to take me. I was so anxious to see our first niece. Little Yasodha was about eight months, when Loku aiya and Violet akka went to reside at Matara, Pamburana. I was taken out of the hostel at came to stay with them.
It was a happy timeI still remember putting little Yasodha to sleep. I still remember Violet Akka carrying little Yasodha to the gate to greet me when I came from school. She used into jump to my arms. These are sweet memories. Then Loku Aiya was transferred to Badulla and the family went there. She was only one then.
I came to study at Southlands, then Loku Aiya came to Galle and little Yasodha came up to the school going age. She too, was admitted to Southlands.
As far as I can remember, it was I who admitted her to Southlands during the time of Miss Ridge. Then she had another brother and sister. Loku Aiya got transferred to Kurunegala and she had to leave Southlands.
Her childhood days were spent mostly with us. She was with my parents at Hambantota when Loku Aiya was at Badulla. These are the memories I have of loving Yasodha. I used to take her to plays and shows with me. Those were the happy times; she grew up to be a pretty young maiden.
Her marriage with Wimal was a happy one. He was a caring and loving husband as was she a wife. She was blessed with two dutiful, amiable sons: Anuradha and Suranga. Yasodha did her duty by her parents and siblings, and she was loving to her daughters-in-law and us relations.
She was loved by everybody and I never ever addressed her by her name. I always call her Loku Doothat is how her father & mother call her too.
Loku Doo is no more as all good things come to an end. Her family is proud of her, and death will not remove the aura attendant on her for many years to come.
Memories of her will always remain impressed in the minds of all those who knew her. May her journey in Sansara be brief, smooth, with no grief, until she attains Nirvana.
Loving punchi aunty,

Rev. Bro. Raymond Benildus
Great administrator
Rev. Bro. Raymond Benildus FSC entered eternal glory to be with his maker. April 13 was his 13th death anniversary. He was the former Director (1964 - 1973) of St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, which is my alma mater. Bro. Benildus had served in all the prestigious La Sallian institutions and organizations islandwide such as De La Salle College, Mutwal; St. Xaviers College, Mannar; De Mazenod College, Kandana; St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa; and St. Benedicts College, Kotahena.
He had served St Sebastians College, Moratuwa and St Benedicts College, Kotahena more than once. Rev. Bro. Modestus was transferred to St Benedicts and Bro. Benildus was appointed as the Director of the College.
He introduced a number of fundraising projects and also set up a welfare office to collect funds directly from parents. Rev. Bro. Benildus was one of the greatest administrators St. Sebastians College ever had. During this period, parents were requested to pay very reasonable admission fee and monthly donations. Almost single-handed, he managed the income-generating project, especially the college farm, to find the additional funds required to run the college. The new building was extended to accommodate the sport pavilion.
The religious atmosphere in the school was excellent. Being a scholar in oriental languages, Bro. Benildus was keen on improving oriental studies, in keeping with the national culture of Sri Lanka. During the Bro. Benildus era, St. Sebastians produced Duleep Mendis, who at sixteen, captained the St. Sebastians College First Eleven cricket team, scored 1,000 runs in the cricket season, and also captained the Sri Lanka test cricket team.
The last time the college won the Big Match was In 1966, during Bro. Benildus period. Harindra Fernando, who in 1971, was placed fourth in the island in the GCE (A/L) examination, won the UNESCO Gold Medal for the best engineering student of Sri Lanka in 1978 and was in the profession of Mechanical and Aero Space Engineering at Arizzona State University, USA.
My memory moves back to the then nursery class at St. Sebastians College where I started studies in the year 1965 and continued until I sat for the GCE O/L Examination in 1975. I feel that it is Gods special blessing to have studied in the college under Bro. Benildus, who served as the Director during that time.
He helped many a parent in admitting students to the school after having listened to their woes. He was strict on all his students; he was also sympathetic towards them. He was popular among both, present and past pupils. His faithfulness and loyalty to his master Jesus Christ and founder St. De La Salle was immeasurable. His was a legacy of service, fraternity, cordiality, and commitment. Although Bro. Benildus is no more, he is immortal in the hearts and minds of thousands who associated him. Certainly, the La Sallian congregation lost an invaluable son, and a jewel in their crown.

Asia markets close higher on strong US finish
Asia markets were mostly higher on Friday after a strong session in the U.S. amid caution following a suspected terrorist shooting in Paris ahead of the first round of the presidential election at the weekend.
One policeman was killed and two were injured after a gunman opened fire in central Paris on Thursday night.
The shooting took place just before voters head to the polls in a tightly contested presidential race, with centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen leading the pack ahead of the first round of voting with none of the candidates expected to command the 50 percent needed to win outright, leading to a second round runoff on May 7.
Either way, the result of the election is unlikely to result in France leaving the European Union, Mizuho Bank Senior Economist Vishnu Varathan said in a Friday morning note.
A Le Pen victory this round is quite far removed from Frexit risks ... (E)ven if Le Pen makes president, establishing supporters among lawmakers to even get a Frexit referendum off the ground is a long way off. Simply put, Frexit is not an imminent risk in any case.
Euro/dollar eased to trade at $1.0724, higher than the $1.06 levels seen earlier this week. It had earlier climbed to a one-month high of $1.0777.

Asylum seeker from Sri Lanka let himself be tortured with hot iron bars to support his bid to stay in Britain
An asylum seeker allowed himself to be tortured with hot iron bars to support his bid to stay in the UK, judges have ruled.
He claimed five scars on his back were evidence of how he was badly treated by authorities in his native Sri Lanka. But rejecting his claims, the Court of Appeal ruled that he probably consented to the torture in as part of a ruse called self-infliction by proxy or SIBP.
It added that a cooperative and clandestine doctor might have put him under general anaesthetic while the heated iron rods were placed on him.In a 22,000-word appeal ruling, one of the countrys most senior judges, Lord Justice Sales, questioned why the 35-year-old man had not experienced any significant infection as a result of the burning.The judge said an earlier immigration tribunal which threw out the mans asylums claim was justified in highlighting the highly unusual type of scarring as a central implausibility in his account. It also raised doubts about his relationship with the Tamil Tigers and his alleged detention and escape from the country.The man arrived in the UK on a fake passport six years ago before claiming asylum. He is thought to have racked up enormous legal bills at taxpayers expense in his desperate bid to avoid deportation.
He claims that he was detained in the aftermath of a Tamil Tigers attack on the Colombo airport in 2007 over possible links to the organisation.His alleged torture occurred in August 2009, where it was claimed he felt intense pain from the first burn before falling unconscious while receiving other burns.- Daily Mail

Bizarre trick to concealing dark circles under eyes
Nothing screams "I had a rough night" more than those tell-tale dark circles under our eyes. That, and the fact you're mainlining fizzy pop and crisps like there's no tomorrow.
Of course, dark circles are also linked to stress, allergies - even our genetics, and they are notoriously difficult to disguise effectively. As such, there is a plethora of beauty hacks available, ranging from the simple to the extravagant.
There are eye creams, concealers and home-made remedies advising you to pat lemon juice around your eyes (which we're too scared to try). Now there's one doing the rounds which has to be seen to be believed - concealing those pesky shadows with red lipstick.
Wait, what
It might seem like the last thing on earth which would work but beauty writers are touting it as a pretty effective concealer. As Spring St reports, it works because the red tones should cancel out the blue and purple tones under our eyes which make us look so tired.
Application is pretty easy and you can use any shade of red too. You blend the lipstick in a bit, and then apply your regular concealer over it, making sure you blend that in too.
Rather than resulting in a gory-looking mess, the combination of the red lipstick and the light concealer gives a nice pink/peach shade, which gives the appearance of a healthy flush to the tops of the cheeks. In Style

China bowled out for 28
BANGKOK: China were humiliated as they were bowled out for 28 by Saudi Arabia and crashed to a 390-run defeat in a World Cricket League regional qualifier in Thailand on Saturday.
Saudi Arabia piled up 418 all out off their 50 overs before Chinas outclassed batsmen collapsed in just 12.4 overs as extras top scored with 13.
Their total was seven runs fewer than the record low for a full one-day international of 35 made by Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka in 2004.
But it was still more than the record 50-over low score of 18 made by West Indies U19s against Barbados in Guyana in 2007. The Saudis are considered favourites to win the tournament in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai, which is the first step towards qualifying for the 2023 World Cup.
Shahbaz Rasheed made 50 and Mohammad Afzal a century from 91 balls with 13 fours and two sixes.
But it was Saudi captain Shoaib Ali who propelled the innings to 400-plus as he took only 24 balls to reach 50 and made a rapid-fire 91 from just 41 balls with 10 fours and six sixes. Facing the huge total China were shot out by bowling trio Ibrar Ul Haq who took three wickets for eight runs, leg-spinner Imran Arif who bagged three for just two runs and off-spinner Shahbaz Rasheed finished the match with a hat-trick.

Chinese leader urges restraint over North Korea in call with Trump

Chinas president, Xi Jinping, has called onDonald Trumpand the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to exercise restraint as a US aircraft carrier group headed towards the waters off the Korean peninsula the Guardian reported.
Tensions remain high after a war of words between the US andNorth Koreaover the past month, with Trump ordering the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to sail to waters off the Korean peninsula and raising the possibility of military action.
In the second call between Trump and Xi in less than two weeks, Xi urged all sides to temper their actions.
China hopes all parties involved will exercise restraint and avoid doing anything to exacerbate the tense situation on the peninsula, reada summary of the call released by Chinas foreign ministry. Only when the parties involved assume responsibility and move in the same direction can there be a quick resolution to the Korean nuclear issue and denuclearisation of the peninsula.
We are willing to work together with the parties concerned, including the United States, for peace on the Korean peninsula, Xi said.Chinaalso opposes any action that violates UN security council resolutions, the statement said.
China is North Koreas largest trading partner and Trump has repeatedly pressed China to do more to rein in the reclusive state. But China has been reluctant to take drastic action, preferring to maintain a status quo rather than risk a collapse of Kims regime, using North Korea as a buffer with US-allied South Korea.
At the weekend, North Koreathreatened to sink the US aircraft carrierwith a single strike. Pyongyang also detained an American professor as he was preparing to leave the country, officials said on Sunday, bringing the number of US citizens being held to three.
The US has not specified where the carrier group is, but two Japanese destroyers were due to join the Carl Vinson for drills in the western Pacific. South Korea has said it is in discussions with the US navy on holding joint military exercises.
The US vice-president, Mike Pence, who recently visited South Korea, said on Saturday the carrier group would arrive within days.
Last week it emergedthat at the same time that the White House was saying that the Carl Vinson was steaming towards North Korea, the boat was in fact thousands of miles away and heading in the opposite direction.
The North Korean army will celebrate its 85th anniversary on Tuesday and the county has used similar events for nuclear or missile tests in the past.
In a separate call with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Trump and Abe agreed China should play a role in resolving tensions with Pyongyang.
Trump has said he would consider any option, including a military strike, to end North Koreas nuclear provocations. The US and its allies in Asia fear North Korea may be preparing to conduct a sixth nuclear test. Another test could trigger more UN sanctions.
On Sunday the Global Times, a Chinese state-owned newspaper, said another test could result inrestrictions on oil exportsto Pyongyang, an important lifeline for the regime.

Garbage galore
At the Anderson Flats, each of the 40 blocks is provided with 2 chutes on either side for garbage disposal, and there are openings at every floor to dump the garbage. Occupants had to walk up to the closest chute and throw the garbage into the chute at any time during the day or night. The CMC collected the garbage once a week from the entrance to the chute on the ground floor.
Recently the CMC advised occupants to separate the garbage: kitchen waste separately and all other items such as paper, plastic etc separately. If the convenience of the occupants was considered, all that had to be done was to assign one of the chutes on either side for kitchen waste and the other for all other items.
Instead the CMC sealed the openings of the chutes at all floors, and called upon occupants to place their kitchen waste in bins on the ground floor, and to hand over all other items to the collection van which calls over on Wednesdays. Upper floor occupants, some of whom are elderly persons or couples living alone, have been put into great inconvenience as they now have to come down with the garbage and climb the stairs to get back. To make matters worse, in one block, kitchen waste can be deposited only during a specified time of one hour.
Any arrangement to separate the garbage, should not inconvenience occupants and they should not be deprived of the facilities they have enjoyed up to now. Apparently, in areas where the garbage is collected by a private company, there are no complaints.
This may be an issue in other areas served by the CMC as well and it is up to the Condominium Authority to come up with a suitable arrangement which can be followed uniformly in all similar housing schemes.
The CMC may not be sensitive to such concerns, but candidates at the Local Government elections are in for a rude shock, if this problem is not resolved satisfactorily. The chutes have been used since the inception of the scheme. Why should they be sealed now

This is to thank you for the very appropriate comments made on the editorial of April 18 regarding Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake. You have referred to what he has stated regarding the change of government. He makes such impartial statements irrespective of party politics. In today's context the need of the hour is the presence of such leaders for the current society.
Even regarding Meethotamulla tragedy too, the JVP by its leadership has very clearly mentioned not to take political advantage out of such situations considering the period it commenced.

CPC unions to strike over alleged Trinco deal with India
Several Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions were planning to launch an island-wide strike from midnight yesterday against an alleged decision by the government to sign an agreement with India regarding the oil tanks in Trincomalee.
Convener of Trade Union Alliance of the CPC Janaka Rajakaruna told the Daily News that a majority of CPC unions have agreed on the trade union action demanding the government to halt the alleged agreement with India.
Rajakaruna said the proposed agreement will benefit the IOC and will help the Indian Oil company to expand further in the island.
Rajakaruna also stated that the unions will also oppose the handing over of a part of the oil facility operations at the Hambantota port to a Chinese firm. Meanwhile, a senior official at the CPC said the union members have been invited to a meeting chaired by Minister Chandima Weerakkody today to discuss the issues raised by the unions.
He was of the opinion that the union members were not fully aware of the details or benefits which may come Sri Lankas way by agreeing to develop Trincomalee jointly with India.
The CPC official said the minister and high ranking officials of the CPC will explain to union members the details of the proposed agreement and discuss other issues which concern them.
Minister Weerakkody recently said India and Sri Lanka have agreed in principle to jointly develop and operate the oil storage facility located in strategically important Trincomalee.
The minister said this will be a joint venture between the two countries with benefits to both parties. Some are trying to interpret this venture as a sale of state assets. But this is completely false and misleading, he added.
This facility has been idling since 1966. It will now come to use through this joint venture and importantly, the Sri Lankan government will only give these oil tanks on lease, Minister Weerakkody said.
He also explained that the oil tank farm was a property of the United Kingdom until former Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike purchased them back. Speaking on the economic prospects of the joint venture, Minister Weerakkody explained that when the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation gets 10 oil tanks for exclusive use, Sri Lanka will have a guarantee of more oil stocks. All this time, we had only a stock which is enough for 10 days, he said.
Once the facility is jointly developed, we will be entitled to 50 percent of the joint venture company, which is involved in both storage and sale of oil, Minister Weerakkody pointed out.
We will not only be able to sell oil stocks within the country but outside as well, Minister Weerakkody added.

Daniels 75 in vain as Australia win series 4-1
Jehan Daniel scored a fighting 75 off 89 balls but it was not sufficient to bring Sri Lanka victory as they fell short by 23 runs to lose the fifth and final Under 19 Youth ODI to Australia at Hobart on Sunday.
The loss meant that Australia took the five-match series 4-1. Sri Lanka were left chasing 245 for a face-saving victory having already conceded the series to Australia.
But following an opening stand of 53 Sri Lanka were truly on course for a win at 192-4 in the 41st over when Daniels dismissal triggered a collapse and they lost the remaining six wickets for 29 runs to be all out for 221 in 48.5 overs.
Half-centuries from Max Bryant (67), Jason Sangha (59) and Mathew Spoors (65 n.o.) saw Australia reach 244-4 off their 50 overs after winning the toss and electing to bat first.
Scores: Australia (U19) 244-4 in 50 overs (M Bryant 67, J Sangha 59, M Spoors 65 n.o., W Sutherland 20, P Uppal 22 n.o., P Jayawickrama 2/47)
Sri Lanka (U19) 221 in 48.5 overs (N Sumanasinghe 21, V Chaturanga 31, K Mendis 25, J Daniel 75, K Arachchige 36, W Sutherland 3/24, L Pope 3/40, M Spoors 2/24)

The decline of the English novel
At last months award ceremony for the inaugural Republic of Consciousness Prize for small presses, I experienced a flicker of dj vu. Of the four novels recognized by the judges  one winner and three runners-up  only one, Paul Stanbridges Forbidden Line, was by an English author. It had only been a couple of months since the Goldsmiths Prize for innovative fiction was awarded to Mike McCormack for his novel, Solar Bones. That prize has been going for four years, and in that time its winners have been either Scottish (one) or Irish (three). I found myself wondering about the state of the English novel. Are English fiction writers, readers and publishers more risk-averse than their counterparts in Ireland and Scotland Solar Bones won a runners-up prize at the Republic of Consciousness awards, as did another book by an Irish novelist, Anakana Schofields Martin John (which had also been shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize). Why did it fall to two tiny independent publishers  Tramp Press in Dublin and the Buckinghamshire-based And Other Stories  to publish these two formally challenging novels
In the broad historical sweep, the decline of the archetypal English novel, with its descriptive realism, unilinear narrative and conventional sensibility, may be traced all the way back to the middle of the last century. In The Prose Factory: Literary life in England after 1918, the critic D. J. Taylor attributes this partly to the formal innovations of literary modernism, and partly to the horrors of the Second World War: To put it bluntly . . . Belsen, Auschwitz and Katyn need something more than the traditional patternings of character, irony and sentiment to be done justice by art. But if the traditional English novel is no longer the pre-eminent force it once was, its hold on the collective psyche remains strong. The author Neil Griffiths, who founded the Republic of Consciousness Prize, believes there is a fundamental difference in mindset between English and Irish literary cultures when it comes to creativity and experimentation: The three pillars of Irish modernism  Joyce, Beckett and Flann OBrien  pretty much give anyone following permission to try anything as long as the writing is of the highest order. Thats both a liberation and a challenge. The bar is very high indeed, but that can only be good for ambition. Whereas in England, after Virginia Woolf there was a reaction, and the three pillars became Waugh, Powell and Amis  who wrote short novels about the middle and upper classes, ironizing anything approaching high emotion or deep feeling. It had a kind of deadening effect on anyone not of the same sensibility. And anything stylistically challenging was felt to be pretentious.
Local appeal
It is certainly true that much of the most exciting and innovative work seems to be happening on the fringes, away from the mainstream.
Laura Waddell, a writer and a board member of PEN Scotland, reckons outsider status can have an invigorating effect on literary culture. A lot that happens independently in Scotland and Ireland is a necessary response to geographical distance from London-centric literary press and culture, she told me.
When a literary culture is positioned as external but in relation to a bigger and more centralized one  distinguished for all kinds of reasons, including local appeal sales, press and national funding bodies  it may give rise to work that is different in style from its bigger neighbour and conceives itself, in part, as different.
The indie publishing scene is thriving at the moment, and innovation often emerges in that context. Literary culture here is self-aware in national identity, and it is the other.
Lara Williams, whose collection of stories Treats was shortlisted for the Republic of Consciousness Prize, lives in Manchester but is published by the Glasgow-based indie press Freight Books. She recalls: When I first began sending my collection out  at that point, without an agent  publishers with open submission policies did seem to be confined outside of England: Doire Press in West Ireland, Seren Books in Wales and Freight Books in Scotland. So I think there is some more obvious risk-taking and less formalism happening beyond the English publishing scene. That said, I live across the road from the offices of Comma Press, who are putting out works I cant imagine finding a home anywhere else.
The literary critic David Collard has been an enthusiastic supporter of the Republic of Consciousness Prize. He maintains that innovative English fiction is alive and well; the trouble is that small publishers are under-resourced and so it is harder for their novels to get the coverage they deserve. Im not sure that too much emphasis should be placed on prizes and prize-winners when it comes to diagnosing the state of the anglophone novel. For my money the best recent novels are Paul Stanbridges Forbidden Line, Harry Parkers Anatomy of a Soldier and Eimear McBrides The Lesser Bohemians, which is set in London. The latter two both came from Faber, who seem to have rediscovered their modernist mojo. But most of the books that snag my attention and admiration seem to come from tiny independent publishers.
With small presses its not all about marketing, and focus groups, and risk aversion. While small presses may be a way ahead in that sense, the writers dont get much out of it  tiny advances (if any), modest sales and little financial support. Ive sometimes made the perhaps glib analogy with other hipster enterprises  artisan cheese, vinyl records, craft beers  in that indie publishers are operating on a shoestring for a very savvy and encouragingly substantial audience.
Indeed, there seems to be a direct correlation between scale and risk-taking. Joanna Walsh, the award-winning author of experimental fiction (Vertigo) and creative nonfiction (Hotel), told me: Its chiefly small-scale indie publishers and imprints such as And Other Stories, Galley Beggar, Fitzcarraldo, Influx, Tuskar Rock, that consistently publish the most innovative fiction in English. Of these, only Galley Beggar and Influx publish mainly English writers, with the others devoted largely to literature in translation, and from other English-speaking countries. In a similar vein, Eileen Battersby, the literary correspondent of the Irish Times, observes that the novels of ideas tend to be the novels in translation.
She cites Mathias Enards Compass, which was longlisted for this years Man Booker International Prize, as one of a number of bold, adventurous works that have come to the attention of anglophone readers in recent years.
The imaginative storytelling and narrative artistry of these books are well able to deal with the demands of having to move between two languages.
We should acknowledge the ability of gifted literary translators such as Celia Hawksworth, Anthea Bell, Don Bartlett, Sam Garrett, Frank Wynne and Sophie Hughes, and also look at whats coming from China, Korea and Japan. Istros in particular is publishing outstanding work from the Balkan region.
These books are exciting. Theyre not predictable or formulaic, as is so much of the hyped fiction coming from the big American and English publishers.
Youre really talking about imagination versus banal commercialism.

Meet Sebastian, a French bulldog, and Luna, his Pomeranian paramour. The four-legged lovers are stars of the Instragram account Sebastian Loves Luna, run by their owner, photographer Emily Abril.
Ms Abril told Buzzfeed the dogs got engaged last June (details of how this took place are regrettably sketchy) - and the event was celebrated recently with an engagement photo shoot in Washington DC, timed to coincide with the bloom of the citys famous cherry blossom trees.
Ms Abril told BuzzFeed that the dogs, who have close to 60,000 followers on Instagram, are already like an old married couple.
They are, simply put, fashionistas in love in DC, she added. Luna adores Sebastian completely even when he sometimes doesnt return the affection. He also is very much her protector and will push other dogs out of her way if they get to close to her.
Sebastian and Lunas wedding has been penciled in for either autumn 2017 or spring 2018.

EU Parliamentary group opposed to Lanka tariff concession
An European Parliamentary group has tabled a resolution in the EU Parliament against granting the GSP+ tariff concession to Sri Lanka for its exports to the 28- member bloc, citing concern over Colombos worryingly slow progress on key issues like human rights.
The motion if approved by 376 out of 751 members would see the non granting of the concession, which would have made Sri Lankan exports to the European Union (EU) cheaper and contributed to its export growth vital to boost external reserves.
The resolution will be taken up at the plenary session to be held next week.The resolution contends existing breaches of Human Rights in Sri Lanka raise concerns about the appropriateness of granting the GSP+ status while there is inadequate real progress.
The process of repealing and replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has not yet been accomplished.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has noted a number of shortcomings in the ILO conventions.
Sri Lankan government is suspect of not adequately tackling the culture of impunity by rewarding military officials accused of human rights violation with government positions, the resolution says. The Sri Lankan government sources said they were working on meeting the EU conditions on replacing the PTA with new legislation to meet international standards.
However, the EU resolution says the progress has been worryingly slow. The current government was keen to restore the facility after it was stopped by the EU in 2010 citing grave human rights abuses and violations related to International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
Sri Lanka was granted 18 months by a UNHRC resolution in October 2015 to initiate a credible investigation into the nearly three-decades long civil war with the LTTE.
It has sought two more years from the UN Human Rights Council to probe the alleged war crimes committed during the conflict with the LTTE.According to the UN figures, up to 40,000 civilians were killed by the security forces during the former President Mahinda Rajapaksas regime that brought an end to the conflict with the defeat of LTTE.
The GSP+ is a component of the EU Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) for developing countries.It offers additional trade incentives to developing countries already benefiting from GSP to implement core international conventions on human and labour rights, sustainable development and good governance. - PTI

## Title: Fair for taxi fare
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Fair for taxi fare
The modern marketing gurus tell us that state regulations are anti-innovative and anti-competitive. They argue that rules and regulations are unnecessary because market forces can effectively regulate industries.
While regulation may not be beneficial for some industries, history has proven time and again that the taxi industry is different. An unregulated taxi industry puts passengers in danger financially and physically, and leads to an unhealthy business environment. But smart regulations ensure all have access to safe, affordable and timely door-to-door transportation. The debate over why taxis should be regulated is now heating up in Sri Lanka as alternative newcomers like Uber gain popularity in cities like Colombo.
Benefits
Technically, regulations ensure that taxis are safe. This involves protecting the passengers and other road users in matters concerning their physical safety. It implies regulation of vehicle standards and driver standards.
In addition, regulations ensure that the driver is qualified and remain qualified. For example, in New York city, every taxi vehicle needs to undergo a 200-point inspection, three times a year. In order to become a NYC taxi driver, one must meet many conditions including going to a taxi school and pass a tough exam to show you are proficient in safe driving and also have excellent knowledge of New York City streets.
Another reason for regulation is passenger protection. The regulations prevent operators in a strong bargaining position from exploiting passengers. The appropriate regulatory measures in these circumstances will be compulsory metering and the setting of maximum fares and/or fare registration plus the advertisement of the fare on the side of the cab.
Dimensions
These are the main benefits. Then comes the implementation of the regulatory system. There are three important dimensions of a regulation mechanism, namely the conferment of monopoly rights, the imposition of entry conditions and the control of fares.
The monopoly power granted to taxis is the exclusive right to ply for hire. Although this has no legally water-tight definition, it is usually understood as the right to search physically for business in the vehicle within a defined area. Such monopoly carries responsibilities, also  such as guaranteeing comfort and safety of passenger.
Imposition of entry conditions may include, limiting the age of vehicles used, insistence that drivers have a thorough knowledge of the area and adequate driving experience, or technical vehicle specifications. Another condition on entry commonly applied is some form of quantity control, usually a restriction on the total number of licensed vehicles.
The third dimension - fares control can take two forms, namely specification of the level of fares and regulations concerning the fares structure. Control of the level of fares can range from laying down the maximum permissible fare or setting a minimum fare to specifying the actual fare which must be charged.
In an ideal situation, when you get into a taxi anywhere, you should know that the driver has the required training standards, that his vehicle has been regularly inspected, he is licensed to carry passengers and his vehicle has proper commercial insurance. As an added level of security, the taxis location is typically monitored by GPS.
The enforcement of rules, fares and accountability in the taxi industry should be decided by the respective Provincial Councils. That gives the public a significant measure of control over the industry.
Different types
Today, we find different types of taxis operating in Sri Lanka: three wheelers, mini cars, cars, luxury cars. The major percentage are the three-wheelers. And, we also have Uber, an international service provider, calling themselves as ride sharing network, who operates through the smartphone connectivity. Uber maintains that they are just a technology company connecting passengers and drivers. It, therefore, assumes a limited amount of responsibility for the services customers receive.
Uber types are generally referred to in U.S. jurisdictions as Transportation Network Companies (TNCs).
Uber argues that passengers will pay less than other service providers, while drivers will earn more. But the facts dont support that. Ubers fares vary according to demand. The high fares - a product of Ubers demand-based dynamic pricing model where users are charged more during high demand periods, and comparatively less when its slow -have sparked outrage and threats from users to revert to using an old fashioned, government-regulated fare system.
Policy statement
This writer believes what we really need is a national policy for the regulation of taxi industry, including three-wheelers and online ride-sharing organisations. The following are few of his random thoughts.
1. Market definition - The Transport Ministry should prepare a national policy for taxi and private hire services. Once it is approved, each Provincial Council should be given complete authority over the taxi business within each province. Taxi services, as a whole, must be regarded and regulated as a public utility.(In the case of three-wheelers, the organisations representing the interests of three-wheeler owners can act as licensees).
2. Licensing  Provincial Councils can issue license to taxi operators. The license must be displayed in a prominent place.
3. Economy vs deluxe - New policy has to decide on the categories of taxis, whether to keep the present structure as it is or to change.
4. Fare regulation - The fare for each type of taxi should be decided by the Transport Ministry of the Central Government, who will suggest minimum as well as maximum fares to be charged. While fixing the tariffs, the Ministry may engage the services of transport economists and related experts who would be able to provide a scientific approach to determination of tariffs and permit charges. Further, for pre-booked trips over 50 km (return), prearranged half-day or day tours, the tariffs should not be regulated and be allowed to be determined by market dynamics.
5. Fare meters - Either the electronic fare meter or mobile fare application may be used. However, the algorithms used for distance and fare calculation, should be checked and validated for accuracy. Quality of these software applications should also be audited by from an agency authorized by Central Government. The meters needed to be checked by an Authority at least twice a year.
6. Surge pricing - New policy should recommend range bound dynamic pricing to be allowed to effectively match demand and supply. The passenger should be notified about the surged tariff when he places the order. The maximum tariff may be permitted up to 50 per cent of the tariff. To increase the availability of taxis during the night time, maximum tariff is allowed up to two times that of minimum tariff from 12 midnight to 5 am in morning. This would ensure adequate supply during peak hours and at night.
7. Drivers regulation  Provincial Councils may place appropriate cap on the duty hours of drivers in the interest of road safety and in consonance with labour laws. Drivers must also be at least twice a year to check their fitness to drive. Any complaints received against drivers must be quickly and effectively dealt with.
8. All licensees/drivers must abide by all relevant statutes. A driver must have a clean record and be of good moral character and taxi licensees will be responsible for the quality of drivers, their police verification, and their conduct with passengers.
9. Licensed organisations must establish and maintain a call centre or a web portal. Licensees will be required to maintain a minimum fleet of 200 taxis (or 500 three-wheelers) and taxis must be fitted with a panic button so that, in case of any distress, a signal will be transmitted to a control centre of the licensee and then to the nearest police station. A GPS or GPRS system must also be maintained in order to keep constant communication with a central control unit of the taxi service.
It is clearly important that our taxi services should operate efficiently and that the services provided should meet the aspirations of the users. Whatever policy structure finally decided upon, should enable the development of innovative services to contribute towards achieving public objectives that are characterised by acceptable waiting times, high levels of safety and quality (including reliability of service), and affordable prices.

Foreign coach Pietersz failed in his task  SLTA
The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) said that the foreign coach Eric Pietersz, whom they had got down to form and train a national pool had failed in his task and they had decided to terminate his contract.
We started in February, 2016 with 36 players who were the three top seeded players of U-12, U-14 and U16 but within three months only 24 players were left in the program, revealed SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick.
We amended the program and gave him 63 players (U-10, U-12, U14 and U16). The new group included SL no. one Janali Manamperi (U-16), Vibudha Wijebandara (U-16), Tania Doloswala (U-12) and Apna Perera (U-12) to restart in May, but Pietersz failed again to produce the expected outcome, he said.
All four top seeded players left the program and by October 31, 33 players deserted the program. So as the national governing body we decided to terminate Pieterszs services. There was no point in wasting so much money on a program that does not produce good results.
We were promised money for Pieterszs coaching package by the Sports Ministry before we started the program, but we did not get a cent from the Ministry. Thereby SLTA and the parents had to bear Pieterszs monthly package of Rs. 800,000. If our need is not fulfilled, it is an utter waste to keep him.
Patrick alleged that there are some influential parents who want to keep the coach just because his coaching is good for their children.
They took this matter to the Sports Minister and we were told the minister will grant some money to carry on with the program. For this we had to provide two courts. Anyway Pieterszs contract will end in April. We are going to convince the Sports Minister with all the stats on this matter and stop this waste of money and time, Sohan explained.

France elections: Macron and Le Pen through to run-off

The centrist Emmanuel Macron will face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency on 7 May, near-final results show.
With 96% of votes counted from Sunday's first round, Macron has 23.9% with Ms Le Pen on 21.4%.
Opinion polls have consistently predicted Macron defeating his rival in the run-off.
The two fought off a strong challenge from centre-right Franois Fillon and hard-left Jean-Luc Mlenchon.
Whoever wins the second round, the voting marks a shift away from the decades-long dominance of leftist and centre-right parties in French politics.
Macron cements his rise
While Le Pen has long been seen as likely to make the second round, Emmanuel Macron's rise has been swift. The BBC's Hugh Schofield says Macron's likely victory is the story of the evening.
He told cheering supporters "we have changed the face of French political life in one year", calling for people to rally against "nationalists".
A former banker, Macron served as economy minister under current President Francois Hollande, quitting to launch a new party.
He has never stood for election before and if he wins would become France's youngest-ever president.
A pro-European, he has called for gradual deregulation of France's economy and a multi-billion dollar public investment plan.
Le Pen hails 'historic' result
As the results came in, Le Pen called herself "the candidate for the people", saying that the "survival of France" was at stake.
"The first step... has been taken," she said. "This result is historic."Le Pen and Macron 'in French run-off'
Le Pen leads the Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant National Front party. She has attempted to soften the party's tone and brought big gains in the 2015 regional elections.
She has urged a shake-up of France's relations with the EU, calling for negotiations followed by a referendum.
Le Pen also wants immigration to be slashed and the closure of "extremist" mosques.
At times, Emmanuel Macron's campaign HQ felt like an extremely polite rave.
During the long wait for the candidate to come and speak, loudspeakers played techno music. Volunteers holding French flags swayed; some chanted "Macron President". Most crammed towards the front to get a better look at their candidate.
Macron himself came to cheers. But the campaign supporters inside the arena were not his main audience.
His victory speech was a pre-presidential address, directed towards the rest of the country that did not vote for him. He was sober, sombre, and emotional only when he spoke of his wife's support.
After he left, the crowd drifted away. The DJ played Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire. In the street at night, as I waited to head back into central Paris, I saw no celebrations, no-one honking their car horns. There is still a second round to fight.
Defeated rivals back Macron
Macron is widely seen as favourite in the final round of voting, and in a sign of the uphill struggle Le Pen faces he soon won high-profile endorsements.
Admitting defeat, Franois Fillon, whose campaign was rocked by corruption allegations, said there was "no other choice" but to vote for Macron.
He polled about 20%, slightly ahead of Jean-Luc Mlenchon.
Benoit Hamon, the candidate of President Hollande's Socialist Party said "I encourage everyone to fight as hard as they can to fight the extreme right, and to fight for Macron".
He endured a difficult night, polling only just over 6%.
Both Germany and the EU also offered praise for Macron.
Turnout nationally appears to be similar to the last election in 2012, at about 80%. Almost 47 million people were eligible to vote.
Nearly 60,000 police and soldiers were deployed across the country to secure polling,with France still reelingfrom the shooting of a policeman on the Champs Elysees.

The collected garbage was transported to the Garbage Recycling Centre in the Veyangoda area at a cost of Rs 21,000 per tipper lorry to the Panadura Urban Council.
The Panadura Garbage Collecting Centre is filled with garbage at present.
The number of PHI officers deployed in the area is inadequate, the public complain.
This year, over 250 dengue patients were reported from the area, they said.

Gatlin trumps De Grasse, Thompson shines in World Rela ys
NASSAU AFP April23, 2017Evergreen American sprinter Justin Gatlin struck gold when he anchored his team to victory at the IAAF World Relays in Nassau on Saturday, while double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson shone for Jamaica.
The battle between Gatlin, the 35-year-old 2004 Olympic 100m champion who has served two doping bans, and Usain Bolt's self-professed successor Andre de Grasse did not play out, the Canadian deprived of the chance to run his leg after a botched handover by his teammates.
De Grasse, a three-time medallist at the Rio Olympics, had cocked his head over towards Gatlin three times before turning on the afterburners to edge the American in the heats.
But there was to be no showboating come the final at a breezy, half-full Thomas A. Robinson stadium as Aaron Brown fluffed his handover to Brendon Rodney.
The US were not out of danger, however, with Britain looking to be ahead as Gatlin took the baton from Ronnie Baker after slick passovers between Leshon Collins and Mike Rodgers.
But Englishman Danny Talbot failed to hit his mark and Gatlin had a free run in for 38.43sec, eyes glued on the big screen in near bewilderment as Barbados took silver at a distant 39.12 and China bronze (39.22).
I'm proud of my guys, the team, said Gatlin, dubbing himself the official track vampire for his longevity.
They were hungry, not nervous or jittery. Gatlin added that the result was perfect ahead of the August world championships in London.
We wanted to prepare ourselves, saying let's have smooth handoffs, be as fast as we can for April, he said.
We want to come across the line first in August as we did tonight and we want to be as successful as possible.
I didn't realise Great Britain and Canada didn't get the stick off so I was running with 20 metres to the line thinking 'hey, where's everyone at!'. - Thompson the anchor - Thompson, who won double gold in Rio last year, was afforded a rousing welcome as she safely led her Jamaican teammates to victory in the women's 4x200m. The 24-year-old anchored her team also including Jura Levy, Shericka Jackson and Sashalee Forbes home in a championship record of 1min 29.04sec, Germany (1:30.68) snatching silver from the United States by 0.21.
There was no pressure, said Thompson. We came on the track and do what we do. The US defended their women's 4x800m relay title in first final of the night, Laura Roesler and Charlene Lipsey pulling away in the final two legs after teammates Chanelle Price and Chrishuna Williams were involved in an early nip-and-tuck battle with Australia.
I've had the pleasure of making all three teams that have won here in the Bahamas, said Price, whose opening leg of 2:01.73 was the quickest run on the night.
I knew we had a target on our backs and that all the other teams wanted to take the crown from us. We also wanted to set the tone for the USA. Belarus eventually edged the Australian quartet into third thanks to a strong anchor leg by Maryna Arzamasova, the 2015 world champion in Beijing.
Despite Olympic 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo running a scorching first leg, the Bahamas failed to progress to the final of the women's 4x400m. France, with European indoor champion Floria Guei running anchor, also failed to qualify.
There was also no such luck for the Jamaican men's 4x100m quartet, missing Bolt and late withdrawal Asafa Powell, as the precision needed for baton passovers was highlighted in their first-round race.
Third leg runner Jevaughan Minzie bolted before Kemar Bailey-Cole could get the baton anywhere near to him, leaving anchor leg Yohan Blake, the 2011 world 100m champion and double 2012 Olympic silver medallist behind Bolt, with his head in his hands. That leaves the Jamaicans needing to post a top-16 qualifying time for the London worlds by July 23.
Sunday's action sees the men compete in the 4x200m, 4x400m and 4x800m and the women in the 4x100m and 4x400m, while there will also be a mixed-sex 4x400m relay, handing Miller-Uibo a second chance to shine in front of her raucous home support.

Global march for science to fight alternative facts
US: Thousands of people joined a global March for Science on Saturday with Washington the epicenter of a movement to fight against what many see as an assault on facts by populist politicians.
US President Donald Trump himself passed dozens of protesters on his way to visit wounded soldiers at a military hospital.
Stop denying the earth is dying, one sign visible from Trumps motorcade read.
Despite rain, protesters gathered around the Washington Monument for a festive day of music, speeches and teach-ins by scientists disturbed by the rise of so-called alternative facts around crucial issues like climate change following Trumps election.
We have no Planet B, read one of the signs. Many demonstrators sported Keep Our Science Great caps as they arrived from around the country on Earth Day to highlight the importance of science to daily lives. Protesters marched to the US Capitol to carry their pro-science message.
Science is political but it is not partisan. Science serves all of us. Together we can -- dare I say it -- save the world! Lets march! declared a television personality, Bill Nye the Science Guy, who currently heads the Planetary Society.
The movement was echoed in hundreds of events across the United States and around the world, from Sydney to Accra.
At a time when the Earth has marked three consecutive years of record-breaking heat, and ice is melting at an unprecedented rate at the poles, risking massive sea level rise in the decades ahead, some marchers said it was more important than ever for scientists to communicate and work toward solutions to curb fossil fuel emissions. In London, hundreds of people marched from the Science Museum to the Houses of Parliament, holding signs with messages like Science is Sexy and Less Invasions, More Equations.
The London rally was attended by actor Peter Capaldi, who plays TVs time-travelling hero of science, Dr Who.
In Ghana, organizers used the day for a teach-in at a beachside hotel in Accra about environmental issues of local concern such as the impact of plastic waste on the environment.
Its killing our fish, we have flooding in our communities, we have a rise of environmental diseases, said Cordie Aziz, an American activist involved in plastics recycling.
Vocal protesters in Sydney wearing white lab coats called on politicians to support the scientific community. We need thinkers not deniers, read one banner.
Demonstrators turned out across Australia, in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and other cities, as well as Wellington and Auckland in New Zealand.
In this day and age, theres so much fake news and alternate facts going around that its important to remember that science is what has built the society we know today, Parissa Zand, who was at the Sydney march with her molecular biologist mother, told AFP.
Protestors in major university cities in Europe posted pictures on Twitter of marches in Bonn, Helsinki, Munich and Stockholm. - AFP

Hearthwarming!
We had Brangelina from Hollywood and we have Saifeena from Bollywood. Meet Dilzanne from Sri Lanka! Former supermodel and Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe 2005 Rozanne Diasz Leanage and her husband Dilruk Leanage dubbed themselves with this portmanteau when they tied the knot in 2010. She is a fashionista and he is a businessman but their life flowed smoothly despite being engaged in two different spheres. Rozannes doting husband Dilruk tells us that it is being at home and close to her family that really makes his wife tick.
Rozanne in a few words
She is a very energetic, loving, and a beautiful wife.
Greatest strength
Our children are her greatest strength. We have two children: Raeanne who is 10 years and Zach who is five years. She simply dotes on them and manages everything well.
An alternative profession for Rozanne
She would have made a good sportswoman. She has played basketball for the national team so I believe that she could have gone far in that sector.
She is the one
We met in church so I believe that it is a match made by God. It is difficult to describe my first impression about her She was different from anyone I met in my life. I realized this difference the first time I laid eyes on her. We began going out and I got to know what a beautiful person she is on the inside. This made me fall for her and choose her as my life partner.
Romance
Though we have been married for nearly seven years and are busy parents we make time for the two of us whenever we can. We go out for dinner once in a while. However we do not stay out very late because she is perticular about getting to the childrens side soon.
I was not a responsible person before marriage. I was carefree and adjusting to a family life was not easy for me. Every experience was new for me and even when she was pregnant I was waiting to see the childs face without knowing what kind of duties I have to take on as a father. Our daughter was born early morning. The greatest gift that Rozanne has given me is our two children. Now that we have a son and daughter we feel like our family is complete.
The family person
Rozanne is wonderful with the kids. Family comes first for her no matter what. That is why she loves staying at home. She manages all the childrens activities and is a very dedicated mother. She cuts back her work a bit even and tends to give more of herself to the family. She is also close to my parents and gets along with them wonderfully.
The public figure
Since Rozanne is a celebrity people walk up to her and talk to her wherever we go. I am use to that now. I dont mind it when they walk up to say Hi or pose for a picture with her.
Free time
Rozanne is very much a home bird. Any free time she gets, she enjoys staying at home. She loves being around the kids and me when we all get some free time. Our schedules are normally hectic during the school days when the kids have to go to school and there are classes to take part in during weekends. I drop them off at St Bridgets and The British School in the morning on my way to work and she picks them up later and takes them for classes. So any free time we get we try to spend it at home doing nothing in particular. It is just a day of togetherness spent at home.
Holidaying
We go out of Colombo when we get a holiday. We love to explore the country so we visit different places rather than have one or two favourite holiday destinations. We go to foreign countries for vacations as well. We have been to Singapore, Malaysia and Bali so far. We visit India regularly because I have some good friends over there.
Foodwise
We have a maid to do the cooking but Rozanne whips up a dish now and then. I love the dhal curry she makes. She makes a delicious pol sambol too. Attending functions is a part of our lifestyle so we eat at such places. Sometimes we eat out. We are adventurous in that sense because we love tasting different kinds of food. We might go to an expensive hotel on one occasion and a small eatery the next time.
One thing Rozanne dislikes about Dilruk
She does not like it when I have to go out late in the night.
Irritations
When I lose my cool it irritates her a bit. She is also quick tempered but cools down fast. When we get angry  we really get angry! However within two hours everything has cooled off. We do not discuss matters which we disagree on in front of the kids. What generally happens after we have had a bad argument is that I go off somewhere to be by myself. We talk it over during the night and the next day it is as if the argument has not taken place! We do not harbor any grudges.
Shared passion
Food! We are both gastronomic adventurers when it comes to tasting new types of food. Rozanne is a fan of Japanese food. I also love Japanese dishes so we have no problem picking out what kind of cuisine we want to visit. We do not have a favourite dish but we like things like salmon dishes made the Japanese way. Believe it or not, I was not into seafood  especially fish - before marriage but my taste changed after spending a few months with her.
We go to the gym and go for morning walks to maintain our figures. Though we are both foodies we follow a healthy lifestyle and food choices. We try to eat less towards night time. Rozanne loves chocolates. She simply has to have them. I eat chocolates too but do not crave for them like her.
Poles apart
We differ from what we engage in. She does her fashion related work and I let her handle those things without getting involved. Likewise she does not meddle with my business affairs. However we are supportive towards each others professional goals just by being there, standing by each others side.
Habitswise Rozanne likes to read books  autobiographies and biographies of well known figures in particular. I am not a bookworm. I leave her to it and watch TV instead.
One change
Rozanne is a workaholic. She hardly takes a break when she is on the go. If it was up to me I would see that she does less so that she does not tire herself too much.
Rozanne is particular about
Neatness. Everything has to be in order for her. She is concerned about tidiness too. This is difficult with the children because they are still very young. They might do as she instructs them then but leave stuff around later. Rozanne also encourages the children towards studies expecting the best possible grades from them.
The unkonown side of Rozanne
Rozanne is pretty much an open book so there is nothing much that is unknown about her. Many people think that she might be proud but she is a very down to earth person. You have to meet and speak to her to realize this.
The public has this conception that models and beauty queens are so full of themselves and how they look that they do not dedicate themselves to their families. This does not go with Rozanne because she is very much a family person.

Indian farmers suspend Delhi protest

Drought-hit farmers in India have suspended a protest, after an assurance that their demands would be met.
More than 100 farmers from southern Tamil Nadu state had mounted an eye-catching protest in the capital, Delhi, more than a month ago.
They brandished human skulls, held live mice in their mouths, shaved their heads, and slashed their hands.
They were demanding waivers on farm loan repayments and relief funds, among other things.
Reports say that the farmers, who had been camping in a makeshift tent near Delhi's Jantar Mantar observatory for 40 days, called off their protest on Sunday after an assurance from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E Palaniswami that their demands would be met.
The farmers union said they would resume their protest if their demands were not met by May 25.
Tamil Nadu is facing its worst farming crisis in decades because of lack of water due to poor rainfall, low crop prices, and dwindling access to formal credit.
More than 50 debt-stricken farmers have taken their lives in drought-affected districts since October, according to officials. A local farmers association insists the number of farm-related suicides and death of farmers is more than 250.
The farmers are demanding ample drought relief funds, pensions for elderly farmers, a waiver on repayments of loans, better prices for their crops and the interlinking of rivers to irrigate their lands.

He said as a short term measure, the garbage dump should be stabilized to ensure there would not be further collapses. Before the onset of the monsoon the shape of the dump should be streamlined and the base should be covered with polythene. As a secondary measure, the shape of the dump should be made symmetrical with a broad base to ensure proper distribution of the gravity.
The experts group also proposed long term measures to remove the dump by adopting 3-R system of reduce, reuse and recycle.
President Sirisena thanked the Japanese Experts Group for undertaking a comprehensive study within days of the disaster and said that the Japanese expertise would be useful to solve the major issue of garbage in Sri Lanka. He pointed out that although the Meetotamulla disaster began as a human tragedy, now the garbage has become a political issue. He said the need for a lasting solution to the issue and sought continued support from Japan for this endeavour.

Kandy dump under probe
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has dispatched a team of officials to the Kandy Gohagoda dump site to examine whether there is an imminent threat of garbage mound collapsing under pressure at the site.
NBRO Landslide Research and Risk Management Division Director R M S Bandara yesterday said the team would make the necessary recommendations today to the authorities following the study. He also said the Japanese expert group that arrived in the country to study the Meethotamulla dump site might also join the research activities.
In the wake of Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse, geologists and environmentalists also cautioned the possibility of a landslide at the Gohagoda dump site to which the Kandy Municipal Council dump garbage.
About 100 tons of garbage collected daily within the municipality is being dumped at this site and it has already reached its capacity. Peradeniya University Geological Department Prof Athula Senaratne warned of a possible collapse of the dump with the rains.
There are several slopes in the area where the dump is located. With the rains, a landslide is possible in such slopes, he said.
The geologist pointed out that this poses an environmental threat to the Mahaweli River that flows nearby. The NBRO official said all these claims would be inspected during the study and an official announcement would be made thereafter.
When asked whether the Japanese Expert Group intimated their findings to the NBRO following the site visit at Meethotamulla dump yard, Bandara said the expert group would meet the NBRO officials today for a discussion before finalizing the report in this regard.
Meanwhile, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S. S. Miyanawala said the report of property damages assessment carried out in Meethotamulla would be submitted this week. He noted that compensations would be paid as per these estimations. He added that the illegal occupants in the area would not receive this compensation, but added that they would still be entitled to other allowances and relief provided by the government.

Kelani Saviya recognised as one of the best CSR programs in SL
Kelani Cables PLC's joint CSR Program Kelani Saviya which served the youth of the country by producing professional electricians continuously for the past 10 years was further extended for a period of five years by the Kelani Cables management and the Peradeniya University administration.
The agreement was signed between Kelani Cables PLC Director, CEO Mahinda Saranapala and Vice Chancellor of the Peradeniya University Prof Upul B Dissanayaka on Friday at the Senate House of the Peradeniya University.
Kelani Saviya over the past 10 years has been able to deliver a yeoman service to the society, opined Vice Chancellor of the Peradeniya University Prof Dissanayaka addressing the gathering at the agreement signing ceremony. He emphasized the need of giving a methodical scientific training to employees of different trade fields in Sri Lanka in order to generate professional tradesman. "They know what they do but they don't know why they do it. We have a social responsibility to give an answer to that. This is one of the outcomes of that, Prof Dissanayaka emphasized. The VC said his understanding was that the Kelani Saviya programme which was extended for five years should be continued forever and was the responsibility of the University of Peradeniya (UoP) and as a well established private organization, Kelani Cables to ensure that it happens as a social responsibility.
Prof Dissanayaka said this CSR should not be restricted to the electricity filed only but be extended to other fields as agriculture, electronics etc as well and requested the corporate sector to take necessary steps to do it. The vice chancellor assured his fullest corporation for such moves. "I will be behind and helping you. This is the way forward for universities and private sector. Every ware in the world this is taking place. So we have to follow that," the Don insisted. The VC appreciated the services rendered by Prof Janaka Ekanayake who initiated the program and Kelani Cable officials who got involved in it from the beginning.
Kelani Cables PLC Director, CEO Mahinda Saranapala speaking at the event termed the occasion, "Signing this for the third time after completing 10 years," as a historic day for Kelani Cables. Saranapala said a few things that they learnt over the years were the realization that they have done something for the society. He said one of the classic examples of the first batch was how one of the Kelani Saviya students had explained how he got into the habit of studying because he had come into the university environment and subsequently had managed to pass several exams and climb the corporate ladder.

A kinder, gentler World!
In todays world there are various types of problems. The destructive attitude of the people is due to their being unkind to others. Countries wage war against each other just to show their power by the usage of deadly weapons to destroy valuable heritage. Thus we see lot of terrorists everywhere in the world who cause lot of damage to world peace. Due to the ongoing wars and conflicts with Nations, thousands of people are made refugees and are displaced.
The solution for all these disturbances is that people must start realising the Human Values in them. If they try to understand and start practising them, then there will be only PEACE. Human Values are virtues that guides us. They have the effect of bonding, comforting, reassuring, and procuring serenity.
Human Values are universal and important consideration should be taken when interacting with other people of different Nations. These values help to create bonding between people of different Nationalities, race, religion, beliefs and culture. All the different religions in the World contain the value- LOVE for a good peaceful life. The value of LOVE is the undercurrent of all the other values. LOVE in THOUGHT is TRUTH ( honesty). LOVE in ACTION is RIGHT CONDUCT( right behaviour). It is a known fact that the correct thing done will be appreciated. LOVE in FEELING is PEACE and LOVE in UNDERSTANDING is NON-VIOLENCE. If we practice non-violence, there will be peace. Wars are raging in every direction. The Earth becomes an enormous battle-field. Innocent people, animals and plants are dying. Forests are being burnt down making an imbalance in the nature. The result is earthquakes, tsunami , excess heat, floods etc.
Values are generally regarded as the moral standards of human behaviour in the society. They play a vital role , for they are said to be the basis for the cultural development and preservation of cultural heritage. Hence everyone should follow the human values. These attributes include honesty, trustworthiness, diligence, discipline, fairness, love, peace, justice, care for one another and being mindful of the environment. It is absolutely compulsory and will make the place we live a better place with mutual understanding , happiness and peace. Generally, human values are highly encouraged in Society. These values are passed from one generation to another. People with excellent human values
are usually held in high esteem, admired and rewarded. The traits are important especially in leaders and people in influential positions.
Now lots of countries are introducing value based education with the school curriculum. When it is introduced in the tender age it will definitely be practised by the children as a part of their life. It is the education for LIFE. This education not only compliments but also completes academics guiding students to serve society with morality and integrity.
If there is righteousness in the HEART
There will be beauty in CHARACTER
If there is BEAUTY in CHARACTER,
There will be harmony in the HOME.
If there is HARMONY in the HOME
There will be ORDER in the NATION.
When there is ORDER in the NATION
There will be PEACE in the WORLD.

Mattel to stimulate growth in Sri Lankas Toy Industry
Mattel, a multinational toy manufacturer has identified Sri Lanka as a key market for growth.
In a recent presentation to Mattels local partners South Asia Country Manager Ishmeet Singh outlined the toy companys vision for Sri Lanka.
Mattel highlighted its commitment to developing and growing the toy market in Sri Lanka that will ensure the availability of quality, safe toys that aid early childhood learning and development as well as help address the threat of counterfeit and unsafe toys that have seen a recent influx in the country.
Sri Lanka has all the necessary factors for growth and is only in need of focused investment and development to reach its full potential. We see Sri Lanka as an important market in our growth plan. Towards this end, we are working with our partners on the ground on creating demand utilizing local insights.
This means getting the product line architecture right, in terms of design, accessibility and affordability, said Singh.
Recent studies have reiterated the critical role that toys play in the overall growth and development of children, beyond providing entertainment.
Playing with toys is invaluable to the early development of children, and in later stages, toys have been found to also drive creativity and innovation. Most importantly aiding early development in children today will help create a new generation of entrepreneurs, leaders and builders of tomorrow, Singh said.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, playing with toys is essential to development because it contributes to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth. Play also offers an ideal opportunity for parents to engage fully with their children.
KTI Managing Director Nabhan Akeel said, We look forward to working closely with Ishmeet and his team on developing the local industry. He outlined some important strategic points that we believe will help us take advantage of the current economic situation. We, too, feel the time is right for such a move and expect our relationship with Mattel to grow stronger as we set out on this journey together.
Mattel will launch key properties in Sri Lanka beginning with the Hot Wheels Make It Epic initiative in Q2 of 2017, followed by promotions for Barbie in Q4.Mattel is a Fortune 500 American toy manufacturer founded in 1945. Kiddies & Toys International (KTI) is the exclusive agent for Mattel toys in Sri Lanka.

Army engineers are in the process of covering the remainder of the garbage dump at Meethotamulla with polythene to ensure the safety of those still living nearby.
This is a containment technology that forms a barrier between the contaminated area and the surface, thereby shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents and perhaps limiting the migration of the contents. According to the Army, another segment of troops of the Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE) and the Corps of Engineer Services (CES), following guidelines, specified by the Commander of the Army, are liaising with Major General Dananjith Karunaratne, Chief Field Engineer of the Army, and are repairing and re-painting the affected Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya buildings. Engineer troops offering their technical expertise are meanwhile, measuring water levels every hour in the garbage pile to indexing geological changes or developments underneath as advised by geologists.
Meanwhile, clearing of debris and search for those missing continue unabated.

Micro partners Koreas SK Group to make electric cars here
Micro Car Holdings has tied up with South Koreas top three largest diversified conglomerates, SK Group to make Sri Lankas first electric car.
SK Group, a Fortune 500 company will invest US$ 30 million this year and a further US$ 20 million in the next two years with Micro to manufacture this car in Sri Lanka.
SK Group Senior Vice President C.H. Lee said this is the first time that they are investing in the South Asian region. We have seen the rapid technological progress of Micro Cars in Sri Lanka and decided to invest with them.
Lee said that they were also impressed with the geographical location of Sri Lanka where they could manufacture and re-export to neighbouring countries as well.
Micro tied up with the Korean automobile giant Ssangyong in 2008 and began assembling SUVs in Sri Lanka for the first time with a local value addition.
Lee said SK Group is the worlds second largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and they hope bring this technology to Sri Lanka as well.
Micro Holdings Chairman Dr. Lawrence Perera said they were keen on making a local electric car and the prototype of which was unveiled this January. We are confident that the first electric car could roll out from our Kurunegala assembly facility by early 2018.
Perera said that it could travel upto 140 km in one charging cycle which would make it more impressive than some of the imported models that are available in Sri Lanka. We will also match the imported electric car prices.
Micro ventured into the overseas market by exporting vehicles into Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal in 2011. In 2012 Micro opened Sri Lankas largest After Sales Centre to cater the demand of the ever expanding market share. We will also export this car from mid 2018.
He said Micros future expansions will receive significant financing from SK and they will increase their production facility.
SK Group also known as SK Holdings, is composed of 95 subsidiary and affiliate companies that share the SK brand and culture. SK Holdings is ranked 57th in the 2013 Fortune Global 500. SK Group has more than 70,000 employees who work from 113 offices worldwide.

More funds allocated for Malaria prevention: Health Minister

Even though Sri Lanka was certified as a Malaria free country by the World Health Organization (WHO) in September last year, the Government has allocated Rs. 30 million this year in order to prevent Malaria from affecting the country again, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo today he said that usually the government allocates Rs. 10 million for malaria control every year.
But the Government has allocated over Rs 83 million for malaria as recurrent expenditure. The WHO has formulated a 15 year plan commencing from 2015 to 2030 to eliminate Malaria.
According to Minister Senaratne, the last death due to indigenous Malaria was reported from Sri Lanka in 2007 and the last Malaria case due to Indigenous Malaria was reported from Sri Lanka in 2012.
But recently a malaria patient was found from Colombo South Teaching Hospital (Kalbowila) and he was a foreigner.
429,000 Malaria patients have died in the world in 2015.
Malaria can be spread in Sri Lanka again from one or more of those countries through tourists, business travellers, members of armed forces sent abroad as peace keepers, refugees arrive in Sri Lanka from foreign countries etc.
It is important to obtain the vaccination against malaria before leaving for affected countries, he added.

MRs excuse
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is finding ways to wriggle himself out of responsibility for not finding a solution to the garbage problem that came to a head on New Years day when the Meethotamulla trash mountain collapsed killing over 30 persons and displacing hundreds of families. All this, while he is holding onto a tenuous claim that it was all set for the garbage to be disposed at a site in Puttalam and that money too had been allocated in the 2015 budget for the purpose. What is more, he says his brother, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, had it all cut and dried and that it was only a matter of time for the problem to be solved, when the regime changed. Rajapaksa also got some moral support from an unlikely quarter to back his claim when Minister Champika Ranawaka happened to endorse Gotas plan, although Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala had earlier gone onto explain the unfeasibility of the Gota project.
This is why one is at a loss to understand the latest explanation of Mahinda Rajapaksa for not implementing the project. Speaking to reporters at Anuradhapura, after attending to religious observances, the former President said that the garbage problem could not be solved during his tenure since he had to fight the terrorist war. This, after claiming that Gota had a plan. Surely the former President could well have given priority to this matter. It was not as if the war held back projects, both development and infrastructure. The Expressway projects were implemented well after the war.
True, development took a backseat, somewhat, due to all governments, which faced the war, having to pump ill affordable resources to defeat terrorism. But to say that all important projects had to be abandoned due to the war is furthest from the truth. Sri Lanka could not have moved forward to reach middle income status if governments sat back and did nothing, with the excuse that they had to put all its eggs in the war basket. Rajapaksa, himself, did not let the grass grow under his feet just because there was a war raging but plunged into projects that however turned out to be white elephants, squandering billions of rupees. A fraction of this would have sufficed to solve the garbage problem. The Mattala Airport, Hambantota port, the Nelumpokuna theatre, the Sooriyawewa Mahinda Rajapksa stadium etc. all came to be realised long after the end of the war in 2009. To say now that the garbage problem could not be solved due the war is but a clear attempt to hoodwink the people amidst public anger against both the present and past rulers for neglecting this issue.
Rajapaksa would do well to own up to this lapse, as even the Prime Minister has acknowledged that the present government should have given priority to the matter at the very outset of its tenure. It is obvious that Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition is hell bent on cashing in on the Meethotamulla tragedy for political gain, in the process blinding itself to their own role in the tragedy. It has now transpired that leaders of the community living beneath the Meethotamulla garbage mountain were bribed by a politician who was very close to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who held sway in Kolonnawa at the time, to abstain from protesting against the dumping of garbage. Not only that, this politician also lavished his largesse in setting up sport clubs and other facilities for youth in the area in order to buy their silence while the garbage trucks kept roaring into Meethotamulla. Joint Opposition stalwart Dinesh Gunawardena who was Urban Development Minister at the time and who is today shouting himself hoarse on the tragedy should not have been unaware of what was going on. Instead of heaping blame on the government JO members should extend their support to the President and Prime Minister to find ways to overcome the problem. Having parliament debates is not going to help, but can only exacerbate the public anger towards politicians of all hues.
A bull in a china shop
While President Maithripala Sirisena has declared garbage disposal an essential service there is at least one member of the Joint Opposition who is hell bent on acting in defiance of this order. Prasanna Ranatunga is his name. Television showed the burly MP in the forefront of a mass protest to prevent garbage trucks arriving in the Dompe area. Not only that, Ranatunga was behaving in a violent manner threatening the truck drivers using foul language. Later, speaking at a meeting to commemorate his late father Reggie Ranatunga, the Gampaha District parliamentarian was raving and ranting at the police telling the crowd the next time the police arrive they should get together and assault the men in khaki and he would take the lead in this endeavour. This, while a gazette is out under the Presidents hand to arrest those disrupting garbage disposal. What is more, it is also a direct challenge to the IGP.

## Title: Participatory path to irrigation management

Participatory path to irrigation management
Irrigated agriculture  the largest water consumer of the country, is facing severe challenges today. The bet challenge in the near future is how to produce more food and enhance farmer income with less water. The Government of Sri Lanka makes massive investments for development and improvement of irrigation infrastructure in the context of rising demand for water.
More than two thirds of the countrys total land area, which lies in the Dry zone is not productive without the provision of irrigation water. Therefore in the past, investment in irrigation have been concentrated on constructing new irrigation systems or restoring ancient tank systems in the Dry zone, which once supported the ancient civilization. Participation of farmers in irrigation systems construction, operation and maintenance has been one of the key aspects in irrigated agriculture since ancient times. This being an obligatory requirement during the time of ancient kings was called Rajakariya (work performed by the people to the king). Rajakariya was a service done for the king without payment. People got land from the king for cultivation. In return, they performed a compulsory service to the king. However, after the commencement of the British rule in 1796, they abolished the Village Councils and consequently the Rajakariya in 1833.
Irrigation infrastructure
After gaining independence in 1948, large proportion of public investments were allocated to Irrigation Department, mainly for new constructions. The development of large amounts of irrigation infrastructure demanded massive resources as recurrent expenditures. Unlike in community based irrigation systems, where the responsibility for maintenance rested with the user as incentives for maintenance and benefits were localized: in the government intervention systems farmers expected maintenance by the government bureaucracy. Thus there developed a gap in the resource requirement for irrigation system maintenance between bureaucracy and beneficiaries. Therefore since 1978 the government of Sri Lanka started experiments on farmer participation in irrigation system management and handing over of operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities to Farmer Organization (FOs) or Water Users Associations. In other words, prior to 1978, all major and medium irrigation schemes in Sri Lanka were managed by the government with little involvement of farmers.
Irrigation policies may be broadly divided into two categories; (a) irrigation development polices and (b) irrigation management policies. Irrigation development policies may be further divided into for discussion, two categories namely, (i) supply augmentation policy and (ii) system improvement policy.
As regards supply augmentation policy moves, since independence in 1948, the major government efforts for economic development in general and agricultural development in particular have been directed at the development of irrigation sector. The rationale for this policy has been that the development of the irrigation infrastructure is the fundamental strategy for increasing food production in Sri Lanka. More than two thirds of the countrys total land area, which lies in the Dry zone, is not productive without the provision of irrigation water. Therefore in the past, investments in irrigation have been concentrated on constructing new irrigation systems or restoring ancient tank systems in the Dry zone which once supported the ancient island civilization.
The research reveals that investment in irrigation rehabilitation has shown a rapid increase after 1980s, with the implementation of several rehabilitation projects such as Tank Irrigation Modernization Project (TIMP), Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (VIRP), Major Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (MIRP), Irrigation system Management Project (ISMP), National Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (NIRP), and Mahaweli Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (MRRP).
Irrigation management policies may be divided for discussion, into two categories namely (i) user fee and (ii) farmer participation.
Irrigation cost
The findings of the early research revealed that government of Sri Lanka has failed to make necessary policies to mobilize sufficient resources from irrigation beneficiaries to ensure proper maintenance of expanded and improved irrigation infrastructure. The allocation made from government for Operation and Management (O&M) has also decreased over the years at real prices. Direct charging for water was politically very sensitive and has caused severe negative consequences for ruling parties in the past. However historically there had been several instruments used by the government to collect revenue for the State to meet part of the irrigation cost.
With regard to user fees, as indirect tax does not appear to provide any incentive to use the water resources efficiently. The government of Sri Lanka has made several attempts to collect irrigation fee directly from water users. According to the economic theories, pricing of services or commodities is needed to ensure the optimum resource allocation in production. Water pricing methods can be based on volume of water consumed or extent under cultivation. In Sri Lanka O&M fee implemented was based on the area of land cultivated irrespective of the volume of water consumed. In economic efficiency terms, area based pricing is not efficient because famers are inclined to use as much as possible water for the given fee in the absence of physical, administrative, legal or social restrictions, to prevent them.
Irrigation Ordinance No.48 of 1968 as amended provides for the imposition of an irrigation rate upon lands benefited under any season.
The government imposed a land tax, but collections were minimal since 1978. In 1984, the government introduced an O&M fee in all major irrigation schemes with the promise of improved irrigation services. The need to collect O&M fee arose from the enability of the State to generate and allocate sufficient fund to operate and maintain major irrigation schemes at optimal level.
The direct consequence of the failure to allocate sufficient funds for O&M in the long run has resulted in rapid deterioration of irrigation infrastructure. Free collection started with promising result, but did not last long. For example, by the end of 1986, only 15% of the fee for 1985 had been collected.
The collection rates for 1986 fees stood at only 11%. One reason for the failure may have been the acts of opposition political parties to translate the fee collection as an attempt to privatize the irrigation system. Fee collection also suffered from a variety of implementation problems. They included the inability of linking the collected revenue from the system improvement, weak enforcement mechanism adopted for fee collection failure to take action against defaulters and adoption of a uniform rate of O&M fee collection for all the scheme without considering the water availability and physical conditions of a given scheme.
The failures of past attempts in the collection of O&M fee demanded and alternative policy for the substainable and efficient management irrigation infrastructure and management of water resources. After a series of experiments and experiences of participatory irrigation management (PIM) the pressure from doner agencies to reduce public expenditure on irrigation system O&M, the government made attempts to introduce PIM as a national policy.
The Cabinet of Ministers agreed in principle on PIM in 1989, but it has been approved as a policy only in 1992. The government expected to reduce the cost of irrigation O&M by 50% through the policy of PIM as stipulated in the Cabinet Memorandum of 1989.
The legal backing for FOs had earlier been granted by the Agrarian Services Act. PIM for major irrigation had been approved legally by an amendment to the Irrigation Ordinance in 1994.

Privatisation, remedy to poverty
Public-private partnership (PPP) has been the latest mantra of development in the global economic landscape. Considering the recent government move, it is a very prudent attempt to embark on PPP. It has also become a fashionable slogan in the development strategies, particularly during the last couple of decades in many developing as well as advanced countries.
PPP is being adopted in a good number of economies in various infrastructure development sectors, such as the development of airports, railways, roads and recycling municipal solid waste. Sri Lanka is yet far behind in adopting the PPP strategy in providing public utilities. Government has to bear the burden of extra expenditure on behalf of the provision of public goods. At present, it is no longer confined to these sectors. It also has entered the sectors which had been areas of public monopoly for several decades, if not centuries. Education is one sector which had been confined to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state for long. But PPP is being extended to education, including elementary education, which is regarded as a universal human/fundamental right, and also other human development sectors such as health and even to activities relating to poverty reduction.
Recent experience has shown that the role of the private sector in sectors such as education and health has been producing mixed effects, more often negative effects on quality, equity and other dimensions of education, jeopardizing the well established goals of human development. Instead of direct provision by private sector, PPP is depicted as if it is different from privatisation, and as a viable strategy. This would minimise the adverse effects of private sector movement and strengthen the desirable effects of the role of public sector. Public service need to be strengthened in Sri Lanka. The government alone cannot provide everything at any cost. As responsible citizens private sector needs to tie up strategically in providing public service to the community.
There are many questions that need to be critically examined in this context.
What is public-private partnership How does it work in the case of the education sector
While examining the implications for educational development, it is also necessary to underline at the very outset that the education system in South East Asia, South Asia is more privatised than in many other advanced countries of the world, and the rate of growth of the private sector in education is increasing at an alarming rate.
Generally various models of PPP involve a formal contract between the government and the private sector to carry on some specific pre-defined activities in education, such as to set up new institutions, and/or to run the institutions, or carry on a particular activity in education  all financed by the state and/or through self-generated resources.
A typical model of PPP implies the private sector providing infrastructure and service delivery; it may also be responsible for designing, financing, building and operating; and it recovers its investment through lump-sum/annualised payments from the governments, and through user charges. Under the typical model, it shares risk with the state.
Areas that come under PPP
Areas that come under PPP might include almost every aspect of education, including policy making, formulation of plans, evaluation and implementation, ownership, management, funding, running of institutions, academic aspects, special education programmes, like bridge courses, teacher training services, extra academic aspects, examinations, including entrance examinations, support services, hostels, healthcare, transport, maintenance, security, and so on, though policy formulation is normally considered as an exclusive prerogative of the state.
Nowadays, the main objective of proposing PPP is to raise private funds and save public resources. The current widespread discourse on university-industry linkages is also found to be rooted in the same neo-liberal ideology (The private sector was also interested during the earlier periods for philanthropic reasons, purposes of charity and to provide education to the people for national development).
Make quick profits
On the other hand, private sector is interested in PPP nowadays essentially to make quick profits, treating education as a business. For profit sector began to enter into education in a big way either formally as for-profit entities or in the garb of trusts and foundations. Philanthropy has almost vanished in many societies. There is no regulatory framework to monitor the private higher education providers except the prevailing mechanism on providing degree awarding status to degrees. Board of Investment and Ministry of Higher Education need to come on to a common platform in preparing a mechanism to regulate private higher education providers to ensure the quality and result oriented higher education to the students community in this country.
Why PPP
Strategy to tap untapped private financial and human resources
Since government does not have sufficient financial strength, it is necessary to opt for PPP. It is claimed that PPP will ease financial constraints, as the private sector makes huge investments on its own under PPP. As the private and public sectors complement each other, it is claimed, the total resource base will increase. The PPP is projected as a major strategy to tap untapped private financial and human resources, including specialized skills that may not be available in government and to encourage active participation of the private sector in national development.
With the increased resource base, there will be improved access to education and improvement in quality of education. In the absence of PPP, with limited public resources, education system might severely suffer.
It is claimed that the public system is inefficient; it is rigid and inflexible; it does not respond to market needs; it is not autonomous and so on. On the other hand, it is argued that PPP will provide flexibility in relaxing restrictions associated with the public sector, such as in the salary structure, recruitment policies, fees and resource mobilization and management and development rules (e.g., civil works).
It promptly responds to changing market signals in academic and other aspects; it even promotes innovativeness; and increases transparency. PPP increases competition, brings in efficiency associated with the private sector, improves accountability, reduces costs, improves cost-effectiveness, and thereby reduces prices or fees in education.
Tool for augmenting the public resource base
It is also assured by the government, to silence the critics that the major responsibility of providing education finally rests with the government that the government continues to remain accountable to the people for educating its citizens.
Governments further assure the people that PPP does not mean lesser provisioning of government resources; it does not mean abdication of government responsibility; it is not a transfer of responsibility; it is certainly not privatization of the sector; but is a tool for augmenting the public resource base.

Sangakkara scores 58th fc hundred of career
Surrey opening batsman Mark Stoneman made his second century inside 14 days and former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara his second of the season to help Surrey gain a first innings lead of 105 on the third day of the English County championship match at Edgbaston on Sunday.
After Warwickshire were dismissed for 332, Surrey ended day two on 299-3 with Sangakkara unbeaten on 98.
Surrey lost Rory Burns cheaply before Stoneman and Scott Borthwick (50) put on 116 for the second wicket.
Stoneman (123) and Kumar Sangakkara (98no) then helped Surrey reach 299-3.
Having been given a life on 83 when he was dropped in the gully by William Porterfield off Chris Wright, former Durham batsman Stonemans total of 355 runs in three games is now more than any other batsman in the County Championship this season.
But 39-year-old former Warwickshire and Sri Lanka international Sangakkara, went past Stonemans aggregate when he added seven to his overnight score that took him to the 58th first-class century of his career.
Warwickshire first-team coach Jim Troughton said: We lost a couple of soft wickets early in the day which was disappointing. We wanted to be batting most of that first session.
Then the sun came out and made bowling hard work. I wouldnt say we have bowled badly. Surrey have played well. Mark Stoneman has got another hundred and we all know what Kumar can do.
Sangakkara who resumed at 98 was dismissed for 105 as Surrey were bowled out for 437 on Sunday.

SLT Free GB Offer buy 1 get 1 free campaign ends
As a means of catering to growing and encouraging extra GB usage, while rewarding customer loyalty, Sri Lanka Telecom launched the Free GB Offer, a buy one get one free campaign, which was held from March 13-19.
The campaign offered SLT Broadband customers the chance of getting an equal amount of free GB for each extra GB top-up they purchased.
As a pioneer of digital lifestyle in Sri Lanka, SLT is committed to the task of doing all in its power to enhance the broadband experience of their customers. Being the most agile and stable ISP in Sri Lanka, SLT Broadband is known to provide the highest volumes of data on a monthly basis.
The On Demand data volume facility, also known as the Extra GB facility, is one of the key features, which provides undisputed Internet experience quality to customers. This feature was introduced to enable additional GB top-up features online starting from 1GB.
Every time a customer purchased more volume his GB charges were reduced as a result, with prices ranging from Rs. 500  Rs. 750 for 2 GB and 5GB respectively.

SLT invests in boosting customersSocial Media experience
Equipped with in-house caching solutions for top global social networks, Sri Lanka Telecom has clearly secured a key investment for the National Internet Infrastructure and all social media lovers; a distinct value addition when it comes to the improvement of quality for SLT broadband users who go online with their family and friends.
Most of the content is now served within our shores without the need to search for off-shore servers to deliver target content, improve video chatting, and gain high definition for videos and so on.
The caching servers are under the direct control of the respective social network hence there are no issues in privacy or third party involvement for securing content.
Caching is a well-known mechanism used in the industry to improve user experience by saving the frequently used content of the users at first attempt and serving the same content at next attempts from the cache without requesting from the original servers located off shore.
For an example, the first attempt to download a specific content will take up to 40 milliseconds, however following that the next attempt will take a mere 5 milliseconds from the cache.
This will present users with the opportunity to download HD content, a clear enhancement for movies etc. This enhancement has already achieved a large increase in the demand for global social network sites and content browsing as well.
The real benefit to the end-user is the improved latency, which can be described as accelerated, quick and fast response as a result of caching.
A pioneer when it comes to the task of making the Internet available to all Sri Lankans, SLT has consistently invested in developing the National Internet Infrastructure over the past twenty years.
The organization has been committed-to ensure that all Sri Lankans enjoy the very best Internet experience at the lowest possible prices.
Priyantha Fernandez, Chief Network Officer said, The quality of our Home and Office broadband services was significantly enhanced to provide dedicated Internet services to our customers where volume based packages offer one-to-one contentions. SLT Broadband packages provide the best broadband speed in the market with highest amount of data volumes, while our international Internet bandwidth has been significantly upgraded with a huge capacity to provide a better broadband Internet experience to customers. Social network caching was introduced; facilitating better performance for web based social networking applications, which in turn, enables an overall better internet experience

SLTA to conduct highest number of tournaments for 2017
The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) boasts that they will conduct the highest number of annual tournaments during their 100-year history in 2017, including over 20 tournaments in the under-10 category.
The SLTA will host a tournament once in three weeks throughout the year, creating competition opportunities to the age category that has shown an unprecedented high volume in recruiting to the sport. This was revealed to the media during a discussion at the SLTA where the national governing body announced its annual tournament calendar and clarified questions raised by the media.
The SLTA vice president Sohan Patrick said that over 15,000 U-10 kids are playing tennis island-wide and participation at national level under-10 tournaments exceeds 1200.
The popular junior programme, Mini Tennis has been re-branded as Cool Tennis and proved to be a resounding success, said Patrick.
Grass root level tennis at outstations has shown great progress. Tournaments will be conducted in Jaffna (Dec. 8-10), Negombo (July 7-9), Batticaloa (April 28-30), Kurunegala (Aug. 15-18) and Kandy (Aug. 25-27) and about 15 new courts have been set up in the outstations during the past two years, he said.
The enthusiasm in parents, kids and outstation schools are very encouraging. But unfortunately we experienced a big drop out in the age categories U-14 and U-16, so a lesser number of players continue in the U-18 and beyond.
Speaking further, Patrick stated, There are lots of international tournaments for U-12, U-14, U16 and U-18 age categories. Around 35 Lankan juniors annually participate in these tournaments. International exposure is very important and at present 6 to 7 Lankan juniors are doing well overseas. We have Adithya Karunaratne who reached U-18 world 250 rank recently, training in Spain. We hope she will qualify to play in Wimbledon. Avindra Perera is also one our future hope.
SLTA will host 12 international tournaments including three mens Future series (June19-July 9), three womens Future series (Oct. 2-22), two ATF U-14 (Oct. 30- Nov.12) and most importantly the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group III (July 17-22) in Colombo this year. Ending a continuous five-year stint in the Davis Cup Group II, last year Sri Lanka was relegated to Group III, but SLTA has high hopes this year that our players will prosper on home advantage to bounce back to Group II. Nine teams namely Jordan, Malaysia, Pacific Oceania, Qatar, UAE, Syria, Turkmenistan, Lebanon and host Sri Lanka will battle in two groups where the top two teams of each group will play off to determine the two teams to enter Group II. The Lankan team for the Davis Cup will be selected before end of May.
The 7 hard courts at the SLTA will be renovated after the completion of the 2017 tournament calendar at a cost of nearly 35million, so the top international events can be hosted.

Small space gardening tips for city dwellers
Despite being an urban mecca, we are lucky to be Vancouverites when it comes to food growing. While we experience A LOT of rain, on the plus side, this means we dont have to water until summer hits. Its also one of the most temperate regions in Canadawe can grow food 365 days a year with a little planning, whether you have a couple of patio containers, a community garden plot, or yard space. At Victory Gardens, were a team of urban farmers who specialize in transforming all types of urban space for food production. Whether you live in Vancouver, or another temperate city, growing plants (and even food) in a small city apartment isnt impossible. In fact, it can be quite easy, and bring much needed nature into your concrete jungle. Here are a few gardening tips and considerations before you drop some seeds in the soil.
Materials
When planning your garden infrastructure, consider the materials youre using. If youre building boxes out of wood, opting for untreated cedar will ensure your boxes have a long and sustainable life. Avoid using treated wood, as it can leach harmful chemicals into the soil.
Avoid using wood like pine, as it has a short life weathering the elements and your efforts in creating your infrastructure wont give you the longevity you need. Terra cotta pots are another good option.
Just ensure your container is deep enough for the veggies you want to grow.
18 is a good depth for growing any variety of veggies, while 10-12 is better for shallow-rooted crops like greens. Ensure your container has holes in the bottom for drainage!
Space
Planning out what veggies you want to incorporate into your garden plan is essential. Ask yourself, how big does my plant get How long does it need to mature before harvest (If youre not sure of these things, talk to the person or company you bought your seeds from). If you have limited space, you might want to stick to crops that need less space and have a shorter date to harvest, such as lettuce, spinach, arugula, and radishes. Choosing cherry tomatoes for a more bountiful harvest might also be an idea.
We always recommend growing herbs in your small space, as youll need them often, and this alleviates multiple trips to the farmers market or grocery store. Not to mention, you can save a lot of money! Another major consideration before planting is knowing how much light your space gets. Ask yourself, how much light does my space get If you have a shadier space, fear not, as leafy greens can tolerate as little as 4 hours of light per day. Root crops need 6 hours, and tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and zucchini need a full 8 hours of direct sunlight.
Planning
No matter how small the space, planning out your growing season will ensure effective use of space. Draw a garden map! Determine how much of each thing you want to grow and when it will be planted. Determine what preparation you will need to do before planting (like soil amendments), and whether you will need to start crops indoors so they will be ready to transplant. Make a plan that includes the succession of crops, where they should be planted, when they should be harvested, and what should be planted after them. Timing: Timing is also another major consideration so that you can maximize your garden space and harvest all year round! Consider using space so you leave room for early spring, mid spring, late spring, and summer crops. This is the challenge for the new gardener (and the seasoned!)  to resist the temptation to plant all at once. There are veggies that grow well in cool soils in early spring, veggies that need warmer soil and do better in late spring, and those that do best in the heat of summer
We utilize a method of successive planting so that we can harvest continuously throughout the season. Successive planting is when you plant one variety of crops multiple times throughout the season.
That way you have a longer season, more manageable harvests, and can maximize your urban space. One example is arugula: it can be planted from March until September, so why seed it all at once and only get one harvest before it finishes its life cycle Seeding a row every month ensures youll never run out.
Companion planting: We always plant certain crops for their companion, nutrient fixing, or other beneficial qualities. We do this in organic gardening to perpetuate garden health and viability without conventional additives. Companion planting is when we plant two different crops amongst one another to provide a symbiotic relationship between them: One helps the other repel pests, they compliment nutrient intake, often attract pollinators, and provide natural trellising. Some companion examples: Tomatoes and basil, broccoli and scallions.
Vertical growing: One easy way to grow vertically is to use a trellis in your small space. A trellis is essential if you have limited space, and its an easy solution. Trellises are ideal for beans, peas, zucchinis, cucumbers, tomatoes, and other vine plants that need support.

## Title: Social graces will take you places
## Supertitle:

Social graces will take you places
Social graces are skills used to interact politely in societal situations. They include manners, etiquette - the specific accepted rules within a culture for the application of universal manners - deportment and fashion. These skills were once taught to young women at a finishing school or charm school.
Polished behaviour
The focus of social graces has changed over the last century, recently with an accent on business etiquette and international protocol. Did you know that an impression is made within the first seven seconds of meeting someone Seven seconds is an extremely small amount of time, so you must rely on your etiquette skills and social graces to make an ace of that first impression.
Maintaining good cell phone etiquette
Anyone who knows how to behave in gatherings, functions and get-togethers is known instantly. And they stand out for their polished behaviour by going to any lengths to make others comfortable. This trait is crucial for self development.
Social grace then refers to the general behaviour and attitude of being polite and welcoming to people. Social graces are there to make people in one anothers company feel comfortable and know what behaviour to exhibit without putting others ill at ease.
This means putting other's needs before your own in some cases, such as offering a chair to an elderly person rather than sitting down on it first.
It also means paying attention to your own behaviour to make sure you aren't offending others. Social grace is extremely important when meeting new friends. Relationships can develop at a faster rate if you show courtesy toward someone else. As a friendship strengthens and friends get more comfortable with each other, social graces are relaxed. For example, when you have established a new friendship with someone you will probably make it a point to interrupt them less during conversation.
As time goes on, you will each learn when the other is being rude and when they are just excited or bored. While social grace tends to be loosened a bit for good friends much like you would for family, the principles behind them are still a good idea to remember. You don't need to be formal or stuffy to have social grace, you simply need to make sure your behaviour is not offensive and that you are making other people feel special. That alone will go far in friendship.
So you won't get offended as much when they interrupt you because you'll understand the intent behind it. Social graces include making proper introductions to people. Listening and not interrupting in conversation. Using good table manners. Maintaining good cell phone etiquette. Being careful not to put your foot in your mouth.
Extremely important
Some of the basic rules of society that our parents taught us such as never to interrupt or to await your turn are key components of social grace. While you can pick up books on etiquette, developing social grace often takes time and the ability to pay attention. Rather than focusing on how good a time you are having or if you are able to talk about your latest success story, hold back and watch the others in the room.
Do they seem to frown when you start talking If they do, it's a good chance you're boring them or you interrupted them. In each new event or environment You are in, pay attention to the goings on around you. Does someone need a chair Is a person fanning their face and therefore warm Is there someone sitting in a corner who hasn't joined the conversation See if you can help in any of these situations.
You can also learn social grace by taking note of what you find rude in others. If you hate it when someone fails to introduce you or takes every cell phone call they get while standing before you, never duplicate such behaviour yourself.
Social grace is extremely important when it comes to friendship. When finding a friend, you want someone sincere who will support you and who you can also have fun with. If a person pays attention to your comfort level and has good manners, you're more apt to get to know them better than someone that makes you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed to be around. Some people are of the view that manners and etiquette are painful formalities that are patronising and conceited and are given too much precedence in modern society. It is not the etiquette, nor the manners, that are snobbish but rather the misuse of them by people that gives the appearance of snobbery.
Showing class
When people use what they think are good manners as a way of separating themselves from others, it is called acting pretentiously. It is attempting to impress others by affecting greater importance, knowledge, culture or wealth than the others around them. Such stuck-up behaviour however backfires, as the people acting this way make themselves appear to be snobbish, conceited or self-absorbed. Such toffee-nosed individuals look ridiculous to anyone who actually understands that the root basis of manners, is simply to show self-respect, while showing respect for all others around them and the social situation that he or she is in. They are the same people who usually have arrogance and class confused.
Acting as if one is better than someone else is simply being arrogant. It does not show that one has class. Showing class is treating others with respect, the same way that you would most like to be treated. Would you ever be able to term a person self developed if he or she bulldozes their way, dashes women unabashedly and tramples other's feet while trying to reach their seat in a cinema or theatre
The rules of proper etiquette and protocol have been around for years, but they are far more important in this day and age than ever before. Implementing proper etiquette and protocol skills into everyday life should be habit for everyone - including children. After all, people who display proper etiquette not only feel good about themselves they also make those around them feel important and respected.
Are you up-to-date with these skills Well, it is never too early, or too late, to start. Possessing social grace means that you can manoeuvre yourself admirably through any social gathering or situation with ease.

Crossings accounted for 61% of market turnover for the week helping push market turnover to a YTD high of LKR 5.17Bn on Tuesday. Crossings in COMB accounted for 64% of the week's total crossings and 39% of the market's total turnover for the week while JKH accounted for 21% of the week's total crossings. Retailers too returned to markets this week, taking cues from the consistent foreign buying in domestic equities in 2017.
The market rally since late-March has led to the ASPI gaining a cumulative 539 points (or 9%) over the last four weeks.
The rally over this period has helped wipe off earlier losses on the Index, and the ASPI has gained 4.9% YTD, relative to the loss of 4.0% between Dec 31 2016 and Mar 24 '17 when the rally began. Markets are likely to retain the current positive momentum, although some profit taking is also likely in the week ahead.
IMF Raises Global Growth Outlook for 17-18E
In its latest World Economic Outlook report, the IMF raised its global growth projections for 2017 (to 3.5% from 3.4% in Oct'16) and 2018 (3.6%), citing consistently good economic news since H2'16 (buoyant financial markets and a cyclical recovery in manufacturing and trade) for the improved outlook1.
The IMF noted that growth is expected to be broad based, with activity projected to pick up markedly in EM and developing economies as macroeconomic strains experienced by commodity exporters ease amid the partial recovery in commodity prices and as growth remains strong in China and many other commodity importers1. The reported noted however, that a stronger recovery is held back by structural impediments and that the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside, particularly over the medium term.
The IMF noted further that persistent structural issues such as low productivity growth and high income inequality have increased pressures for inward-looking policies in Advanced Economies, threatening the global economic integration that has served the world economy (particularly EM & and developing economies) well1.

SriLankan Airlines further enhances service excellence for passengers of all airlines at BIA
SriLankan Airlines further enhanced its customer service capabilities with more specialized training for its airport service staff at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to serve passengers of all airlines even better.
SriLankan Airlines (www.srilankan.com) is the sole airport ground handler for all airlines that operate to BIA in Colombo, where it annually handles nearly 9 million passenger movements on approximately 70,000 flights.
SriLankan Airlines, General Manager Airport & Ground Services Bandula Weragama said, We at SriLankan Airlines are constantly seeking more ways to enhance the skills of our staff, in order to delight all our customers even more. We remain steadfast in our commitment to provide the finest levels of service to our valued passengers, especially as our volumes of traffic at BIA increase, growing year on year due to the steady growth in tourist arrivals and larger numbers of Sri Lankans travelling overseas.
The latest service enhancement involved training on handling of wheelchair and stretcher passengers by the instructors of the St. John Ambulance Service, who imparted specialized skills to the airline's airport staff through a four-day training programme, to further enhance safety and comfort of elderly passengers and passengers requiring special assistance.
Sri Lanka's National Carrier has built a reputation as one of the world's finest airlines in terms of customer service, both in the air and on the ground, over nearly four decades of operations. Apart from handling of passengers, baggage and cargo of all airlines, charters, freighters, private aircraft and other types of aircraft that operate to BIA and MRIA, it provides specialized services for premium passengers such as the Serendib Business Class Lounge and the Silk Route Priority Check-In Service. SriLankanAirlines expertise as an airport ground handling company has long been recognised.
It was one of the first ground handlers to receive the prestigious IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) Certification in 2008 from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global association of airlines, a certification that has been continuously renewed since then.
In its quest to provide a superior service, SriLankan works closely with all authorities at BIA including the airport owning company Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd, Sri Lanka Air Force which is the airport's security handler, Customs, and Immigration.
The National Carrier's fully owned subsidiary SriLankan Catering operates the Serenediva airport transit hotel and provides catering services for most of the airlines that operate to BIA and the other lounges.

SriLankan Airlines to further reinforce Mideast presence

SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of Sri Lanka and a member of the one world airline alliance, is looking to gain further impetus from the Middle East, even as the Indian Ocean island nation increasingly reaps the positive dividends of rapidly growing tourist numbers the Saudi Gzzette said.
The airline will be making fresh forays into the region, which is one of its significant source markets, through its presence at the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai on April 24 to 27.
The airline is uniquely positioned to serve as a seamless connector between the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Far East and Southeast Asia, as a result of its strategic location and strong route network.
The airline has traditionally done well in carrying tourists and expatriates between the Middle East, Sri Lanka and the sub-continent and has also been increasingly viewed as a viable alternative to reach East and Southeast Asia.
With demand increasing, SriLankan Airlines has now enhanced its services to the region, with daily flights to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Riyadh, Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait.
The airline is also looking at increasing connectivity to other parts of the Gulf depending on demand. The Middle East continues to be one of our most important markets and being present at the ATM allows us to network and interact with the majority of tour operators, travel agents and other stakeholders and present them with our latest offerings, said Desiree Premachandra, Country Manager of SriLankan Airlines in the UAE.
The airline, will also look to further leverage its membership of the one world alliance and work with other partners to increase traffic across its network. We are an airline with a unique set of advantages, being located in the tourism paradise of Sri Lanka and having strong networks and traditional ties to India, the Middle East and East Asia, which we are looking to capitalize on to grow our presence further as a leading player in this sector, Premachandra said.

Struggle to provide housing
A small solar panel sits on top of the hot tent, collecting sunlight, while the people sit outside, unable to bear the heat that their solar panels revel in.
Close to a year since the devastating landslides which took place in Aranayake, Kegalle, many still remain in tents; unsure of their future and yet adapting to their present circumstances.
Authorities have finally found lands to settle those displaced, but controversy around their final resettlement has risen, as people who have been displaced from possible vulnerable areas now state that they do not want to leave the campsvery few trust the government authorities when they inform the people that it is safe to return to their new lands.
Aranayake District Secretary Z.A. M Faizel, however, assured that the issues pertaining to settlement of those displaced would be solved soon.
The displaced people living in camps for nearly a year alleged that the whole process of handing out new houses was politicised, and many vulnerable people have been ignored.
Houses for Displaced families
Camp site
Around 571 families were affected in the landslide in Aranayake and many lost their houses, while others were evacuated as they lived in the high-risk areas demarcated by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO). The government, at the time, promised that houses would be provided to families which have been identified as living in high-risk areas and to the victims whose houses were damaged beyond repair.
According to Faizel, the people were provided with tents, while some were housed in partitioned school premises until the government constructed houses for them.
He added that 56 families completely lost their houses and that they have already been handed over 50 houses by last week.
There are 571 families who lived in high-risk zones. Among them, measures have been taken to proveide land and houses for 191 of families. The people would be paid according to the work they carry out on their own houses. For that, they have to commence constructions, but many have failed to do so, he said.
Faizel claimed that people opposed when they tried to close the camps as well.
At present, there are eight camps in; Dehiyanwala, Rahalagala, Dippitiya Muslim MahaVidyalaya, Dippitiya Arafa Senior School, Narangamana School, Pallepamunuwa School, Hathgampola grounds, Godigamuwa school, and Ussapitiya public grounds.
Chaminda Premaratne, who runs a small-scale garment factory, and Saman Kumara, a mason, were hopeful of getting new houses very soon.
Flats are being built for us under the Chinese housing scheme. We have given our names; hopefully, we will get our houses soon, said Premaratne.
He said, they were informed that a total of 100 houses would be built. During the first stage, 60 houses are to be built, and 40 houses would follow in the second stage.
Kumara, however, pointed out that there are 60 more families who are in need of houses.
Fear of false promises
Unlike Premaratne and Kumara, N. Samaraweera, a three-wheel driver, was disappointed by the initiatives taken by the government authorities.
Not all the victims are receiving houses. The whole process is politicised, he said.

According to Samaraweera, his mother, who had lost her house in the landslide, has been completely ignored by the authorities.
When I went to talk to a government official about it, he asked me whether I have support from a politician so that the work can be done easily. This is a common slogan in all government authorities, he said.
Meanwhile, lives that collapsed with the landslide continue to be restricted to displaced camps amidst great difficulties.
Samaraweera said, with rain water seeping into camp sites, the people living in the camps were facing many health issues.
J.P. Badmakumari lamented that the government had promised to provide them houses, but are yet to provide a definite date. She feared that it just might be another false promise given to them by the government.
I wonder for how many days I would have to suffer in these tents with my children, she said.
Badmavathis house was marked as high-risk by the NBRO after the Samasara landslide. She said, she had a small house with a big garden, and now, all is lost. We were immediately evacuated and sent to these camps after the landslide. Now we are stuck, she said.
K. Ratnayake, meanwhile, said that his house was also marked as high-risk, but the NBRO had recently asked him to return to his house, stating that it was safer to live there now.
They had no answer to give me when I asked them what they did to mitigate the risk, he said.
Ratnayake stressed that without knowing of the preventive measures taken by the government authorities to mark it as safe, he would not leave the camp.
A government official who wished to remain unnamed said the people were refusing to leave the camps, claiming they feared another landslide and added that some also insisted that their houses too, have been damaged beyond repair.
He said the government had promised to provide these people with measures to protect their homes, but was reluctant to elaborate on the measures that are being taken by the authorities.
The official noted that some of the victims who witnessed the landslide fear that another landslide could occur once the rains recommence.
Faizel, meanwhile, emphasized that only those people living in the danger zone identified by the NBRO, as well as those whose houses were destroyed, would be provided with housing via government schemes.
Villagers from areas identified as possible vulnerable areas have been requested to return to their houses as the government had promised to provide measures to ensure the safety of their homes, in addition to constructing roads to their houses, he said.
Despite several attempts made by the Daily News to contact Chairman of NBRO R.M.S Bandara, for a comment, he was not available.
Less support from people
According to the government official, the government has been making good progress to settle the displaced. He said, the people received support from non-governmental organizations as well.
Faizel explained that people from vulnerable areas too, were staying at camps, claiming their houses were endangered and uninhabitable.
They also request alternate land from the government, which is not an easy task. The government has already taken initiatives to provide houses for the victims whose houses were completely destroyed and who lived in high-risk zones, he said.
The official stressed on the fact that the people should also make a move whilst the government takes all possible initiatives.
Not everyone, but some, have their own hidden agendas. Some try to do everything possible to get a house from the government, he said.
A retired teacher from Aranayake, W. Chandrasekara, also had the same view on the problem.
It is not easy to find out who is being truthful and who is not. This becomes an emotional problem when you ignore their demands, he said. Chandrasekara further said, government authorities should deal with these issues without being biased.
