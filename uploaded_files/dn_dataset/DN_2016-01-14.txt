De Villiers fulfills lifelong dream
JOHANNESBURG: All eyes will be on AB de Villiers when he fulfills a lifelong a dream of captaining his country in the longest format of the game when South Africa take on England in the third Test at the Wanderers on Thursday.
The Proteas were rocked by the shock resignation of Hashim Amla immediately after the second Test at Newlands, which ended in a high scoring draw to keep the visitors one-nil ahead in the series with two games to play.
Aside from the leadership change, the home team will go into the Test in a much more confident mood after their batsman finally managed to put some big runs on the board and put England under pressure.
Amla, De Villiers, Faf Du Plessis and Temba Bavuma made notable scores which means there will again be no place in the starting team for JP Duminy, who comes off a big hundred in a domestic first-class game. The Proteas just have to decided if they will go into the match with an all pace attack, which will mean spinner Dane Piedt dropping out and seamer Kyle Abbott returning to the line up.
Compared to the hosts, England have had a rather quiet week-long build up as they look to seal a series victory over the world's number-one ranked Test side.
The tourists are expected to keep the same eleven that did duty in Cape Town, although there have been concerns about their bowling attack that spent 211 overs in the field in the previous Test.
The main area the visitors been would have been working on this week was their fielding as they spurned a grand total of 10 catches in the last game.
The captain, Alastair Cook, needs some runs under his belt as he has been the only English batsman that has not contributed a significant score on the tour so far. Allrounder Ben Stokes will be trying hard to replicate his Newlands batting form, he scored the fastest ever 250 in the longest format of the game, but it will be tougher on a Wanderers track that is expected to offer much more to the bowlers.
Teams:
South Africa: AB de Villiers (captain), Hashim Amla, Kyle Abbott, Temba Bavuma, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl, Chris Morris, Quinton de Kock, Hardus Viljoen
England: Alastair Cook (captain), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Gary Ballance, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler, Nick Compton, Mark Footitt, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Samit Patel, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Taylor, Chris Woakes

Dhoni not convinced by DRS after wrong call
PERTH, TUESDAY: Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni says he remains unconvinced by the merits of the Decision Review System despite India appearing to get a wrong decision in their opening one-day international loss to Australia.
MahendraSingh Dhoni
Indias lack of faith in the use of DRS proved costly as George Bailey overcame what should have been a first-ball dismissal late Tuesday to help Australia reel in the tourists 309 for three with four balls and five wickets to spare in the Perth one-dayer.
Bailey went on to score 112 off 120 balls and man-of-the-match Steve Smith hit 149 from 135 balls as the Australians easily ran down Indias total, which was boosted by an unbeaten 171 by Rohit Sharma and captain Virat Kohlis 91.
It could have (changed the outcome of the game), Dhoni said of the Bailey incident.
But at the same time, we need to push the umpires to make the right decision. You have to see how many 50-50 decisions (dont) go in our favour, and it always happens and then you have to take it.
But Im still not convinced on DRS.
The matchs pivotal moment came in the fifth over of Australias innings when Bailey appeared to glove his first ball down legside to Dhoni off debutant paceman Barinder Sran.
Television replays confirmed the contact between ball and glove, but with no DRS technology in place for any series involving India, the visitors were unable to challenge umpire Richard Kettleboroughs decision of not out.
When asked by broadcaster Channel Nine about a potential DRS reversal, Bailey said: Were not the team that doesnt want it.
When asked to clarify whether he thought India was being punished for their refusal to embrace DRS by finishing on the wrong side of line-ball decisions, Dhoni said with a smile: I may agree with you. The DRS uses ball-tracking and thermal imaging to verify umpires decisions. It was made optional, rather than compulsory, at Indias insistence.
India, which accounts for the lions share of global cricket revenues, has been suspicious of DRS since making a number of unsuccessful referrals during the 2008 Test series with Sri Lanka, when the technology was on trial. But most other cricketing nations including England and Australia support the system.

Govt postponing LG elections, Dinesh to go before courts
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader and parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said that his group will announce how they would contest the forthcoming local government elections after elections are declared by the government.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo, the parliamentarian said that they will have to go before court as the government is in the practice of postponing local government elections citing various issues. He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had sent a report to the President finalising the delimitation process though the government is in the habit of postponing the elections citing delimitation.
Gunawardena requested the government to convene parliament according to schedule. He said that parliament was scheduled to meet 8 days within the month of January.
"Parliament met only on one day and the next session is scheduled to be held on January 26," he said. Gunawardena added that they were able to foil the government's attempts to establish an institution outside parliament for the draft of the new Constitution.
The parliamentarian added that those who imported vehicles are waiting the government decisions with regard to taxes.

Here's What Emma Stone Could Look Like As Cruella De Vil
Disney's Maleficent took one of the most purely evil characters from their animated film history and turned her into a wronged vehicle of vengeance. Can Disney do it again They're going to try, as it looks like the plans to move forward on a live-action movie about 101 Dalmatians villain Cruella de Vil are going into high gear. Rumors are circulating that Emma Stone is in serious negotiations to play the title role, so one artist has given us a beautiful, and deliciously evil, look at what Stone might look like in the role.
The poster idea comes courtesy of SG Posters, who create original poster art based on numerous movie franchises. The image is based on a previously existing fashion photograph of the actress, but the change in coloring completely changes the look of the image. What would otherwise be a simple smile instead looks absolutely vindictive behind the bright red lipstick in an otherwise colorless picture. This single picture of Emma Stone conveys two things. Cruella is up to no good, and we can't wait to watch her doing it. She's missing the trademark streak of white hair (unless you count the shade to the left of the image), but this Cruella is much younger, so maybe she won't have it yet
The rumor just broke a couple of days ago that Emma Stone is in talks to take the iconic Disney role. This will obviously be an early origin story, as Cruella is usually portrayed as a much older woman. The movie could put us so early in Cruella's story that there may be no mention of dalmatians whatsoever. The casting rumor follows on the heels of a report that Disney has hired Saving Mr. Banks writer Kelly Marcel to pen the script. It looks like the Mouse House is looking to shift this film into high gear, possibly with plans to begin filming sometime later this year.
If Emma Stone does take the role, she'll have big shoes to fill. The role was previously played by the amazing Glenn Close in the live action 101 Dalmatians and its sequel. This is another reason that we're guessing there will be no spotted puppies in this upcoming film. That live action movie has already been made, so there's no reason for this movie to cover the same ground. All it will do is bring comparisons that Disney likely won't want. However, this opens up the possibilities for a Cruella movie to deal with entirely new ideas. It's very nearly a blank slate.
A cartoonishly evil Emma Stone sounds like a fun movie to us, and even though this isn't a real poster, it's the sort of thing that would draw us into a theater. How about you

Kandy SC running away with league title
The inter-club league rugby tournament is half way through with all clubs playing seven games each. Defending champions Kandy SC are placed number one followed by Havelock SC and Navy SC. If Kandy SC continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem retaining the league title for another year.
Kandy SC has been branded as the best rugby team without any doubt having beaten all the clubs they have met convincingly. Currently Kandy has all the fire power to topple any side.
In their last outing on Sunday, the VIP enclosure was packed with high-spirited rugby lovers like ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Malik Samarawickrema, MP's Lohan Ratwatte, Dilum Amunugama, few officers from the Navy and the committee members of the host club. The stadium was filled to capacity and the club made the highest gate collection of the season.
Full back Nigel Ratwatte had a memorable game and fashioned out the 29-10 win for Kandy. Ratwatte who missed the earlier game against Havelock SC scored 24 points out of the 29, a try a goal and five penalty kicks at goal was his contribution.
Nigel speaking to the Daily News after the final whistle said he really enjoyed the game and was proud that he was able to contribute towards the win in the presence of the home crowd.
"It was a team game and all my scoring was done due to the backing given by my team mates. The last few days at practice I concentrated more on my kicking and that helped me in a big way. My club will do better in the second round, for which all players are in top form," said Ratwatte. "I am thankful to the club for giving the much needed back up."
It seemed as though Kandy SC's fullback Ratwattte had reserved his best performance for the game against the Navy SC.
Kandy SC's new head coach Sean Wijesinghe created a very good image in his first year as coach. Taking on the champion club and maintaining their winning streak is no easy task. The former captain of the club and the country Wijesinghe after the match hailed his captain Fazil Marija as the greatest fly half ever. He has helped the club make history as the only team to win seven consecutive games this season.
"We took the field with the hype, confidence, superiority and power, which has been the hallmark of the team this season. It was a special victory than the rest because last year Navy beat us at Nittawela by one point. It was an opportunity that we really wanted to take and it was a huge relief and brought a sense of satisfaction at having got the job done well," said Wijesinghe.
The coach also thanked his former coach Johan Taylor who is in Kandy on a short visit. Taylor gave the team all the encouragement and a helping hand in the last two games, and helped to polish up the team's performance. He leaves for Ireland in a few days time.
Taylor said, "This victory means a lot - I'm pretty grateful to be where I am. I'm so proud of the team. To win back-to-back matches is a dream come true. It's a pretty strong group of guys. We try to do things no other team has done before. It's a special feeling to be part of such a great team."
Marija the skipper said, "We've been the hardest working team in club rugby. Nobody has trained harder than us. The work ethic has been magnificent. We do not have the huge stars, but we've out-worked other teams and that's something to be proud of. I thank my players and all the people who helped us in every way."
Rugby Chairman of the club, Lasantha Wijasuriya a former captain says one of their goals was to be the team of the tournament. "We set out to create a team that Kandy rugby fan can really be proud of. They should be proud of this group of young men, who have worked so hard to achieve what they have done. This moment and the day belonged to the team, and it is yours to share"

Katie Holmes Sparkles in Diamond : Engagement Ring from Jamie Foxx
After years of covert dating, Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are engaged! Check out the the petite glacier he put on her famous finger.
Radar first reportedly exclusively back in 2013 that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were an item, and now, the pair has taken their secret romance to a serious new level.
Just weeks ago, Holmes, 37, was photographed on a red carpet wearing a sparkling diamond ring on her left ring finger, and according to reports, it is her engagement ring from Foxx!
While the rock is certainly not the giant iceberg that has become the norm in Hollywood, there is a significance behind the diamond that he gave his bride-to-be.
According to reports, the rock has special meaning to Foxx, 48, because it once belonged to his grandmother.
But as happy as this couple may be, In Touch reports that Holmes still fears that her ex-husband Tom Cruise will come back into her life and try to take her daughter Suri away, ruining her new blended family.
However, for now, Holmes and Foxx have their eyes on a low-key wedding in the near future.

Nothing major happened - Mathews
Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews and manager Jerry Woutersz played down the alleged 'scandalous behaviour' the team has been accused of during their disastrous tour of New Zealand.
"This is not the first time it has happened, it happened straight after the World Cup as well last year. People come up with so many allegations," said Mathews at a media conference held at Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters yesterday after the team's return.
"Being the captain if somebody has done something wrong and violated the team rules they will definitely be brought to task and have no way out.
"If there is any incident during the tour we take action against a player immediately, we don't wait till the tour is over, we got to fight it then and there. Nothing major happened, the manager will tender his report and Sri Lanka Cricket will take it up from there.
"If something had happened definitely the manger will get to know and he will look into the matter very seriously. I can't really deny or accept it without knowing," he said.
Manager Woutersz stated that he had been informed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to comment on the allegations because the Sports Minister had requested for a report.
"Whatever the incidents that have been highlighted, I will be making that report in a few days and hand it over to SLC, they will take it up from there," said Woutersz.
REASONS FOR LOSS
Stating the reasons for the team's poor performance Woutersz said, "We didn't play upto our potential. The cricket we played out there was not good enough against a very good New Zealand outfit. We had some good days but didn't continue it when we should have. We came close to drawing the first Test and close to winning the second but the middle order did let us down a bit."
Sri Lanka lost the series in all three formats to New Zealand - the Tests 0-2, ODIs 1-3 and T20Is 0-2.
"We are disappointed we lost all three series. We did everything as far as preparations were concerned, but our planning nothing worked for us. If you look at our team we lacked in experience," said Mathews.
"The reason for the defeats is situation handling. If we had experienced players in the side and when they come up against such situations they know how to handle it. We have been experiencing these situations for some time. We talked about it and hope to rectify it.
"In time to come the players will learn. Because this is an inexperienced side the mistakes are showing in their numbers. (Kumar) Sangakkara and Mahela (Jayawardene) when they went out they left a big void and it is showing. But that cannot be given as an excuse. The present squad is a good one but even though they lack in experience the more they play they will improve.
"The coach cannot be blamed for our performances. It is of our own undoing. As players we need to perform in the middle, the coach can only prepare us for it," he said.
DILSHAN INCIDENT
Commenting on the incident Tillakaratne Dilshan was involved with a spectator during the second T20 international at Auckland, Mathews said, "I actually don't know what exactly happened but as players we don't play to lose. You get upset as well when somebody casts some remark. From the fans' point of view they are also hurt that we lost, so it goes both ways. I can't really comment on whether Dilshan was right or wrong."
The spectator had told Dilshan that it was time for him to retire to which the Lankan opener had reacted and replied, "Do you want to play in my place."
NO SQUABBLING IN TEAM
Mathews denied any squabbling between players including the captain and the coach as was reported by a news agency quoting the Sports Minister.
"We have been hearing so many things from the time of the New Zealand tour, but as far as I am concerned we have a very good relationship. I've known Jerome for the past 8-9 years and we never had differences or any issues. I am clueless where these allegations came from," said Mathews.
On the positive side of things Mathews said, "(Dinesh) Chandimal stepping it up and Dushmantha (Chameera) had a great tour. Chameera bowled with lots of fire and pace and he was able to go hard at the New Zealand batsmen. (Jeffrey) Vandersay bowled well in patches for a new recruit in the team and Kusal Mendis had a few good knocks. We definitely have the capacity and the capability it's just that fine tuning and to cope up with the pressure.
"It was a very difficult tour for us, quite demoralizing and embarrassing because we have had our chances and when we got them we just let it go."
Coach Jayaratne was optimistic that Sri Lanka would be able to defend their World T20 title in India.
"We have a talented unit they have the ability, it's just the adaption in those challenging moments out there in the middle whether they are able to adapt to those situations and manage and navigate their innings and see it to a finish," said Jayaratne.
"You take Milinda Siriwardana he looks great but unfortunately he couldn't finish a match for us especially the ODI series. If you don't do this day in day out in our domestic structure it is difficult. They have the talent and in the subcontinent we would be much stronger than we were in New Zealand."

Promise of a bruising return leg
X'mas... done, festive spirit... done, recovery through New Year... done, league 1st round... done. The promise is of a bruising return leg larger than life and much concern for coaching staff and fans alike.
The questions remain, can Sandun Herath's captaincy inspire Havies to bridge the 6-point advantage, focus practise to a defined "Lagga" plan, catch up and dramatically swing the pendulum in their favour Will Kandy grow in strength and confidence and thrive off the Marija experience and more recently, the Ratwatte boot Can CR, skipper Noor, and coach Marikkar, fashion up the biggest upsets, the island nation has ever seen.... Experts and masters of the Union code, can consider the immense laws of possibility, then analyze the form, before diving headfirst - let's see if the oracle speaks
The reality for all contenders, particularly the top 3, Kandy 39 points, Havelocks 33 points, and CR 25 points....hinges much on current injuries to key players, and the process of recovery in time for those critical clashes, just weeks away. Let's address the issue of player wellness, medical care and insurance with the likes of coaches Sean Wijey, Tavita Tulagese, Imthi Mariks, Nilufer Ibrahim, and their response is pretty universal.
My mate Lasantha Basnayake, easily the most qualified physiotherapist around, with a vast record of hands on experience, specifically, sports medical knowledge, is the perfect source and ideal man to change the environment. The "A" list, the who's who of our current rugby fraternity.
Fazil Marija, Danuska Ranjan, Ratwatte, Dulaj, Omalka, Richie Dharmapala, Dinusha Chaturanga, Srinath Sooriyabandara, a growing list... National players, club and school reps, who have been past the Sports Ministry medical facility - will happily admit to how much time and care is actually needed. If push comes to shove there is massive concern about the lack of qualified sports physiotherapists on board and available. The medical facility at Torrington must have the ability to rehabilitate, advise, guide and recover players, naturally National caps the biggest priority.
Professor Arjuna as captain of that ship well understands the massive contribution required, and is responsible for the big step up, in proper care.
Sport in Sri, and particularly, an impact sport like rugby, needs that confidence and clinical care, the experts, the facilities, the equipment and the ability to inspire belief and high performance at all levels.
In case you are wondering, yes I have spent my fair share of screaming and biting pencils, as the physio expertly manipulated torn hamstrings, ultra sensitive calcified heels that have a love hate relationship with golf balls (those who know, will grimace) and broken fingers that defy description, jaws, shoulders bruised and colour-toned, ankles that have twisted and turned inside the boots beyond convention. Percentage injuries that must be sorted and timelined for return to the middle.
Thank goodness for the likes of "Lassa" and the time taken to provide expert care and advise ...much thanks also to k tape in all its fashionable go fast colours and designs. Ultra useful to all recovery and player wellness from school via club and rep rugby, to full internationals on duty for the flag, against the might of Asia in 15s, and the world's best in Hong Kong at the 7s.
Rugby is a warrior sport in every sense of the given word...perhaps the hardest we play While the experts and pundits ponder these facts and the recently concluded...simply magnificent World cup in sunny England ...we need to turn our radar to the warmer shores here in sunnier Ceylon, Taprobana, that feisty Pearl of Sri.
Club rugby is still the pinnacle of local sport, glam to the core and skills on both sides of the touchline. Fashion is a high maintenance facility for the billboard clashes in Colombo and the hill capital. Planning will be key, to hit the stands for Havelocks v Kandy and CR's trip through the Kadugannawa tunnel ...what mouth watering prospects for pure fans ...what tantalizing possibilities for the players to shine ...the mind races, the heart beats a step faster, as scorelines flitter past. Kandy is the team to beat, the team to target and the team both CR and Havies need bonus points from. Interesting that both return matches are in Kandy @ Nittawela.
X'mas cheer for the capacity partisan supporters, who will intimidate and scream every pass, every lineout, every scrum, each tackle .but the try cheer is resounding...and matched for shock, only by the silence, when the opposition scores.
Timeless traditions that make Nittawela an intense and fiery cauldron.
First round form and skilled finishing have one clear Bilal Hassen as the leading try scorer and overall leader with 8 tries, Yoshitha Rajapaksa 7 tries, and Fazil Marija 6 tries ....much anticipation about the final top scorer, once the league concludes....but for now, Police can shine some light, on their quiet uneventful season, bar Tank Hassens low gravity skills and appetite for ripping balls at rucks and mauls. Hassen also constitutes a list of elite players, who have Japanese club scouts looking closely at the likes of ...Shenal Dias, Sooriyabandara, Gayan Weeraratne, Willarwara, Muthuthantri, Fazil Marija, Dhanushka 'Gertha' Perera, Danushka Ranjan, Nigel Ratwatte, etc...
Good news for the likes of club debutants Omalka Gunaratne, last year's Isipathana and current junior National captain who is making his league mark this year. Havies Kevin 'Kutty' Dixon, another player, certainly matching the best club players and earning respect, despite the 'new kid' status.
On the official front, there is eager anticipation that the SLRFU will sort the legal issues, get its rugby council appointed, and have our house shipshape and administrating the game at all levels, sooner rather than later.
The year 2016 is upon us and the league champion just weeks away from that distinction, a place of honour and national pride. All the months of hard work, hours in the gym and hundreds of metres clocked at pace...all part of making a complete team.
The game defines a team, the distinction between average, good, exceptional and brilliant from 0 to 80mins ...the measure of strength, effort, fight, endurance, skill, pace, power and work rate, completing the list. Consistency is the key.
All hail the experts who can predict the Dialog league champions 2016. Enjoy the intensity and the confrontation as the 2nd round kicks off. Big hand for the fittest warriors who transform the game and elevate the realms of possibility. Bula bula island rugby!!!

SRK and Amitabh Bachchan pictures sure to demand a Mohabbatein repeat
The actors look amazing in this picture and we are beaming with pride!
Baadshah and Shahenshah together...too much fun!
For us, Bollywood stars never age. They were perfect, they are perfect and they always will be perfect. Our love for them is unconditional. So we always want our stars to be in harmony with each other because that's when we get some of the best clicks like this rare picture of Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan which will make you go Aww! They are the Shahenshah and Baadshah of Bollywood and when they come together, it's nothing less than grand! This image proves what they can do to your senses if they are in a single frame. This is a picture of Shah Rukh and AB's first cover shoot for a magazine. The Dilwale actor last year had tweeted this and one more picture from this shoot saying, "My 1st ever foto shoot with the Maestro.I remember I rested my hand on his shoulder ever so lightly lest I 'soil' him." That's the respect SRK has for AB talking in this post. Nobody can match the awesomeness of the Bachchan! He is just INCREDIBLY good actor! Check out the lovely tweet here.
The picture has AB getting his hair right while SRK held the mirror. Although it's SRK's side profile, you can still make out the mischief on his face. This image should go down in Bollywood's wall of fame if there is one! What say people

Suriya starrer S3's first look revealed
The shooting for the third installment of the action/crime franchise has officially begun.
Kollywood actor Suriya has had his share of good and bad movies. But the one which really brought him huge success was the 2010 action masala film Singam. After the raving reception, the Tamil actor teamed up again with director Hari to make Singam 2 in 2013, which was also as big a hit as its predecessor. So Singam 3 was a very natural choice for the Kollywood hunk.
Much to the delight of the fans, the first look of Singam 3 titled as S3 has been unveiled. The first look photos look very interesting and shows the macho Kollywood star's face merged with that of a lion with the words THE UNIVERSAL COP emblazoned on top of the poster.
There are also photos of Suriya sporting his trademark Singam mustache and looking very cool and stylish in a pair of black shades. Shooting of S3 has started today and the movie is expected to be released sometime this year. Other than Suriya, Shruti Haasan and Aushka Shetty also play leading roles in the movie.
Although the storyline of Singam 1 and 2 were rather predictable and we hope S3 adopts a fresher plot-line. We wish the actor director duo luck so that S3 becomes an even bigger success than the first two parts. BollywoodLife

'Theravada Bikkhu Bill to empower Sangha Adhikarana decisions'
The new draft Bill introduced in Parliament to promote Theravadha Bikkhu dialogue is envisaged to empower Adhikarana Sangha Sabhas, Chief Incumbent of Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya temple Most Ven Prof Bellanwila Wimalarathana Nayaka Thera stated yesterday.
The Bill was introduced with the knowledge of the Maha Nayaka Theras belonging to the Three Chapters. The Bill was moved in Parliament by Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatillake.
"At present, there is no situation as such where laymen or law enforcement authorities would be empowered to dictate terms on members of the Maha Sangha or that they would be entitled to monitor their discipline," said Ven Prof Wimalarathana Thera. "The normal law would take its course on Buddhist monks as it would be on others," he said. "The Bill seeks to empower the Adhikarana Sangha Sabhas or the disciplinary councils of the Maha Sangha, so as to enable them with legal powers to carry out its decisions with regard to the conduct of bikkhus," the Nayaka Thera explained. Asked if the Nayaka Theras approved that bikkhus should not obtain driving licenses which could be described as a violation of a fundamental right, the thera said, "There is a consensus among the community of the Buddhist clergy and laymen that monks should not be drivers. There is immense respect attached to it," he said.
"If we permitted monks to obtain driving licenses and drive motor cars, you would soon see monks on the driving seat carrying laymen in their cars. It is the laymen who attend on monks. It has been a cultural aspect and one born out of respect for monks," he said.
Commenting on the situation that some monks are running occult service establishments, the Nayaka Thera said, "There was a case recently in Avissawella, where a lay family had been affected by some activities of a so called guru haamuduruwo at an astrology office. We just cannot afford such instances to manifest."
"These are things we have discussed with those who had presented this Bill.
However, I must get a copy of the draft Bill, as I have not seen it yet," he added.
