Economic reforms making role of accountants increasingly important
With more economic reforms, the role of accountants too has become increasingly important, stressed Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the 2017 annual convocation of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CASL) recently at BMICH recently. CASL has played a great role in producing Chartered Accountants for over 57 years.
The role of well qualified accountants has become increasingly important to the economy. Sri Lankan Chartered Accountants earn high respect both at local and international levels and due to the high quality and integrity they show their reputation is widely known.
This is the reason they are highly employable said Minister Bathiudeen.
Every year the institute produces hundreds of new Chartered Accountants who go on to become corporate professionals and leading accountants. I commend the institute for propagating the importance of this qualification to every part of Sri Lanka affording the opportunity to the youth in the country including rural areas to realise their professional dreams while commanding local and international recognition and respect.
I am given to understand that a new Certified Accountants institution is to be established as a private MP bill and the Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka are worried as they are not pleased of its accounting standards and it could overcrowd the profession here and bring down the standards. I believe any new accountancy body to be established should take care to not degrade the reputation and integrity of Lankan chartered accountants.
I shall facilitate some discussions with the relevant Member together with you and to sort this out.
The fact that the institute offers a large number of scholarships annually is yet another encouraging development and shows CASLs commitment to promote economically backward but promising students across the country.
CASL, under the purview of Ministry of Industry and Commerce is one of the largest accounting and financial professional bodies in the country with a growing Student Member strength (over 44000 at present) and with another 5600 Professional Member strength.
Joining Minister Bathiudeen at the convocation were CASL President Lasantha Wickremasinghe. At the event Minister Bathiudeen too awarded some certificates to new Associates & Fellow Members.

Universities play important role in national unity
Universities play an important role in national unity and reconciliation, which is the need of the day. Hence, we must all work hard to achieve this goal, keeping in mind that all of us are Sri Lankans, said former President and Office of the National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairperson Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga.
She was addressing the academics, students and staff of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka at the Auditorium of the Engineering Faculty, recently.
UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva, Vice Chancellor Prof.MMM Najim, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Dr. S. M. Junaideen and the Co-Coordinator of ONUR Eng. M. B. Murshid received the former president and her officials at the Faculty of Engineering.
Explaining the objective and the purpose of setting up of ONUR to the academics and the students of the university, former President Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga said that ONUR was set up with the commitment to achieve national unity and reconciliation, to give effect to this pledge.
She added, The war that lasted for 30 years and brought heavy losses of human life and properties of Sri Lanka, has now come to an end and peace prevails; however, the people of Sri Lanka are still not enjoying a healthy peaceful situation. In order to make this reality, we are striving hard to achieve this goal and we thought universities are ideal places to initiate this project. She announced that seven universities have been selected to implement this project. She said university students can be utilized as agents for positive changes by conducting various activities based on interest of each higher institute. She also expressed her confidence that that as this universities consist of all three communities, this project can be given a big boost and appealed to all students to work constructively.
University staff and the students raised various questions at the open discussions which followed.
UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva, Vice Chancellor Prof. Najim and Dean Dr. S. M. Junaideen also spoke. Certificates were issued to the students who performed cultural programmes at the conclusion of the ceremony. Co-Ordinator M. B. Murshid proposed the vote of thanks.

## Title: Accessible tourism for all

Accessible tourism for all
World Tourism Day has been celebrated since 1980 on September 27, the day in which the Statutes of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) entered into force.
Official celebrations of World Tourism Day 2017 will be held in Qatar. The UN General Assembly declared the year ahead as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development with the emphasis on Tourism as a driver of economic growth.
Sustainable tourism is all about economic growth with cultural preservation and social inclusiveness - accessibility being an indispensable element.
It is defined as: Tourism that respects both local people and the traveller  their needs and expectations, cultural heritage and the environment. It seeks to benefit the people of the host country. It should take full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental positive impacts.
Open your eyes!
Taleb Rifai, Secretary-General, World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in his official message stated: Last year alone, 1.2 billion travellers crossed international borders in one single year.
In just 12 years - by 2030 - this number will increase by 50% to become 1.8 billion. The question, as we celebrate World Tourism Day 2017, is how we can enable this powerful global transformative force - these 1.8 billion opportunities - to contribute to make this world ACCESSIBLE to all of them with safety and dignity and thereby to advance sustainable development.
Ageing is inevitable for everyone and sets new needs that shape travel decisions.
People over 65 years are those who have the time, desire and purchasing power to travel. It is estimated that they make up at least 16% of the world travelling population.
Globally, it is estimated that there are nearly 1 billion persons with restricted mobility, as well as another 2 billion people, such as spouses, children and caregivers of such persons, those temporarily immobile, representing almost a third of the worlds population, who are directly affected by dis-Ability.
This signifies a huge potential market for travel and tourism. But, it still remains vastly under-served due to inaccessible travel and tourism facilities and services, and discriminatory policies and practices.
The world of travel and tourism is a people-oriented fast growing industry. The ACCESS and SAFETY needs of world touring population are diverse. But every human has the right to enjoy leisure and tourism without obstacles.
Failure to provide safe and equal access to a facility or equal treatment in a service - such as in tourism - constitutes discrimination.
Planning for as broad a range of travellers as possible implies planning for people with varying physical and sensory abilities. It will enable them to take an active part in travel and tourism with minimal risk of injury.
Enabling that to happen is an indispensable lucrative business opportunity providing rich dividends for companies and destinations.
Also, businesses have a moral duty, social responsibility and a legal obligation to make their facilities accessible equally to everyone.
Accessibility in tourism promoting universal accessibility was the international theme for the year ended.
It is about the commitment, endeavour and creation of tourist destinations to ensure that built environments and facilities, products and services are accessible and cater for the needs of the widest possible range of travellers with safety, regardless of their physical limitations or age.
Then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, last year in his official message, concluded even with modern technologies, those with visual, hearing, mobility or cognitive impairments are being marginalised or left behind in many tourism destinations.
Five goals
Last year at the Worlds Tourism day held in Bangkok, the following goals were recognised for Accessible Tourism to include:
(i) Hotels and guest houses that can cater for the essential facilities and safety needs of everyone, focusing the principles of universal design.
(ii)Clearer, precise, more accessible and reliable information on accessibility and safety of tourism facilities, products and services for these sectors.
(iii)Adequate overall training for tourism professionals at all levels.
(iv)Accessibility standards and guidelines throughout the tourism sector.
(v)Independent assessments by truly competent accessibility experts to evaluate these provisions against internationally accepted design standards.
Where exactly are we today
Sri Lanka Tourism is yet to get off the ground with Accessible Tourism. The travelling population with physical and sensory impairments remains an overlooked growth market.
Their high spending potential remains untapped due to lack of right facilities, failure of staff to acquire the skills necessary to attract and serve them knowledgably, and absence of marketing skills to earn their business.
Bits and pieces of facilities here and there cannot systemically target them to serve the purpose well enough nor bring the advantages Accessible Tourism can bring us.
None of these five goals identified last year is yet recognised by Sri Lanka tourism.
No wonder, importantly, increasing numbers of travellers complain that the facilities and accessibility needs they booked are not the ones they truly find on arrival here.
Assessments and evaluation by independent accessibility experts for compliance with minimum standards and access regulations are completely overlooked in awarding certificates of conformity and assigning 4 or 5 or 6 star grades.
Toilets and wash facilities at most 5 and even newly given 6 star hotels remain safety hazards even for the ambulant. Often they are inaccessible for independent travellers using wheelchairs. Basic safety features are either missing or wrongly positioned.
Most restaurants and ballrooms do not even have a single accessible table or a nearby accessible toilet, causing many embarrassments to seniors attending weddings.
Emergency alarms are unheard of even by most city hotels. There are several reputed hotels awarded 5-stars without even a single room with proper essential access facilities!
Although the ruling given by the apex court of the country in April 2011, and the accessibility regulations that are in force approved unanimously by the Parliament of Sri Lanka on March 20, 2007, state the minimum number of rooms that must comply with design standards, they are never taken into any serious consideration in granting STAR statuses in the classification of hotels.
Even after 10 years, these court rulings and laws are yet not incorporated into UDA Building regulations.
We also have ratified in 2016 a UN Convention of 2006 to assure the world that immediate steps will be taken to ensure that the people with limited ability in Sri Lanka shall start enjoying their inherent rights.
This is just another Convention Sri Lanka is failing to honour as promised. We cannot fool all the people always!
Accessibility experts our missing link
Accessibility experts perform a highly responsible specialised job, involving money, time and effort concerning precious human life.
It requires a good in-depth understanding of intricacies, adequate practical experience and thorough working knowledge that goes beyond textbook knowledge.
It is not one where standards and specifications can just be read and applied in vital tasks.
Politicians and decision makers here still believe that the architects and engineers in the building construction industry are alone competent enough to break barriers and establish a just society inclusive to all. Looking at reality proves that, absence of the services of experienced accessibility experts is a very costly blunder that fuels social exclusion and loss of business opportunities and good name. This adverse trend is reversible.
Proposed plan of action
The Justice Ministry on high priority must take immediate steps to ensure Laws and Court Orders of which failure to implement thereby are affecting the lives of the largest minority of Sri Lanka estimated at 20% of our population are enforced enabling to enjoy their Inherent Right to Access public facilities with dignity and without marginalisation, regardless of their degree of ability.
The goal the Ministry of Justice should achieve here is: all facilities at up-coming cities, towns, basic urban infrastructures and; services under new Mega-polis agenda, hotel industry in particular that the public will use in daily life, shall comply with court orders and accessibility regulations.
As UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai concludes, you should be the change you want to see and may you be an ambassador and activist to bring these changes for Sri Lanka to become the tourism destination of choice soon.

Anthonians rally around one flag
St Anthonys College, Wattala will celebrate its Diamond jubilee this year. To coincide with its Diamond Jubilee, the college has embarked on a mega development programme to bestow a facelift to it with the help of its old boys, to be on par with major national schools in Colombo.
Fund raisers
The Alumni of St Anthonys College, Wattala has organised a fund raising project to develop the school in a 10 year project.
Sub projects in the pipeline include; renovation of the main gate with the 75th anniversary emblem, parents waiting area which will be unveiled soon, visitors rest room and the science room.
The quadrangle has been already completed. Primary school building which is now under construction is a project worth 45 million rupees. The government has funded this project, said J. D. L. Dinuka who is the President of the Old Boys Association of the college.
Our strength is our Alumni. We have resourceful old boys holding top positions in the corporate sector, in the media fraternity as well as in the business sphere within the country. Old boys who live in other countries too are doing extremely well. We want to communicate with them and get them to rally around us to bring back the past glory to our Alma-Mater, he said.
Mega carnival
Alumni member Sanjeewa Weerasinghe said a friendly walk followed by a mega carnival and a musical extravaganza with the Marians is scheduled to be held on September 23.
The Walk will commence at 2pm from the college grounds. College T shirts, caps and souvenirs are already distributed among old boys and can be obtained by participants. The college expects a gamut of old boys and parents to participate in the Walk with teachers to induce strength to the fund raising project, he said.
A raffle draw will be held to give away loads of prizes in the latter part of the day after the Walk at the carnival before the musical show begins.
Rector of the College, Rev Father Mal Warnashantha Fernando said the Government, Sri Lanka Cricket, private sector and old boys of the college are helping to make this endeavor a success. This is a 10 year project and by 2028 we will see our college in the clan of major government schools in Colombo, he said.
Memories
Ranjan de Silva said completing 75 years is significant to the college thus a souvenir will be printed on the history of the college.
The souvenir will carry each and every students photograph with teachers photographs. Old boys now living abroad can extend their warm wishes to their Alma Mater via the advertisements on the souvenir, he said.
An old boy, Hirantha Perera said the Jubilee Dance will be held on November 11 at Grandeeza Hotel, Negombo.
Reuniting
Invitations are already extended to old boys who live overseas and we look forward to their participation at this occasion. We intend to re-unite with our long-lost friends of St Anthonys College, Wattala.
We hope old boys living outside Colombo too will rally around the college to elevate it to the next level.
We will reach out to them as they are doing extremely well in the society and network with them in our regular get-togethers and functions, he said.
Chief organizer of Anthonians Sixes Denver Fernando said a Cricket Carnival will be held with the participation of 27 cricket teams from leading schools to raise funds to construct the college pavilion.

Binoy Surendra
Charismatic Journalist
My association with Binoy Kumar Wickrama Surendra goes back to the time we were together during my days at Lake House in the 1960's. I was attached to the advertising Department then. Very often, I used to visit the Dinamina editorial to meet my long-standing friend Thilaka Kuruwita Bandara who was a sub-editor there. It was then that I met Binoy Surendra who too was a sub-editor.
I remember that we struck an immediate rapport and I found in him something unique not only as a journalist, but also as a gentlemen. He possessed wonderful human qualities, the epitome of compassion for the needy, among other virtues. Sharing is one of the greatest joys in life, and we regularly shared our knowledge and happiness with our friends at Lake House.
He was an understanding person to whom one could go with problems even of a very personal nature. He had moral stature and was a guiding light and a mentor to me and was concerned about my welfare.
It was by sheer hard work and because of his integrity that he rose to the top as a sub-editor and associate-editor. His veins were filled with ink and he made catchy headlines that proved his journalistic excellence, also as a page maker.
In 1979, when television was introduced to Sri Lanka, he sensed a huge potential for growth in TV technology. Consequently, he started the Institute of Television Technology (ITVT) during the same year. This school of TV technology, which was the first in this country, fulfilled a great national need of that time.
I remember the day it was launched followed by a colourful conference with the participation of leading media experts including Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the then Director Information, Dr. Anura Gunasekera, Tissa Abeysekera, Andrew Jayamane, Leslie Bothegue, Edwin Ariyadasa, H. M. Gunasekera, Mahinda Ranaweera and Givantha Arthasad.
From the youngest to the oldest, students took part in variety of programmes such as film script-writing, TV techniques, themes and camera work etc. These courses were conducted according to the syllabus and guidelines of the City and Guilds Institute of London by able instructor engineer Jayantha Gunawardane of the Ceylon Air Force. Some of these students, who play a prominent role in today's society include: Sumithra Rahubadha, Anoma Rajakaruna, Padmini Abeysekera, Gordon Silva, Sisira Wijesinghe and Ananda Dissanayake.
Binoy was the only child of one-time media giant Sirus W. Surendra who also did a prominent role in the film Dingiri Menika.' Binoy was married to ayurvedic doctor Mallika Hemalatha Perera and blessed with three daughters and a son. Binoy was a inspiration to all who knew him.
It will be ever so difficult for Mallika, his daughters Chandima, Athma, Vinodha and his son, Ranga, to come to grips with the reality the void created by his absence.
It will be a constant reminder that the affectionate tower of strength behind their family is no more. He passed away on August 20 at the age of 76.
His death was a tremendous blow to us all. Binoy did not realize that his time to leave this world would come so soon, leaving all of us in tears.
I salute you for your passion for and commitment to journalism, for your nurturing of others, your deep devotion to your family and your understanding, acceptance and love.
On behalf of your family and friends, dearest Binoy, I say goodbye. Hopefully to meet you once again as a journalist in the journey of Sansara.

Mano Muthukrishna
A true trailblazer
Mano Muthukrishna, whom I always called 'darling,' was an outstanding woman who will live on in the minds and hearts of all who knew her. Her fragrance will always permeate and her memory remain entrenched, for she was truly a trailblazer and one who raised the bar for both men and women.
Manoramabai was her full name and like her name, there was much that was distinctive about her. She made a lasting impression on me when as a schoolgirl. I first set eyes on this regal woman, stunningly beautiful, elegantly clad and upright of bearing. Piercing of eye and sharp of wit, nothing missed darling!
She had an iron will and determination to get things done despite all odds and put her heart and soul into all she undertook. Latterly despite her age, her social and professional calendar rivalled that of her daughters Ramola and Sharadha, who were often amazed at her stamina and sheer energy.
Blessed with parents who instilled in her the fact that women could do anything, she sought throughout her life to empower people and help them. She immersed herself in the lives of others and this was why she was such a great listener, conversationalist and friend, a mine of information on any subject. Always well-informed and abreast of both local and international news, Darling prided herself on being current! In fact, till recently, she was on Facebook and e-mail!
She was of course meticulous with detail and especially with the English. The staff at the Polytechnic were totally loyal to her and were tremendously proud of their association with someone of her calibre . A dedicated professional and ardent social worker, Darling introduced the Zonta movement to Sri Lanka 50 years ago.
The Club in Colombo is part of Zonta International and she was the Charter Secretary of Zonta Club 1 of Colombo which is celebrating its jubilee year this year. She inaugurated Zonta Club 2 of Colombo and Zonta now has four Clubs in Colombo and one in Kandy.
The Zonta Woman of Achievement Awards was her brainchild which she started 35 years ago and continues to this day. She was also a member and office bearer of the Sri Lanka Women's Conference, a founder member of the Women's Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the Founder President of the SAARC Women's Organisation, an active member and an office bearer of the Forum on Ageing an NGO which cares for the elderly, while she was also committed to the Colombo Chetty Association.
She held the position of Representative for Trinity College, London, for several years and also represented the Institute of Financial Accountants, UK and was the Chairperson of The Polytechnic Pvt Ltd. for many years.
A woman of strong principles, Darling knew only right and wrong and had no patience with the many shades of grey so prevalent today.
She was so very proud of her daughters and her many grandchildren and great grandchildren, who continue to uphold her values and ethics.
Darlings physical presence may be absent, but her enduring spirit and all she stood for and upheld in life will continue to live on.
In fact, Im convinced that even up there with the Almighty, Darling will be trailblazing in her own inimitable style!
In her own words, what I do know for sure is that the good things in my life have far, far outweighed the bad, and I thank God for sustaining me through the best and worst of life. At least life was never dull.

S. de S. Jayasinghe
He was a strong pillar
Forty years ago on September 26, 1977, S. de S. Jayasinghe, then Minister of Fisheries in the J. R. Jayawardane government, passed away. His sudden death was indeed a very sad moment not only to his family, but to the people of Dehiwela as well.
He was a humble human being, a man of all seasons, he left a legacy etched in the hearts of all those touched by him.
Born on January 6, 1911, in Papeliyana, a village suburb to Colombo City, he had his education at Ananda Sasthralaya, Kotte. He was in Government Service for a short period. Thereafter, he commenced his own business and became a very successful businessman who helped the needy. Senior citizens of this area still remembers him granting them season tickets for free of travel in his bus service, The Gamini Bus Co. Ltd., which was nationalised as a policy of the Bandaranaika government.
In 1944, he entered politics from the UNP, contesting the Dehiwela-Mt. Lavinia Urban Council.
He was elected as the chairman. During the 33 years for his Local Government Politics, he was the Mayor of the Dehiwela-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council as well. In 1952, he contested the Parliamentary election, defeated Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and was elected to Parliament. Again in 1965, he won the Parliamentary election and was appointed a Deputy Minister. In 1977, he was appointed as a Cabinet Minister. Jayasinghe was a strong pillar to the UNP. His services to the party were honest and dedicated. He closely associated the late leaders of the UNP Rt. D. S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Sir John Kotalawela and J. R. Jayawardane. I still could remember very well, J. R. Jayawardane as the Prime Minister in 1977 attending Jayasinghe's funeral. In his speech, he said Jayasinghe accompanied him as a brave man at the protest march in 1957 from Colombo to Kandy.
As a strong Buddhist, he worked very closely with the clergy and offered a memorable service to his religion. Colombo South Kalubowila Hospital and pipe-borne water to the Dehiwela Mt. Lavinia City limits are two projects launched during his term of office. His sudden departure from our midst certainly created a vaccum which is not easy to forget. But Jayasinghe has gifted us a daughter who was couragous enough to step in to her father's shoes and follow his foot steps. On November 11, 1977, people of Dehiwela elected Sunethra Ranasinghe as their representative. Since then, for the last 40 years, she has continued her father's commitments successfully to the betterment of the people. S. de S. Jayasinghe left us 40 years ago, but memories of him are in our hearts for ever.
May you attain Nirvana!

Dr. Sarath Abeykoon
A compassionate doctor
It is not only because Dr. Sarath Abeykoon was my Consultant Oncologist that I decided to write this tribute. To me, he was more than that. While I was undergoing Tomotherapy at Ceylinco Healthcare Services Ltd., I used to see him moving around and on many an occasion he would stop to talk to a patient if he casually came across one.
Dr. Abeykoon revelled in taking down copious notes of the consultation process with red and blue ball point pens. Time didnt matter to him. I had 37 sessions of Tomotherapy. After that I had the longest period of remission in the entire history of my cancer. As cancer does most often, it returned and in my case metastasized to lung cancer. So along with my niece Sandya Salgado, I had to visit Dr. Abeykoon after a relatively long period of time. He remembered and recognised me at once. He examined thoroughly all the X-ray plates and simply asked me so whats the problem I said I have lung cancer and thats why I came to see you. Patiently and convincingly, he explained to me that there was nothing that could be done therapeutically at my age; had I been fifty years younger, there would have been other options available to him. He said my cancer was on the peripheral part of the lung, but could change to haemorrhaging at the centre, in which event he would have to give me some palliative radiation.
Dr. Abeykoon loved repartee. Some would say the patient knows best and being human always lives in hope. I hadnt realized that I had succumbed to this conventional wisdom when I asked Dr. Abeykoon about a PET scan He sharply reacted when he said do you want your PET scan framed and hung on your bedroom wall
With the calmness and righteousness of a mature visionary, he thus defined for me lifes inevitability.
But portentously he said I will be on leave for six weeks and you can see me only then. Having said that, he got up from his seat, held my wheelchair and pushed it until up to the entrance of his consultancy room, filled with compassion.
How often do we see consultants (even those whom we know personally) recognize and greet you while you are waiting in the room with other patients How often will a consultant get up from his seat to greet you How often will a consultant push your wheelchair and even if you can find one, how long is a consultant prepared to spend time during a consultation
To Dr. Sarath Abeykoon, these things did not matter. The total time he spent with me at the last consultation was over an hour. And that hour reflected a part of a man whose values and of professionalism and humanity transcended pure personal gain.

You were the greatest father anyone could ever have. Death may have taken you away from us, but our lifes hero youll forever be. We miss you everyday.
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana!

Attn: Pancake-People
I type on my laptop's screen, "Is the Internet making us stupid". Press enter. In 0.39 seconds I receive 16,000,000 results. I feel frustrated  the fact that I have to Google to check my own stupidity is surely an indication of my increasing idiocy.
And, the scariest part is, I can feel it. I can feel my mind is changing. I feel it the most when I am reading. There used to be a time when I could completely immerse myself in a book for hours and hours. My mind would get so caught up in the narrative I find myself blissfully submerged in long stretches of prose. But sadly not anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, I lose track, without giving it a seconds thought, I stop reading and search for something else to do. I feel as if I have to force my brain to stop wondering  often to my Facebook, WhatsApp or email accounts. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.
A recent study (if you are into technology in a big way, as most of us are these days, you would probably have forgotten it by now) suggests 90 per cent of us are suffering from digital amnesia. More than 70 per cent of people don't know their sibling's phone numbers by heart, and 49 per cent have not memorized their partner's number. While those of us who grew up in a landline-only world may also remember friends' home numbers from that era, we are unlikely to know their current mobiles, as our phones do the job. The study conducted by the Kaspersky Lab concludes we don't commit data to memory because of the "Google Effect"  we're safe in the knowledge that answers are just a click away, and are happy to treat the web like an extension to our own memory.
Dr Maria Wimber, lecturer at the University of Birmingham's School of Psychology, endorses this fact, saying, the Internet simply changes the way we handle and store information, so the Google Effect "makes us good at remembering where to find a given bit of information, but not necessarily what the information was. It is likely to be true that we don't attempt to store information in our own memory to the same degree that we used to, because we know that the Internet knows everything."
These findings echo Columbia University Professor Betsy Sparrow's research on the Google Effect on memory, which concluded, "Our brains rely on the Internet for memory in much the same way they rely on the memory of a friend, family member or co-worker. We remember less through knowing information itself than by knowing where the information can be found."
This even extends to photographs. A Fairfield University study in 2003 found that taking photos reduces our memories. Participants were asked to look around a museum, and those who took photos of each object remembered fewer objects and details about them than those who simply observed. Dr Wimber says: "One could speculate that this extends to personal memories, as constantly looking at the world through the lens of our smartphone camera may result in us trusting our smartphones to store our memories for us. This way, we pay less attention to life itself and become worse at remembering events from our own lives."
Phone cameras apart, frequent users of smartphones quickly get used to the auto-complete function of their devicesthe way they need only type a few letters and the phone fills in the rest. Maybe too used to it, in fact. According to research published in the journal Bioelectromagnetics this handy function seems to make adolescent users faster, but less accurate, when responding to a battery of cognitive tests.
Meanwhile, astudy led by researchers at the University of Coventry in Britain surveyed a group of eight- to twelve-year-olds about their texting habits, then asked them to write a sample text in the lab. The scientists found that kids who sent three or more text messages a day had significantly lower scores on literacy tests than children who sent none.
It appears even something as seemingly harmless as an email could be harmful to our brains. Trying to answer messages while also completing other work makes us measurably less intelligent. Glenn Wilson, psychiatrist at Kings College London University, monitored employees over the course of a workday and found that those who divided their attention between email and other tasks experienced a 10-point decline in IQ. Their decrease in intellectual ability was as great as if they had missed a whole nights sleep, and twice as great as if they are addicted to drugs.
So, how do we get out of this mess Anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell, thinks it's easy. She says technology "helps us live smarter" as we are able to access answers. "Being able to create a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, as you quickly work out what information you want to extract and identify the app to help achieve this. To me, this suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness." She gives the example of a new mother trying to work out whether her baby staying awake most of the night is bad  and when to start worrying. "These are all questions that technology may be able to address quicker than calling your own parents," she says. "This isn't making consumers more dumb, instead it's helping them to think smarter."
In contrast, Nicholas Carr, author of 'The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Think, Read and Remember' believes we should be alarmed. "We're missing the real danger, that human memory is not the same as the memory in a computer: it's through remembering that we make connections with what we know, what we feel, and this gives rise to personal knowledge. If we're not forming rich connections in our own minds, we're not creating knowledge. Science tells us memory consolidation involves attentiveness: it's in this process that you form these connections."
Carr believes our brains are not like hard drives, or refrigerators that can get overstuffed so there's no more room. In contrast, he says they expand: "It's not as if remembering and thinking are separate processes. The more things you remember, the more material you have to work on, the more interesting your thoughts are likely to be," he says. In an essay written sometime ago, the playwright Richard Foreman eloquently described whats at stake: I come from a tradition of Western culture, in which the ideal (my ideal) was the complex, dense and cathedral-like structure of the highly educated and articulate personalitya man or woman who carried inside themselves a personally constructed and unique version of the entire an entire heritage. [But now] I see within us all (myself included) the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of selfevolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the instantly available.
As we are drained of our inner repertory of dense cultural inheritance, Foreman concluded, we risk turning into pancake peoplespread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button.
Pancake People! Urgggh! Off I go; to switch off my laptop and smartphone; to pick up 'The Brother's Karamazov', shake off the dust and start reading. If you want to contact me, send a smoke signal.

Why technology makes you stupider
1. Tech makes it impossible to sleep.
Studies have shown that blue-enriched light, which is emitted by gadgets like smartphones, tablets and laptops makes it impossible to make you stick to a proper sleep schedule.
2. You are easily distracted.
3. You cant remember much...
Technologys tendency to butt into whatever else you are doing makes it more difficult to form new memories.
4. So you are relying on the Internet to remember things for you.
5. You are much more forgetful than you used to be.
6. You cant find your way around without GPS.

Beat breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most-commonly diagnosed cancer in women. Breast cancer begins with the formation of a malignant tumor in the breast. A malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into nearby tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry, Dr. Suraj Perera (MBBS, MSc, MD) speaks about breast cancer which is also common among Sri Lankan women.
Q : Who are at risk of developing breast cancer
A: The women with a past history of breast cancer/breast condition, a family history of breast or ovarian cancers are prone to breast cancer. Infertility, first child birth after 35 years, low parity, not breast fed or breast fed only for a short period, attended puberty before 11 years, menopause after 55 years, use of oral contraceptive pills five years or more and obesity after menopause are some other factors that can develop breast cancer. High consumption of animal fats, consumption of less fruits and vegetables, less exercise, over consumption of alcohol, active or passive smoking and women with past exposure to radiation can also help develop this condition.
Q : What are the main signs and symptoms of breast cancer
A: Breast cancer does not show any clinical features during early stages. Clinical features appear only with the advancement of the cancer. These clinical features include;
- Skin changes of the breast
- Colour changes of the breast
- Change in shape of the breast
- Orange peel (Pseudo orange) appearance of breast
- Ulceration on the breast
- Late occurrence of breast asymmetry (usually both breasts arenot of equal size. Therefore, a long standing breast asymmetry isnot a sign of a cancer)
- Nipple change/discharge other than breast milk (Having invertednipples from birth is not a sign of a cancer)
- Breast lump or thickening of the breast skin
- Lumps in the arm pit or around the neck
Q : How can breast cancer be detected early
A: A breast cancer can be detected through breast self-examination, a clinical breast examination by a health care worker, or through a mammography and/or an Ultrasound Scan, Non Excision Biopsy - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and or cone biopsy. Clinical breast examination should be done by all women between the ages of 20  40 once in every three years and annually by all women above the age of 40. Mammography should not be done for women bellow the age of 35 unless asked by the doctor. All women between the ages of 50  69 should get a mammography done once in every two years.Genetic testing plays a major role in early detection of breast cancer, especially for women with family history. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are available in Sri Lanka. Testing is done on DNA extracted from peripheral venous blood. Genetic consultations are available at Human Genetics Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Kinsey Road, Colombo 08. Telephone: 0112689545, email: [emailprotected] Working hours: 8 am  4pm (Mondays to Fridays).
Q : How can women wself-examine breast cancer
A: A practice of breast self-examination on monthly basis is very important for early detection of breast cancers. This should be carried out once a month by all women over 20 years of age. This should be conducted on a fixed date every month. It is better to conduct this, one week after the start of menstruation. If she is not menstruating, a fixed date in every month should be used. A woman can use any place that suites her. It can be conducted in a lying down, sitting or a standing position or while bathing. Breast self-examination has two components. They are inspection and palpation.
Q : Where can women find cancer screening if there is anything unusual
A: The first and main place is the SuwaNariSayanaya (well Woman Clinic) in the relevant area of the patient. She can go to her family doctor or another doctor in a state hospital or a private hospital. She can also visit the surgical clinic / breast clinic located in the nearest state hospital. Any Sri Lankan women can also visit the Cancer early detection Centre, No. 516, Elvitigala Mawatha, Colombo 5. The telephone number is 0113159227.
Q : What are the other common female cancers 
A: Cervical Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Oral Cancer, Colon Cancer, Oesophagus Cancer, Uterus Cancer, Leaukaiemia and Lymphoms.
Q : How can women reduce their cancer risks 
A: Do not smoke and do not use any form of tobacco. Make your home smoke free. Be physically active. Enjoy a healthy diet. Limit your alcohol intake. Avoid too much sun and use a sun protection. Breast feed your children as much as possible. Reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution. Vaccinate your children against Hepatitis B and HPV. Take part in organised cancer screening programmes.

## Title: Bird is the word

Bird is the word
On April 12, 1784, Mozart completed the score of his Piano Concerto No 17 in G. Six weeks later, he was astonished to hear a whistled fragment of his new piece coming from a pet shop.
Somehow, a caged starling had learned the phrase ahead of the concertos first official performance. The cocky little bird had even given the tune a new twist, tweaking the last two Gs up a semitone. That was wonderful! Mozart wrote in his diary that night, beside a transcription of the avian variation.
Although such a common bird was an unusual choice of pet for the status-conscious composer  wealthy Viennese preferred canaries and parrots  Mozart took it home to join his household during the most productive period of his life.
When the bird died four years later, Mozart was so heartbroken that he held a grand funeral, complete with a poignant eulogy he had written himself.
American naturalist Lyanda Lynn Haupt was intrigued by the bond between the maestro and his little mimic.
Starlings are rarely kept as pets these days (its illegal to take one from the wild in the UK), but they have a long history as domestic companions. Pliny the Elder raised them for study and recorded that Julius Caesar taught them to parle Greek and Latin.
So Haupt and her husband half-inched a five-day-old starling from a local nest she knew was slated for destruction and raised her as a pet, feeding her cat food and playing her regular bursts of Mozart.
Her charming account of life with the bird she christens Carmen demonstrates what extraordinary characters they can be. As hoped, Carmen proves a brilliant impressionist, quickly mastering the sound of a wine bottle opening, the cats miaow and her mistresss call of Cmere honey! More impressively, she learns to make the stopper sound before the wine is opened, greet the cat with a miaow and summon back her mistress with that Cmere honey!
Shes a clever and engaged family member, snuggling onto Haupts shoulder to sleep and pecking at the keys of her computer when she tries to type. She also poops all over the place.
No wonder Mozart loved his starling: he found it easier to compose in a chaotic environment and rejoiced in toilet humour. (He once signed off a letter to his cousin: Oui oui, by the love of my skin, I s*** on your nose, so it runs down your chin.)
Like his starling, Mozart was a brilliant mimic who loved drinking and, when Haupt discovers Carmen has a taste for wine, she imagines the composer sharing a glass with his pet as they bounced musical phrases back and forth, just like the birdcatcher Papageno and his lover in his opera The Magic Flute.
When Mozarts beloved father, Leopold, died in 1787, money problems prevented his famous son from attending the funeral.
Some musicologists have suggested the strange Musical Joke he published shortly afterwards was a consequence of his grief-stricken mind.
But Haupt quotes ornithologists who hear the distinctive patterns of starling song in the piece he wrote during the three years he kept his bird.
Mozarts pet died soon after his father. The two bereavements collided. He mourned them both in music that lives on centuries after his own premature death. Dizzying swarms of notes: rising, soaring, twisting and turning.
On a darker note, Haupt lives in America, where huge flocks of starlings  murmurations  are a serious problem. Theyre believed to cause $800 million of damage to U.S. agriculture each year as they binge-feed in cattle troughs.
A flock of starlings even brought down a passenger plane in 1960, killing 62 people, when hundreds of their bodies were sucked into its engine shortly after take-off from Boston  the worst bird strike in aviation history.
Even the most devoted American bird-lovers despise the robust, invasive species for their ability to outcompete more sensitive native birds, such as bluebirds, chickadees and swallows.
Their emergence in the U.S. is a peculiar story  they were shipped across the Atlantic from England in 1890 by the eccentric pharmacist Eugene Schieffelin.
The misguided Anglophile was on a mission to populate New Yorks Central Park with every species of bird mentioned in the works of Shakespeare.
The chaffinches, nightingales and skylarks he imported all died. But genetic research has proved that the 80 starlings he released are the direct ancestors of all 200 million of the birds that now live across North America.
Perhaps Schieffelin should have read his Shakespeare a little more carefully: the starling described in Henry IV is a curse disguised as a gift . . .

Boom doesnt go bust
Wednesday is World Tourism Day. Ever since its inception the event is celebrated on September 27 to foster awareness among the international community of the importance of tourism and its social, cultural, political and economic value. As the official day set aside in the United Nations calendar the celebration seeks to highlight tourisms potential to contribute to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), addressing some of the most pressing challenges society is faced with today.
The main income sources
This year, the world will celebrate the occasion with a common theme with the focus on Sustainable Tourism  a Tool for Development. As in the past the event also stresses the international significance of aiming to push tourism towards becoming a global industry. Tourism has experienced continued growth and deeper diversification to become one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world. Modern tourism is closely linked to development and includes more new destinations for visitors. Tourism has become one of the major players in international commerce and represents at the same time one of the main income sources for many developing countries. These dynamics have turned the industry into a key driver for socio-economic progress. For our tropical island nation such an event is all the more important to facilitate showcasing the famous Sri Lankan hospitality in the ambiance of a peaceful environment. That is because tourism which was once among our principal foreign exchange earners was dealt a lethal blow by the prolonged secessionist war. The industry was on its knees, suffering a life threatening crisis. Its infrastructure development was brought to a screeching halt. Tourists naturally gave the country a wide berth in the wake of a wave of terrorist bombings. The gruesome scenes of carnage broadcast in the international media stopped even the most intrepid foreign visitors in their tracks.
The empty hotels and hostelries remained in forlorn neglect as testimony to the sad state of the bad times they had fallen on. For thousands who were engaged in the industry the future seemed an extremely bleak one. Clearly, it seemed that it would be only a matter of time before the prevailing visitor drought sounded the death knell for the hospitality sector.
The pessimism was not unfounded because the industry seemed dead and as extinct as the Dodo. And they would have been right because no one had predicted a decisive end to the long drawn out conflict. But now eight years after the terrorist threat was wiped off the face of our nation, the industry is experiencing a miraculous resurrection. Indeed, Sri Lankas tourist arrivals have been continuing to grow sharply after the 30-year conflict ended. It is not only alive and kicking in a peaceful environment, but showing signs of heading for an unmatched surge in attracting holiday-makers. More than two million visitors now head to our tiny Indian Ocean island every year, more than four times the number that came in 2009.
An expansion
Arrivals have been rising every month on a year-on-year basis since the war ended in May 2009. And the government has launched several ambitious projects and promotional campaigns to achieve targeting an annual revenue of US$2.5 billion by 2016 from 2.5 million expected visitors coming to take in our beaches, hill resorts and religious and historic sites.
The year has already witnessed a boom in the tourism industry and the authorities are confident that the new initiative would further spur the activity and benefit the reviving nation. Sri Lankas tourist arrivals rose 2.5 percent in August this year compared to the same period last year, surpassing the 1.4 million arrivals for the year, data released by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) revealed. The month recorded 190,928 tourists arriving in the country compared to the 186,288 arrivals in August 2016. In the first eight months of this year 1,406,854 tourists visited the island compared to the 1,359,906 visited in August 2016, recording an increase of 3.5 percent.
Tourism is the worlds largest export, yet it is ephemeral, produced within an encounter, usually fleeting, between host and guest. It has enormous growth potential and almost every country desires an expansion in this sector. The industry can provide the ideal export for developing countries, such as ours, which can avoid debt by capitalising on what we already have. No one can deny that we have a unique culture, a singular natural environment and a definite place in world history. However, this would mean a huge expense in infrastructure such as major sanitation facilities, local transportation, hydroelectric plants, medical facilities, and hotels.
Over the decades, tourism has experienced continued growth and deepening diversification to become one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world. Modern tourism is closely linked to development and encompasses a growing number of new destinations. These dynamics have turned tourism into a key driver for socio-economic progress.
Becoming the forerunner
Today, the global business volume of tourism equals or even surpasses that of oil exports, food products or vehicles. The sector has become one of the major players in international commerce and represents at the same time one of the main income sources for many developing countries. This growth goes hand in hand with economic and employment benefits.
This world-wide spread of tourism in industrialised and developed states has produced large scale economic and employment benefits in many related sectors - from construction to agriculture and telecommunications. There is no doubt that pent-up demand for Sri Lanka as a hot-spot destination, which has been inaccessible for many years, is driving growth.
Undeniably there are still varied challenges ahead to catch up with our competitors and thrust the industry into becoming the forerunner of our economy. Many neighbouring nations possess similar tropical attractions. Several other countries in the Asian region are blessed with the allure of intriguing paradise isles complete with warm seas and sunny beaches. They have all launched inventive promotional campaigns to sell themselves as prime holiday destinations. All these nations boast international hotel brands which naturally attract high-spending tourists.
But Sri Lanka has far more going for it in the sphere of tourist attractions including remnants of its magnificent civilisation, artistic monuments and an incredible diversity of landscapes, climates and unique flora and fauna. Yet these resources and present boom patterns can and must be translated into long-term sustainable growth to propel our tourism sector to be in the forefront of our economy. [emailprotected]

CIOB, HNB launch green credit card
Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) the pioneer which actively promotes Green constructions in Sri Lanka together with Hatton National Bank (HNB) launched a green credit card for people engaged in the construction industry as well as for professionals recently at the HNB auditorium.
The function was attended by CIOB President, Dr Rohan Karunaratne, Advisor Professor Chitra Wedikkara, Deputy Presidents, Jayakesh Tudawe and Ruwan De Silva, Executive Member Kalana Alwis, and Head of Credit cards HNB, Roshantha Jayatunga, as well as a host of distinguished guests attended the event.
President CIOB Dr. Rohan Karunaratne expressing his ideas said that the latest trend in the construction industry is sustainable construction and green construction, and this is the first time a credit card specializing in these areas is being introduced. He said that the green credit card will help those engaged in the sector to practice these concepts continuously by providing the much needed finance through the green credit card. I thank HNB for coming together with us to support this task.
He further said that most of the mega construction projects are undertaken by large foreign companies due to their strength in finance, manpower, material and other resources.
The local companies cannot compete alone with foreign companies and this is one of the challenges we face and to win this challenge CIOB is trying to gather all large scale construction companies and create a new structure.
We are also having discussions with the government to get small portions of large projects given to foreign companies. The green credit card will encourage green builders and support the endeavors launched by us, said Karunaratna.
Head of Credit cards HNB Roshantha Jaytunga explained the significance of CIOB -HNB Green credit card and said that entrepreneurs and professionals who are members of CIOB can obtain this credit card which is also valid internationally.
Therefore this credit card can be used to make payments locally as well as internationally, and can pay up to Rs one billion while the interest is very nominal. A long time is offered to settle the credit card. In addition when entrepreneurs and professionals go abroad the green credit card will help them immensely.
CIOB is engaged in promoting green construction for the last six years.

The continuous anti-SAITM campaigns, GMOA strikes, boycotts staged on by the medical professionals in front of the Fort railway station put one and all in confusion. Gradually, it has reached its blazing point now. But, some or other, it should end with a concrete solution without protracting the time and energy of the students. All should realize, time is precious and the wasted time cannot be regained at any point. The better the quicker decision and agreement save the life of the students. The great disappointment is that the doctors with great calibre, societal concern and the eminent professors also muscularly show not only negative attitude towards the SAITAM but also discouraging and vehemently rejecting this effort point blankly.
In my point of view, there are many alternative institutions for educational fields to continue, flourish and prowess academically. Likewise, why cant we accommodate private medical colleges in our country to produce skilful doctors by following a set of standard general rules and regulations Indeed, our country needs a number of doctors to serve the people. Be that as it may, building up with positive mind set for the benefit and development of the country rather than sending many of our children to foreign countries spending massive lump sum of money where many of the parents cannot afford. Instead of smashing flatly such newly budded sustainable ventures, the experts of the medical field can associate and cross the stream where it is shallowest and bring the agreement at some critical point to rectify the loopholes that they find and give the proper remedy to this issue no sooner than later despite of total pulling down.
It would be the best service and the enormous responsibility expected from the proficient and excellent medical officers who were worshipped as living Gods once.
Its not the time to fuel but to realize the fact and act swiftly in deliberation. As the adage goes, criticism is something you can avoid by saying nothing, doing nothing and being nothing. For the betterment of the country, we should have broader thoughts rather than being in a limited space.

## Title: Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Local
## Date: Monday, September 25, 2017 - 01:00
Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017
1. The Civil Procedure Code introduced on August 1, 1890, has seen several amendments and the latest amendment has been introduced by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)Act No. 08 of 2017with a view to advance the civil litigation procedure that meets the current needs.
2. The prime objective of the new Act can be viewed as follows;
a. Expeditious litigation process
b. Simplification of administrative procedure
c. Enhance efficiency
d. Reduce delay
e. Inexpensive disposal of actions
3. An important feature in the new Amendment to the Civil Procedure code is that it has introduced both procedural and administrative changes which are important for practicing counsels and instructing attorneys, as well as to judges.
4. Salient areas of focus
 Appointment of registered attorneys
 Service of summons
 Pre-trial proceedings
 Consolidation of action
 Substitution process
5. Appointment of registered attorney
I. The previous Section 27 has been repealed and the introductory provision requires that;
 Proxy must be filed in the format of (Form No 7) of the First schedule. (The same provision in the previous section has been imported )27(1)(a))
 In addition to the address of the registered attorney, at which service of any process can be served, the electronic mail address (if any) should also be included in terms of the new Act. (27(1)(b) and (c))
II. Section 27 (2) (a) requires that where a party is a natural person a memorandum must be submitted nominating a legal representative to carry out a case upon the death of the party.
 The memorandum must be in the form set out in Form No. 7A of the First Schedule set out in the new Act.
 The repealed Section 393will apply in regards to the nomination of legal representatives in filing the memorandum.
III. Revocation of proxy is set out under Section 27 (3), thus the appointment of a registered attorney will be in force until;
a. Revoked by the client in writing by his own motion, with leave of Court and after notice to the registered attorney, signed by the client.
b. Revoked by the registered attorney.
The right of the registered attorney to revoke proxy is a new concept which has been introduced to the legal system. Thus, the registered attorney can revoke the proxy;
i. in writing signed by the client and filed in Court; or
ii. with leave of the court having given thirty days notice to the client.
c. Where the client dies or upon the death or incapacity of the registered attorney; or
d. Where all proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the client
The ambiguity in the previous section has been cured through specifying the procedure as to the instances where the registered attorney and/or client may revoke a proxy.
6. Service of summons and notice
I. Section 29 has been amended and the existing section has been re-numbered as Section 29 (1) which sets out that, any process served on the Registered attorney, or left at the office or residence of such Attorney is presumed to be duly communicated to the party.
II. With the insertion of Section 29 (2), Service of any process, notice or document in the address of the registered attorney
and sent to the electronic mail address, given under section 27(1) is also deemed as sufficient delivery to the party.
 However, it is important to note that, mere fact of sending service/notice to the mail address does not constitute delivery, and hence service on the given address is imperative and service to the E-mail address is an additional requirement.III. Service to the address in the memorandum is sufficient notice to the nominee
7. Pre-trial procedure
I. Immediately after Chapter X, a new Chapter XA has been introduced. The said chapter can be viewed as an important feature which has been introduced to the legal framework.
II. In terms of section 79(A);
a. forthwith on the expiration of the time allowed for the filing of the answer; or
b. where a replication is permitted, on the last day of the time allowed for the filing of that replication, whether it is filed or not;
a date after 3 weeks and before 2 months must be fixed for the pre-trial. (79A(1)) and all parties must have notice. (79A(2)) Although the section 79A(1) specifically refers to time allowed for the filing of the answer, the said section must be read in conjunction with Section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code which facilitates a subsequent date for filing of an answer
III. Section 80 has been repealed and accordingly the new section requires that, after completing the pre-trial process, on a calling date, to fix the date of trial of the action in the trial Court, the Court will appoint a date for trial and give notice of costs of service.
IV. 80A (1) sets out that no application for pre-trial steps is allowed once the matter is fixed for trial, except upon the permission of Court, where Court is satisfied that a grave and irremediable injustice would be caused if such steps are not permitted.
 framing Issues is a duty of the judge conducting the pre-trial hearing, no amendment can be made at the trial, unless in special circumstances where the court is satisfied that if it is not allowed it would cause manifest injustice.V. Section 93 of the enactment, dealing with amendment of pleadings
to be conducted on the date 'first fixed for Pre-Trial.'
Immediately after Chapter XVII of the principal enactment, a Chapter XVIIA has been brought in.
Chapter XVIIA of the pre-trial
VI. Admissions and issues in the pre-trial process

Effective  communication  is the key for  business revival
From crisis to confidence  Part 2
If you are an executive, manager or leader, you do not need to be told that the world of work is tougher than ever  you live it every day. To meet the increasing demands, to do more and to deliver more, top business managers follow seven golden principles. Beginning today, we will discuss them in detail, one per week.
The first principle is communication. Tough management requires an obsessive attention to the effectiveness of all communication, including the what, when, how, and most important, the why of what you are communicating.
Effectively communicating with your team members is more than just firing off a few emails or picking up the telephone.There's a degree of strategy that needs to accompany communication in the workplace.
Importance
Productive communication in the workplace is important on numerous levels. It's involved in creating products, delivering services, engaging employees, satisfying customer needs, and handling vendors. Effective communication, therefore, becomes critical to running a successful and profitable business.
Communicator should stay cool and engaged when things get heated in meetings, negotiations, or difficult conversations. He or she must never lose sight of the bigger picture.
It takes everyone on an organization's team to collectively work towards the common goals of the company, which means all members involved need to be engaged and kept in the loop. Conveying pertinent information to employees and peers is a continual endeavour among business leaders. The need never ceases. It's essentially a predominant component to the job of a leader and demands a lot more effort than sending a blanket memo.
Equipping yourself with strong communication skills is one of the most valuable things you can do for yourself and your workplace and can vastly enrich social interaction. Working on improving your communication skills is a journey, simply because with it you are opening new social horizons. So, how do we improve our communication skills, ensuring that we speak to the world with clarity and confidence
Communication in business is much like communicating with children. You state your point in a way that you consider to be very clear and obvious to the listener while the listener hears something totally different. Listeners hear what they want or expect to hear or, even worse, interpret what they think you meant, as opposed to what you said.
Listening is a generous act
Listening is really the single most important factor in becoming a clear and confident communicator. Actually, listening to peoples words, to their pitch contour and hints of emotion, means you are much more likely to understand where they are coming from and what they are trying to tell you.
A doctor must develop a good line of communication with his patient, in order to get the most accurate and helpful information regarding the patient's health. One of the factors that contributes to wrong diagnosis is lack of inadequate information from the patient.
Actively listening and engaging fully in the conversation is great for confidence and personal clarity. Firstly, good listeners are always respected; it is an act of generosity towards the speaker. Secondly, youll feel in control: youll understand the conversations finer points, and knowing the finer points means youll be much more able to construct coherent and relevant responses and questions.
Self-analysis
Unfortunately, simply improving listening skills cannot heal all communication problems. There are a number of other reasons  such as poor self-confidence  why you find your conversations might prove unsatisfactory.
A good exercise is to write yourself an open list about what you find uncomfortable in your interactions and the negative feelings you experience after you have left a conversation.
Keep the list with you and the next time you come out of a conversation feeling unhappy write down what you feel went wrong. This way you will be able to conceptualise some of the issues involved in your communication problems. Perhaps you need to work on your self-confidence If so, take up that social hobby youve been putting off, and which will improve your confidence, and beat your communication problems at the source!
The receiver must watch the nonverbal cues which include body movements, body orientation, nuances of the voice, facial expressions, details of dress, and choice and movement of objects that communicate. They reflect needed information.
Taking responsibility for your words
A diffident speaker peppers her or his speech with Maybe, But, I'll try, I think, and I hope. It serves to muddy the message and as such works in a vicious circle, reducing confidence, which in turn reducing clarity, which in turn reducing confidence. Next time you go into a conversation make a conscious effort to show commitment to your proclamations. Believe in your words and make strong statements! That doesnt mean you will seem bullish, it just means that youre happy to stand behind your words as you speak them. If you dont presume to speak for others (for example, saying, We think), if you are a good listener, and prepared to learn from others then this positivity of speech becomes something to be admired.
Aim your speech
All communication, in whatever form, has aims. You speak to be heard, and so cause a reaction in the listener.
Knowing why youre entering a conversation, if you initiate it, and what you want your words to convey, once youre in it, means you can focus clearly, keeping all irrelevant details out. As well as this, taking a step back and looking at your intentions before you speak means youll be more able to spot negative aims, such as wanting to be hurtful.
Its quite simple  negative aims create negative conversations. Guarding against this can improve your experience of conversation no end. This is especially useful if you have a habit of blundering out horrible things when you are in a fury or under pressure!
Communication is never straightforward. Subtexts lie below subtexts, below subtexts, below subtexts. And that's to say nothing of those thoughts that people leave in their minds. In many ways that is what makes life exciting; after all, were not robots. Ultimately, perfect communication, in terms of fully understanding others, is impossible.
That is not to say that there is no point in trying to be a good communicator. It's quite the opposite. Developing your communication skills means you get nearer and nearer that impossible goal  to understand what it is to be another person.
Last minute briefing needs very high communication skills. The briefing must be brief, but consist of clear crisp instructions.
Think of how often you communicate with people during your day. You write emails, facilitate meetings, participate in conference calls, create reports, devise presentations, debate with your colleagues the list goes on.
Use seven Cs
We can spend almost our entire day communicating. So, how can we provide a huge boost to our productivity We can make sure that we communicate in the clearest, most effective way possible. Try the 7 Cs of Communication.
According to the 7 Cs, communication needs to be:
Be clear - When writing or speaking to someone, be clear about your goal or message. What is your purpose in communicating with this person If you're not sure, then your audience won't be sure either. To be clear, try to minimize the number of ideas in each sentence. Make sure that it's easy for your reader to understand your meaning. People shouldn't have to read between the lines and make assumptions on their own to understand what you're trying to say.
Be concise - When you're concise in your communication, you stick to the point and keep it brief. Your audience doesn't want to read six sentences when you could communicate your message in three. Are there any adjectives or filler words that you can delete You can often eliminate words like for instance, you see, definitely, kind of, literally, basically, or I mean. Are there any unnecessary sentences Have you repeated the point several times, in different ways
Be concrete - When your message is concrete, then your audience has a clear picture of what you're telling them. There are details (but not too many!) and vivid facts, and there's laser-like focus. Your message is solid.
Be correct - When your communication is correct, it fits your audience. And correct communication is also error-free communication. Do the technical terms you use fit your audience's level of education or knowledgeHave you checked yourwritingfor grammatical errors Remember, spell checkers won't catch everything. Are all names and titles spelled correctly
Be coherent - When your communication is orderly, logical, and aesthetically consistent it is coherent. All points are connected and relevant to the main topic and the tone and flow of the text is consistent.
Be complete - In a complete message, the audience has everything they need to be informed and, if applicable, take action. Does your message include a call to action, so that your audience clearly knows what you want them to do Have you included all relevant information  contact names, dates, times, locations, and so on
Be courteous - Courteous communication is friendly, open, and honest. There are no hidden insults or passive-aggressive tones. You keep your reader's viewpoint in mind, and you're empathetic to their needs.
In the recent past, there were two additions to the 7 Cs of Communication:
Be credible Does your message improve or highlight your credibility This is especially important when communicating with an audience that doesn't know much about you.
Be creative Does your message communicate creatively Creative communication helps keep your audience engaged.
Use this 7 + 2 Cs of Communication as a checklist for all of your communication. By doing this, you'll stay clear, concise, concrete, correct, coherent, complete, courteous, credible and creative.

End this hypocrisy
Echoing the views of his ministerial colleague Mangala Samaraweera, Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga has called for the relaxing of restrictions placed on the sale of soft liquor. Answering an Oral question raised by MP Buddhika Pathirana in parliament of Friday, Minister Amaratunga said they plan to remove restrictions on soft liquor sales by way of a budget proposal. He would be requesting the Minister of Finance to ease laws pertaining to soft liquor such as beer and wine so that light alcohol beverages would be freely available. Availability of soft liquor is essential for the tourism industry. Soft liquor is available in almost all shops in other countries promoting the tourism industry, whereas the opposite is true of Sri Lanka, the Minister observed.
Earlier Minister Mangala Samaraweera too called for the easing of restrictions on soft liquor to wean the imbiber away from hard liquor that was more injurious to health. Not only that, he also called for the lifting of the liquor sales ban on Poya days, which he said had the largest volume of liquor sales than on any other day, with bootleggers stockpiling the stuff to sell at double the price and even Wine Shop owners enjoying booming sales by disposing of their liquor from the back door, to known customers.
It is time that our archaic excise laws are changed, in order to relax, or, altogether remove restrictions on liquor sales. This is because it is next to impossible to wean the habitual drinker away from the bottle. It is also moot whether the hard liquor drinker can be made to convert to soft liquor by reducing the price of soft liquor. The best course is to reduce the price of ALL legally manufactured liquor in order to keep the hard drinker away from the rot gut, or kassippu, which has lethal consequences. Today, the price of the cheapest brand of local liquor is Rs 1,500, which is beyond the purse of the average income earner. He will naturally turn to the homemade brew, which is much cheaper, to deadly effect. The government which may hope to collect additional revenue through the increase of excise duties will only be losing any such revenue so earned, several fold, on the treatment of diseases connected to consumption of rot gut, thus drilling a big hole in its health budget annually. It is therefore feasible that a moratorium be placed on liquor price increase, as even suggested by minister Samaraweera, so that the genuine stuff is enjoyed by the habitual drinker, after a hard days work.
We say this because trying to reduce the drinking habit through projects like mathata thitha will not work. In any event mathata thitha was a big hoax, because wine stores began mushrooming even when the campaign was in full swing, with politicians freely issuing liquor permits to the businessmen who bankrolled their election campaigns (as one wag declared it was thithata matha). Even campaigns carried out on television by the redoubtable Prof Carlo Fonseka blacking out scenes in films depicting consumption of alcohol, and later, slogans to the effect that one would lose one's virility by taking to liquor, no doubt, failed to convince the imbiber.
Be that as it may, the hypocrisy surrounding the government's liquor policy, where liquor prices are jacked up for the stated objective of weaning the imbiber away from the bottle should cease. It (government) should come to terms with reality and desist from using the price stick to control the drinking habit. Recent surveys showed liquor sales remained the same, or, if at all, had even jumped, after the price increase. One has only to observe the jostling crowds at liquor outlets on the day before a Poya to get a clear picture.
Late minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle was frank enough to declare that his government's mathata thitha programme did not work in the Negombo area from where he hailed. He famously declared in parliament that those in his area began the day after a couple ape peththe minissu dekak dala thamai patanganne. Even the late Harold Herat, who hailed from the Dankotuwa area, went to the extent of requesting the government to permit pot arrack manufacture, as a cottage industry, although the suggestion drew flak from President Premadasa. Minister John Amaratunga, also representing an electorate known for its large volume of liquor sales, no doubt knows what he is talking about. He, together with Managala Samaraweera, certainly would not be favourites with the Buddhist clergy and temperance movements, for their advocacy of relaxed excise laws. But they, at least, had spoken out with conviction. Even Prof. G. L. Peiris as deputy minister of finance under Chandrika called for the slashing of prices on soft liquor, such as beer and wine. He argued that reduction of prices on soft liquor would make hard liquor drinkers switch to beer and wine. He also argued that the shortfall in revenue would be made up by the sheer weight in the numbers who will convert to soft liquor. Whether this actually happened is anyone's guess.

England beat West Indies by 124 runs in 3rd ODI
Bristol: England beat West Indies by 124 runs to win the third one-day international at Bristol on Sunday.
West Indies, set 370 to win, finished on 245 all out after Moeen Ali's 53-ball century took England to 269 for nine in their 50 overs.
Joe Root (84) and Ben Stokes (73) laid the platform for a big total after West Indies captain Jason Holder won the toss. Veteran West Indies opener Chris Gayle marked his return to the side with a valiant 94 before he was run out by Adil Rashid's direct hit from midwicket after the Jamaica left-hander missed the rainswept no-result at Trent Bridge on Thursday with a hamstring injury.
From then on the Windies' chase fell away, with fast bowler Liam Plunkett taking five for 52 his maiden five-wicket ODI haul as England won with 65 balls to spare. AFP

## Title: Exclusion of youth from politics

Exclusion of youth from politics
The youth insurgencies in Sri Lanka were not spontaneous, but as a result of continuous issues related to youth marginalization. Sri Lanka today has nearly 23.2 percent of the total population, around 4.64 million individuals, comprised of the youth (those between 15  29 years of age) group and yet over three decades later, they are still being frequently left behind and excluded from political process and activities in the island nation.
Youth involvement in the political process has being debated for decades, but consecutive governments have failed to address the issues concerned. This was very evident when the recent Local Governments Elections Amendment Act was passed in Parliament; even though this assured a 25 percent quota to female representatives, the mandatory 40 percent youth quota in nomination lists was removed.
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya
The youth quota was introduced in 1990 by an amendment to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act no. 25 of 1990, to provide 40 percent of youth candidates between 18  35 age, places in the nomination lists.The government decided to introduce a youth quota following a recommendation made by the 1990 Youth Commission which was set by late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. It was set up in the aftermath of the JVP insurrection to examine the underlying causes for the insurrection.
The Commission found that young people felt alienated and marginalized. The Commission suggested several remedies to address the basic issues and it suggested measures aimed at bringing about accountability and transparency in political institutions. It also recommended that a quota system should be provided for youth by law to increase youth representation in local level institutions. The Youth Commission explained the rationale behind the youth quota as follows:
The Commission is convinced that at this particular period of our history, the generation gap has so widened that youth are in fact a distinct category who require separate representation. Although they may share different political ideologies, they are substantially united in the belief that the system does not give them the opportunity to represent and act upon the views.
Elections at this time were being held under the proportional representation system, and the legal provisions that were introduced required each political party or independent group to allocate 40 percent of the places on their nomination list to youth candidates.
However, the youth quota that was recommended to get youth involved in the political process by law does not exist anymore leaving another void in the journey of politics for the youth.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said that it was high time that the political parties also take responsibility to get the youth involved in the political process.
The Minister also pointed out that they cannot just have the law do all the work.
Its not possible to do everything by law. We have already given 25 percent quota to female representatives and we cannot give another 25 percent for youth again. The political parties too have social responsibilities, therefore, they should allocate a quota for youth from the party level, he said. Musthapha added that his party (SLFP) ensures youth participation in their political process.
What do political parties and civil society organizations have got to say
Former SLFP MP and Chairman of the SLFP youth wing Shantha Bandara claimed that this decision would be a big blow to the youth who are willing to get into politics.
He said that it was very hard for any youth without a political background to contest for either local government, Provincial council or parliamentary elections.
Not a single party spoke of this issue, only the election commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya highlighted the negative aspects of the decision. All the independent commissions appointed after the youth insurrection in 1981 and 1989 recommended that we include youth in the political process and their voices need to be heard. Youth participation in Politics should be vital for the development of the country. The amendment was discriminatory and unfair, he said.
Bandara meanwhile assured that under the SLFP, the youth would never be marginalized.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the party to allocate 30 percent quota for youth in the coming Local government elections.
We will not let anything unfair happen to youth within our party. We value them and their ideas, he said.
Bandara said that when the 40 percent quota was mandatory, all parties were forced to get youth involved but now the ratio might vary from one political party to another.
It would reduce the youth involvement in politics; the political journey for a young person without a political background is going to be very tough, he said.
Former MP Bandara said that he entered politics through the same quota and added that if it had not been mandatory, it would have been very hard for him enter the political arena. Before the party leaders were legally bound, but now they have been released from some responsibility.
Youth show a greater interest in politics today and their insights are equally valuable for the development of the country. The SLFP youth wing has started a political academy to make youth more involved in politics. During the SLFP May Day rally and 66th Anniversary a huge number of youth participated, he added.
History repeating itself
The JVP which has always had a strong youth base said quota or no quota, they will continue to have youth involved in their politics.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said believed that though the youth quota has been removed from the Local Government Amendment Bill, they would have a chance under the new electoral system.
MP Ratnayake further said that the country desperately needed more youth without a political background to get engaged in politics.
The Daily News made several attempts to contact UNP National Youth Front Chairman MP Kavinga Jayawardena but he was not available for comment.
The quota though not perfect, according Executive Director of Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Rajith Keerthi Tennakkoon, it has helped many youth who entered political area through it get to high ministerial positions in government.
Tennakkoon further said that the decision to provide a quota was taken as the youth were in the belief that the system does not give them the opportunity to represent and act upon their views.
It was considered as one of the important decisions taken after the country faced tragic incidents in the hands of unsatisfied youth.There is no retirement for politics. Therefore, the old will remain until they are dead and the youth will forever remain as a marginalized group, he said.
Tennakkoon emphasized that this decision would discourage the youth from entering politics. The famous Spanish philosopher George Santayana once said, Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it. The country is now left with the question whether it will once again marginalize its youth and make the same mistakes that will lead to history repeating itself once again.

Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya:
Deshapriya said that the Commission was going to write to all political parties to ask that they give atleast 30 percent quota to youth.
The 40 percent quota was mandatory in 1991, 1997, 2002, 2006 and 2011. The candidates elected through this quota became members, deputy chairmen, chairmen, deputy mayors and mayors. After those provincial councilors, provincial council ministers and the chief ministers, there are many parliamentarians, deputy ministers, ministers and cabinet ministers who were benefitted through this quota, he said.
He further said that Act no. 22 of 2012 of the Local Government Act was amended. It reduced 40 percent to 25 percent and used the changed the word from shall to may, making it not mandatory to have a youth quota.
Deshapriya said that youth organizations, National Youth Council(NYC), youth coordinators and together with the Election Commission made representation in the political party activities and emphasized the need to have a mandatory quota for youth.
In June 2017, the draft of the recently amended act was presented to the parliament and it included 30 percent compulsory youth quota. But unfortunately, when the act was passed in Parliament on August 25, this section was removed. It was removed due to the negative ideas expressed by the members of the Parliament. They had pointed out that the nomination papers get rejected due to the compulsory quota, he said.
He added that youth educated as well as non-educated are not interested in political parties.
To have the youth get involve in the political process, we need some activities to attract the youth. If we do not have the compulsory quota, they think that the elders ignored them. Ideas and issues of the youth will never be discussed in Parliament, he said.
He said that out of 225 members of the Parliament, only 14 members fall under the category of youth. But 40 percent of the total voter population is comprised of youth. The most negligible section is not only women, but also youth. Parliament should have 90 youth MPs according to the ratio.
According to our law, a person below the age of 35 cannot be appointed as the President. So why not give them opportunities at the local level We have put restrictions for the youth to become a President and even the lowest level of the political process does not have a compulsory quota, he said.
He said that no one knows whether the ward system was going to help the youth.
In Sri Lanka, the secretary and the hierarchy of the party will choose the candidates. Youth are less likely to be involved in governance and decision-making processes, as a result of economic, political, and procedural barriers that prevent their participation. However, the problem is most of the political parties do not have youth cadre, he said.
Youth Parliament Speaker Sachinda Dulanjana (UNP):
I believe that it is high time for young people to get themselves engaged in the democratic process in any capacity in order ensure that their voices are heard in decision making while having an adequate representation in all formal political institutions and processes starting from local governments.
However now we find it a challenging task with the removal of the mandatory youth quota from Local Governments Elections Amendment Act which was approved by the Parliament on August 25. Therefore we have already initiated a public awareness campaign and a social media campaign called Youth To Lead with the objective of pressurizing all political parties to allocate a considerable percentage for young candidates in their parties when they prepare the nomination lists for the upcoming local governments elections. I also believe that we must take serious policy action on this issue. Otherwise, in few decades, the interest of young people to get involved in politics will be gradually faded away while allowing the political system to normalize it.

Express train tickets sold at higher prices at Kandy Railway Station
The Railway Department has initiated a probe on a complaint that a person working at the tourist information desk at the Kandy Railway Station is selling tickets for express trains at exorbitant prices to foreign tourists.
The worker is allegedly buying tickets for express trains plying from Kandy to Colombo and Kandy to Badulla and selling them to foreign tourists at higher prices.,
It has been alleged that the employee sells a Rs.1,000 ticket at Rs.3,000.
The Kandy Railway Station said that an investigation was launched into the allegations. He refuted allegations that a Railway Department worker at the Kandy Station was involved in the racket.
He said that the Intercity Express trains tickets could be bought 30 days prior to an Intercity journey.
He said anyone could buy tickets prior to the journey and sell it to a third party on the day of the journey at a higher price. Only a limited number of tickets are issued for the intercity express trains, he said.
The Station Master said passengers had a responsibility to inform authorities about such illegal practices.

Faces in different places
The senior students of Elizabeth Moir School are all set to present their annual Art exhibition under the theme Faces in Different Places. As the title suggests the paintings will focus on faces and places and will demonstrate the integration of proportion and perspectives. Drawing on places and people who are important to them, these young artists are gearing up to host an exhibition that demonstrates their talent, originality and flair.
As always, the Schools Inter-house art competition will be held simultaneously. The theme for this years competition is Be the change you want to see in the world and the four Houses were free to interpret the theme in their own way, tackling different social issues from gender stigma and acceptance to hypocrisy and the need for change.
Students Shakira and Kaavya cited various factors that inspired the students to create the pieces on display at the exhibition including the time spent developing their skills and trying new techniques while learning to look at different perspectives and enhancing their creative outlook. They also described how the subjects of their paintings are often people close to their hearts, with the paintings serving as tributes of respect, appreciation and affection. This year the students decided to integrate proportions and perspective together as the youngest age group starts off their first year in Sr. School learning to draw proportions of faces and figures and in the second year learning perspective in forms of structure and places Art Teacher Aruni Wijegunawardene said.
The exhibition is an ongoing project to get the whole school involved and discover how students interpret the topic giving them the freedom to explore their own creativity, allowing them to amaze us with their many talents. This year the exhibition also features paintings by Ameli who achieved a score of 99 per cent for Art at the IGCSE, she added.
The chief guest at the event will be Saskia Fernando of Saskia Fernando Gallery.
Faces in Different Places will be open to the public on Thursday, September 28 from 9am to 12noon at the JDA Perera Art Gallery, Horton Place, Colombo 7.

Feeding the world after climate change
Humans have changed the weather on this planet, and that will change everything, especially how we grow food. Consider corn. The major crop (by volume) grown in the United States, corn does not reproduce at temperatures higher than 95 degrees. During the 20th Century, Iowa experienced three straight days of 95 only once a decade. But by 2040, if greenhouse gas emissions remain on their current high trajectory, Iowa will experience three straight days of 95-degree heat in three summers out of four, Professors Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University and Donald Wuebbles of the University of Illinois have calculated.
We absolutely have to develop seeds for improved and climate-adapted varieties, but we also need to increase the diversity of seeds, says Sara Scherr, the president of Eco-agriculture Partners, an NGO in Washington, D.C. The current business model in agriculture is based on maximizing volume, which militates against diversity.
Mixing forests and farmland is also being explored in China, where Lin Erda, a senior government scientist, has joined with Greenpeace to endorse ecological agriculture as the best way to cope with climate change. Raising ducks and fish in rice paddies, for example, reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and the need for chemical fertilizers; the fish decrease the methane that the paddies would otherwise emit, while the ducks control pests.
But how does ecological agriculture compare against industrial agricultures greatest strengthits ability to produce prodigious amounts of food Thats a vital question on a planet where, even today, one in seven people goes hungry.
In Africa, extensive field studies show ecological agriculture matching the yields of conventional agriculture, while also boosting water supply and soil fertility. But Africa is a special case. Bypassed by the Green Revolution of the 1970s, it never got used to the inflated yields that industrial agriculture made possible.
In the United States and Europe, switching from industrial to ecological agriculture has invariably caused an initial decline in yields. However, after a brief transition period of three to five years, ecological agricultures yields rebound to equal those of industrial agriculture, according to a 30-year study conducted by the Rodale Institute.
And ecological agricultures advantages promise to be even greater under climate change. In drought years, Rodale found, its yields were 31 percent higher than conventional yields. Ecological agriculture also built rather than depleted soil fertility while recharging groundwater supplies. Finally, it produced 40 percent fewer greenhouse gases than industrial agriculture.
Drought tolerant vegetables
Drought tolerant vegetables develop deep root systems to counter both heat and low water levels. Many grow quickly, which also reduces their long-term water requirements. When shopping for seeds and plants suitable for drought resistant gardening, look for labels that indicate the plant loves hot temperatures and has low to moderate water needs. Different vegetables have different water requirements for the best production. Focus on giving plants the perfect amount of moisture  while conserving water  by grouping vegetables in your drought tolerant garden according to their watering requirements.
Drought-resistant soil
Garden soil can either act like a sieve  allowing water to quickly filter down  or a sponge. Spongy, drought-resistant soil absorbs water for a continuous source of plant moisture. Nothing saves water more quickly, easily or economically in a garden than a thick layer of organic mulch. It breaks down over time, adding organic material and nutrients to the soil.
Watering drought tolerant vegetables
Excessive water usage in the garden can happen when people overwater their plants. This can happen when they forget to turn off their irrigation during periods of rain or when they water in the heat of the day when evaporation is more likely to occur.
If your goal is to use less water each week while drought gardening, skip the containers and plant drought tolerant vegetables directly into the ground. The soil in limited, above-ground spaces is more prone to evaporation and thus requires more water than the garden soil beneath your feet. With the right plants, proper tools and solid planting strategies, even a long, hot summer can result in a successful harvest.
Global demand for food will be increasing. Human population is projected to swell to 9.3 billion by 2050. And as incomes rise in emerging economies, consumers will demand diets that require more resourcesparticularly meat. John Beddington, the chief science adviser to the British government, has warned that by 2030 the interlocking trends of climate change, population growth, and resource scarcity may result in major destabilization, including street riots and mass migrations as people flee shortages of food and water. But that nightmare scenario need not come to pass. We already know what worksand what doesntto feed a post-climate-change world. In fact, many of the practices and technologies we need are already in use, in the United States and abroad. Whats needed is to bring these isolated success stories to scale, to make them the rule rather than the exception
Better seeds alone wont save us. Instead, feeding the world under climate change will require a broader strategy, grounded in two imperatives. On the one hand, we must rapidly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, to avoid facing unmanageable amounts of future climate change. On the other, we must prepare our agricultural sectors for the climate impacts already in the pipeline, which will be severe enough.
More and more agricultural experts are saying we need a shift to ecological agriculture, sometimes known as agro-ecology. In western Africa, for example, thousands of the poorest farmers on earth are capturing scarce rainfall and rejuvenating soil fertility by growing trees amid their fields of millet and sorghum. Despite enduring some of the hottest, driest weather on earth, these farmers have returned greenery to 12.5 million acres of land. More important, underground water tables have been replenished, and crop yields have doubled and tripled.

Get your pulse racing
She says that she has known him more than half her life. For Tatum Hertogs, the doting wife of ace racer Pasindu Peiris, the relationship has been her anchor. Pasindu has been by her side through good times and hardships. Losing her father last year has been one of the greatest blows in her life. Pasindu has been attending to his father-in-law when Tatum had to take care of their one month old baby. This incident and many more has strengthened their bond.
The meeting
My father, Alan Hertogs, was in charge of organising car races. I would accompany him to the races. I saw Pasindu for the first time on the Fox Hill track in Diyatalawa in 2007. He was only riding bikes then. I was around 13 years old.
We hold a huge party at the end of each year for the racers. We also give an award to the best racer at the event. Since Pasindu performed so well he stood out among the rest. We got the opportunity to chat and dance together at the function. Later we exchanged phone numbers and continued our alliance. Pasindu is seven years elder than me. He is an old boy of Isipathana College and Gateway College, Colombo. I schooled at an international school in Negombo before moving to Colombo International School.
He is The One
Pasindu and I share a lot of common interests. We are both crazy about cars. We also love animals, adventure and nature.
I come from a foreign background. My Dad is from Belgium while my Mom is Sri Lankan. Therefore Pasindu and I learnt new things from each other. That was an interesting experience for us. I introduced him to different types of food like Japanese, Vietnam and German. He has not tried them out before and soon he became hooked to tasting various types of cuisines. He even established a Japanese restaurant called Sushi Cai in 2014. Cai means Ocean in Japanese which suggests that we have a wide range of dishes available at the restaurant.
The wedding
Pasindu never really proposed. We always knew that we wanted to get married so it was not really a big shock when we decided that now was the time to tie the knot. We have been going out for five years.
My parents knew about our relationship from the very beginning. They are more laid back because of our foreign background. Pasindus parents are a bit stricter and since he is seven years elder than me, they were looking for a bride for him. This hastened our marriage.
We got married on January 30, 2013. We have been married for five years now and altogether we have been together for 10 years.
The children
Our eldest daughter, Ariya, was born on September 12, 2014, while our second daughter, Teyhana, was born on August 18, 2016. I always wanted two girls so I was overjoyed when they were born. A lot of people expected our second child to be a boy because they wanted someone to follow Pasindus footsteps. Obliviously we are not stopping both of them if they show interest towards racing just because they are girls! Ariya is already Pasindus number one fan and is cheering him all the way along the race track.
The racer vs the husband and father
Once Pasindu goes for a race, he is in a serious mood because his concentration is fully on the track. He is not the sweet and funny guy you find at home then. You need talent and a lot of confidence in yourself to become an ace racer because there are a lot of people who are putting pressure on you expecting you to win. That is why Pasindu is in a different mindset and fully focused on the game when he takes part in a tournament.
Pasindu is a wonderful husband and father. He is very playful with the children. He loves playing with them and taking care of them and they too adore him in return.
The racing passion
I am passionate about racing. I believe that is one of the key factors which drew Pasindu and me together. I have taken part in a go cart race and came in second place. I would love to take part in racing but since the kids are still young I have to give it a miss. However I definitely hope to get more involved in racing in the future. Pasindu is very supportive towards my passion. He has no objections but has only requested me to give it some time till the kids are older.
I do feel a little fear at the back of my mind when Pasindu is on the race track. However I have seen how much he enjoys engaging in racing. True, it is a risk that you are taking but on the other hand the cars are equipped with a lot of safety gears.
Other passions
Pasindu is a total foodie. He loves inventing new dishes for our restaurant menu and trying out new flavours. He invented a yummy juice once which is a combination of lemongrass, lemon and ginger. It is called the Cai House Glass. That is one of the items which are most in demand at our restaurant. He also came up with a sushi birthday cake recently. That too has become a hit among our customers.
My family comes from a restaurant background. We have a restaurant in Negombo. So I have always tried out different types of food. My Mom is a superb cook. She used to make all types of dishes for my father. So it was not all rice and curry at home. Pasindu loves the Tom Yam soup that I make.
He is also very social and loves entertaining people too.
Racing tournaments
Pasindu has taken part in many racing competitions abroad, especially in countries like India and Indonesia. He takes part in the Fox Hill Super Cross annually. Before marriage I would always accompany him to such events but now that the kids are here, it is a bit difficult to attend every event. We did take them both to Udawalawe when Teyhana was two weeks old but it was crazy because it was dusty and sunny and keeping an infant in the car for a whole day was not easy.
Greatest strength
Pasindu embodies great leadership qualities. He is good at organizing things and getting people engaged in whatever he wants them to do. He trains young racing drivers and teaches them all the tricks in the trade. He motivates them a lot.
Goriest momentin a tournament
Pasindu raced against an Indian rally driver in Fox Hill Super Cross in Diyatalawa in 2012. There was a lot of tension then because the Indian racer was the Asian champion. Pasindu managed to beat him and win the race in the end.
One change
I wish Pasindu would pay more attention to fitness. He actually does not have time to go to the gym or engage in much fitness activities since the restaurant and races keep him busy. He drops Ariya to Montessori in the morning on the way to his office. He stays in the office most of the time till he has to pick her up and bring her home. Then he goes back to his office in the evening.
Most touching thing
It is something small and simple but very touching like unexpected flowers. Pasindu took me out to Cinnamon Grand hotel for my last birthday in January. My youngest daughter was three months old then and that was the first time since I gave birth that I got the opportunity to dress up and get out of the house.
10 years from now
Hopefully we would have a few more restaurant branches. I hope Pasindu gets an opportunity to make more use of his talents as a racer and establish his own school to train young racers. I also wish that the kids would excel in studies as well as sports.

GMOA threatens more trade union action

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will take stern trade union action against any effort made in order to introduce `SAITM friendly minimum standards' for medical education, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing media during a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo today he said that the National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva's duty completed when he handed over the report on SAITM issue to the President.
But he is using a power that does not exist; he had called a meeting recently. He is using a power that he is no longer entitled to, Haritha Aluthge said.
 Aluthge pointed out that even the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) informed him that they cannot take part in the meeting since there are contradictions between the committee report facts.
They said that they cannot arrive at a final decision without contacting lengthy internal discussions and the so called meeting went ahead with some fake stake holders, Aluthge said.
UGC Chairman and the Official from the Attorney General's Department have already rejected 17 minimum standards proposed by the SLMC and have also distorted the SLMC proposals.
Therefore the so called `minimum standards for medical education' formulated by those two persons will be fake and they will be aimed at including current SAITM low standards within this minimum standards, he added.

HNB takes Singithi depositors on  tour across Colombo
Seeking to cultivate the savings habit in young Sri Lankans, Hatton National Bank rewarded 274 selected winners of the HNB Singithi Depositors competition together with their parents for a special educational tour around a series of landmark locations across Colombo.
Having conducted the competition for the last four years, the October 2016 edition of HNB Singithi Savings Month was the largest to date and continues to provide children from across the island with entertaining and educational experiences that are aimed at inspiring the next generation of Sri Lankans to save, and aspire to greater heights in future.
It is a true privilege for both myself and our team at HNB to host winners of our annual Singithi Savings Month and do our part to make savings habit a fun and rewarding task for the next generation of Sri Lankans.
We hope that these tours will serve as further encouragement to young Sri Lankans to take a more proactive approach to their savings and in doing so, empower these children with a strong and stable financial future, HNB Chief Employee Experience Officer and Assistant General Manager Deposits and Remittances, Kalum Wijesooriya stated.
Each accompanied by one of their parents, the winners gathered at the HNB head office before embarking on a memorable journey of that commenced with a highly educational and engaging guided tour of the Ratmalana Air Force Museum.
Following a drive across the city, the children were thereafter given their very first glimpses of the bustling Colombo Port, including a tour of Colombo Dockyard before wrapping up with an exciting tour aboard the Sri Lanka Navy vessel, SLNS Sayurala, an offshore patrol vessel utilized in patrolling deep seas off Sri Lankas coast.
For many of these young children, this years fun-filled educational tour amounted to the very first time that they had seen an airplane or a ship first-hand, making the trip a particularly memorable one.
One of the main reasons we selected these locations was because these are the kind of places that usually require special permission to gain entry and so it would be a difficult thing for these families to have accomplished on their own, HNB Senior Manager Deposits, Viranga Gamage stated.

Legal action against parents of underage drivers
National Council on Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda yesterday said plans are afoot to take legal action against parents or guardians of underage drivers.
Dr. Kodagoda speaking to the Daily News said the parents or guardians who allow children below the age of 18 to drive should be at the receiving end of the issue and tragedy behind it. According to Dr. Kodagoda, parents and guardians should be aware of the risk and illegality of the action. So that would be the recent we might have to look into penalizing the parents and guardians of underage drivers. We are to carry out discussions regarding this proposal in the near future,Dr. Kodagoda said.
The dialogue on taking legal action against parents or guardians of underage drivers comes in the wake of the death of a schoolboy in Thalawa in a motor cycle accident, Dr. Kodagoda explained.
The deceased was a Grade 10 student of Kiralagama Subodhi Vidyalaya, whose motorbike veered off the road due to high speeding.
This was just one case; there have been many similar incidents and the situation keeps getting from bad to worse. Dr.Kodagoda added.
Dr.Kodagoda also added that the usage of helmets in rural areas has dwindled. He identified the situation as another grave issue which should be quickly addressed.

Manchester City too strong for Palace as United labour
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City ran riot in the second half at the Etihad to thrash Crystal Palace 5-0 in the Premier League on Saturday, while Manchester United made hard work of their 1-0 win at Southampton.
City were second-best for much of the first half but Leroy Sanes goal just before halftime gave them the momentum to go on to rout Palace who became the first side in English Football League history to lose their opening six games of the season without scoring.
United were far less convincing in their success at Southampton but Romelu Lukakus first-half goal was enough to ensure they stay level on points with leaders City. Referee Craig Pawsons decision to send manager Jose Mourinho to the stands late on put a dampener on the result at St Marys.
The Portuguese declined to be drawn on the incident but was full of praise for his sides defensive efforts.
We fought hard, Mourinho said. We did for 20, 25 minutes what many teams do for 90 minutes which is to play with five at the back. So many teams are always defensive.
That being said, we had two incredible chances to kill the game. Our attacking players were not sharp.
One striker very much on form was Alvaro Morata, whose hat-trick helped Chelsea to keep pace with the Manchester clubs. Antonio Contes men remain three points behind in third after their 4-0 win at Stoke.
Liverpool won 3-2 at Leicester City in typically heart-in-the-mouth style when Simon Mignolet comically conceded and then saved a late penalty, which Jamie Vardy fired too close to the Belgians body. The spot-kick save was Mignolets fifth from his past eight attempts.
Tottenham climbed into the top four after a thrilling 3-2 win at London Stadium over West Ham. Two goals from Harry Kane and one from Christian Eriksen helped Spurs to ease into a 3-0 lead but goals from Javier Hernandez and Cheikhou Kouyate ensured that the visitors, who had Serge Aurier sent off with 20 minutes to go, were hanging on at the death.
In Manchester, Sanes brilliant first-half goal for City seemed somewhat undeserved but Palace struggled to cope with their slick football in the second half.

The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 22.11% (or 28.74Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.14Bn.
The Plantations sector followed suit, adding 20.73% to total turnover volume as 26.93Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 0.51Bn of total market turnover value. The Diversified Sector meanwhile, contributed 17.52Mn shares (or 13.48%), amounting to LKR 1.98Bn.
Top gainers and losers
PC Pharma was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 100.0% W-o-W from LKR 0.10 to LKR 0.20. SMB Leasing[NV] gained 50.0% W-o-W to close at LKR 0.30 while Lanka Cement gained 29.6% W-o-W to close at LKR 5.70. Adam Investments (+25.0% W-o-W) and Hunas Falls(+21.6% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
Tess Agro[NV] was the weeks highest price losers, declining 16.7% W-o-W to close at LKR 1.00 while Paragon (-13.7% Y-o-Y), Amana Takaful (-11.1% W-o-W) & Kotagala Plantations(-10.2% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 0.87Bn relative to last weeks total net outflow of LKR 10.91Bn (+107.97% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 108.65% W-o-W to LKR 2.91Bn from last weeks value of LKR 1.39Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 2.04Bn relative to LKR 12.30Bn recorded last week (-83.41% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, Dialog & Commercial Bank led foreign purchases while NDB Bank & Vallibel Power led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Commercial Bank and JKH led foreign purchases while NDB Bank and LB Finance led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets continued its uptrend for the 2nd consecutive week, aided by a slight uptick in Q217 GDP growth figures and waning concerns on the new IRD bill. Q217 GDP recorded a growth of 4% Y-o-Y, slightly higher than the 3.8% Y-o-Y growth recorded in Q117 as robust growth in the Services and Industrial sectors helped offset the Agriculture sectors sixth quarter of negative growth.
The benchmark ASPI consequently rose ~25 points W-o-W, in line with the ~26 point increase in the previous week.
Average daily turnover levels however, declined to LKR 0.89 over the week, down 70% from last weeks notable daily average of LKR 2.95Bn amid the LKR 10.90Bn transaction in Singer Sri Lanka as Hayleys acquired a 61.73% stake in the company.
This weeks average daily turnover however, is broadly in line with the YTD daily average of LKR 0.92Bn. Crossings over the week meanwhile, accounted for ~25% of total market turnover, driven by crossings in JKH & Madulsima Plantations.
Foreign investors meanwhile reverted to a net buying position once again this week, as foreign purchases rose to LKR 2.91Bn cf. sales of LKR 2.04Bn and compared to last weeks net selling position of LKR 10.91Bn in amid the transaction in Singer Sri Lanka.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from next weeks monetary policy decision by the CBSL.
National inflation level rises to 7.9% in August
National inflation levels (NCPI) rose over the month of August, increasing to 7.9% Y-o-Y cf. 6.3% Y-o-Y in the previous two months of June and July.
The increase was in line with urban inflation levels which rose to 6.0% Y-o-Y in August (cf. 4.8% Y-o-Y in July 2017) and core CCPI levels which rose to 6.0% Y-o-Y (cf. 4.9% Y-o-Y in Jul7) both due the base effect and the monthly increase in Core CCPI in August.
Increases in both the Food and Non-food categories contributed towards the higher point-to-point inflation at the national level over August 2017.
On a monthly basis however, NCPI levels fell for the second consecutive month, driven primarily by decreases in prices of the items within the Food category.
Meanwhile, NCPI Core inflation, (which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy) increased to 4.8% in August, marginally up from the 4.2% Y-o-Y increase recorded the previous month; nevertheless, annual average NCPI Core inflation declined 5.8% in August cf. 5.9% July.

More regulatory cooperation  critical in strengthening cyber  threat regulatory expertise
Greater regulatory cooperation is critical in strengthening resilience and regulatory expertise in relation to cyber threat, said Chairman of the GEM Committee and Vice Chairman of the IOSCO Board, Ranjit Ajit Singh.
There was agreement among emerging market regulators to accelerate the development of sustainable finance, including the establishment of a Task Force on Sustainable Finance, he said speaking at the the IOSCO Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) Committee annual meeting and conference hosted by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka concluded at Cinnamon Grand last week.
Key issues and challenges regarding liquidity in emerging capital markets, as well as possible measures in promoting liquidity to help spur market growth and development were also discussed.
The new APRC Chairman, Jun Mizuguchi, Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of the Financial Services Agency of Japan, said the APRC focused on issues, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), the effective supervision of harmful but legal conduct, common enforcement challenges for the region, the impact of European Union regulations on Asia-Pacific markets and capacity building initiatives in the region.
Participants also discussed how fintech is shaping capital markets and the balance between innovation and investor protection, particularly in areas such as crypto currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Fintech and cyber resilience have no borders and the public conference offered a unique opportunity for emerging market jurisdictions and members from our region to interact and share views on relevant issues, including these pressing matters.
Participants discussed measures to address challenges in scaling up sustainable market based financing, including the role of policy makers, regulators and industry participants in promoting green financing solutions within emerging markets.
The GEM Committee also conducted a cyber simulation exercise developed in collaboration with market experts to strengthen regulatory capabilities and preparedness in tackling cyber threats. The regulatory workshop provided participants with a better understanding of key cyber developments, risks and threats impacting global financial markets.
IOSCO is the leading international policy forum for securities regulators and is recognized as the global standard setter for securities regulation. The organizations membership regulates more than 95% of the worlds securities markets in more than 115 jurisdictions and it continues to expand.
The two day event attracted more than 300 participants from 50 jurisdictions and the GEM Committee annual meeting and conference were preceded by the meeting of the IOSCO Asia-Pacific Regional Committee (APRC).

North Korean quake not a nuclear test
CHINA: A shallow 3.5-magnitude earthquake which hit North Korea near the countrys nuclear test site on Saturday was not the result of a fresh nuclear test, Chinas seismic service said, after initially reporting a suspected explosion.
The China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC) said in a statement late Saturday that study of infrasonic data determined the incident is not a nuclear explosion, but had the nature of a natural earthquake.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences also released a report saying the earthquake was likely a lagged collapse earthquake, echoing international experts hypotheses that the earthquake was a delayed repercussion of a previous detonation.
The Norths last nuclear test, on September 3, was the countrys most powerful, triggering a much stronger 6.3-magnitude quake that was felt across the border in China.
Monitoring groups estimate the nuclear test had a yield of 250 kilotons, which is 16 times the size of the US bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. The test prompted global condemnation, leading the United Nations Security Council to unanimously adopt new sanctions that include restrictions on oil shipments.
The strength of the quake on Saturday was much lower than the tremors registered during any of North Koreas previous nuclear tests, including its first detonation in 2006, which triggered a 4.1-magnitude quake. It came at the end of a week that saw a blistering war of words between between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, with Trump using his maiden speech at the UN General Assembly to warn that Washington would totally destroy the North if America or its allies were threatened. - AFP

Nuclear medicine to detect diseases
Lanka Hospitals pioneers nuclear medicine in Sri Lanka, becoming the only private hospital to offer this service. Nuclear medicine is a branch of medical imaging that uses small amounts of radioactive material to diagnose and determine the severity of or treat a variety of diseases, including many types of cancers, heart disease, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological disorders and other abnormalities within the body.
Because nuclear medicine procedures are able to identify molecular activity within the body, it provides the opportunity to identify disease in its earliest stages, as well as a patients immediate response to therapeutic interventions.
Speaking on the subject, Lanka Hospitals, Consultant Nuclear Medicine, Dr. Udugama said Nuclear medicine is used in a very safe manner in order to get the maximum benefit and minimum exposure to the patient.
Many medical procedures like X-ray and CT use radiation to diagnose and treat patients. Before deciding to recommend nuclear medicine procedure to a patient, we first have a consultation to determine if the patient is eligible for the process and if it is really necessary. Then, we use only the highest quality pharmaceuticals in the market in our tests and the smallest dosages necessary to diagnose our patients, he said.
Dr. Udugama added that the use of radioactive substances (Radioisotopes) in nuclear medicine is governed by an international body, known as the International Atomic Energy Authority, which enforces strict guidelines and safety criteria.
Nuclear medicine is very commonly used to detect cancer spread, particularly cancer spread in to bone, from the breast or lung. Further nuclear medicine is also useful in detecting sports injuries, such as those occurring as a result of over exercising, or using the wrong techniques. Radioisotopes use in Nuclear medicine does not typically have any side effects with intravenous injections or radiation and it rapidly eliminates from the body. The nuclear medicine center at Lanka Hospitals offers a wide spectrum of Nuclear Medicine Imaging and has been in operation for the past 15 years, since its beginnings in 2002.

Over 15,000 litres of Glyphosate seized
Sri Lanka Customs on Saturday seized a container carrying a stock of Glyphosate, a banned agrochemical, which was illegally imported to Sri Lanka from China.
The stock of Glyphosate was in a 20 foot container which was taken into custody at the Orugodawatta Container Yard. Sri Lanka Customs Spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said the stock was worth around Rs.60 million.
Around 3,948 cans of Glyphosate containing over 15,000 litres of the banned agrochemical were nabbed. Further investigations are conducted by Sri Lanka Customs under the directive of Director General of Customs Chulananda Perera. The government banned the use of Glyphosate in June 10, 2015, issuing a gazette notification saying imports and use of Glyphosate are banned under the Import and Export (Control) Act, No 01 of 1969.

Pandya fifty helps India clinch ODI series
Indore: Hardik Pandya hit an aggressive half-century to lead India to a series-clinching five-wicket win over Australia in the third one-day international in Indore on Sunday.
Pandyas 72-ball 78 and his crucial fifth-wicket stand with Manish Pandey, who remained unbeaten on 36, helped the hosts chase down their 294-run target with 13 balls to spare.
Openers Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane put together a 139-run stand to lay a solid foundation for the team to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.
But it was the Indian bowlers who set up the comfortable victory after opener Aaron Finchs blazing century, restricting the visitors to 293-6 at the batting-friendly Holkar Stadium.
In reply, Sharma, who hit 71, and Rahane, who made 70, combined the right dose of caution and aggression to give the Australian bowlers a hard time.
Sharma hit a huge six off Kane Richardson early in the innings that sailed out of the ground to signal his intent. He registered his 33rd ODI fifty with another six off Ashton Agar.
His 62-ball-knock was laced with 6 fours and 4 sixes before he top-edged a delivery from Nathan Coulter-Nile and substitute fielder Hilton Cartwright made no mistake at deep mid-wicket.
Rahane soon followed his partner back to the pavilion after Pat Cummins, who was brought back for his second spell, trapped the batsman lbw as Australia tried to check a rampaging India.
Kohli tried to take charge during his 56-run stand with Pandya but lost his wicket to left-arm spinner Ashton Agar.
Richardson got Kedar Jadhav caught behind for two as India suddenly found themselves in trouble at 206-4.
The 23-year-old Pandya, who survived a dropped chance by skipper Steve Smith off Agar on 41, then showed maturity as he and Pandey took control of the situation.
Earlier Finchs 125-ball 124 helped Australia post 292-6 in fifty overs after electing to bat.
Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed two wickets each to help India fightback a strong start from the Aussies, who eyed 300-plus at one stage.
The fourth ODI is scheduled for Thursday in Bangalore. AFP

Parkeredges Fury to keep heavyweight belt
MANCHESTER, Sunday  Joseph Parker beat Hughie Fury by a majority points decision to retain his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) heavyweight title at the Manchester Arena on Saturday.
The New Zealander endured a frustrating night and did not look confident ahead of the scores being announced, but the judges scored it to Parker by 118-110, 118-110 with the other seeing it a 114-114 draw.
Mandatory challenger Fury, 23 last Monday, suffered his professional first defeat in 21 fights while a second title defence for Parker improved his undefeated record to 24 wins, 18 by KO.
After a scrappy fight, two judges scoring it 10 rounds to two for Parker seemed generous as the Kiwi had not seriously troubled the challenger. I feel I won the fight, he put up a great fight, said Parker.
I felt the aggression was good on my side. He was really awkward and his movement was good. But I caught him with the harder punches, I felt.
Fury boxed smartly in his first world title fight and his jab, along with his nifty footwork, frustrated Parker who was unable to land cleanly.
I don't know what happened there with the judges, said Fury.
Parker kept chasing and had more success in the second half of the fight to secure the win that keeps him in contention for bigger fights next year, possibly against Furys fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.
A lot of the rounds were close, with few clean and powerful punches landed, but it was Furys movement and flicking jab that gave the champion problems in the first six rounds especially. It was the first boxing event at the Manchester Arena since 22 people were killed by a terror attack after a pop concert in May. The venue was only opened earlier this month and Fury had hoped to dedicate victory to the victims.
Fury is the cousin of Tyson Fury, who won the WBO, WBA and IBF world heavyweight titles by pulling off a shock points win over Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in November 2015. Tyson, who has not fought since and is no longer a champion, was ringside.
In the third, Parker stalked Fury without much success and was caught by a right at close range on the ropes.
Parker was better in the fifth and landed a few right hands but he could not land his big punches cleanly and Fury, behind his fast jab, was able to respond in the sixth with an eye-catching right uppercut.
Parker opened up a bit more in the eighth round and stepped up the pace in the ninth when a flurry of punches and an overhand right found the target.

Pethiyagoda calls for urgent need to look into social issues of plantation workers
The responsible authorities should pay more attention towards the day-to-day problems and living conditions of over 200,000 plantation workers in the country, considering the invaluable service rendered by them to uplift the plantation sector.
Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda made these remarks at the 163rd AGM of the Planters Association of Ceylon held in Colombo. Planters Association Chairman S.S. Poholiyadda and Deputy Chairman A.L.W. Goonawardena were also present.
Speaking further, Dr. Pethiyagoda said the Planters Association over the past several decades contributed immensely to develop this most important sector. Commenting further on the problems faced by plantation workers, Chairman Pethiyagoda said this vulnerable sector is the backbone of the plantation industry.
Therefore it is the duty of the responsible authorities to pay special attention to the housing, education and nutrition needs of plantation workers and their families, he said.
The Chairman said if plantation workers are neglected, it is difficult for them to become normal citizens of our society.
Dr. Pethiyagoda said, According to a survey conducted by a group of specialist doctors a few years ago in the plantation sector of Nuwara Eliya District, it was revealed that a large number of men and women between the age groups of 18 to 24 had contracted sexual transmitted diseases.
He said the survey further revealed that one in every 10 children in the plantation sector was sexually abused by older persons and therefore 10% of children were abused at a tender age.
He also paid attention towards the percentage of Nuwara Eliya District plantation sector girls of 18-24 who had undergone illegal abortions.
Dr. Pethiyagoda said it was a positive factor that with all these difficulties, 3% of children in the plantation sector had passed their Ordinary Level Examination.
He said, Plantation workers households are not like others, as their children are badly exploited due to various social issues and it is the sole responsibility of authorities to look into this matter.
The Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman also said plantation workers are the isolated community in the present day society and it is the duty of everybody, especially the state, to look into their social needs and provide suitable assistance.
He asked authorities to make the plantation workers full citizens to get a meaningful representation of people in Sri Lanka.
He said that it is the duty of everybody to integrate them with the rest of our society and said no government has so far found the political will to help them to develop into the modern urban unit.
Dr. Pethiyagoda also focused attention towards the pesticides that are immensely needed to develop the plantation industry and said authorities had banned using of pesticide even without consulting the Fertilizer Secretariat, the Medical Research Institute and the Tea Research Institute.

Police force to be modernised: PM
The Government will introduce new reforms to the Sri Lanka Police to make it more efficient and productive, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Sri Lanka Police is administered and functions under very archaic laws and regulations which were introduced a long time ago. We plan to modernise our Police Force by introducing laws and regulations for an effective and productive service to the nation, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a public gathering that followed the inauguration of the Police Officials Residential Complex at Wekunugoda, Galle.
After 2015, we witnessed a decline in the number of organised crime. The rate of fixing criminal offences has been increased by over 70 percent about which we could not be fully satisfied, the Prime Minister said. With the elimination of crimes, the country becomes more stabilised. We are resolved to strengthen our Police Force with modern facilities and equipment to develop its capacity in handling criminal affairs. The respective minister is resolved to open up new universities in that respect which is fully supported by Inspector General of Police, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Our aim is to rebuild a law abiding society. We have established the Independent Police Commission aimed at halting political influence over Police affairs. Another issue in this respect is to find solutions to expedite the long and undue delays in court activities. The Sri Lanka Police is administered and functions under very archaic laws and regulations which were introduced over a century ago. Firstly, we have to modernise our Police Force by introducing laws and regulations for an effective and productive service to the nation,the Premeier assured.
Our contemporary Police Forces are confronted with various types of crimes. The crimes of today are different to those of past. Today, the Police have to handle new types of organised crime such as drug dealings in various forms. Police are currently held responsible in cracking down on organised crimes, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Our Police Force today is entrusted with the novel responsibilities of overcoming the rising wave of terrorist acts and violence of various forms. We learnt that in recent times the Police became the main target of terrorist outfits in both the South and North. We witnessed this situation mainly in the North. Hence, we had to operate special Police units, platoons and Special Task Forces to combat such terrorist activities, the Prime Minister further said.
On the other hand we are faced with new issues related to maintainance of Law and Order in the country. Many issues were political. As we fail to solve such problems through authentic political strategies, the people resorted to violence in order to find solutions to such issues. Therefore, the Police and the public had to face a problem which could not be solved through proper administrative involvement, the Prime Minister said.
The conflict in the North was solely political. After even the end of the war, the problem could not be completely solved. The Sinhala and Muslim political parties in the South persistently advocated devolution of power within a unitary state which led to conflict. In ending the terrorist war, the Tri-Forces and the Police made the supreme sacrifice. Therefore, we are obliged to halt all avenues which could pave the way for another war owing to the same past problems.
The main focus of our National Governments is solving the national issue. We are now on the right track in solving this problem with the presentation of the Constitutional Steering Committees Interim Report to parliament, the Prime Minister added.
The two main parties have agreed upon some issues of national interest such as extensive power devolution, establishment of a Senate in addition to the Parliament, protecting rights, shunning all forms of prejudices, founding of an independent judiciary and the resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons in the war etc. as prescribed by the Constitutional Steering Committee.
In the past, the main obstacle to solving the national issues was the different ideologies of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party. We have to halt the political Tug-of-War regarding the main national problems. Now, we are united over theses national problems, the Prime Minister said.
On January 8, 2015 we were unified for the victory of President Maitripala Sirisena as the Common Presidential Candidate. All opposition political parties and civil society joined hands in finding a lasting solution to all national problems. President Maithripala Sirisena since assuming office as President devoted his time and energy to these issues of national importance, the Premier said.
Thereafter, the social and political reality of the country following the subsequent Parliamentary election paved the way for the establishment of the National Government of SLFP and UNP to address long lasted national issues.
So, all personal gains possible under a single party government are not practical under a National Government as such a rule is formed to achieve National goals of utmost importance.
From this stage onward we have to forge ahead with our national aspirations. We hope create a dialogue over the interim report. We are to make available for everyone a copy of the interim report. Parliament will conduct a debate on the report by October end. We want to create a productive dialogue over the matter in the country. In the process, we must not allow the extremist elements to obstruct our forward march. What we could do for the country we could accomplish through the Constitutional Steering Committee. Now the country is obliged to fulfill its national aspirations, the Prime Minister reiterated.
Ministers Gayantha Karunathilake, Sagala Ratnayaka and Vajira Abeywardana and IGP Pujitha Jayasundara also spoke. Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara and Parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Bandula Lal Bandarigoda were also present.

Questions and Answers
Illegal Contract
Question
I am a retired engineer. I joined a reputed construction company after retirement and worked there continuously for five years and stopped working in July, 2017. At the time of joining the construction company, I was asked to enter into contract with the company and I did so accordingly.
The contract had a clause stating that I would not be eligible for EPF, medical benefits and bonus. I signed the contract as I thought these were normal conditions. My contract has been renewed every year for five years subject to the original terms and conditions of my original contract. Please let me know the followings.
1. Is it legal to enter a clause in my contract and deprive me of EPF payments by the company
2. If I am entitled to EPF, irrespective of the above clause in my contract, what steps should I take to claim EPF
3. At the time of concluding my contract, I requested the company to pay me EPF, but they remained silent.
4. Can I complain to the Labour Department and with whom should I correspond
Rupasiri - Panadura
Answer
Although you are a retired engineer, as you are working in a private company on contract basis, you are entitled to EPF.
Paying EPF is a statutory obligation, so the company cant avoid statutory obligations and draft/enter into illegal contracts; therefore, you should complain to the Commissioner of the EPF Labour Department, claiming your EPF with all dues and interest. However, the contract you have entered into is illegal. An illegal contract has no legality from the beginning.

Revocation of a Deed of Gift
Question
I am a Law student. Please advise whether it is possible to revoke a revocable Deed of Gift of a minor without sanction of the District Court
Can a Deed of Gift of an adult with a clause of revocation be revoked writing a mere revocation deed or should sanction from District Court be obtained after filing an action
Answer
In both cases, as the deeds of gifts are revocable it can be revoked without a legal action.
However, with regard to a minor, the Court is the upper's guardian and the Court considers the best interest of a child. So if the deed is irrevocable, then the donor has to go to Courts to revoke the deed of gift. In a revocable deed, the donee accepts the gift subject to the condition of revocation by the donor.

Record-breaking gaming achievement
Nintendo is the undisputed ruler of the handheld video game console market.
From the release of the original Game Boy back in 1989 to the success of the 3DS, the company has seen off competition from Sega and Sony, dominating portable gaming for almost 30 years (40, if you count the Game and Watch series).
With the recent launch of the Switch, Nintendo has blurred the line between handheld and home consoles, creating a machine that is effectively both.
Say what you will about the House of Mario, but its managed to create a device with the power of a modern home gaming machine thats small enough to fit in your coat pocket (depending on the coat).
Imagine then, for a moment, that in this crazy, mixed-up world of ours, someone decided to do the exact opposite: make something that could only display four shades of grey but was also big enough to use as a coffee table
Enter Belgian student Ilhan Unal, who has built a giant working Game Boy that would require its own airplane seat if you tried to take it on holiday with you.
Clocking in at 101 cm tall, 62 cm wide and 20 cm deep, Ilhans oversized love letter to the classic machine means the 21-year-old holds the Guinness World Record for the Largest Game Boy in the world.
Designed on a computer in one week and taking a month to build, the chunky bit of kit plays any original Game Boy title - though mercifully it uses normal GB cartridges, so you dont have to cart around a cupboard door-sized copy of Super Mario Land in a suitcase.
It even uses System Link like the good old days, so you can use a cable to connect to a friends regular Game Boy for awkward multiplayer action. The buttons might be harder to press, but its intimidating size probably awards you a psychological edge over your opponent. Describing his inspiration behind the project, the thoroughly chuffed Ilhan said: People who are able to bring smiles to other peoples faces are generally happier than other people.
Reconnecting 30 and 40-somethings with their greeny grey-tinged youth is a noble quest: The Game Boy made other people happy. It brought back their childhood. When I was a kid, that was what I wanted to do. Those of us who grew up with the Game Boy first time around are likely marvelling at the prospect of being able to play Tetris without having to spend 20 minutes finding the exact lighting angle at which the screen wasnt rendered unplayable from the slightest hint of glare or shadow.
Unfortunately, if you fancy picking one of these up for yourself and pretending to be one of the characters from Land of the Giants (Google it, kids) then youre out of luck, as the humongous handheld wont be in shops any time soon.
While its a bit unwieldy to bring on your bus ride to work (and using it for a Tetris session would quickly result in full upper body cramp) we can all agree that it would be a darn sight easier - and less embarrassing - to use in public than the Nokia N-Gage, the notoriously awful pitta bread-shaped phone/gaming chimera.

Simple steps for a longer life
Many of us resolve to make dramatic health improvements, such as joining the gym or giving up an addiction. But some of the most dramatic changes we can make are incredibly simple.
Here are some easy steps that really will make a difference to your life.
Floss
Flossing at least twice a day is essential to prevent decay. Very few people floss, putting themselves at risk of life-threatening diseases such as mouth cancer and heart disease.
Have your eyes tested
A thorough eye test is a health check that can detect underlying conditions that leave you predisposed to sight loss. So get your eyes tested at least every two years.
Eat good bacteria
Good bacteria or probiotics are essential for our digestive health and helping the immune system to work. In certain circumstances, for example prolonged use of antibiotics or a severe bout of vomiting or diarrhoea, the gut is stripped of its good bacteria.
One of the best sources of probiotics is natural yoghurt.
Take a cholesterol test
Coronary heart disease is the biggest killer. Everyone over 40 should know their cholesterol level and then aim to reduce it.
Stop slouching
Better posture is the single most effective weapon against chronic back problems. Simply stopping your slouch habit at your desk and not lugging around heavy bags can make a huge difference.
Switch to unsalted butter
The recommended amount of salt per day is 6g, but most of us routinely consume around 9g.
Cutting your salt intake by one teaspoon a day can halve your risk of coronary heart disease.
Eat a can of sardines a week
Omega 3 fatty acids in oily fish (such as sardines, tuna and herring) play an important part in the development of the central nervous system - and in countering a range of conditions including heart disease and Alzheimers.
Reduce your waistline
A recent study found that people who had the biggest tummies were 40 per cent more likely to suffer from a heart attack, and that the waistline was a better indication of health than your Body Mass Index.
Women should have a waistline of less than 31.5 inches and men 37 inches.
Stop making plans
Live for the moment. When people reflect on the past and make plans for the future, if you have too many regrets or set yourself unachievable goals, youll end up disappointed.

SLC pleased to assist ICC ACU
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday confirmed that the ICC ACU has commenced a preliminary inquiry in Colombo with regard to various allegations that had been circulating in the recent past.
At a meeting held on Saturday at SLC headquarters the Executive Committee issued a directive to all SLC officials and employees to extend their fullest cooperation providing any and all information required in order to assist the ACU in a thorough inquiry.
Commenting on the inquiry, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva stated: We are most pleased that the ICC ACU has decided to initiate this inquiry. We request all those who have any information to come forward and help with this inquiry by declaring all their information and evidence rather than casting aspersions from the sidelines and damaging the reputation of our players, our cricket and our nation.
We believe this will exonerate our national players, who themselves have requested an inquiry. We are committed to working closely with the ICC to complete this inquiry expeditiously and give our players the freedom to concentrate on playing their cricket without the cloud of these various allegations, which no doubt affect their game, hanging over them.

Somerset in danger after loss to Surrey
LONDON, Friday - Surrey secured their Division One status with a six-wicket victory over Somerset at The Oval, leaving the visitors in serious relegation trouble.
Somerset moved from 113-4 to 306 all out in their second innings with Steve Davies (58) and Peter Trego (68) hitting final-day half-centuries. That left 143 to win for the hosts, which they knocked off in 32.4 overs.
Surrey are up to second, while Somerset must win their last game against Middlesex for a chance of staying up.
Somerset started the day still 51 behind Surrey's first-innings total but half-centuries Trego and Davies resistance as well as a 48-run ninth-wicket partnership between Jack Leach and Dominic Bess set up the possibility of an unlikely victory.
They gave themselves a slim chance when Rory Burns, England opener Mark Stoneman and Ryan Patel were all dismissed to leave Surrey 73-3, but a 44-ball 42 not out from Ben Foakes took the hosts to 146-4.
Foakes hit six fours and a six while Kumar Sangakkara also made an important 35 in his final first-class innings at The Oval. The 39-year-old Sri Lankan has scored 1,442 Championship runs this season at an average of more than 110.
I can't ask for any more. Forget the hundred, but to win, that was outstanding. I never really planned a farewell like this. But to walk off with a win, I can't describe how special that is, Sangakkara told BBC.
The atmosphere in the dressing room has been fantastic all season, but especially in this game. I've been made to feel so welcome, to feel part of the family. I'm just happy I could repay them with some performances.
It has rekindled that passion that I thought I'd lost. When I get on a stretch where I'm scoring runs, I've been able to repeat that process over and over again.
Coming here I wanted to see an improvement as me in a player, but also in Surrey as a side and what's giving me the most satisfaction is watching how the senior players have led this group from being in the second division to being a force in the first division. When you are playing against Sanga you can see the genius of the man. It looks like he is playing a different game at times. It's not nice being on the wrong end of things against him, said Somerset captain Tom Abell.
It was a real battle today and I think we've bowled as well as we have all season in this game. Things just didn't seem to fall our way, but you couldn't fault the effort of our guys. Next week is a cup final now.
If we beat Middlesex we have a chance of staying up.
Champions Essex bowled out Hampshire for 76 to seal a incredible win, having followed on at the Ageas Bowl.
New-ball pair Sam Cook (5-18) and Jamie Porter (2-21) starred as Hampshire, chasing 185 for victory, collapsed in 29.4 overs to lose by 108 runs.
Hampshire, who started the game third in Division One, are still not safe.
Essex - who remain unbeaten - had battled back after being bowled out for 76 themselves in their first innings, with Dan Lawrence's century and brisk lower-order runs in their second innings giving them hope of an unlikely win.
Yorkshire gave a massive boost to their hopes of staying in Division One of the County Championship by hanging on to beat already relegated Warwickshire by two wickets at Headingley.
Steve Patterson's unbeaten 44 was the key as Yorks picked up 21 points from their fourth win of the season.
Northamptonshire threw the Division Two promotion race wide open with a 124-run home win over Nottinghamshire.
Victory against Leicestershire in their final game of the season could send them up, providing Notts earn no more than 11 points against Sussex.
Resuming on 107-3, the visitors lost their last seven wickets for 82 as they were all out for 189.
Notts remain second in the table on 210 points with Northants 13 points behind, with the final round of games starting on Monday.
Sussex bowled Durham out for 131 to complete a 132-run victory on day four at Chester-le-Street.
Durham started the day 5-0 needing 259 more runs for victory but were bowled out in 42.2 overs. Glamorgan and Gloucestershire settled for a tame draw on a lifeless pitch as Nick Selman and Andrew Salter hit career-best scores.
Glamorgan were 353-3 when bad light intervened.
Selman made an assured 142 not out, while Salter's 88 was his second career-best of the game.
The Division Two game between Derbyshire and Kent was abandoned as a draw without a ball bowled on any of the four days at Chesterfield.
A wet outfield prevented any play on Tuesday or Wednesday, while heavy rain fell on Thursday.

Southern students visit Northern counterparts
A group of 60 students from the Southern Province together with their teachers and principals visited Jaffna last Friday to join hands with their Northern colleagues.
The visit was carried out under the student exchange initiative, 'Sahodara Pasal/Padasalai,' launched by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) in collaboration with the Provincial Education Departments
It was organised by the Northern and Southern Education Departments and sponsored by the Southern Province Chief Ministry, following a request by ONUR Chairperson and former President of Sri Lanka Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to Southern Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva.
On Southern Province Chief Ministers special invitation, 12 media personnel from Galle also took part in the tour. The ONUR introduced the novel programme to unite schoolchildren, understand and respect diversity and bring diverse communities in the country together.
Sixty students from the Southern Province and 39 students from the Northern Province of the two diverse ethnic, religious and linguistics backgrounds together with respective teachers, principals and education officials participated in the four-day residential students camp.
During the programme, the students were provided with the opportunity to learn to appreciate diverse aspects of reconciliation.
The programme was formulated and planned in a student centered and activity based manner. The students were guided to collectively make an action plan for the camp under the teachers.
The students learned solemn issues such as conflict transformation and creating national unity and reconciliation among others in a free and enjoyable atmosphere.
The Southern students were accorded with an earnest welcome by the Northern students at the Jaffna College of Technology on Friday evening. The girls were provided lodging at the Jaffna Technology college hostel, while boys stayed at the Jaffna college hostel.
The Southern students were from the Mapalagama Central College and the Mapalagama Sirisunanda School of Galle and Jaffna students were from the Hartley College, Yarltan College, Kaithady Navakuli GTMS, St. Thereshas Girls College, Karainagar Hindu College, Jaffna Central College, Jaffna College, and the Idaikkurichchi Srisubramanium Vidyalaya. Galle Mapalagama Central College Principal W.G.Ajith and Deputy Principal of G/Mapalagama Sirisunanda joined with their students and teachers.

Udayakumara, Southern Province Deputy Education Director J.K. Rajapaksa , Northern Additional Education Director P. Selvin Irenius, Northern Deputy Director of Education K. Manimarpan, Northern Province Deputy Director of Education A.S. Sathgunaraja and several education officials were present.

S&P cuts Chinas credit rating, citing increasing economic, financial risks
S&P Global Ratings downgraded China's long-term sovereign credit rating by one notch on Thursday to A+ from AA-, citing increasing risks from the country's rapid build-up of credit.
"The downgrade reflects our assessment that a prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased China's economic and financial risks," S&P said in a statement, adding that the ratings outlook was stable.
S&P's downgrade follows a similar demotion by Moody's Investors Service in May and comes as the government grapples with the challenges of containing financial risks stemming from years of credit-fuelled stimulus spurred by the need to meet official growth targets.
It also comes less than a month ahead of a highly sensitive twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress which will see a key leadership reshuffle.
Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Financial Group told CNBC via email that China's domestic debt dynamic is a long-standing issue that most investors are already well aware of.
"To be sure, the move by S&P this morning merely brings the ratings agency into line with where Moody's and Fitch already were (5 notches below triple-A). Therefore, the direct economic/market impact of today's decision by S&P is low."
Gallo further explained that this is not going to necessarily see direct translation into a weaker currency because restrictions on outbound flows are still relatively tight. "If anything, the decision by S&P highlights the degree to which China will aim to keep leverage growth within the domestic economy low-to-moderate as opposed to high. This means that neither onshore rates nor the RMB are likely to drop sharply as a result of today's news."
Concerns about China's sustained strong credit growth appear to be increasing, even as first-half economic growth beat expectations.
China's stock markets were already closed Thursday when the downgrade was published, and there was little reaction from the yuan. S&P said that recent efforts by the government to reduce corporate leverage could stabilize financial risks in the medium-term. CNBC News

Sri Lankas uniqueness attracts Germans
Sri Lanka Tourism organized a series of roadshows in four German cities this year as the second step of a promotional campaign which started in 2015, to showcase the country as a unique tourist destination.
In 2015, the first step of the roadshows was held at six most populated German cities including Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg, and Berlin. This year, the second series were held at Cologne, Dortmund, Hannover and Bremen and this promotional activity started on the week from September 12-15.
The events conducted in the aforementioned metro cities were followed by B2B meetings with Sri Lanka trade delegation, bringing travel industry stakeholders into one platform.
The events were graced by Sri Lanka Ambassador for Germany Karunasena Hettiarachchi.
The distinguished guests included Jurgen Weerth - Honorary Consul of Dortmund and Cologne, Claus Holtmann - Honorary Consul of Hannover and Klaus Kriwat, representing the Honorary Consul for Sri Lanka in Bremen and Lower Saxony.
Participants in Hannover
The promotional campaigns were further honoured by the presence of senior German state officials including Ralf Pospich, from the Ministry of Economics, Labour and Transport of Niedersachsen, Ulrike Hiller, State Secretary for Federal and European Affairs and Development Cooperation and Kerstin Lhren, Deputy Chief Protocol of Bremen. Nihal Samaharasinghe, Honorary Consultant to the Minister of Tourism also attended the event held in Dortmund.
The roadshows were organized to promote Sri Lanka as the preferred Asian destination to the Germans. The events were attended by German outbound tour operators and travel agents. Thus, the events proved to be a good opportunity to facilitate new business partnerships with the German counterparts.
During the promotional campaign, Ambassador Hettiarachchi expressed his views on the long-standing relationships between the two governments.
Sutheash Balasubramaniam, Managing Director of Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, by making a destination presentation, highlighted the diversity, authenticity and compactness to position Sri Lanka in the minds of the German participants as a unique destination in Asia.
The positive comments which were made by several German participants at the roadshow proved how Sri Lanka has become a popular tourist destination across the globe. The German counterparts were excited to see the colourful attractions depicting cultural heritage, picturesque landscapes and the diversity, which encouraged them to explore the destination.
During the promotional campaign, Sri Lanka Tourism was able to receive positive feedback from the German counterparts. The overall rating given for events highlighted a positive impact while the suggestions included more improvement on promotional activities.
B2B in Cologne
Claus Holtmann, Honorary Consul of Hannover, gave an excellent overview of Sri Lanka as a compact and versatile island at the roadshow. He said,"I have been to Sri Lanka several times with my family. The screen saver on my laptop changes every time you open it. One morning, a picture of a whale comes up, then a beautiful landscape, a beach or monument of Sri Lanka. I can only underline what you have just seen in the presentation. Sri Lanka is so versatile, compact and manifold.
Ulrike Hiller, State Secretary for Federal and European Affairs and Development Cooperation, specifically mentioned that both nations have the same aims in promoting tourism. He further mentioned that he was glad Sri Lanka had developed so well and become a safe destination and is able to present its beautiful features in the world.
Jrgen Becker, representative of BCD Travel, recommended Sri Lanka as an ideal travel destination. He said, After travelling to Sri Lanka in the 1980s, I am quite excited to go back next year and explore the changes in the country. We also do lots of business travel to Sri Lanka because we have got lots of clients who work in the textile industry.
Lam Kann Naichun, a representative from the Pacific Travel, expressed his ideas on the compactness of Sri Lanka as a characteristic of a perfect travel destination, when compared with the other countries in the Asian region: We are dealing with lot of tourism to India and do not sell many trips to Sri Lanka yet. Sri Lanka is very compact and a tourist can do many different things in one day. Tourists could just travel by car, bus or train and see a cultural highlight and the beach in one day. In addition, Sri Lanka is still a lot more affordable than most Asian countries.
Tanja Altenwirth, representative of DEPART, also recommended Sri Lanka highlighting the compactness of the country. It was really interesting evening. We know now that we could promote Sri Lanka again. I didnt know about its many facets, from wildlife to beach, from culture to food. Years ago, we would sell a package including a Sri Lanka round trip, but then send the clients to the Seychelles beach. A big selling factor obviously is the stable political situation which is not the case in many other tourist countries.
Apart from these remarks, the representatives of the Sri Lankan travel associations had given their input for further improvement of the industry.
This promotional campaign which was carried out by Sri Lanka Tourism not only enabled to create a positive impact among the German counterparts but also generated an interest to the Sri Lankan tourism sector, enabling Sri Lanka to become one of the most sought after destinations across the Asian continent.

Sri Lankan arrested with nearly 1kg of gold in his rectum

Sri Lankan authorities have arrested a man for allegedly trying to smuggle gold and jewellery weighing up to 1kg (2.2lb) hidden in his rectum.
Customs officials found 904 grams of gold, worth about 4.5m Sri Lankan rupees ($29,370, 21,700) inside the suspect's rectal cavity.
The 45-year-old Sri Lankan man was bound for India but was stopped at Colombo's international airport.
There have been several similar cases in past years.
Typically smugglers in the region buy gold in places like Dubai and Singapore, where it is relatively cheap, and then bring it to India to sell there at a profit.
A customs officer said that they spotted the man because "he was walking suspiciously".
Metal detectors then identified the hidden luggage, "carefully packed in polythene bags and neatly inserted", according to a custom officer.
"Among that there were four yellow gold biscuits, three pieces of yellow gold, six yellow gold jewellery articles and two silver plated yellow gold jewellery articles," a customs spokesman said.
Last week a Sri Lankan female also travelling to India was caught by customs while trying to smuggle 314.5 grams of gold pieces concealed in her rectum.

Japan's Toshiba is locked in last minute discussions over key issues with the would-be buyers of its $18 (roughly Rs. 1,14,817 crores) billion memory chip business led by US private equity firm Bain, potentially delaying a formal agreement on the sale.
Toshiba said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell the prized unit to the Bain consortium, and had been expected to formalise the sale on Thursday.
Instead, South Korea's SK Hynix, part of the winning consortium, said talks were still ongoing. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed consortium members were still wrangling over details of their agreement and said commitment letters from all participants were still needed before the sale could be signed formally.
There are some key issues still to be agreed upon in the content approved by Toshiba's board, the South Korean chipmaker said in a statement, adding that it would continue talks. (Gadgets)

US expands travel ban to include N Korea

The United States has expanded its controversial travel ban to include people from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad. 
The White House said the restrictions follow a review of information sharing by foreign governments. Donald Trump issued a presidential proclamation late on Sunday. "Making America safe is my number one priority. 
We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet," Trump said. 
The restrictions on Venezuelans apply only to government officials and their family members. 
The three new countries join five others from Trump's original travel ban: Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia. But the new proclamation removed restrictions that were placed on Sudan. Trump's original ban was highly controversial, as it affected six majority-Muslim countries, and was widely labelled a "Muslim ban". 
It was subject to a range of legal challenges and the subject of several large-scale protests, and is due to be considered by the US Supreme Court in October, having been partly reinstated in July. 
The American Civil Liberties Union rights group said the addition of the new countries "doesn't obfuscate the real fact that the administration's order is still a Muslim ban". 
It is not yet clear how the president's new proclamation, which changes several key elements, will affect that legal challenge. 
The addition of North Korea and Venezuela now means not all nations on the list are majority-Muslim. 
The criteria for the new ban list is now based on vetting procedures and co-operation, and the restrictions have now been "tailored" on a country-by-country basis: 
The White House said North Korea did not co-operate with the US government "in any respect" and failed all requirements - and so all travel to the US by its citizens has been bannedChad, while an important counter-terrorism partner, did not share terrorism-related and other public information the US required - business and tourist visas for its nationals are suspended 
Only "certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate family members" have been banned - its government was recently been hit with economic sanctions by the US, who now say it does not co-operate "in verifying whether its citizens pose national security or public-safety threats" and does not receive deported nationals willingly 
Most of the restrictions come in the form of suspension of B-1 and B-2 business and tourist visas, and they do not appear to be time-limited in the way that Trump's former executive order was. In a fact sheet accompanying Trump's proclamation, the White House said that while Iraq also falls short of the required criteria, the country was not included in the new restrictions "because of the close co-operative relationship between the United States" and their part in fighting so-called Islamic State. 
The restrictions come into effect on 18 October, but will not apply to those already in possession of a valid visa, the White House said.

Websites creating public discord with Myanmars Rohingya issue
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen denied social media accusations that he invited Myanmars Rohingya refugees to come into Sri Lanka yesterday.
He said those far-flung accusations were part of an operation by some sinister political elements that are trying to fan the flames of communalism.
I have already lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department regarding this, the minister said.I have called the CID on Saturday to investigate into social media posts that quoted me as saying that I made any statement nearly as calling Myanmars Rohingya refugees into Sri Lanka, he said.
Some social media websites has alluded that I have promised citizenship to Myanmar refugees, Bathiudeen said.I am not the President of this country. I have no capacity to offer citizenship to anyone.
This was all total fabrications carried out with a purpose to cause discord between Muslims and the Sinhalese public, he pointed out.
They have gone on to instigate the public to surround my official residence in Colombo over this malicious news.They staged a picket over this story they had invented over the social media, he said.
Meanwhile, sources at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs said , the country has not admitted any Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.
However, the Rohingya refugees had come to the country previously on three occasions. Even they had left the country, the sources said. They came to be handed over to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, they said.

When neighborhood bookstore is closing down
I sometimes fantasize about moving to another city. Ideally that city would be inexpensive, but with the all the amenities of a big city. Right now a ridiculously expensive one-bedroom apartment is home. Despite the rent, I absolutely love the area where I live. With the exception of affordability, my neighborhood has most of what I want or need and most of it is in walking distance. Grocery stores, movie theaters, restaurants, and even my church are mere blocks away.
There is a substantial amount of green space suitable for walking, running, or just relaxing. Best of all, there are multiple bookstores nearby. Or at least, there were.
When I first moved to town in 2006 there were five bookstores in my neighborhood. Barnes & Noble and Borders each occupied large pieces of real estate.
Three independent bookstores took up less real estate but left big marks on the neighborhood. One of the independents sold comic books while another focused on politics and history. The third had more books about art than a museum store.
It was an embarrassment of riches really, but of course that didnt last. Eleven years later and only two of those five bookstores are left  the comic bookstore and the Barnes & Noble. By the end of the year it will only be one as the Barnes & Noble is closing.
Reading needs
Interesting though it was, the political bookstores inventory was too narrow for my reading needs. I barely noticed when it closed. Losing Borders upset me mostly because of what it seemed to portend for bookstores as a whole. Losing the art bookstore was a shock. I could always find interesting and unique stuff there, books I hadnt seen anywhere else.
It was a great store and I was sorry to see it go. Finding out about the impending closure of my local Barnes & Noble has been the biggest blow of them all. I cant say I am totally surprised. Barnes & Noble has been struggling for years. Two other of the chains stores in the next city over closed a few years ago. Still, Im crushed.
Places with books have always been my happy place, my sanctuary. In times of stress simply walking a bookstore brightens my day. The city I grew up in had several new and used bookstores.
They were like a second homes, I spent so much time in them. In high school I took two buses across town to get to school. There was a bookstore in between the stop where I got off one bus and the stop where I caught the second bus. If I had a stressful day at school, perusing the shelves of the bookstore on the way home nearly always made the day better. Ive lived in many different cities since high school and in each one I sought out a nearby bookstore to call my part-time home.
Bookstore value
The first time I saw a Barnes & Noble bookstore was in Boston in the 90s. It was the biggest bookstore I had ever seen. It had multiple floors. Comfortable chairs provided a somewhere to sit and think about which books to purchase. It totally blew me away. It was overwhelming in the best possible way. I literally wrote a letter home to my parents about it.
Incidentally I also love libraries and have several favorite independent bookstores, but with its size, selection, and late hours, Barnes & Noble quickly became and remained one of favorite book places. Bonus if it is one that sold coffee on the premises, like my soon-to-disappear local store.
I dont just walk around bookstores and browse till my stress levels have receded and my mood has lifted.
Barnes & Nobles is where I do a significant amount of my gift shopping. (Im the type of aunt who gives books at Christmas.) Except for comics, it is where I buy most of my own books. It is important me that to have a bookstore in my neighborhood.
Talking about the value of bookstores isnt enough, I know.
So I made a point of supporting my neighborhood store with my dollars. Apparently it wasnt enough.
Bookish items
Around the same time that I found out that Barnes & Noble was closing I learned that a new bookstore had recently opened.
It isnt too far away from the present location of Barnes & Noble and sells primarily used books. It also sells cute bookish items like book themed washi tape (a current obsession of mine) and journals. This new store is the bright spot amidst the news of the Barnes & Noble closure.
It wont replace Barnes & Noble. Its small and doesnt stay open that late. But thank goodness it exists.
I wonder how the closure of Barnes & Noble will change my book discovery and reading habits.
Podcasts, the bookternet, and book reviews provide a plethora of book recommendations. Nevertheless one of my favorite ways to find something new to read is to walk up and down a bookstores aisles and see what catches my eye. I read the note cards employees leave recommending books.
Something specific
I check out the new releases shelves, the bargain books, and the themed tables spread throughout the store. When I shop online it is usually for something specific. When I walk into a store, I may have something specific in mind but inevitably something else catches my attention. Serendipity will now place a much smaller role in my reading life.
Putting aside my own reading woes, I wonder how the closure of the bookstore will change the neighborhood.
The loss of the other bookstores didnt seem to change the neighborhood that much. Still once Barnes & Noble closes there will be no store dedicated to selling new books in the neighborhood.
Housing costs are high in my neighborhood but I could justify it (at least in part) because of the amenities. With the closure of the bookstores, the neighborhood seems a little less worth the price.

Why build new worlds
When J. R. R. Tolkien theorized writing fantasy literature, he called the successful fantasy author a sub-creator; someone who can make a Secondary World which your mind can enter. While you are inside this world, you accept as true the ways in which it has been constructed. The laws that hold this world together have to be coherent and consistent. The moment disbelief arises, warns Tolkien, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather, art, has failed.
Not all fantasy builds entire imaginary worlds. There are brilliant and powerful fantasy works that simply enchant our own world (the Primary World, in Tolkiens terminology). But high, or immersive fantasy allows us to inhabit another world, an alternative world. [SUBHEAD] Dragons forever It may have elements of what we know and recognize, but it is also fundamentally different. In some of these worlds dragons exist and elves live forever and can be reincarnated. In others, language has the power to summon and transform, or children can fly with the help of fairy dust. In yet others, human beings are accompanied by an aspect of their consciousness in the form of an animal, or there is an entire parallel universe of magic, complete with a secret Ministry. In its offer of an alternate reality, fantasy has much in common with science fiction. But while science fiction worlds are more about speculation and thought experiments, fantasy worlds tend to focus on enchantment and the revival of mythical motifs.
To talk about fantasy worlds is to talk about imaginary space and time, carefully thought through and crafted. In The Lord of the Rings, Elrond reminisces about the Last Alliance of Elves and Men thousands of years in the past, and this is not a literary device. By the time he wrote that scene, Tolkien had been constructing his secondary world, Arda (only the north-western part of which is Middle-earth), for over two decades.
The heroes of the past that Aragorn mentions to the hobbits had already been invented by Tolkien many years before, and they were fully developed characters with elaborate stories, not names dropped to create an effect. The sense of depth of time in Tolkiens fantasy is tangible.
Painstaking efforts
As for space, the maps of Middle-earth are not there for decoration, but are an integral part of the experience of reading Tolkiens work. His painstaking efforts to make the geography work realistically are legend. He even respected the phases of the moon within the chronology of The Lord of the Rings, as the characters move across his invented landscape. Tolkien also devised entire timelines and genealogies that showed his world unfolding in time. And his landscapes are inhabited by flora and fauna that is inventive and significant: from the golden mallorn trees in Lothlrien, to the awe-inspiring Oliphants.
And, with this rich setting that gives you a where and when, comes culture. Or, rather, cultures. The encyclopaedic detail that accompanies many of these cultures make Tolkiens mythology read like history, like a vast tapestry of interweaved historical narratives. That is the sort of fantasy that George R. R. Martin has also adhered to in his series A Song of Ice and Fire. The politics of Martins clashing cultures may have moved beyond a good-vs-evil dichotomy, but the presentation of competing ideologies and an understanding of the cultural other and its distinct point of view is already there in Tolkiens writing.
For Tolkien, this massive world-building was in part a way of dealing with the many traumas of his early life (from orphanhood to the horrors of the Somme) and a way of indulging in his secret vice, the art of creating imaginary languages (languages, of course, need speakers to develop and flourish). For other fantasists, the motivations are different.
The creation of Ursula Le Guins Earthsea was, in many ways, an act of writing against Middle-earth and the medievalism of the many secondary worlds that followed it. Rather than constructing a world that feels like the landmass of Northwestern Europe in a vaguely medieval period, Le Guin gives us a Polynesia-like archipelago of islands inhabited by copper-skinned and black people, with white people considered barbarians at the fringes of the main civilization.
quest romances
She was quite conscious of her choice: I didnt see why everybody in heroic fantasy had to be white, she wrote. Added to that, Earthsea is more tribal than feudal. It is a world that revolves around principles of anthropology (rites of passage, sympathetic magic and shamanism) rather than philology, epics and quest romances. It has a Taoist flavour, rather than the Christian undertones of Middle-earth or C. S. Lewiss Narnia.
Part of the pleasure of creating fantasy worlds is fulfilling the desire to play God. Tolkien described sub-creation (a word used knowingly) as the duty of writers to imitate Gods creation of the Primary World. He captured this idea in a line of verse in his poem Mythopoeia: We make still by the law in which were made.
This religious (or metaphysical) motivation for world-building had already been expressed by George MacDonald, Tolkiens Victorian predecessor and one of the grandfathers of Tolkienian fantasy. MacDonald claimed that the laws of nature may suggest laws of other kinds, and man may, if he pleases, invent a little world of his own, with its own laws. In their thinking, God was the ultimate world-builder: he created the wonder of the natural world. The fantasist follows in the same divine footsteps, but his or her worlds only exist in the imagination.
And if playing God is, perhaps, a rather loaded expression, then just playing is a good enough motivation in itself. Indeed, many authors of fantasy started creating worlds as part of childhood play. The phenomenon of childhood paracosms, elaborate worlds created by small groups of children, often siblings, is fascinating. The Bront siblings created the fantastical worlds of Angria and Gondal, complete with their distinct geography, history and tales of adventure and intrigue. Boxen, the paracosm created by C. S. Lewis and his brother Warnie, included talking animals  a concept that eventually fed into Narnia.

a world run to seed
All this was years ago, but how could I forget
the first thing I did when you finally left me
was grow distinctly unlike myselfso distinctly unlike

That when help was offered I took it. Those kind hosts
my Canadian cousinsif cousins they were, and at what
distant remove from me I no longer remember
invited me out for a slice of their black sheep life

Which had come to the good: ten luxy days in Vancouver
and ten so absurd I Was Wondering: am I myself
or what This ones the big surprise, they told me,
This oneII really leave every trouble behind

And I found I was thousands of feet up the Rockies
expected to horse-trek. Horses! Id sooner be called
a coward. So every morning, while they would be
tinkling and giggling and shouting goodbye in the distance

I would be left as I wanted, free to wander alone.
The mountains were everything everyone said,
but the village . . . Looked down on, it seemed that a flock
of herring gulls had landed and suddenly atrophied:

Rough slate roofs like wings stuck out, white clapboard walls
mottled with green, and all deserted but ours
ours had stayed as a holiday home for anyone
thinking they ought to refresh themselves with the sight

Of a world run to seed, and a scruffy mine
which was famous, exhausted, and left to decay. The mine
itself was a ship with its side stoved in a huge hull
criss-crossed with ladders and platforms running

Wherever I chose to look, but mostly drawing me down
to a plug of dirty cement where the shaft began.
I never went close, but my morning walk to the pines,
which began where the village stopped, would show me

As much as I wanted to see. for days I imagined this
was the view that I would remember: this I decided
would float through my head when I thought of the time
I was telling myself to forget you. It seemed enough.

But just as my visit was ending, and I was up there
under the pines of a morning as ever, brooding,
someone appeared at my side who made me believe
I was wrong. He emerged from the trees with no more

Than the prickly crack of needles and Well . . .
Good day . . .
 a figure who when I was squinting up to him
into the sun, and glimpsing tangled hair, a tartan shirt,

I thought might be insane, or a beached hippy
someone who might be expected to sell me a ring
from a tray of bent-nail jewelry. All he wanted,
in fact, was to reveal what he called Our treasure.

Wozniacki retains Tokyo crown
TOKYO AFP Sept24, 2017 :Defending champion Caroline Wozniacki romped to a 6-0, 7-5 victory over Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Sunday to win her third WTA Pan Pacific Open.
The Danish former world number one needed only 75 minutes to complete the rout under the Tokyo sunshine, capturing her first title of the year after losing in six finals.
Third seed Wozniacki stormed through the first set in just 22 minutes, blazing winners past a stunned Pavlyuchenkova.
The Russian saved a match point in the 10th game of the second set before Wozniacki converted on her third opportunity, the world number six fizzing a backhand pass down the line to claim her 26th career title.
It was my seventh final this year and obviously after a while it gets harder and harder, said Wozniacki after winning her first tournament since Hong Kong in October last year.
Obviously I've won here in the past and it has great memories for me so I'm happy I was able to stay focused and aggressive, she added.
Everything was going my way in the first set. The second set was tricky but I managed to stay positive and it feels great to win the title again. It was awesome. Wozniacki, also Tokyo winner in 2010 and runner-up in 2014, joined former greats Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini with three Pan Pacific Open crowns.
