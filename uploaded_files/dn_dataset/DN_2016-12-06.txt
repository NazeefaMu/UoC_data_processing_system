Sri Lankas first ever all-femalepercussion band live on stage
Thuryaa, Sri Lankas first ever all-female percussion band is set to thrill audiences with their concert Thuryaa Live in Colombo 2016, their first public performance in Sri Lanka and it will be an unforgettable event for the music lovers in the country. This will be a remarkable experience in the Sri Lankan percussion art scene. This is a revolutionary milestone in the history of Sri Lankan percussion art.

We are the first ever female percussion band in Sri Lanka and this is our first public show. We launched the band in 2015. So far there is no female percussion artist in Sri Lanka who continues performing at a professional level, said Sithara Maduwanthi, the leader of Thuryaa
Sithara, is the first female student enrolled in Percussion Music Department of the University of Visual and Performing Arts. Percussion music is an art form which is highly dominated by men till Sithara stepped into the scene at the University of Visual and Performing Arts percussion music department.
Although it was quite a challenging task, especially to change the conservative mindsets inside and outside of the University, Sithara had the support and guidance of Sriyan Chandrasekara, Lecturer in Tabla of University of Visual and Performing Arts along with nine other young, enthusiastic, energetic female students who wanted to join and perform alongside her.
These girls want to become professionals and build a career in the field of percussion. Since the percussion industry is dominated by men, these girls want to break the boundaries and get into the field of percussion, stated Maduwanthi.
Thuryaa womens drums ensemble brought pride to Sri Lanka recently by winning the first place in the best music category and also the first place in the recent 18th Global Female Folk and Dance competition and carnival held in Punjab, India at University of Lovely Professional.
Percussion requires a lot of energy so that is a challenge we have. This is not an industry for females. That is also a challenge but we are determined to establish ourselves as professional in the percussion industry, pointed out Maduwanthi
Students of the University of Visual and Performing Arts, the all-female ensemble was formed with these ten talented undergraduate minds. Shaping with the essences of Kandyan, Low country and Sabaragamu traditions of Sri Lankan percussion art, Thuryaas ultimate goal is to explore and develop a novel trend in the Sri Lankan percussion art scene.
Going beyond the conceptual boundaries and challenging the existing trends of the contemporary percussion music, Thuryaa is the trailblazer of Sri Lankan percussion music with a much more novel feminine theme Share the rhythm of humanity, explained Maduwanthi.
The music direction by Sriyan Chandrasekara, Sithara Maduwanthi (Leader), Tharuka Sewwandi, Nadeeka Asuranada, Chamini Anuruddhika, Sanduni Chathurangi, Shalini Yashodha, Hashani Siriwardhana, Chethani Rathnayake, Chathurika Sandaruwani and Oshin Sachini are the members of the band.
Thuryaa Live in Colombo 2016 will be held on December 6 at 7pm at Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre.

Stronger mechanisms needed to safeguard differently abled  persons rights

The differently abled persons requested that a stronger mechanisms to coordinate and monitor their rights is vital, and they rejected the initiatives to entrust their issues to one ministry.
Convener to the February 8 Movement Cyril Sirwardane said one ministry cannot be held accountable to ensure the rights of the differently abled persons.
Wed need a powerful institution than a ministry. It would be great if the government can establish a separate body, functioning under the Presidents direct purview, the Prime Ministers or Cabinets who would also be the convener, he said addressing the media at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES).
At present, the Social Service Department under the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry is committed to create an independent lifestyle for differently abled and vision impaired persons.
Ashoka Bandula, one of the movements conveners, said the existing National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) has been a failure. He said the reason could be that its composition, functions and powers are controlled by a single ministry.
The members of the February 8 Movement urged that their rights are beyond welfare. They pointed out that the Social Services Ministry does not have the capacity to coordinate and guide other ministries to safeguard the rights of the persons with disabilities.
They also highlighted that effective inter-ministerial coordination is vital to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal opportunity without any barriers.
It has been nearly two decades since the Act for protection of the rights of persons with disabilities was passed, but nothing has been done effectively to ensure our rights, said Bandula.
Rasanjali Pathirage of the Sri Lanka Foundation of the Rehabilitation of the Disabled said differently abled women also face extreme discrimination.
The NCPD has never ensured the rights of the women with disabilities. It never made an attempt to include differently abled women as a part of the programmes initiated by the Women and Children Affairs Ministry, she claimed.

SLC launches  program to train coaches  systematically

Talent should not be measured by the runs, but a cricketers steady batting style, said Sri Lankan batting legend Aravinda de Silva after a cricket coaches conference conducted by the SLC at the Sports Ministry auditorium yesterday.
De Silva also stated that certificates and trophies should not be the basis to measure the talent. He was of the view that mental stability of a sportsman plays a vital role in bringing out his best while being consistent.
As coaches we have to boost players self confidence, said De Silva who heads the SLC Cricket Committee.
The conference was a part of SLCs program to train cricket coaches islandwide systematically in order to produce top cricketers.
Former Test captain and a solid middle-order batsman Hashan Tillakaratne and former all-rounder Upul Chandana who was an outstanding fielder during his playing days have joined hands with SLCs Skill Development Program which is run under the supervision of High Performance Manager Simon Willis, the former Kent coach.
Willis said that Sri Lanka has lot of talented youngsters and this development program has identified 20 fast bowlers to be trained under a long term plan.
Our plan is to have a back up to be used as the requirement of the national side, said Willis.
Tillakaratne will serve as an assistant batting coach for Sri Lanka A team and the Development squad and also help to uplift the batting standards at provincial and district levels.
Chandana will look after the bowling at provincial and district levels.
Commenting on the recruitment of Tillakaratne and Chandana, De Silva said that SLC has launched a long term program to develop cricket where two former great cricketers have joined to educate and share their vast knowledge with young cricketers.
We are privileged to have our finest fast bowler Chaminda Vaas as the fast bowling coach of the national team and hopefully bring in former greats Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Asanka Gurusingha and incomparable Muthiah Muralitharan in the future, De Silva said.
Head coach Graham Ford said, The coaches training program is a milestone in developing Sri Lanka cricket. Apart from strengthening batting skills of batsmen we have to focus on developing batting of spinners who come as tail-enders. Strengthening the lower order will greatly benefit in the Test format.
In teams like Australia and England the lower order batsmen do a great job to evade defeat. Cricket history has proved that many times surviving from the last ball of the penultimate day will have a great impact on the fate of the match on the final day.

No curtailment of funds for Provincial Council: Ravi

The funds allocated for Provincial Councils by the Central Government through its Budget 2017 have not been curtailed in any form, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake reiterates.
He points out that there is no truth whatsoever in the charges made by certain Provincial Council Chief Ministers that Budget 2017 has curtailed the amount of money allocated for Provincial Councils comparing to previous budgets.
Explaining further, Minister Karunanayake said that the pattern of Budget allocation to Provincial Councils has been changed this time by providing some funds directly to line ministries.
Accordingly, the Provincial Councils will not be able to use government funds for wasteful activities such as foreign trips and, such valuable money will be used to provide necessary public amenities in the province.
At the same time, regular funds will be provided to the Provincial Councils as in the past but other funds have already been allocated to line ministries according to the requirements of such ministries.
In addition, vehicle registration fees, stamp fees, courts penalties, Local Government taxes and different types of revenues other than taxes collected by Local Government institutions will not be deposited to a consolidated fund. They will be deposited to the Provincial Council Fund instead.

He said that only 25 persons engaged in transporting sands obtain proper permits from the authorities.
Jayaratne said that peoples support is needed to protect the environment.
I have already given instructions to Ministry officials take prompt action against those involved in destroying the environment, he said. Jayaratne said that the environment is not protected merely because the President is holding the Ministry. The support of government servants and the public is required for the protection of environment.

Committee to  study judicial  sentencing policy

Discrepancies questionedin bail for Wimal, Gunaratnam
A committee has been appointed to study on the sentencing and bail policy to reduce inconsistencies, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said at a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe was responding to a question from the media concerning the differences in bail and sentencing policies followed by the judiciary regarding Kumar Gunaratnam and the outdated passport case against Wimal Weeravansa.
There are certain inconsistencies regarding the sentencing policy and bail policy in Sri Lanka. Thus it should not be misinterpreted as the court is favouring a certain party.
Currently, the granting of bail and sentencing is based on Discretionary Jurisdiction. The decisions of bail or sentencing on seemingly two identical cases, shall differ, he said.
Foreign countries usually have a guide when using Discretionary Jurisdiction, which we do not have in Sri Lanka, which may cause this inconsistency. We have formed a committee to study sentencing policy and bail policy while paying special attention to laws in foreign countries regarding bail and sentencing, the minister said.
The rule of law is the foremost check on political power used against peoples rights. Protecting the judiciary is the responsibility of all parties. There was a series of unfair criticisms, false rumours etc. about magistrates, spread by the Lankaenews website, he said.
The website was using unacceptable language in the articles it was publishing. Magistrates were badly affected, both career and emotional wise, because of these rumours. I was planing to go to court regarding this matter when the Gampaha Magistrates Court issued an international arrest warrant against the Lankaenews Editor for contempt of court, for publishing a photograph of a suspect in a case of assault, even before the suspect was produced for an identification parade, Minister Rajapakshe said.
Referring to the ISIS claim made by him, the minister said he stands by his statement despite who says what.
I have received information when I made the comment and I am responsible for every statement I make. My statement may seem controversial, depending on with what point of view people take. The situation I was referring to is a thing that many are unwilling to shed light on. I made this statement so that a discussion will rise, Rajapakshe said.
If a discussion rises, it will prevent any social conflict. These matters are highly emotional, so it is important that we make space for discussion. A small incident can cause a catastrophe. My intention was to stop such a disaster taking place, Minister Rajapakshe said.

Not a cent offered by Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC) would be accepted under any reason, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this comment with reference to the Budgetary Proposal that invited the CTC to donate Rs. 500 million to the Presidential Fund to be utilised by the Presidential Task Force for the anti-smoking campaign.
The President said he issued a clear statement through the Presidential Secretariat on the day after the Budget speech that he was not ready to accept even a cent offered by the CTC under any reason. It is our policy, stressed the President.
He made these observations joining in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2017 when the Finance Head of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry was taken up. The President, commenting on the shortage of doctors and nursing staff in the country, said the main reason for that situation is the large number of doctors and nurses leaving the country.
The number of nurses coming out of nursing colleges annually is very little compared to the number of nurses retiring and leaving the country. I make an earnest plea from all consultant doctors and nursing staff to avoid leaving the country as much as possible. At the same time, there are about 15,000 Sri Lankan doctors serving in foreign countries. I invite them to come back and serve the country at least for a short period, he said.

JO members at protest  should share equal liability  for levelling threats: PM

The Joint Opposition parliamentarians too will have to take the responsibility for the threat levelled by the protesters on Saturday along Parliament Road if the members were present at the site, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation referring to the Joint Opposition protest along Parliament Road on Saturday after Joint Opposition MP and MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena raised a privilege issue. We regret the firing of water cannon and tear gas but the Opposition has to take the blame for the alleged threat to surround Parliament, the Premier said. Those who staged the protest were not university students but members of pradeshiya sabhas and other local bodies. One had raped 100 women while the other had killed a foreign national and raped his wife. According to information I received, only one lane was closed on that day. They are the decisions that the Police can take.
The Prime Minister said those who came said they would surround Parliament.
He added that until that statement was made, it was a protest.
It was not by university students but by the municipal council chairmen, provincial council chairmen and others involved in thefts, the Prime Minister said.
At this stage Opposition and government MPs traded charges and the Speaker ordered Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara to take his seat.
He also instructed Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe to take his seat.
If those people say that they would surround Parliament it is a threat to Parliament, the Prime Minister said. At such a moment if there was a parliamentarian among protesters, he too is complicit.
There is a great difference between what these members say and what we saw through the media.There was an organised gang. I feel sorry that they were attacked by water cannons.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said Opposition members are trying to say that sil observers were attacked by water cannons.
But these were Upasaka Balallu (wolves in sheeps clothing). They are those who are skilled in burning tyres and attacking vehicles. One chairman had raped 100 women, another had raped a foreign woman in Tangalla and killed her husband. So are we not afraid At such a moment, Police act, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this should not be repeated.
We have told Police to allow the people to protest. The two groups could stage the protest on either side, but leave a little space for us to travel. The other matter is that as the road is being renovated, the ordinary people are trapped due to a traffic jam, he said.
Raising a privilege issue, Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena said the privileges of Parliamentarians to move freely and their protection have been secured by the Act.
He added that last Saturday that privilege was breached.
Last Saturday, several members experienced it including MP Soysa who brought the matter before Parliament on Saturday, Gunawardena said. If the people are not allowed to meet us, let us meet those people. The Premier too promised that the people who come to meet us would be allowed. We are ready to explain this situation if the Chair allows us.
At this stage UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said Gunawardena was not stopped going out of Parliament but he was stopped by Police while on his way to Parliament. There was a large number of thugs, and I suggest that if we could lead them to the Parliament grounds we would have been able to trim it easily, Jayamaha said.

Accusedgrantedbail

Barredfrom leavingcountry


Fifteen prosecution witnesses including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were yesterday noticed to appear before the Colombo High Court on March 20 to testify in the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
Attanayake was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo High Court following the Attorney Generals stance that the prosecution would not object for bail since defence should be given sufficient time to access with the computer evidence prior to the trial.
High Court Judge Sajojini Kusala Weerawardena ordered the former UNP General Secretary to be released on a cash bail of Rs. 25,000 with four sureties of Rs. 500,000 each. Meanwhile, Attanayake was further barred from leaving the country and case against him was fixed for trial on March 20 next year.
On October 19, Attanayake was ordered to be remanded till December 5 for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act. Additional Solicitor General Wasantha Navaratne Bandara PC with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the Attorney General. The Attorney General alleged that Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
The Attorney General alleged Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.The Attorney General has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as witnesses in the case.

Apollo denies reports of Jayalalithaas  death, says she is  on life support

Apollo Hospitals denied media reports that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa passed away on Monday evening, saying that doctors from both AIIMS and Apollo continue provide her with life-saving measures.
Dismissing the reports as totally baseless and false, Apollo asked news channels to rectify their mistake.
Confusion gripped Tamil Nadu as news of Jayalalithaas death was flashed by Tamil news channels and picked up by the national media.
Soon, a scuffle broke out between AIADMK supporters and police with the former throwing stones and upturning barricades outside Apollo Hospitals in Chennai. Police, deployed in large numbers to preempt any untoward incident, were forced to resort to lathicharge.
Even the party flag was seen flying at half mast at the AIADMK headquarters in Royapettah after the reports of her death, but it was hoisted once again after the hospital issued a denial. The chief minister, who has been in Apollo since September 22, had suffered the cardiac arrest on Sunday evening. The party MLAs are scheduled to meet later this evening, apparently to chalk out the next course of action. Though party sources did not reveal the agenda of the meeting scheduled in the evening, they, however, confirmed that the legislators would discuss key matters.
The AIADMK chief suffered the cardiac arrest hours after her party told media that she has fully recovered and will be returning home soon.
Born in 1948, Jayalalithaa started her career as an actress in South Indian films. In 1982, she joined the AIADMK, which was founded by her mentor M.G. Ramachandran. She first became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991.

Twenty five tons of Triposha dispatched by train by officers of the Rajagiriya Factory to the Badulla District Health Services Office for distribution among expectant mothers and low weight children in Badulla district have been lying idle in two goods compartments at the Kotagala Railway Station for the past two weeks.
The stock of Triposha had been handed over to the Railway Department on October 3 for dispatch to Badulla. As two months had passed since handing over the consignment to the railways any further delay may cause the entire stock to perish, public health officials said.
They said Triposha should be consumed within a period of three months after dispatch from the factory and as such, it should reach the beneficiaries at least two weeks before its date of expiry.
The station master at Kotagala on inquiry, said he would take steps to dispatch the consignment as soon as he received a railway engine and driver.
