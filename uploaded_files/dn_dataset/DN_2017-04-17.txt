Beach parties harm environment, tourist industry
Beach parties which continue late at night cause more harm than good to the tourist industry and the environment. They are held throughout a week on the Mirissa Beach which go on till dawn during the peak of the tourist season, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) General Manager and CEO Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said.
Marine life is at risk due to the use of high powered laser beams and decibel music that resonate at night at some of the tourist attractions which are advertised as beach parties, he said.
The MEPA established by the Sri Lanka Government under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008 is responsible for preventing, controlling and managing the pollution of Sri Lankas marine environment
Beach parties are held seven days a week during the tourist season in the Mirissa Tourist zone in the south. They start off at around 8.30 or 9.00 pm and go on till 3.00am. High powered laser beams light up the waves and DJ music penetrates areas miles away. This is very harmful to marine life. The Mirissa beach has been a natural nesting ground for sea turtles, but they are shying away now due to such harmful tourist extravaganzas, he said.
The tourist industry should be developed but not by harming the attractions that draw the tourists to the country. If the authorities do not take immediate action to control the situation, the industry is going to suffer, Dr. Kumara said.
I planned to stay in Mirissa with my family for five days but there was so much noise at a nearby hotel last night which went on till 4 am this morning that we decided to leave. I complained to the hotel management and even to the Police about the noise but no one stopped it, a tourist who was loading her bags into a vehicle said.
Mirissa was a quiet and calm beach at night when I came to Sri Lanka five years ago. I loved watching the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs but I am told that they stay away due to the lights and noise, she added.
Guests come to Sri Lanka to get away from their hectic work schedules and relax. They cherish the serene and quiet locations. Mirissa beach is an ideal location at day where tourists can take in the sun and swim without being bothered by beach boys, vendors or beggars. Over 3,000 hotel rooms were available in the Mirissa tourist zone, but only a few tourists attend these beach parties. In-house guests complain to us every day, and we in turn complain to the police but no action is being taken, a hotel owner in the Mirissa Tourist zone said.
I find it difficult to concentrate on my books, a girl preparing for the GCE Advanced Level Exam to be held in August said. I am kept awake until about 3 am due to the loud music and it is impossible to concentrate.
We complain to the police when the noise is unbearable, but it seems they are unable to stop it, she said.

Nanda Samararatna
Rare personality
Nanda, the jewel of a paddy left the shores of Sri Lanka to breathe her last in the arms of her beloved daughter Lalani in California. Her unexpected demise on August 14, 1916, was a shock too sad and unbearable to all of us who knew her down First Lane, Dehiwala. She bade adieu to her family relations friends and neighbours, both here and California, putting everybody into deep grief. Her unending love for Sri Lanka and all of us probably caused her early departure.
Everybody has beautiful words of praise for this rare personality. She was calm, soft spoken, and well-mannered with immense friendly ties. It is with sadness and great respect that I recall the time, though not very long, I spent with her in conversation, not feeling the time passing.
Born to a respectable family at Kurunegala, she was very proud of their gloried past. Both her parents were principals of schools who rendered a great service in the field of education.
They always advocated a life of Buddhist principles, and it was well demonstrated in her active participation in religious activities. She had her early education in schools where her parents worked and her secondary at Holy Family Convent, Kurunegala, the most prestigious school there. After her school career, she became a qualified teacher of distinction, serving the country through the many schools she taught at, her last being St. Clares College, Colombo. Among her many talents, she excelled in cookery, art, and music.
She was blessed with a loving husband, Dr. Samararatna. He was a knowledgeable person who had read widely and was highly distinguished in his career as an Education officer. Both were devoted parents to their illustrious children, well brought up, daughter, Lalani and son, Alex, professionally highly qualified in their respective fields. They gave them the correct education and exposure needed. They had a rich family life and shared many good times with friends and relatives. Lalani, presently domiciled in California, took her there with overwhelming love, and we were all saddened by her untimely goodbye. Lalani's still grieving over the loss, and is said to continue a lot of religious performances to bestow merit on her.
Alex, at this end, performed the religious rights under the advice of Ven. Diviyagaha Yasassi Thera of Bauddhayathanaya, Watarappola, Mount Lavinia, where she had been a devoted Dayikawa. According to Nayaka Thera, the merit she had acquired in her life span was more than enough for her sansaric journey, while narrating the numerous meritorious activities that she was deeply involved in.
Under the guidance of the Thera she had vastly contributed to the rural Buddhist temples, assisted the student monks in their education, participated in annual cattle releasing campaigns of the temple, and above all, what she enjoyed most was the donation of a serene Buddha statue to a temple at Madurangala. With the passage of time, she seriously took to religious activities; she never failed to listen to Dhamma sermons daily at her residence and to observe sil on Poya days, accompanied by her son. She also led a very good social life, helping the poor and the needy. Such was the life of this rare personality. Her memory will certainly live as one of those who led a very meaningful life. Her demise is mourned by all her relatives, friends, and those whom she helped with a noble heart. Her rich smell of humanity still exists. Let this be a tribute to her.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
Rupa Banduwardena
Ravindra Wimal Jayewardene
Modest hero
A great son of an even greater father, is only manifested by the conduct of the great son that brings merit to his greater father.
I stand here today in anguish to memoir the immortality of the late Ravi Jayewardene. His exemplary unpretentious lifestyle established what peace there is in silence amid the noise and haste of ostentatious gloating. He went about placidly in modesty out of conviction and respect to others, which was his pivotal objective.
He navigated his own car on the roads himself, in humility, although he was one of the pioneering sons of the soil that was accredited by the International Regulatory Authorities to pilot passengers in the sky across the globe. He shunned security escorts and bodyguards, although he was assessed as a prime target of the bloodiest terrorist organization on the planet.
Unlike most, who demanded all the trappings of office, a man of his position held in regard to personal security, late Ravi Jayewardene demonstrated to all that he had the confidence and ability to look after himself.
Special Task Force (STF) remembers his colossal contribution to fostering the expertise he injected into the Armed Services and Police in the field of Combat Pistol Shooting having himself at one time been Western Australias Combat Pistol Champion.
A man, who lived a very simple life not basking in the reflected glory of his illustrious father, the President of our beloved motherland, but residing in the backwoods of Piliyandala in a home by the river with his adoring wife, Penny, his closest companion at all times. He dressed most simply, spoke softly, and little and certainly endeavoured to conceal his family name in case, even a hint of being the first Son is oriented by the mere mention of it. His life style to devour all this, at a time of such proximate presence and political respect and not authority being availed to him, deserves an iconic role model that must be always remembered, reminded, and followed by the generations to come. This will be the only way we can say Thank you to a great son of a great father.
Life, dishes out to us a mixture of challenges, successes, and failures, losses and gains. It is a constant in life. Each day offers us daunting challenges, some foreseen and some, unexpected, some discouraging and some rewarding. The catch phrase, Who dares wins, the popular motto of British Special Air Services credited to the founder of the SAS Colonel David Stirling, and again we are also reminded of the quote from Shakespeares, The better part of valor is discretion.
We stand today to pay our solemn condolences to our hero, mentor, and Beloved Friend, the late Ravi Jayewardene, who entrenched into us that, He who dares, Wins. I beg to make an emphasis, make no mistake, the late Ravi Jayewardene, was the undisputed father of the Special Task Force (STF). He was the pioneering visionary, who used his prudent mind to foresee the need for a specialised unit within the Sri Lanka Police at that time and beyond, to engage in counter - terrorism and protective security operations and mitigate threats to national security that was non-existent in the minds of Counter Terrorism Specialists that have mushroomed locally and globally.
His contribution through his inherent ingenious proficiency in matters of Defence and National Security have eluded the attention of many. At a time, when terrorism had plagued the country and was steadily making critical inroads into the security of the state, it was none other than the late Ravi Jayewardene, who strived arduously and identify the importance of good intelligence and training and also the deployment of small combat groups in search of this elusive enemy. As he perceived the requisite of this identical need, the embryo of something between a conventional Army and the Police, a Para-Military Arm was certain. To create from nothing such an organisation with exceptional skills, commitment, dedication, courage, and professionalism, the mandatory requirement was excellence and the very best of training. He strived and oppugned himself to settle to choose the very best of veterans from the elitist British Special Air Services (SAS) which have always remained as the number one special forces unit in the world.
Over the decades, STF has grown in manpower, technology, and tactics from our humble beginnings, and STF owe a deep gratitude to this mighty man, who stood up for what he believed in and followed that dream with relentless passion. This dream has constantly ratified his vision to be an asset to our beloved motherland.
The late Ravi Jayewardene was, is, and will always remain the undisputed father of the Special Task Force (STF) that has grown in the ensuing decades and our excellence today as a professional and formidable force is a reflection of his untiring sacrifices and incredible exertions.
He spent extensive hours of training and superintending the progress of new recruits to the Special Task Force (STF), observed and personally guided them into the in-depths of combat operations and to inspire them he strived to secure the Special Task Force with the very best in men, technology, and equipment needed for combat enabling the Special Task Force to evolve to being the most dreaded force to the terrorists. His unrelated determination to his dogma that the eastern province being the sole penetratable route into the terrorist strongholds and the deployment of the Special Task Force to achieve this objective bore results in the years to come.
Special Task Force soon became first the pride of the Police and later, the pride to the nation in combating not only terrorism but organized crime whilst being respected and admired by the populace of this Country.
Late Ravi Jayewardene set high standards and was a taskmaster. He set the tone for those he saw deemed fit to command the Special Task Force at its inception.
I am humbled with the honour of having being closely associated with the late Ravi Jayewardene, as a young sub-inspector culled to be recruited into the first intake of the pioneering batch of the Special Task Force, who were trained by the counter terrorism specialists formerly from the elite British Special Air Service (SAS). It was the vibrant yet humble ingenious of this great gentleman, which paved the way for the formation of the Special Task Force (STF).
Philosopher, Socrates remarked, The secret of change is to focus your energy on building the new, and this is exactly what the late Ravi Jayewardene achieved, for all of us in the Special Task Force (STF). For this revolutionary change, in his solemn absence, once again, I am obliged to repeat my expression of gratitude by saying Thank you, our dearest sir.
Excellence is not an act, but a habit - this is undoubtedly a manifestation in the manner in which late Ravi Jayewardene molded his thoughts into action and motivated others around him to attain a common objective in unison. Our excellence today as a professional and formidable force is a reflection of his untiring sacrifices and incredible exertions.
His unique contribution was not made in expectation of any recognition or reward. This is an endorsement to the exemplary work done voluntarily by the late Ravi Jayewardene, whereby he enriched none other but only the security of our nation.
He was altruistic, modest, and did not gloat that he built the Special Task Force (STF) virtually and realistically with his brain, bare hands, and vigour. The Special Task Force (STF) and the late Ravi Jayewardene will always remain synonymous. I must say, dearest sir, if you were here in body and soul, you would have discreetly stopped me from declaring these facts or shied away from here. Please pardon me, dearest sir, I have to say these, as you always taught us that the truth is always stubborn.
His vision continues to guide us as we streamline our stratagems and stay ahead of constantly evolving needs.
On behalf of all serving and retired Officers of all ranks, who are and were honoured to serve in the Special Task Force, we salute you, our dearest sir not for position, badges, or ranks, but for the legacy humbleness and simplicity you have left behind that, the least we can do for you is pass it down with your name carved on it as an icon. We salute you our dearest sir for the immense and significant role you played in the formation and development of the Special Task Force. Although your soul has left us, your memories and the yeoman services you rendered shall remain engraved with eternal gratitude in the hearts of all of us and those that come to be honoured to serve in the Special Task Force in the future.
As a mark of deep respect and honour for the manner in which this great son, great human being, and undisputed mentor that crafted the Special Task Force as it were, we humbly seek the permission of his beloved wife, Penny, and family, to display his portrait with pride prominently in the Special Task Force Headquarters in Colombo.
May your soul rest in eternal peace, our dearest sir, and may you attain Eternal Bliss.
In conclusion, I solemnly quote from the poem, For the Fallen, from Robert Laurence Binyon:
For all of us the in Special Task Force (STF), Ravi Jayawardena shall grow not old,
As we that are left grow old,
Age shall not weary him, nor do the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,
We all shall always remember our hero, mentor, and beloved friend, Ravi Jayawardena.

Australian Tye ends long IPL wait with dazzling debut
RAJKOT, Saturday - Andrew Tye was a frustrated bystander for his first two seasons in the Indian Premier League but the Australia paceman grabbed his chance when it came on Friday, taking five wickets including a hat-trick to set up a first win for the Gujarat Lions.
The 30-year-old Twenty20 specialist was part of the Chennai Super Kings squad in 2015 and was then picked up by Gujarat in 2016 but spent both editions sitting in the dugout waiting for his maiden opportunity in the cash-rich tournament.
It finally arrived in the winless Lions home game at Rajkot against the Rising Pune Supergiant, who are led by Australia captain Steve Smith.
Tye finished with match-winning figures of 5-17 as his side registered their first points of the 2017 season with a comprehensive seven-wicket win in their third match.
I think it was 34 matches now to get my first IPL game. The way it came out today, it couldn't have been any better, Tye told the tournament website (www.iplt20.com).
We went out there with a certain attitude. We had to be energetic. We had to get things done.
Tye struck in his first over, the sixth of the innings, to dismiss Rahul Tripathi and break a flourishing 64-run stand for the second wicket between the opener and Smith.
He then picked up the big wicket of England all-rounder Ben Stokes with the first ball of his second over.  Agencies

Barkley inspires Everton to eighth straight home win
LIVERPOOL, Saturday - Everton midfielder Ross Barkley ended a troubled week off the field by inspiring his team to an eighth straight home win with a 3-1 victory over Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday.
Barkley's shot, deflected off Burnley defender Ben Mee, put Everton 2-1 up in the 71st minute and the league's top scorer Romelu Lukaku made sure of the win three minutes later with his 24th strike of the season.
England international Barkley had been the victim of an assault in a bar on Sunday and was then at the centre of a controversial column in The Sun newspaper. He was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the final moments. Barkley, who also cleared off the line twice, was booked for over-celebrating with fans when he put the team ahead. Of course, I can understand. Because I think what happened last week had a really big impact on him. I think he was focussed on the football side this week and also this afternoon, Everton manager Ronald Koeman told reporters, adding that he did not consider leaving Barkley out of the team.

BCCI irked : ICC sanctions US$135 m for Champions Trophy
NEW DELHI: The BCCI has expressed its reservations with the International Cricket Council's decision to earmark a budget of USD 135 million (approx) as the organisational cost for Champions Trophy scheduled in the United Kingdom from June 1-18, next year.
The budget is a three-fold increase from the USD 45 million that was allocated to the BCCI by the ICC for the World T20 held from March 8 to April 3, earlier this year.
Whenever ICC conducts any tournament, a certain budget is allocated to the host country. The host country appoints LOC (Local Organising Committee), which is responsible for all the expenditure that may occur while hosting the tournament.
What many in BCCI find baffling is the huge cost escalation for a 19-day tournament in UK considering it will host only 15 matches compared to the World T20 in India which was a 27-day event with 58 matches in all (35 men's and 23 women's matches).
Also there are reports that the ICC will be building an office in London which will be handed over to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) once the tournament is over. The draft budget for Champions Trophy 2017 was circulated by ICC to its members for review at the ICC Annual Conference held in Edinburgh in May-June.
Accordingly, the BCCI has sent a letter to the ICC expressing their reservations about the budget and the matter is expected to be discussed on the sidelines of the ICC Chief Executives meeting to be held in Dubai on September 6 and 7.
A senior BCCI official, who played a significant role in organisation of the 2011 World Cup and ICC World T20 in 2016, told PTI: It is strange but when the ICC World T20 was held in India, the BCCI organised a tournament of longer duration at 1/3rd cost.
Even if we take into account that the costs will be more in UK as expenditure will be in GBP (Pounds) but in India, there are more overheads including logistics as you need to take flights from one city to another which is not the case in England.
 The construction of a new office is also something that is being questioned. Every member has right to ask as to why all members should pay for office of one member. Looking at the far bigger picture, every penny saved is every penny earned. This money should be used judiciously for development of cricket.
As per trends of the various major ICC tournaments that have been held in the past decade, BCCI has found that budget allocation has been significantly less compared to what the countries have got.  NDTV

What is NCMC
This refers to the letter The difference between NCMC and SAITM by Prof C Deepal Mathew on April 12. I respond as the only living Clinical Professor of the NCMC that existed from 1981 to 1995. I was a professor of OBGyn from 1985 - 1995 during which time we passed out over 800 graduates, most of whom I am proud to say are leading consultants, lecturers and professors in this country and many other countries abroad. This was mentioned by none other than Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament a few months ago. Even Prof Carlo Fonseka, whom I taught in the final year 1961, when I was at DSHW, who was deadly opposed to the NCMC in 1986, has changed his mind after seeing our products and I have openly talked about it.
Ragama Hospital was not very popular at that time till the college of general practitioners put up that beautiful three-storied prof units and we occupied it for the first time and it became a very popular hospital. It was run at that time as a Public Private Partnership as the NCMC gave the hospital to the Government, and the hospital was managed by a Government Director and all our nursing staff, medical staff were from the government. The Pre Clinical and Para Clinical Department that were put up by the NCMC and the beautiful library was all managed by Dr W D Ratnavale who was Director and his staff of the NCMC.
They were all paid by the NCMC. The Board of Governors, most of whom are dead charged only Rs 350,000 from the students for the whole course at that time. Even at that time the criteria for the admission was two Cs and one S at the A/L.
Prof Daphne Attiygalla, who was the Dean at the time was very helpful at the start and there were no objections from the Colombo Medical Faculty at that time till some of the Buffoons of the Board of Directors of the NCMC were demanding a Colombo Degree for the NCMC Graduates. This started the ball rolling and the lecturers and the students of the Colombo faculty got agitated and thus in 1986 JVP insurrection started with the attack on the NCMC which ended up in three year closure of the Universities at that time and finally ended up when President Premadasa decided to Nationalize and make it the faculty of Medicine Ragama. The first batch of the NCMC that entered in 1981 passed out only in 1990 - a world record.
Regarding the KDU, which is also more or less a Private Medical College, the SLMC approved it for fear of the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in 2012, when even up to now the Clinical Professors give only lectures and have no wards as the hospital still not been opened.
I don't see how SLMC can approve of this set up, as students are not having proper clinical training of six months in each specialty. Obviously the SLMC has double standards.

Citizens  React To  Meethotamulla Tragedy
It was while Sri Lankans were indulging in Avurudu that news of the disaster at Meethotamulla came. While at first there were little details of casualties, as news and images of bodies trapped under the mound of garbage emerged, people online became enraged. The government was duly blamed and the public remembered the other endless woes people living in Kolonnawa, where Meethotamulla is situated, had to undergo. Just last year, rains created rivulets of murky, filthy water that filtered into the homes of those living in the vicinity of the 91 metre tall garbage heap.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva was one of many who took to Facebook to express condolences to the families that had lost loved one, trapped under the great mound of garbage. He said it was ironic, that just weeks ago agreements had been signed to begin a waste-to-energy project that would have finally deal with this perennial problem. But Facebook and Twitter users were not easily appeased. Hitting out angrily at the Minister they reminded him the problem was ongoing for over 20 years  could not successive governments have found solution
On Twitter, users shared feature articles written as far back as 2016, where in chilling prophecy, Meethotamulla residents said their ultimate death would be when the garbage dump collapsed on them. Others shared articles in which was published the shameful incident a local government politician had demanded money from an engineer who had volunteered to solve the problem. Others continued to hold the government responsible for the tragedies that befell its citizens. Memory of Salawa and Aranayaka were evoked where innocent citizens fell victim to tragedies caused by government mismanagement.
A majority was galvanised to action: Ordinary citizens and organisations set up Facebook pages requesting aid for Meethotamulla residents who were being evacuated from the area as Army personnel continued to dig for survivors. With the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) continuing to warn of impending danger, the residents of a further 130 homes within a 600 feet radius were evacuated from the site. Food, water, clothing, shelter; the public coordinated with police and local government officials on the ground to provide these basic needs, even as the Red Cross and the Suvaseriya' stood by to rush the injured to the Colombo National Hospital.
The death toll from the Meethotamulla tragedy continues to climb, as more bodies are unearthed from the ground. While the government has declared no more garbage will be dumped at the Meethotamulla site and has offered to bear the expenses of funerals of those killed in the avalanche of garbage, people are eager to know what the governments solution to Colombos waste problem is. Otara Gunawardene used Twitter to share her solution  exemplary, revolutionary waste management in Sweden, in which country less than one percent of household waste has been sent to a landfill since 2011.

Death toll rises to 24
Combined rescue and relief operations were continuing yesterday for the third day following the tragedy at Meethotamulla garbage pile in Kolonnawa.
A section of the garbage mount collapsed on Friday afternoon burying many houses and people.
The death toll had risen to 24 as at yesterday morning while another dozens are feared missing. Colombo National Hospital Chief Nurse Pushpa Ramyani Zoysa said eight persons are still receiving treatment and the condition of one of them is critical.
According to the Disaster Management Centre statistics, 145 houses had been damaged while 625 persons belonging to 180 families had been displaced. Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe said the search and rescue operations in an area of about 180m by 75m is being carried out with the support of about tri-force personnel and Police. He said the operations could be completed by tomorrow. He said excavations had to be done deep into about 30-40 feet. He said they could rescue four persons adding that the troops were vigilant on the possibility of a second landslide.
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) officials who inspected the field on Saturday advised to evacuate residents in 130 houses adjacent to the dump. The evacuated people have been provided temporary shelter at Terrance de Silva College in Kolonnawa while an information desk has been set up at Meethotamulla Sri Rahula Vidyalaya to collect details of the missing persons and property damages.
An expert group of Peradeniya University Geological Department and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) also inspected the site on Saturday. They said the recent showers had contributed to the disaster. They also pointed out early signs of the disaster such as cracks, bad odour, vibrations, and seeping of water had appeared in the area but not paid proper attention.
The power supply to the area had been temporarily suspended following the landslide. Sri Lanka Air Force deployed a Bell 212 helicopter to quell a minor fire in the dump. A part of the area had also submerged due to a burst of a pipeline.
The Government was hoping to put up several more camps to provide shelter to the evacuated people. Several volunteer organizations and Disaster Management Centre have set up relief collection centres and people are requested to handover water bottles, new clothes, quick food items, bed sheets and Pillows, towels, milk powder, mosquito coils, and sanitary items to be distributed among the needy.
Police said the security in the area has been tightened and 20 persons had been arrested on Saturday for attempted robbery in the damaged houses. SDIG Nandana Munasinghe has been appointed in charge of public order.

Dortmund bounce back as tepid Bayern falter
DORTMUND, Saturday - Borussia Dortmund bounced back from the trauma of the bomb attack on their team bus and their Champions League defeat in midweek to earn an emotion-filled 3-1 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
Champions and leaders Bayern Munich saw their advantage at the top cut to eight points after they were held to a 0-0 draw at 10-man Bayer Leverkusen, having missed a barrage of chances without their injured top scorer Robert Lewandowski.
The result left Bayern on 69 points from 29 games while second-placed RB Leipzig have 61 after booking Champions League football next season for the first time in the club's history with a 4-0 home win over Freiburg.
Dortmund fans gave their players a rousing reception back at the Westfalenstadion after their tumultuous week and ended up cheering goals from Marco Reus, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang.
Their opening goal came in just two minutes after a slick one-two with Aubameyang saw American teenager Christian Pulisic use his pace to catch Eintracht goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky in no man's land. The American kept his composure to find Reus in front of goal for a stunning back-heeled finish on his return from a month out with injury. Eintracht had two good chances before Mexican Marco Fabian equalised only for a right-footed shot from Papastathopoulos to restore Borussia's lead 10 minutes before half-time.

Double delight for Messi, Isco as Barca and Real bag nervy wins
BARCELONA, Saturday - Lionel Messis double strike helped Barcelona scrape a 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad on Saturday to keep the pressure on La Liga leaders Real Madrid, who needed a brace from Isco to beat Sporting Gijon by the same scoreline.
A much-changed Madrid side snatched victory at El Molinon thanks to Isco's two goals, which included a 90th-minute winner, to stretch their lead over Barcelona before the Catalans closed the gap back down to three points at the Nou Camp.
Messi scored twice and set up a third for Paco Alcacer as Barcelona saw off their Basque opponents, who pressed them until the end of a nervy encounter.
The win, however, kept the Catalans within touching distance of Los Blancos, having played one match more, ahead of next Sundays Clasico.  Agencies

An inexcusable tragedy
The Meethotamulla garbage dump landslide was a disaster waiting to happen. Many experts had warned that there was a real possibility of the massive garbage dump giving way, with disastrous consequences for those living nearby. Their worst fears have now come true, with rescue personnel counting more than 19 bodies. This is one of the biggest peacetime tragedies in the country and the grim news hit headlines all over the world.
Unfortunately, this is one of the poorer neighbourhoods in the vicinity of Colombo that suffered the indignity of having to host Colombos daily collection of garbage. Politicians from all sides have spoken about this situation and the authorities have been trying for some time to find a solution. But it was too late, with many media and political commentators agreeing that the authorities did not work fast enough to find an alternative before tragedy struck. Even a fire that erupted in the dump last month failed to galvanise the authorities to take action. Nevertheless, Governmental and Security Forces personnel have to be commended for their swift response to the tragedy once it unfolded.
There are several aspects to this sad event. Some experts say the residents themselves are also partly responsible since most of the buildings around the dump are actually illegal. There are also allegations that some officials and politicians have turned this garbage dump into an income generator by renting trucks and tippers for transporting garbage to the dump.
But these factors gloss over the main issue  thousands of tonnes of garbage collected daily in the City of Colombo were dumped at this site against the wishes of Kolonnawa-Meethotamulla residents with successive Governments turning a blind eye. Since this practice continued unabated for a few years, the garbage dump actually resembled a man-made hill. It was an eyesore that also emanated an unbearable stench.
The real problem is that we still have not found a viable solution to the garbage issue, especially the disposal of solid waste. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) does have a separate Solid Waste Management (SWM) division but various problems seem to have curtailed its drive to find a better solution. SWM is the biggest issue faced not only by the CMC but also by local bodies in Kandy, Galle, Jaffna, Trincomalee and other key cities.
One of the biggest issues concerning SWM is the indiscriminate use of non-biodegradable plastics, including varieties of polythene and polystyrene. These substances take thousands of years to break down, if at all. While the Government has introduced regulations to crack down on their usage, the effectiveness of these rulings is yet to be confirmed. Further action is needed to reduce the use of polythene and related packaging materials. The impression we get is one of all talk and no action on this particular issue.
There are also doubts about the effectiveness of recent moves on garbage separation and recycling programmes. While many local bodies have instructed residents to package their waste separately as paper, kitchen waste, plastic etc., these are all collected together on the same day in most localities. Since the residents pack the garbage mostly in siri siri bags, they all look alike and there is no way for the workers to guess what it is inside. The result is that they are dumped together most of the time. This negates the aims of the garbage separation drive. One alternative is for the local bodies to provide colour-coded biodegradable bags for residents to pack their garbage. Yes, this will cost some money but the gains will justify this expense. This way, the workers will immediately know that plastic waste is inside a red bag, for instance.
Technology and rapid changes in our lifestyle are also partly to blame. A few decades ago, when one wanted to buy a soft drink, the old glass bottle had to be returned to buy a new one. This was recycling in action, when the word was not even in use. Similarly, loose goods such as sugar were wrapped in paper, which is degradable. Today, most soft drinks come in single use PET bottles and everything else is packaged in siri siri bags or other kinds of polythene. Lunch sheets alone contribute to the landfills in a big way. It is time for the authorities and citizens to focus more on the 3Rs  Reduce, Re-use and Recycle. This will take willpower and commitment, but it is essential that we do so.
But the problem of waste will not go away overnight. Landfills and even incinerators are now pass, and we must focus on new technologies that make better use of garbage. There are plenty of garbage-to-material and garbage- to-energy options. One of the latest is super plasma decomposition, which uses low-temperature plasma (ionized gas) to convert garbage into ceramic ash. One city in Washington State, USA, powers 12,500 homes by converting garbage into electricity. This is clean energy that also avoids the problems associated with fossil fuels. The terrible events at Meethotamulla must spur us on to eliminate garbage dumps and opt for viable alternatives.

Karadiyana, Dompe to be used as temporary sites
The Government will temporarily use Karadiyana in Piliyandala and Dompe to dispose garbage collected in Colombo.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said the Disaster Management Committee on Meethotamulla which met on Saturday decided to immediately stop dumping garbage to Meethotamulla and use the new sites for the next two weeks until a permanent site is decided.
He said agreements were signed a few weeks ago to begin waste to energy projects to deal with the long-standing garbage issue in Colombo. About 800 tons of garbage had been dumped into Meethotamulla daily and the garbage mount was 300 feet tall at the time of the disaster.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said plans have been made to develop the area as an urban park. He said the efforts to deal with Meethotamulla garbage dump were continuously obstructed by the protests of the public and various groups.
We informed the Colombo Municipal Council in December 2015 not to dump anymore garbage to Meethotamulla and find an alternative place. The CMC identified several alternative lands but shifting could not be done due to protests. The popular slogan Kolamba kunu apita epa (We do not want Colombos garbage) constantly hampered the Governments plans to deal with the issue he stated.
Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayake who visited the area soon after the disaster said priority has been given to the rescue and relief operations. While expressing the Governments condolence on the tragedy, he said swift actions would be taken to implement the decisions taken in the aftermath of the disaster. He said the Government has already concentrated on providing a durable solution to the problem. He pointed out each time the Government proposed an alternative land, public protests prevented from implementing those plans. He also apologized over the incident on behalf of the Government.
Minister Susil Premajayantha said new houses would be constructed for the families that should be permanently evicted, adding that those expenses would be borne by the Government.
UNP Colombo District MP S M Marrikar said the Government could not shirk its responsibility over the tragedy, adding that the Government was unable to find alternative to Meethotamulla for two long years despite repeated reminders and protests.
The JVP issuing a press release on Saturday said all the succeeding Governments should be blamed for the Meethotamulla man-made disaster that could have been averted. This disaster was a result of the absence of proper waste management plan in the country. The Government should take swift action to prevent similar tragedies in the future, the statement said.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, who visited the site following the tragedy, said the Government should provide housing facilities for the affected people and should provide long term and short term solutions for the issue.
While the political blame game continued, Peoples Movement against Kolonnawa Garbage Dump Organizer Nuwan Bopage pointed out the garbage dump was a money earning machine for CMC authorities. He accused about 60 waste management project proposals relating to Meethotamulla could not be implemented due to corrupt deals.

Meethotamulla   tragedy: Consequences  of  negligence  and  lethargy
In the eve of New Year celebrations, it was a bleak day for the people in Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa, as the infamous garbage dump collapsed, claiming 23 lives and counting. Reports say that 180 families are displaced and the affected have been provided temporary shelter at the Terrence N. De Silva Maha Vidyalaya in Kolonnawa and close by community centers. More than 1,000 military personnel are deployed for rescue and relief mission launched following the man-made disaster.
The officials say that the garbage mount shifted due to heavy rains, and later, a fire erupted, worsening the destruction.
Background
The Meethotamulla garbage dump, located in Potuwilkumbura, was a small-scale dump garbage site for Mulleriyawa and Kolonnawa provincial councils. Following the shifting of Blue Mandel Garbage dump, garbage collected from the Colombo municipal council was also dumped to the Meethotamulla garbage dump. In 2009, the residents of Meethotamulla area have filed a human rights case against the Colombo municipal council at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court says to stop dumping garbage to this site within two years and the dump area should be limited to only two acres.
There have also been number of several public protests against dumping garbage in this area in 2013.
However, the Meetotamulla garbage dump has grown up to 17-20 acres, and it is said the height of the garbage mountain was closer to a 20 meters. Around 800 tons of garbage is dumped to Meethotamulla on a daily basis.
Eight Grama Niladari divisions including Sedawatta, Welewatta, Kotuwila, Kuruniyawatta, Kittampahuwa, Weheragoda, Wennawatta, and Halmulla surrounds the Meethotamulla garbage dump. There are about 5,000 families resided in the area and about a 20,000 general population live in the vicinity of the garbage dumping area.
Stories
Speaking of their miseries, several victims who are currently settled in the Terrence N. De Silva Maha Vidyalaya, said that they shall not go back to live in the hell hole once again.
M. Shanthi, 42, from Nagahamulla said, The Meethotamulla garbage dump site was created twenty years ago, and we were facing issues continuously since then. We request the government to provide a permanent shelter to live without any more hazardous situations as these.
Inoka Priyangi, 33, from Dahampura said, We are temporarily residing at the welfare centre at Terrance N. De Silva College in Kolonnawa, and our basic needs are being satisfied. Dhampura is severely affected by the garbage dump. Our houses were inspected by the officers of the Kolonnawa Municipal Council two weeks prior to this hazard and they said that there is no risk to our houses. Yet this tragic incident took place. However, we request the Government to provide safe and permanent shelters to the victims.
A. Nanawathi, another victim, said, We are not expecting to reside at Dahampura again since it will be very risky for our lives. We request the Government to provide compensation for the damages and to obtain permanent residence at some other area.
Malan Bandula from Wisithunawatta said, We were facing many issues due to the Meethotamulla garbage dump site. Many diseases, including dengue, spread due to the improper waste management at the dump site. We were asked to move out of our houses on Saturday due to the prevailing risk. We kindly request the Government to take effective measures to this issue and to provide solutions to the affected people.
A first aid and medical aid camp facility was established yesterday in the welfare center, conducted by the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade.

A problem runningfor decades:Dr. Harsha de Silva
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva said in a media statement that no more garbage will be dumped into the Meethotamulla garbage mount. A problem running for decades, perhaps as long as 20 years, came to a head with the collapse of a part of the garbage mountain. It's ironic that it was only a few weeks back that agreements were signed to begin waste to energy projects to finally deal with this perennial issue. Anyway, no more garbage will be dumped at this site and two temporary sites were identified this morning for which law enforcement officers will provide access to unblock protesters driven by petty political issues, Dr. de Silva said.
He also said the state will bear all funeral expenses of the all the victims who lost their lives in the tragedy.
However, it's unfortunate that even though payments had been made for those families under risk of land slides to move out, some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago, he added.
Dr. de Silva also said, "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has ordered the release of all necessary funds from the Treasury to deal with all financial requirements."

Immediate steps to facilitate victims: S.M. Marrikar
UNP MP S.M. Marrikar said, ...The government should be responsible for this, even though this dump began under the previous government. The current government, for the past two years, could not even stop the dumping of garbage at this location. Marikkar also demanded that the victims of the tragedy be given new homes in the Kolonnawa Pradeshiya Sabha.
The government has taken immediate steps to facilitate the victims. President Maithripala Sirisena has called for an accurate assessment report regarding the victimized families and damaged properties within five days in order to compensate the victims of the incident.




Former Colombo Mayor refuses to comment:M.H.M. Musammil
Former Colombo Mayor M.H.M. Musammil refused to make a statement regarding the Meethotamulla incident to the Daily News, when contacted via WhatsApp. I am not the Mayor now and I am not in Sri Lanka. I am currently in Malaysia. Hence, I cannot make a statement in this regard, he said.
Needs long term solution:Nuwan Bopage
Attorney-at-law Nuwan Bopage, Chairperson of the The Peoples Movement Against the Kollonnawa Garbage Dump said the politicians are trying to use the dead bodies of the victims as a means to an end.
He said, no politician cared enough to bring a long term solution to the garbage dumping problem in Meethotamulla.
Responding to Daily News, Bopage said compensating is just not enough, and the government needs to apply a long term solution to the matter at hand. He highlighted the fact that more than 60 waste management projects concentrating the area were spurned down for financial gains derived from the process of dumping garbage.

N.Korea missile test fails after showcase parade
SOUTH KOREA: A fresh North Korean missile test failed when it exploded after launch Sunday, the US military said, a day after Pyongyang defiantly showcased its ballistic arsenal at a giant military parade.
The failure, which is likely to be seen as something of a public embarrassment for the regime, came amid soaring tensions in the region over the Norths nuclear weapons ambitions.
The missile blew up almost immediately, the US Defense Department said of the early morning launch which was also detected by the South Korean military.
Neither was able to determine immediately what kind of missile was used in the test, the timing of which appeared very deliberately chosen.
It came after North Korea displayed nearly 60 missiles -- including what is suspected to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile -- at a parade on Saturday to mark the 105th birthday of its founder Kim Il-Sung.
The missile failure also came hours ahead of a visit by US Vice President Mike Pence to South Korea where the Norths weapons programme will top the agenda.
North Korea has a habit of firing off missiles to mark major political anniversaries, or as gestures of defiance to top US officials visiting the region.
US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the latest test but had no further comment.
Sundays launch was carried out around dawn from Sinpo, a site on North Koreas east coast where it has a shipyard.
It is likely that this launch is a test for a new type of missile or an upgrade so the possibility is high for further provocation in the near future, Kim Dong-Yub, a military expert at Kyungnam Universitys Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said.
In August last year, a submarine-launched ballistic missile tested from Sinpo flew 500 kilometres (300 miles) towards Japan.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un hailed that test as the greatest success and said it brought the US mainland within range of a mobile delivery system.
Pyongyangs rogue atomic ambitions have come into sharp focus in recent weeks, with Trump vowing a tough stance against the North and threatening unilateral action if China failed to help curb its neighbours nuclear programme.
Trump has repeatedly said he will prevent Pyongyang from its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States.
With speculation mounting that the North is preparing to conduct a sixth nuclear test, he sent an aircraft carrier-led strike group to the Korean peninsula -- a pointed gesture in the wake of the recent US missile strike on Syria.
The North has reiterated its constant refrain that it is ready for war with the US, and its army vowed Friday a merciless response to any US provocation.
Recent satellite images suggest the Norths main nuclear site is primed and ready, according to specialist US website 38North, and White House officials say military options are already being assessed.
China, the Norths sole major ally, and Russia have both urged restraint, with Beijings foreign minister Wang Yi warning that conflict could break out at any moment.
The UN Security Council has imposed six sets of sanctions against the North since its first nuclear test in 2006 -- all of which have failed to halt its drive for what it insists are defensive weapons.
Pyongyang has carried out five nuclear tests -- two of them last year -- and multiple missile launches, one of which saw three rockets come down in waters provocatively close to Japan last month.
Pyongyang has yet to formally announce it has an operational ICBM, but experts and intelligence officials have warned it could be less than two years away from achieving an inter-continental strike capability.
Operational submarine-launched devices could give the North the ability to strike without warning from a vessel somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.
They could also reduce the effectiveness of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which Washington and Seoul are deploying to the South to counter missile threats, to the fury of Beijing.

Plans to remove garbage dump fast-tracked: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a special statement issued from Japan on April 15 expressed his deep sorrow and grief over the unexpected tragedy which occurred in the Meethotamulla area with the dawn of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
The Prime Minister said this tragedy occurred when steps were underway to remove the Meethotamulla garbage mound after proper planning. But the tragedy occurred before this work could be completed.
The Prime Minister said as soon as he learnt of this tragedy, he held discussions with all parties concerned to take immediate remedial measures. By the time he contacted President Maithripala Sirisena, steps had already been taken to coordinate relief measures.
He discussed necessary security arrangements with the Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development. The Speaker also discussed the situation with him.
Although it was a public holiday, the Minister of Home Affairs had rallied his officials and taken steps to face the emergency situation. He also discussed ground level arrangements with the IGP, Army Commander and Parliamentarian S.M. Marikkar. As soon as initial reports of the tragedy were received on April 15 morning.
The Colombo District Coordinating Committee met at the Ministry of Disaster Management and the Minister In-Charge of the subject and discussed the future program of work with his officials. Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Minister Susil Premajayanth, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, Parliamentarians S.M. Marikkar and Mujibur Rahman, and Provincial Council Members and Ministers joined hands and took necessary steps. The President too was keeping constant contact with all these parties.
An agreement had been reached about steps to be taken to provide relief in respect of the loss of lives, injured and those who lost their properties and the committee appointed for this work will soon educate the people about these measures. It should be emphasized that the pledge given to the people regarding the removal of the garbage mound would never be changed. The plans necessary for this had been fast-tracked. The President too agreed that this work should be accelerated.
We have also accepted certain proposals made by Parliamentarian S.M. Marikkar during the past few months. They too have been incorporated in this final plan. The removal of this garbage mound would never damage the environment in the area or cause environmental pollution. Allegations and talks about such damage were only false rumours, stated the Premier.
The Government would take action to solve the main problem because it was its duty and responsibility. Innocent people need not pay for this with their lives. I will never condone the attempts made by certain parties to sacrifice the lives of people in Kolonnawa by bandying various slogans. Our main duty is to look after the people and provide relief. A fair compensation payment should be made to people who lost their homes and those evicted to find new houses. Actually, a solution should be found for their satisfactions. If not they would not be able to march forward in their lives. What I want a strategy that would satisfy each and every one, the Prime Minister said.
As a government, we are thankful to all the people who helped in the rescue and relief operations during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays. The Government would issue a more detailed statement once it received all full reports.

RCBs Badree claims hat-trick against Mumbai Indians
BANGALORE, Saturday - Royal Challengers Bangalore's West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badree claimed his first Indian Premier League hat-trick on his debut against the Mumbai Indians, taking the wickets of Parthiv Patel, Mitch McClenaghan and Rohit Sharma.
The 36-year-old Badree, bowling his second over, tossed the ball up towards Patel but the left-handed batsman got his timing all wrong as he sent it straight towards Chris Gayle at short extra cover.
McClenaghan was the next to go as the New Zealand international misjudged a low full toss from Badree to give Mandeep Singh, at long on, a simple catch. Badree completed his hat-trick with a delightful googly which shattered Sharma's stumps.
Badree, who also claimed the wicket of Nitish Rana later in the innings to finish with figures of four for nine in his four overs, is the 12th man in IPL history to take a hat-trick.  Agencies

Sun shines across open seas
As the flowers of the cherry blossom bloomed in the backdrop of a cold spring in Tokyo, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sought to champion a vision of Sri Lanka as the trading and logistics hub of the Indian Ocean and a key strategic partner in Japans Open and free seas policy.
In the Prime Ministers second official visit to the country and the governments seventh since taking over office in 2015, the delegation met a host of key Japanese political and business leaders the importance of investing in Sri Lanka and to reassure Japan that Chinas interest in the island nation did not herald a sunset in Japan.
As Wickremesinghe chose to tie in his foreign policy of freedom of navigation in the oceans to that of more open and free commerce between nations, it blended in well with Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abes own foreign policy of bounty of the Open Seas: five principles of Japanese diplomacy.
As Abe spoke of a free and open Indo-Pacific, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe too reiterated such a call and asked that Japan invest in Sri Lankas ports - similar to China. He assured that no Sri Lankan port would be used for military activities of any foreign nation and that Sri Lanka would not support any military activity in the Indian Ocean.
Abe in return promised that Japan would invest a billion yen in the development of the Trincomalee port, together with India while he called on Japanese private investments to work look into investing more in Sri Lanka.
Apart from foreign policy, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe concentrated on further strengthening business ties with Japan during his visit and met the Japan Sri Lanka Parliamentarians League, Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation, former Prime Minister of Japan, Yasuo Fukuda, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshide Suga, Minister of Defence, Tomomi Inada, the Japan-Sri Lanka Business Cooperation Committee and Minister of Finance, Taro Aso in a bid to promote Japanese investments into the country.
He emphasized that it was time that more Japanese private investments flowed into Sri Lanka and they were looking to work more with the Japanese private instead of public sector.
Business lagging behind

At present 150 Japanese firms have set up businesses in Sri Lanka and while Japan and Sri Lanka have enjoyed close ties over the decades, governments have found it difficult to turn Japanese aid and grants into large scale investments in the country. Many of the projects in Sri Lanka like Infrastructure development, institutional and capacity building, health, telecommunication, IT sector, Colombo Port expansion project, Mahaweli development, irrigation, Colombo Airport expansion, Telecom Network expansion and road and railway rehabilitation, as Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama pointed out to a Business Forum organized by JETRO, were supported by Japan but he also observed that the three year average Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) from Japan to Sri Lanka had been at a mere USD 20 million.
At present trade between Sri Lanka and Japan stands at USD 1.2 billion; the exports from Sri Lanka to Japan is at USD 200 million while the imports from Japan to Sri Lanka is at USD 1.2 billion- six times the value of our annual exports.
This is hardly anything to talk about. In comparison Japan invests in Thailand as FDI approximately USD 10 billion annually, said the minister.
Samarawickrama who is on his fourth visit to Japan this year was clear that Japan was very much on Sri Lankas agenda and said, We welcome further investment and collaboration, the time is right now to do so. He also assured the Japanese businessmen that Sri Lanka was in the process of implementing a series of reforms to uplift countrys trade and investments especially in the areas of; labour reforms, fiscal and monetary policy reforms, ease of doing business and so on.
Samarawickrama added that they have also sought advice from the World Bank, Harvard Centre for International Development, and US consultants McKinsey and Company to help usher in reforms. The latter especially has identified that the country should concentrate on the areas of tourism, agriculture and manufacturing to have accelerated growth in the economy.
The minister also hoped to establish an Agency for Development and an Agency for International Trade to Accelerate enterprise growth and job creation objectives. He promised that they would further deregulate and offer various incentives such as not charging corporate taxes until the full investment of the business has been recovered to encourage Japanese investments in the country.
We are also looking at setting up a Japanese industrial township to encourage Japanese companies to set up their businesses in the field of IT, automobile parts manufacturing, electronics, rubber based products manufacturing and fisheries, he said.
Japanese companies have already submitted proposals for the import and distribution of LNG gas to power plants in the western region of Sri Lanka. Commercial operations are expected to start in 2019 with the generation of 600MW of electricity from existing power plants converted to run on LNG and by 2020, Samarawickrama expected another 2000MW of additional capacity to be generated from newly established plants.
More importantly he touched on the various free trade agreements (FTAs) the government was working on. FTAs are a key policy initiative of the government and it is a move they expect would make Sri Lanka attractive as a trade and logistics hub in the Indian Ocean.
The Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India will increase Sri Lankas competitiveness in industrial exports and also increase our supply capacity to better utilize market capacity to India. We are negotiating with an FTA with China and hope to finalize on an FTA with Singapore before June, said the minister and added,
We are also looking at the feasibility of an FTA with Japan. This will give Sri Lanka duty free access to a middle class market of 500 million people.
Minister of Special Assignments, Dr Sarath Amunugama in the meantime also addressing the Business Forum noted that given the expansion in the Japanese economy, they would have to beyond Japans own borders. This a practice Japan has been doing very well in Sri Lanka and Dr Amunugama pointed out that Japan was the first country to engage in major infrastructure development in Sri Lanka and was a champion of joint ventures.
The most famed of its joint ventures was the collaboration of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation (NTT) of Japan with Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) in 1996 when the latter was privatised. The collaboration which turned SLT around also raked in major profits for the Japanese company. When it decided to exit the partnership due to various conflicts, it did so by selling its 35.2 percent stake in SLT to a Malaysian mobile network operator for $297 million, sending Sri Lanka Telecom shares to a record high.
Dr Amunugama who also touched on the Japanese investments in Sri Lankas television network in the 80s, said it was a generous gift by the government of Japan at the time.
What he did not touch on was that the while Japan did build two transmitters for Sri Lanka Rupavahini and helped set up our national television network, they also secured the opportunity to sell all Japanese television sets for decades to come as a result.
More recently, when Sri Lanka looked to digitize its television network, it was Japan once again which offered assistance for the upgrade. The deal for the digitization programme which the previous government entered into through a loan agreement with JICA in 2014, came under wide criticism for corruption.
The present government also suspended the project as the Japanese system was not widely used in countries worldwide and Sri Lanka would have to import Japanese television sets as it is very unlikely that the TV sets available in the Lankan market are compatible with the Japanese system.
But when the Prime Minister met Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary, Yoshihide Suga last week, they touched on the digitization project and Suga spoke of ways in which they could further speed things up with the deal.
Rolling out the carpet for Japanese investments
The present Sri Lankan government is the most favourable to private investment. We are looking at the private sector as the engine of growth in Sri Lanka. While previous governments have said this, we are trying to put flesh and blood in that vision, said Dr Amunugama and asked that Japan come in big, Particularly in the area of joint venture development for infrastructure and set up a special manufacturing centre in the country.
Japanese businesses have shown certain interest in Sri Lanka and the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry together with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and JICA organised a third working group meeting in Colombo in March of this year to promote Japanese investment to Sri Lanka. They discussed ways in which they could realize a competitive business environment, improve customs and logistics operations and establish an effective dialogue and problem solving mechanisms between Sri Lanka and Japan.
Resident representative of JETRO Colombo, Kazuhiko Obama addressing the Business Forum said Sri Lanka should be approached as a Gateway to India.
Chairman and CEO of JETRO, Hiroyuki Ishige added that as Indian ports were very difficult to access, Sri Lanka could become an important export and logistics centre.
Obama explained that while labour costs in Sri Lanka were rising, Japanese companies should move towards hiring quality people rather than cheap labour.
As the per capita income of the country rises, Obama noted that there was a growing middle class market within Sri Lanka too which looked for better quality goods, They have consumers but no retailers, he said.
Greater inflow of tourists into the island nation has also been observed with great interest by Obama as he explained that 70 percent of Noritake sales in Sri Lanka came from tourists, especially Indian tourists.
End of May this year, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is to hold a conference to promote exchanges between businesses of the two countries and Obama asked that Japanese businessmen use this opportunity to look for a local partner they can work with.
Location, Location, Location
The underlying theme of the trip made clear at every meeting was that if Japan wanted markets to expand to, Sri Lanka would offer them the platform for expansion.
One of the main reasons why you should invest in Sri Lanka, is because of its location, said Dr Amunugama as he explained that while this would not only give access to India- one of the biggest emerging markets in the world but the islands location was also excellent for exporting to the European, Middle Eastern and African markets.
Sri Lanka also shares close ties with China, the next biggest market. Furthermore to the South of Sri Lanka we have a tension free sea and almost every drop of oil which travels to Japan passes through Sri Lanka, added Dr Amunugama, as he hoped that the countrys location alone would attract the much needed FDIs into Sri Lanka.

Tackling the issue of trash
The partial collapse of a section of the garbage dump at Meethotamulla highlights the need to focus on dealing with waste, recycling and reuse. Solid waste management, wastewater disposal including sewage disposal, siting, drainage and flooding are issues to be dealt by an integrated waste management master plan.
The following need separation from solid waste - Organic material, paper and cardboard, polythene, glass materials, metal, electronic waste, clinical and toxic waste.
The current systems of management of solid waste is:
- Pradeshiya Sabha level waste generation is 15 - 50 MT/ day requiring a compost yard or bio - gas project to manage the daily waste.
- Urban areas organic waste generation is 50 - 100 MT/ day with a compost yard, establishing cluster sanitary land fill and bio - gas project with related Pradeshiya Sabhas.
- Municipal areas solid waste generation is up to 100 - 500 MT/ day with ompost yard/ bio  gas project/ land fill project. Provincial Councils with local authorities need to make cluster arrangement to initiate projects in respective areas.
Meethotamulla Dumping Yard
This dumping yard has an extent of 21 acres with municipal solid waste. Land belongs to UDA and dumping yard managed by Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). Daily 700-800 MT of municipal solid waste transported and dumped by the Colombo MC and Kollonawa UC. Approximately 3 Mn.
MT of solid waste has already been deposited. Mass scale composting facility (capacity 40-45Mt/Day) which was constructed by the PILISARU project is underutilized. Three acres of adjoining land has been identified to acquire to operate the dump for another maximum three years.
Plastic
Every year, 500,000 metric tonnes of plastic and polythene is imported to the country as raw material to be processed, and 30 per cent of the finished material is exported while the rest is released to the local market. Forty per cent of the discarded polythene and plastics within the country is directed to the recycling process. The CEA currently has six recycling plants in operation and two more awaiting commissioning. About 160 firms involved in plastic recycling are registered with the CEA and this number is expected to increase. The CEA planned to support Local Government bodies and private sector to set up 25 recycling centres covering the entire country in the next year or two.
List of EIA approval granted Solid waste management projects-
Landfill site at Welisara, Sanitary landfill site at Alupotha, Meepe Biolan Solid Waste Management Project at Ja-ela, Sanitary landfill site at Kaduwela, Waste to Energy Project at Meethotamulla Waste to Energy Project at Karadiyana, Waste to Energy Project at Kaduwela.
Tackling issues of waste a few options from Sweden and India are shown next.
Facts about waste in Sweden 
Stepping up recycling
Swedish households keep separating their newspapers, plastic, metal, glass, electric appliances, light bulbs and batteries. Many municipalities also encourage consumers to separate food waste. And all of this is reused, recycled or composted. Newspapers are turned into paper mass, bottles are reused or melted into new items, plastic containers become plastic raw material; food is composted and becomes soil or biogas through a complex chemical process. Rubbish trucks are often run on recycled electricity or biogas. Wasted water is purified to the extent of being potable. Special rubbish trucks go around cities and pick up electronics and hazardous waste such as chemicals. Pharmacists accept leftover medicine. Swedes take their larger waste, such as a used TV or broken furniture, to recycling centres on the outskirts of the cities.
Waste to energy
Sweden has, over time, developed a large capacity and skill in efficient and profitable waste treatment. In 2014, Sweden even imported 2.7 million tonnes of waste from other countries. In 2015 nearly 2.3 million tonnes of household waste was turned into energy through burning.
The remaining ashes constitute 15 per cent of the weight before burning. From the ashes, metals are separated and recycled, and the rest, such as porcelain and tile, which do not burn, is sifted to extract gravel that is used in road construction. About one per cent still remains and is deposited in rubbish dumps. The smoke from incineration plants consists of 99.9 per cent non-toxic carbon dioxide and water, but is still filtered through dry filters and water. The dry filters are deposited. The sludge from the dirty filter water is used to refill abandoned mines.
Companies joining the effort
Some Swedish companies have voluntarily joined in the struggle. For example, H&M has begun accepting used clothing from customers in exchange for rebate coupons in an initiative called Garment Collecting. The Optibag company has developed a machine that can separate coloured waste bags from each other. People throw food in a green bag, paper in a red one, and glass or metal in another. Once at the recycling plant, Optibag sorts the bags automatically. This way, waste sorting stations could be eliminated. The southern Swedish city of Helsingborg even fitted public waste bins with loudspeakers playing pleasant music  all in the name of recycling.
From plastic to pavement: Another example of creative waste management
A professor of chemistry at an engineering college near Madurai in India, Vasudevan came up with this idea seeing his citys surrounding field piled with trash. This technique holds the potential of cleaning up countries overnight given its simplicity as it does not require significant technical knowledge nor large investment or changes to existing road-laying procedures. It has already been tested in India, where more than 5,000 kilometers of plastic roads have been laid in at least 11 states since 2004.
Carry bags, cups, thermocoles, foams and flexible films are shredded into small pieces (between 1.6 mm  2.5 mm). The granite stone is heated to around 1700c. The shredded plastics waste is added to the stone. It get melted and coated over stone in just 30 seconds. Then the bitumen is added and mixed. The mix is used for road construction. From rural roads to national high ways all types of roads can be laid using this technique. Patent has been obtained from the Government of India for the plastic tar road laying process.

Ton up for Chanderpaul, Cook hits fifty on county return
LONDON, Saturday  West Indies great Shivnarine Chanderpaul proved age is no barrier to batting success as the 42-year-old made a painstaking 182 for Lancashire on Saturday's second day of their County Championship clash with Surrey.
Already 85 not out overnight, the veteran left hander demonstrated the application that saw him score over 11,000 Test runs in a West Indies career spanning more than two decades as he anchored Lancashire's first innings at The Oval. Chanderpaul completed the 74th first-class century of his career before, after needing a runner following a thigh injury, he was eventually last man out after a marathon eight hours. His innings came to an end when he mistimed a drive against England off-spinner Gareth Batty, the Surrey captain, and was caught at extra-cover.
In all, Chanderpaul faced 328 balls, including 21 fours and two sixes.
The Guyanan also shared a stand of 243 with Jordan Clark (140) in a Lancashire total of 470.
At stumps, Surrey were 112 for two in reply.
Elsewhere in the First Division, Alastair Cook made a fifty for Essex away to Somerset at Taunton in his first innings since resigning the England Test captaincy.
The left-handed opener, England's all-time leading Test run-scorer, resumed on 39 not out and went to his fifty in 85 balls.
But soon afterwards, he chopped a Lewis Gregory delivery onto his stumps.
Cook's exit for 52 came during an Essex slump from 81 for three to 129 all out but New Zealand paceman Neil Wagner brought the visitors back into the game.
Wagner took six for 48 as Somerset were dismissed for 174 in their second innings to leave Essex with a target of 255.
Cook was unbeaten at stumps, with Essex 10 without loss. Australia batsman Peter Handscomb made 74 and former England all-rounder Tim Bresnan 61 as Yorkshire posted a total of 295 for six at Edgbaston in reply to Warwickshire's 178, with White Rose paceman Ben Coad taking his second five-wicket haul in as many matches.
Elsewhere in the top flight, Michael Carberry was in sight of a memorable hundred for Hampshire against champions Middlesex at Southampton.
Former England batsman Carberry, in his first home championship match since being diagnosed with cancer last year, was 84 not out in a Hampshire total of 209 for four made in response to Middlesex's 356 all out.

Tottenham roll on, now seek a helping hand
LONDON, Saturday - Tottenham Hotspur remained a worrying presence in Chelsea's rearview mirror after a second successive 4-0 victory cut the gap in the Premier League title race to four points on Saturday.
Bournemouth became the 12th consecutive side to leave White Hart Lane empty-handed as Harry Kane hit the 20 league goal mark for the third season in a row with his side's third.
Long-time leaders Chelsea are away at Manchester United on Sunday for what looks the toughest fixture of their run-in.
We got the three points and now the pressure is on Chelsea to win in Old Trafford, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. It would be fantastic if tomorrow night, after the game, the gap is still four points. But four points is still a lot.
With only two of their last six matches at home Tottenham are still rank outsiders to snatch a first title since 1961.
Manchester City moved above Liverpool into third after they registered an impressive 3-0 win away at Southampton, with captain Vincent Kompany on the scoresheet.
Kompany's impassioned celebration, following his 55th-minute opener, told the story of what has been two injury-hit seasons for the inspirational Belgian defender.
I don't really complain about what's happened to me, I just carry on, Kompany, whose goal was his first since August 2015, told BT Sport.
When this happens I feel I'm giving something back to the fans. I'm finally giving something back to the team and that's what you see in that moment.
Leroy Sane and Sergio Aguero -- with his 11th goal in 11 games in all competitions -- were also on the scoresheet.
In the title run-in, Chelsea must still also visit Everton who racked up an eighth successive home win when beating Burnley 3-1 to move above Arsenal and United into fifth, albeit having played more games than the teams around them.
Premier League top scorer Romelu Lukaku struck Everton's third, taking his season tally to 24.
RELEGATION BATTLE
There was little movement in the relegation battle with none of the clubs in the bottom six managing a win.
Bottom club Sunderland scored their first goal in eight games as Fabio Borini's late equaliser earned them a 2-2 draw at home to West Ham United which left them nine points behind 17th-placed Hull City who lost 3-1 at Stoke City.
Second-from-bottom Middlesbrough host seventh-placed Arsenal on Monday while 18th-placed Swansea City slumped to a fifth defeat in six matches in a 1-0 loss at Watford.
Swansea remain two points behind Hull while Crystal Palace, who battled back from two down to draw 2-2 at home to champions Leicester City, are seven points above the relegation trapdoor.
Bournemouth are still looking over their shoulders, although they also have a seven-point cushion.
Since losing to Liverpool on Feb. 11 Tottenham have won seven games in a row -- their best top flight sequence for 50 years -- scoring 22 and leaking only four.
A week after beating Watford 4-0, having also kicked off before Chelsea, they produced another display oozing confidence with Mousa Dembele and Son Heung-Min scoring inside the first 20 minutes and Kane striking just after halftime.

US era of patience with North Korea over

US Vice-President Mike Pence has said his country's "era of strategic patience" with North Korea is over.
Pence made the remarks at the demilitarised zone (DMZ), the area dividing the two Koreas, during a visit to South Korea to reaffirm ties.
His visit comes amid escalated tensions on the peninsula, with heated rhetoric from both North Korea and the US.
He arrived in Seoul on Sunday hours after North Korea carried out a failed missile launch.
On Monday, the US and South Korea launched a joint air force military exercise to ensure readiness against North Korea, according to South Korean media.
Pence, whose father served in the Korean War, was speaking on Monday at the truce village of Panmunjom, where the war's armistice was signed.
He told reporters: "There was a period of strategic patience, but the era of strategic patience is over."
The US wants to achieve security on the peninsula "through peaceable means, through negotiations", he said, "but all options are on the table".
Pence's latest comments echoed those made bySecretary of State Rex Tillerson,who warned that pre-emptive military action was "on the table" when he visited the DMZ last month.
Pence also reiterated the US commitment to South Korea, saying it was an "iron-clad alliance", and that North Korea "should not mistake the resolve" of the US to stand with its allies.
He has denounced North Korea's latest ballistic missile test as a "provocation".
Also on Monday Pence went to Camp Bonifas, a United Nations military compound near the DMZ.
Pence is visiting South Korea, Japan, Indonesia and Australia on a 10-day Asia tour.
On Sunday, Lt Gen HR McMaster, the US top security adviser, said his country was working on a"range of options" with China, the first confirmation the two countries were co-operating to find a solution to the North Korean issue.
US President Donald Trump alsosaid on Sundaythat Beijing was "working with us on the North Korean problem". He had stated last week that the US and its allies may "deal with" Pyongyang if China did not.
The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says US policy now seems to persuade China to contain North Korea while keeping the economic and military pressure on.
China, historically Pyongyang's sole major ally, has reiterated its call for North Korea to stop all tests, and has also called for a peaceful solution.
Besides Sunday's launch, North Korea has held a series of large-scale events in the past week including a massive celebration and military parade on Saturday.
It has denounced the US deployment ofan aircraft carrier groupto the region, saying it would respond by "force of arms" to "reckless moves".
Observers have said North Korea may conduct a sixth nuclear test soon, withactivity reportedat nuclear facilities, according to thewebsite 38 North.
South Korea has sent about 500 personnel and planes. The Max Thunder exercise will last for two weeks.

Winning against Eton was the highlight of my career Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy
The rare honour of Rahul Wijeratne captaining the prestigious Harrow School at cricket during the 2017 English season has not gone unnoticed.
S Skandakumar, Sri Lankas High Commissioner in Australia writes to reveal that it is 50 years ago that the first Sri Lankan had the honour of captaining Harrow. He was none other than Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the present Central Bank Governor. Skandakumar writes: What a fine achievement......FIFTY years after the first ever to do so! Our own Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajith Coomaraswamy! No surprise that we have such a straight Bat driving that revered Institution!! SS
Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy (captain of Harrow School 1967, 1968) 
I am extremely proud for that boy Rahul nothing should be taken away from his achievement, Dr Coomaraswamy told the Daily News. Its a tremendous achievement to captain Harrow let alone play for them. This boy has also captained the Middlesex under 17 side so he must be an outstanding cricketer.
Dr Coomaraswamy captained Harrow at cricket in 1967 and 1968 and he also played rugby for them.
I happened to go to Harrow School because my father who was abroad in the US wanted me to get a British education, said Dr Coomaraswamy. I was 13 when I entered Harrow and the main incentive for playing cricket is that you get an opportunity to play at Lords.
Dr Coomaraswamy said that he played in the prestigious Eton v Harrow annual cricket encounter at Lords for four years.
The first year I played in 1965 we won. The next two years we drew and in 1968 my final year as captain we won again. Winning this celebrated fixture against Eton was the sporting highlight of my career, said Dr Coomaraswamy.
I played as a slow left-arm bowler and in my first year I batted at number 11. By the time I captained I had moved to number five. I took quite a number of wickets the year we won, he said.
In fact Dr. Coomaraswamy led Harrow from the front in 1968 finishing with match figures of 12 wickets for 92 runs taking 7 for 42 in Etons first innings of 210 and 5 for 50 when they were dismissed for 141 in the second. Harrow made 260 (Coomaraswamy 34) and 92-3 to win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare.
In his first year as captain in 1967 Harrow narrowly escaped defeat clinging onto a draw at 151-7 after being set a target of 219. Dr Coomaraswamy held four catches in the Eton first innings of 274-6 decIared and took two wickets for 18 in the second innings.
Dr Coomaraswamy stated that the time he joined Harrow there were only a few foreign students attending unlike today where there are many.
There have been several Sri Lankans who have been to Harrow and played cricket. Two Wijeratne boys (Sachin and Rahul) played together in one year (2015) which is unique.
There is also another younger brother whom I think will make the grade soon, said Dr Coomaraswamy who had a distinguished career in sports playing cricket for Royal College and Tamil Union and, rugby for CR&FC and also captaining the Sri Lanka team in the 1974 Rugby Asiad.
