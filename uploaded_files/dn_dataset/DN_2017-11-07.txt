PM tells Mayors Congress to consider
Finance' city development in countries like SL
As cities become the driver of economic growth and the main beneficiaries of economies of scale, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday asked the Mayors Dialogue, City Net Congress to consider the question of financing such development in countries such as Sri Lanka.
Financial resources for growth as well as having development work within the framework of sustainable development were challenges that needed to be looked at, the Prime Minister said, as he stressed that the former, especially, was a concern when government was committed to low levels of taxation to drive economic growth.
Addressing the opening session of the 8th City Net Congress hosted by the Colombo Municipal Council, the Prime Minister stressed that the urban plans for Sri Lankan cities would be based on the goal of becoming the maritime, logistics and economic hub of the Indian Ocean; a rapidly growing region expected to add 500-700 million new people by 2050.
We aim to develop two ports and two airports in the Western and South Eastern coasts.
Then to develop the major cities in the Wet Zone area, from Kandy in the hill country, to the north of Colombo, Colombo and Hambantota.
It would be the first large economically developed area,explained Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
He further explained that the government would develop road infrastructure; mainly the Southern Highway and Central Expressway to connect the major cities of Colombo, Kandy and Hambantota.
As Colombo, the industrial hub of the country expands faster, some of its industries are expected to be pushed to the North Western Province. In addition, Hambantota would be developed as a major industrial, logistic and tourism area while Kandy will receive development in tourism and IT.
Around 35 percent of the population will live in this economic area, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Western Province is set to become the new Megapolis, with a total population of 8 million expected to live within its boundaries but the Prime Minister made it clear that he did not expect to have its administration come under one big city.
We are not looking at one Municipal Council.
The Western Provincial Council will deliver services that are devolved to them. What we are looking at is to have common infrastructure services like water supply and infrastructure be provided by one or two organizations- a common platform for infrastructure,explained the Prime Minister.
Infrastructure and other development, he said would come under a national policy framework worked out in consultation with the Western Provincial Council, but its day to day administration would be handled by the local authorities within the Megapolis.
Thus, we will be able to maintain the connection between the mayor and voter, the Prime Minister said as he added that the structure would also be more cost efficient when compared to having each local authority undertake their own development plans.
City Net Congress this year is held being held from November 5-8 and will have the Mayors of 25 cities discuss their views on localising the Sustainable Development Goals to make cities and human settlements inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

SAITM issue
Govt. should not allow groups to fulfill their ulterior motives
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka urged the government not to allow certain groups to fulfill their ulterior political motives by exploiting the issue relating to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Minister Ranawaka pointed out that the same groups creating politically motivated resistance towards the SAITM are the same who introduced the issue to the country in the first place. Reflecting back to the tense situations risen with regard to the North Colombo Medical College two decades ago, Minister Ranawaka pointed out that the present generation must never go through a situation like that again due to the SAITM issue.
At the previous regime, we advised then President Rajapaksa about this SAITM issue. But he continued with it anyway, because he wanted to start a similar medical college in Sooriya Wewa. Basil Rajapaksa wanted to start another such medical college in Diwulapitiya. Gotabaya Rajapaksa wanted to establish a similar medical college in Deniyaya. He wanted to open the Kothalawala Defense University to the outsiders as well, apart from the military, Minister Ranawaka said.
All these people with all of these ulterior motives wanted SAITM to be their stalking horse. They wanted to make way for their intentions through SAITM. We may have people with similar thinking among us as well, he added.
Minister Ranawaka requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to finalize a solution to the SAITM issue with no more delays.
Minister Ranawaka also pointed out that the SAITM issue has caused series of protests, delayed 7,000 government medical students from completing their education, 3,000 interns awaiting their internships, 2,000 waiting to sit for the Act 16 examination, 1,500 students waiting for enrollment in medical faculties and 1,000 SATIM students who are at a dilemma of their education.
Considering such delays entangled with the SAITM issue, Minister Ranawaka said it is high time that the government comes up with a lasting solution to the matter. He pointed out that the proposals presented by the deans of State medical faculties and the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association are simple, straightforward solutions with which the government should go with.
He observed that these proposals have considered all dimensions of the issue, including as to what happened to the students already enrolled at SAITM and believed that they were not suggestions tampered with political motives. Minister Ranawaka also said that complementing to these proposals, the Sri Lanka Medical Council has also put forward their standpoint on the minimum standards for medical education. The minimum standard of medical education should be gazetted soon, he said. Minister Ranawaka further said that private education policies should not be mixed up with the SAITM issue.
No one should attempt finding a framework for promoting private education using the SAITM issue as a way out. The SAITM issue is an isolated problem which needs to be addressed sooner than later, Minister Ranawaka added.
Minister Ranawaka said that SAITM, if it is to be amalgamated, it should be done with a government institution. He also said if more students are to be enrolled in this institution, it should be done on the basis of Z-score and fair charges.

SLPP sure to defeat if coalesces with SLFP
People will not cast their votes in favour of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa if the SLPP decided to contest the forthcoming Local Council elections by coalescing with the SLFP, former NCP Chief Minister S. M. Ranjith Samarakoon said.
Addressing a meeting of SLPP activists at the Kurundankulama residence of Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena on November 4, Samarakoon said inviting the SLPP to join hands with leaders who brought defeat to the SLFP at the last General Elections amounted to a big conspiracy. Such an invitation to join hands could be adduced as another conspiracy to stifle people power.
He said people today had no confidence in the people who held positions in the SLFP. He said the SLPP would capture power in almost 75 percent of the local council institutions, totalling nearly 286. The UNP and the SLFP would face an ignominious defeat at the forthcoming local elections whether the two parties contested it jointly or separately, he said.

Smart  choices
The modern world has embraced technology like never before and the advancement of technology has given light to innovations in many spheres, especially in the entertainment sphere.
While the world becomes smaller and smaller due to internet based communication, markets are enhancing tremendously for products and services related to this factor.
Cinema, teledrama, fashion, food, e news, and e books are broadening their landscapes via internet and smart phones.
Sri Lankas premier telecommunications network provider, Dialog Axiata PLC, a company well known for its innovations, has embarked on yet another innovation by producing the teledrama, Thrimana that could be watched via a Mobile App.
Thrimana is presented via Vinode Mobile App of Dailog ViU. To download Vinode Mobile App the customer has to visit Google play or App Store, download Dialog ViU and open Vinode.
Dialog ViU allows users to watch countless hours of local and international movies, teledramas and Sinhala and Tamil TV shows.
The premiere of Thrimana happened at the Dialog Iconic auditorium recently.
Thrimana, directed by Lake House journalist turned seasoned teledrama director Chamara Janaraj Pieris of Ayal fame revolves around a love triangle with a difference. The story sheds light on the creative environment of an advertising agency and a lone creative director whose love life involves a young and beautiful colleague of his.
Chamara uses unique tactics by means of story, dialogues, cast, locations and camera angles to add freshness to his creation. The cast includes; Eranga Jevantha, Iresha Asanka, and Milinda Madugalla in the lead roles with many other talented and versatile artistes.
Thrimana has 10 episodes each with duration of 45 minutes. We are setting a trend in Sri Lanka by showing Thrinama via a Mobile App. Smart phones have now become the magical tool that brings entertainment, let alone business to our doorsteps. This device will be a great rival for television channels sooner than we think, said Thrimana director Chamara.
It was a great opportunity to join hands with Dialog Axiata to use this latest technology for Thrimana tele-drama and I am very happy to bring a production of this caliber to Sri Lankan audiences, he added.
Actor Milinda Madugalla said, I have teamed up with Chamara for many of his earlier teledramas. However being able to contribute to Thrimana in terms of style and other factors provided me a special platform to connect with a newest set of audience. Thrimana takes my performances to the next level.
Dialog Axiata global and content services/ global business senior general manager, Mangala Hettiarachchi said, in todays context the usage of Smartphones is rapidly increasing and fifty percent of Dialog customers use smartphones.
Technology gave light to 3G and 4G technology and now we talk of 5G. With the increase in usage of smartphones consumer attitudes towards entertainment has changed in a revolutionary manner. Entertainment, AnytimeAnywhere is the trend now. For the new generation of viewers, entertainment should be at their finger tips. Dialog catered to this need by producing the teledrama, Thrimana using mobile App, Dialog ViU. This App could be downloaded by anyone from anywhere in the world to watch Thrimana as well as other productions of Dialog.
He added, This innovation will be a great opportunity to artistes, since Dialog has developed the market potential enormously for local tele-dramas via Vinode App. The local teledrama sphere will now become highly lucrative.

Adequate petrol stocks available: Minister Ranatunga
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said an oil tanker with 40,000 MT of petrol is expected to arrive on November 8 and assured that existing stocks are adequate till November 9.
There are enough fuel stocks to meet the demand until the next shipment arrives. The distribution of petrol will begin on November 9 and the situation is under control, he said.
The Minister said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is tracking the vessel closely and all relevant staff is ready to immediately receive the shipment and commence distribution to the public by November 9.
The CPC rejected a shipment of fuel by the Lankan Indian Oil Company(LIOC) on October 17 as it failed to meet the required gasoline import specification of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, another shipment ordered by the CPC, which was expected to arrive between October 31 and November 2, did not reach in time.
According to the Minister, the situation could have been easily controlled but a SMS which went viral that there was a shortage in fuel triggered the situation prompting the public to buy more petrol than usual.
The daily fuel consumption in the country ranges from 1,800 MT-2,000 MT, while the CPC issues 2,500 MT of stocks. The rejected shipment vessel still remains at the Trincomalee Port.
The LIOC in the meantime, had offered a shipment combined cargo, consisting of gasoline and diesel, of which the diesel stock failed to meet the required standards. As a result, the CPC had to reject that as well.
Minister Ranatunga said substandard oil will not be unloaded at Trincomalee and added the Ministry was monitoring the process.
The Minister meanwhile said that he was pressurised by several businessmen and politicians to unload the shipment and added that he would never allow substandard fuel to be unloaded in the country. Yet, he refused to unveil the names of the politicians who demanded to unload substandard fuel.
However, a request by LOIC to refine oil was also rejected by the CPC, and one of the officials attached to the Ministry said that there was no guarantee that refined oil would meet the standards.
We have not tried the Ship to Ship (STS) system before. The standard operating procedures and the Tender procedure also does not allow us to followthe STS system. Therefore, we decided to object to it, he said.
Minister Ranatunga assured that the Ministry is taking all measures to manage the current shortage in 92 and 95 Octane Petrol in the country.
Further, there was an interruption to the CPCs Sapugaskanda refinery operations due to an electrical failure, which resulted in a production loss for 3 days.
The Minister said it was an odd coincidence and added that the situation was rectified immediately and it is in full operation now.
Minister Ranatunga further said they intend to conduct an inquiry on the issue but their first priority was to resolve the existing fuel issue with in the country.
He said that stern action will be taken against the fuel station that refuse to sell diesel.
There are enough diesel stocks available, there is no problem with that. But, some fuel stations have stopped selling diesel. Their licenses might as well be cancelled if needed. We have informed the Police to look into that, the Minister said.

Allianz Lanka alerts road users at unprotected railway crossings
In a bid to protect the lives of fellow Sri Lankans, Allianz Lanka joined hands with the National Council for Road Safety to deploy warning signs at unprotected railway crossings around the island. A set of three signs, will be erected at intervals of 50 meters on either side of such crossings to warn drivers and pedestrians of their presence.
The first set of sign boards was commissioned at the Narahenpita Railway Station under the auspices of Hon. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva.
Speaking at the event, the Minister expressed concern about the rising number of railroad accidents and commended Allianz Lanka and the National Council for Road Safety for this new initiative that would help save lives.
Dr. Sisira Kodagoda, Chairman, National Council for Road Safety said, Our Council strives to create a safer road environment for all Sri Lankans. We are concerned about the rising incidence of railroad related accidents and have hence stepped up our efforts to make railroads safer, especially at crossings. We would like to thank Allianz Lanka for offering their assistance to this endeavour. As a company that is in the business of protecting people, they share our concern for safety. Working together, we are deploying warning signs at unprotected railway crossings to alert road users and protect their lives.
As a responsible insurer, we believe that we need to go beyond standing by our policyholders during trying times. We seek to collaborate with all relevant stakeholders and play an active role in raising awareness on how a bit of vigilance and a few simple precautions could help avoid untoward incidents. Inspired by the work of the National Council for Road Safety, we are delighted to partner with them on this initiative and do our best to help protect the lives of our fellow countrymen, said Mrs. Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka.
This is just one of Allianz Lankas many programs aimed at promoting road safety.
Earlier this year, the insurer had erected several sign boards on all key roads leading in and out of Nuwara Eliya warning drivers of accident prone zones and other dangers, encouraging them to drive safe.

American Made-The sky is never the limit
American Made, a crime based Hollywood movie, directed by Doug Liman and Tom Cruise, sees Cruise playing Barry Seal, a real life TWA pilot in the 1980's who's recruited by the CIA to take pictures of things they want to track. He also ends up being a drug smuggler for Pablo Escobar at the same time.
If the words based on a true story werent shown at the start of this film, you wouldnt believe that any of the actions are true. Its that insane and yet it happened. Barry Seal had money in the CIA, and in the drug trade. He had a successful family life. He had a business and too much cash to do anything with. There are sequences in the film where they are trying to find places to put cash and because they have so much, its overflowing in their house. This film takes a comical approach to this story while also having sequences of real genuine tension.
This is one of the better roles that Cruise has had in the past a few years because he is kind of an anti hero in the movie. Those are usually my favourite Cruise roles, where you understand his viewpoint but you know what he is doing is wrong. The characters complete obliviousness to just how bad and how low he is getting is really funny. The film understands that and takes advantages of that comical side of his character.
Whenever Cruise is starring in a movie, it makes it an exciting event. There have been hardly any movies lately, where he just hasn't been trying to create an authorization. The film makers give you an idea about what this character is like right from the beginning of the movie and as the viewer you should know he would make blunders because he enjoys danger way too much and he just gets bored.
In one scene he is seen flying in a plane as
his co pilot was asleep and instead of just nudging and telling him to wake up, he puts the whole plane down in danger dipping over and shaking up the whole cockpit. Passengers were flying all over the place. This Barry Seal just loves taking risks. That is why I love the movie and Cruise's character in certain aspects.
Domhnall Gleeson plays the role as agent Schafer from the CIA well. He is the one, who recruits Cruise after he blocks him with the cigars. If you look into his characteristics he's actually a devil in human disguise. He doesn't seem too opposing.
The movie does feature one of the most prominent intellectual pieces, which is Pablo Escobar. They make murder feel like a fun time. Whenever he gets offered a new job and given a giant bag filled with cash no matter who it is whether its Pablo Escobar or the U.S Government handing him this money, he just smiles and says cool that sounds like fun and digs into a whole bigger hole, deeper than he was in before. It makes his character more compelling.
There are a lot of good performances in American Made. Sarah Wright who plays Barry Seal's wife is one. She holds her own ground against him She doesn't come across as somebody who is annoying and when she does initially finds out about the plan, she gets sucked in too and goes along with the ride.The movie feels a little lightweight at times.
The tone that Liman has chosen makes the events feel a little inconsequential. Though it was a tense time for the United States, it is portrayed in a very funny, light-hearted and entertaining manner. Therefore at times you just dont really feel invested in the characters. This is one of the better roles thatTom Cruise has played in the past few years. Its a very entertaining movie

In 1973 Army SC, captained by S.P. de Silva, shared the Clifford Cup with Police SC following a 19 all draw. It wasnt until 1975, under Saliya Udugama, that Army SC won the Clifford Cup outright for the first time by beating Air Force SC 43 with the match winning try scored by nippy winger N.P.Amaradasa.
In 1978 the Clifford Cup was awarded to the League Champions and the knockout competition was played for SLRFU Presidents Trophy. In 1979 Army SC won the Presidents Trophy at Longden Place, led by Daya Ratnayake, beating a strong Havelock Sports Club 18 Nil with S.P. De Silva contributing 14 points by putting over four penalties and adding the extra points to the only try scored by winger Reginald Fernando. In 1982 Army won the Presidents Trophy again under the captaincy of John Senaweera with a stunning 13-3 win over league champions CH and FC.
Army SC this year will be captained by St. Lukes College product and speedy wing three quarter Thusith Bandara Senanayake for the upcoming 2017/18 rugby season.

This years Army team is a blend of youth and experience which is likely to perform very well in this upcoming rugby season. Their aim this season will be to at least be placed among the top three in the league and to reach the semi final stage in the Clifford cup knock out tournament. Look forward for the Army team this season and they will give their very best.
In this upcoming season they have retained almost the entire squad of players who did yeomen services to them last year. Vastly experienced former schools/clubs and Sri Lanka national sevens coach Nilfer Ibrahim will take over as the head coach of the Army rugby team this season and experienced ex Isipathana college and Sri Lanka hooker Anuranga Walpola will be his assistant, taking care of the forwards.

Boycott - a dedicated, disciplined and determined batsman
Geoffrey Boycott holds an eminent and lonely position in English cricket. He is not the first man to be the finest batsman in the country but no Geoffrey other has carried such a solitary weight of responsibility, states John Arlott in his Book of Cricketers. Jack Hobbs played in the company of such stars as Sutcliffe and Hammond and then Hobbs successor Walter Hammond had the support of Sutcliffe, Jardine, Duleepsingh, Paynter, Leyland, Walters, Ames and Barnett. Hutton in his turn had Compton, the durable Bailey and later Cowdrey and May. In the next generation of players, May, Cowdrey, Barrington, Dexter and Graveney formed a nucleus of interdependent high ability. Boycott, however has become so completely the mainstay of English batting that, in three years since Cowdrys last test in 1971, no other batsman has managed to hold even a regular place. In consequence, any expectations of an English win, except in freak bowling conditions is based on a major innings from Boycott, states Arlott.
This means that he has become the prime target both physically and mentally of opposing countries - precisely the pressure, stress which so deeply affected Hutton, May, Barrington and Cowdrey. They never stood in quite such isolation as his, recollects Arlott.
Cricket discussions in its constant search for superlatives, frequently canvasses the question of Boycott or Barry Richards as the finer batsman. Richards is one of the most elegant stroke-masters the game has known Arlott states; but through no fault of his own he has played in 4 Test matches. He cannot be compared with Boycott until he has undergone such concentrated and sustained attack on the highest level of play.
In the twelve years including his five matches in 1962 to the end of the 1973 season, Geoffrey Boycott has scored 23,943 runs (with 117 centuries and 122 other scores of over fifty) for an average of 54.53. In 59 test matches he has an aggregate of 4402 runs (with 12 centuries and 25 other scores over fifty) and an average of 49.46. In 1971 he scored 3 centuries in consecutive Test innings, he has made a thousand runs in a season eleven times in England (2503 in 1971 when he became the first English batsman to average over a hundred for a full season) and on 3 overseas tours - to South Africa, West Indies and Australia.
It was apparent from his school days that Geoffry Boycott had outstanding talent as a cricketer; it remained to be discovered if, like many others of high promise he had an inhibiting flaw. He himself keen as he was, refused to assume success, or to make cricket his career, until he was satisfied that he could reach the highest standard.
Arlott recalls that Geoffrey Boycott was born on October 1940, the first of the three sons of a miner, at Fitzwilliam, near Pontefract where he still lives.
He was only ten when he won a Len Hutton bat award for scoring 45 of a total of 52 and taking six wickets for ten runs. The following winter the family sent him to the winter indoor school run by one Johnny Lawrence at Rothwell, near his home and he has gone there regularly ever since especially during the winters when he had not toured overseas.
Young Geoffrey moved straight and quickly to the top of the first class game. he captained Hemsworth grammar school and the local school XI; at thirteen he played for the Ackworth in the Yorkshire council league; at fifteen for Yorkshire schoolboys and for Barnsley on the highest level of club cricket in the area; while at seventeen-most significant in the pattern of countys cricket - he went as vice captain of the Yorkshire federation under eighteen tour of the Midlands, notes Arlott.
As opening batsman for Leeds, Yorkshire Colts and Yorkshire second XI he made his way to the top of all their averages and in 1962, twenty one years old then, he made his first appearance for Yorkshire. He scored 4 runs in each innings against Pakistan; four championship matches as well that season gave him nine innings for 150 runs and an average of 21.42. His ability was clear but, with characteristic objectivity, he considered he had not yet done enough to be certain of success as a professional cricketer. Until he was sure of that, he was not prepared to leave his clerical job, concludes John Arlott.
Such was the 3 Ds shown by Sir Geoffrey Boycott those days and especially the way he climbed up the ladder step by step, never hesitating to turn back or glance sideways and he was a bit more than a Yorkshireman whos attitude towards the game was never give an inch to the opposition, they had that extra bit of grit.
At present Asanka Gurusinha and Co are trying their best to find the right formula to get out of the rut, one wonders whether even a quarter of a Boycott would have got them out of the woods. Your guess is as good as mine!

Call to increase funding for cooperative sector
The leaders of the Co-operative Federations in Jaffna met their parliamentary representatives at the Jaffna District Co-operative Council office last week to ask the Council to request the central government to increase funding and resources to the cooperative sector in the region through the upcoming 2018 Budget.
They pointed out that the three-decade war had resulted in the destruction and looting of assets of cooperatives in the North and East, for which no compensation had been received. They asked that the government provide compensation for these losses so that it can be utilised to increase production and create employment across the district.
In a press release, the Cooperative Federations in Jaffna asked that the government make the necessary finances available to increase the capacity and reach of rural co-operative banking services as Co-operative Rural Banks and Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies were a credible alternative and should be strengthened to provide rural credit. This was important as the poorer sections of society were increasingly being trapped by high-interest rate loans of microfinance institutions.
The provision of such facilities to cooperatives, they said would help the provision of low-interest rate loans that are accessible to rural communities, especially those that are geographically remote, and promote and enable savings of rural people and for such savings to be reinvested in their rural economy.
The Federations asked that the government provide capital investments to the Cooperatives to increase production and facilitate access to low-interest working capital schemes.
In addition, they asked that the Budget 2018, re-establish the tax exemption status for cooperatives to further encourage production.

Carmart (Pvt) Ltd has successfully delivered new SINOTRUK port tractors to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). Marking the first time that these vehicles have been used by the SLPA, these trucks will now join the heavy machine fleet at the port to aid in its rapidly expanding operations.
Financing and procurement for this contract were facilitated by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd as part of the Hambantota Port Development Project (Phase 2).
China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd is an engineering contractor and a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
SINOTRUK had been attempting to break into the port market in Sri Lanka for several years, but had been unsuccessful until recently partnering with Carmart, which has had extensive experience with supplying port equipment through a former group company, Fairfield Trading Company Ltd., the then distributor for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (forklifts), Kato Cranes, Mafi and Capacity RoRo tractors and other material handling equipment. Leveraging its past experience, Carmart was able to open the door for SINOTRUKs debut into Sri Lankan port operations.
SINOTRUK is currently Chinas largest export manufacturer of heavy vehicles.
Carmart is the authorised importer, repairer and spare parts distributor for Peugeot and Mazda. Carmart has now expanded its product offering by solidifying its ties with SINOTRUK Group and is well on its way to positioning itself among industry giants.
This is a historic moment, marking the debut of the SINOTRUK brand to the public sector in Sri Lanka. We are certain the brand has a bright future in Sri Lanka, said Yasendra Amerasinghe, Director/CEO of Carmart.

Both respondent and complainant parties were unable to reach a settlement. Accordingly, the matter was fixed for trial on February 5 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe. On a previous occasion, the Court decided to overrule preliminary objections raised by Ven. Dhammaloka over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers.
On December 6, 2016, the Court had issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Dhammaloka from using loudspeakers in a manner of causing a nuisance at the temple between 5 am and 6 am.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven. Dhammaloka was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr.Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed the Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Temple.

CityNet Congress stress need to tackling climate change
Leaders attending the 8th ever CityNet Congress stressed the importance of cities tackling climate change and furthering development in a sustainable way through the United Nations SDGs.
What we are finding is that these two goals, promoting climate-friendly development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, are very much linked to each other. That also makes this politically important for leaders in our cities, CityNet Secretary General Dr.Vijay Jagannathan at a press conference yesterday.
Jagannathan explained that member cities in CityNet could stand to learn from each other, especially those which have been through similar problems and overcome them, and progress as a result.
It is much easier for a city like Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur to learn from Seoul rather than London, because there is institutional memory of how the challenges were faced.
And similarly, there are lessons to be learned for some of our cities in less developed countries on how Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok have achieved and reached what they have today, Jagannathan said.
Here in Colombo, many of our members, especially those from South Asia, are quite surprised to see how much economic development has taken place.How much Colombo is looking more like a city of Southeast Asia than South Asia.
Mayor Park-won Soon of Seoul, South Korea, the president of CityNet, said that the function, role, and mandate of CityNet should be expanded going forth.
The reason why is because the challenges that cities face have changed drastically over the past few years, Soon said, emphasising climate change and economic inequality as two key challenges.
It is against this backdrop that the 8th CityNet Congress is being held.
Finally, both Jagannathan and Mayor Park-won Soon insisted that in order for CityNet to properly carry out its mission and implement more of its initiatives, more funding of the association was necessary.
Soon also noted that CityNet has been at the forefront of many projects in Colombo, including the Water and Wastewater Treatment system in Colombo.
CityNet is the largest association of urban stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region. Established in 1987 with the support of UNESCAP, UNDP, and UN-Habitat, the network currently includes over 138 member cities from 22 countries.
CityNet Congress 2017 is taking place from November 6th to 8th at the Colombo Hilton, under the theme Our City, Our Future: Sharing Local Solutions for Sustainable Development. This is the second time Colombo has hosted the CityNet Congress, which is held every four years

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has observed media reports highlighting the employment numbers referred to in the CBSL Annual Reports of 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Subsequent to the Census of Population and Housing (CPH) 2012 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) covering the entire island, the Registrar Generals Department introduced changes to the Mid-Year Population Estimates (MYPE) and published a revised series.
Accordingly, in July 2016, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates were re-weighted by the DCS and a new series was published for data pertaining to the years from 2011 onwards. This is the general practice in all other countries and it maintains the consistency of LFS estimates with the revised MYPE.
The CBSL accommodated the details of there-weighted LFS estimates including the 'Number Employed' in its Annual Report 2016. A comparable series of LFS from 2013 onwards can be accessed in the Appendix Tables 56 and 57 of the CBSL Annual Report 2016 in addition to the details available in the DCS publications.
The LFS details, before re-weighting and after re-weighting, is presented for the information of general public.

From crisis to resilience  Part 4: Focus on the final outcome, neither time spent nor task done
James Zenger, a well-known researcher surveyed over 60,000 employees to see which leadership characteristics made leaders great in the eyes of their employees. The most important two characteristics that Zenger found were Focus on results and Focus on people. Today, let us talk on focus on results or outcome.
Many business organizations place too much emphasis on time spent at work. Employees who burn the midnight oil might be viewed as dedicated to their work, while others who quietly get their work done during business hours might be passed over for a promotion.
Punching a time clock makes no sense for professional executives. Their contribution is not the time they spend on their work but the value they create through their knowledge. Bosses with orthodox mind-sets create rules and norms not in the pursuit of efficiency, but rather out of distrust. A local research analyst told me recently that a study done by him has revealed that full-time executives work a total of three days a week, wasting the other two.
Physical presence
Modern management gurus tell us that placing importance on hours and physical presence over action and results leads to a culture of inefficiency and anxiety. The pressure of being required to sit at your desk until a certain time creates a factory-like culture that ignores a few basic laws of idea generation and human nature: (1) When the brain is tired, it doesn't work well, (2) Idea generation happens on its own terms, (3) When you feel forced to execute beyond your capacity, you begin to hate what you are doing.
Of course, there is no short-cut for the perspiration required to make ideas happen. But the time required to complete a project successfully must reveal itself rather than be dictated. If you care about your work, you will do what it takes to get it done right. As such, your performance should be measured by your ability to get work done on time and done well. Your decisions about when and how you completed the work should not matter.
The inefficient hours in the office could be utilized out of the office as creative stimulation. Time spent in the outer world is productive if it is increasing the rate of idea generation and providing the mental focus required to capture and complete action steps when back in the office.There is a value to mixing up the workday, working out, grabbing a cup of tea.
Alternative
But what if you're not in a position to change your organization's policies Within your own sphere, you can focus on results rather than hours worked -- both by using your time more efficiently in the office, and by protecting your time away from the office. Let us see how:
Know your priorities
Many things that you do at work are probably not the best use of your time. For instance, many professionals often spend much more time than necessary perfecting relatively low-priority tasks. Even if employees perfectionist tendencies are pushing more important priorities to the wayside, people still feel and appear productive -- Since I'm sitting at my desk doing things, I must be making progress at my tasks, they might subconsciously think.
The way to fix this habit is easy to say but hard to do: Understand what really matters to you, your boss, and your organization, and then be willing to be less than perfect on your lower-priority tasks.
Handle meetings professionally
Meetings! Meetings! Meetings! Executives all inundated with meetings, many which turn out to be a report out of recent tasks. How do you reach beyond this to use meeting time more strategically
There are several steps we can take to help keep us on track of approaching the strategic level vs. the tactical.
Are you holding your meetings in the same room week after week, month after month If youre trying to generate high-level, creative thinking, consider moving your meeting to a different location. Often the barrier starts with the very walls that typically hold you in.
Breaking barriers
Provide a clear meeting purpose. One of the biggest mistakes is to allow meetings to get off track. Be sure to set clear meeting expectations in advance of the meeting so participants will know that a) their time is important to you, b) that you respect their thoughts and participation, and c) that you will not allow other participants to derail the purpose.
What outcome is expected Often, we set agendas without discussing the needed outcomes. If you have a specific need to solve a problem, design something, create a timeline, etc., spell that out clearly so that the team can work toward the goal in the time allotted.
Provide background and discussion. Why are we in business and how does our team support the business When holding high-level, strategic meetings, its important to remind participants why the business exists. You may think this sounds like something that can and should be skipped, but without this step, the team often reverts to talking about the day-to-day tasks and small goals instead of focusing on the larger purpose.
How do we envision the future next year, three years, or five years from today Envisioning something is very different from writing down tasks you hope to complete in the next year. Talk about how changes proposed will impact the business in the next year and what barriers need to be addressed.
Brass tacks
Prioritize. Now that you have the visioning complete, talk through team projects and begin to prioritize them in order of the ones that will achieve that goal. This may mean taking fun projects off the list or ranking them lower in priority. Be clear with the team that the goal is to aid in not overloading them, but to provide tighter focus on more attainable goals.
Discuss results on priority items. This is the one portion of the meeting where reporting out becomes appropriate. Only after youve talked through the strategy pieces should you spend time on the steps that get you there. Again, reinforce that the results should be presented in a way that ties them back to the business impact, not just reporting for the sake of sharing.
By engaging your team in a strategic, thoughtful way, you should see a difference in their ability to see the big picture vs. focus on day-to-day outcomes.
Don't forget to recharge
An organization that places too much emphasis on time spent at the office probably neglects the importance of time spent away from the office. In order to be productive at work, professionals need to be able to recharge, physically and mentally.
Keep physically fit. On the physical dimension, sleep and exercise are often the first two personal activities to face the chopping block when professionals have to increase their hours spent in the office. But this reallocation of time doesn't actually help people get more done. In my experience, you would get more done during the day if they worked a little less -- and used that time to get extra sleep and some physical exercise.
Avoid burnout. Long hours at work wear people down mentally. All too often, I see professionals work to 8, 9, or 10 every night and go into the office every day of every weekend, even if there is no real crisis. While these professionals might be increasing their output over the short-term, this type of overwork inevitably leads to burnout. And if you're burned out, you're not productive.
So, you should assertively protect your personal time. That means being firm with your boss about times when you are not available -- family dinners or your child's soccer games, perhaps.
Don't be afraid to speak up.
Obviously, asking for more flexibility at work is easier said than done. You might fear that the mere act of requesting time off would make you come off as lazy or not a team player. But while it cannot be guaranteed that every request will be successful, there is little harm in asking politely. Believe it or not, most good bosses understand your desire to spend some time with your children or enjoy a romantic dinner with your spouse. Your boss can't address your needs unless he or she knows what they are.
Improved focus is not just about getting more done. Improved focus ensures that you know where to place your attention so that you may achieve the best possible result. Increasing your efficiency can be very helpful but only if it comes after you have focused on your most important activities and eliminated the unimportant tasks. Improved focus will enable you to prevent the unimportant tasks from making it onto your task list so that you may focus solely on those activities which help you achieve your desired results. Implement the above tips, listed above, and you will soon experience the power of improved focus in your life.

Portrayal of women in media
Doomed to objectification
Many concerns remain about how women are represented in media. The pressure put on women through advertisements, television, film and new media to be sexually attractive is profound. Although roles for women on television and how they are portrayed is varying at present there are issues that have to be addressed.
Ministry of Women and Child Affairs organised a workshop to create a media policy on presentation of women in media.
Speaking at the conference, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Chairman, Sudarshana Gunawardena said women are working predominantly in the middle-level areas of the media industry.
Women can be presenters or newscasters, but never producers. Due to this kind of exclusion, men hold most top jobs in the media, which could be a reason for the rather lop-sided manner in which women are portrayed in the media, he said.
He went on to add that market is deciding how a woman should be projected in media. This ideology should be changed. Women should attempt to go against this norm and aim for top-level jobs in the industry by making civil society more aware of this gender-based hierarchy that exists within the media today, Gunawardena said.
Women as sexual objects

Provocative images of womens partly clothed or naked bodies are especially prevalent in advertising. Womens bodies are sexualized in advertisements in order to grab the viewers attention. Women become sexual objects when their bodies and their sexuality are linked to products that are bought and sold.
The presence of misinformation and media stereotypes is disturbing and today young people often turn to media for information about sex and sexuality.
Researchers argue that the over-representation of thin women in mass media reinforces the conclusion that physically attractive means thin. A study of womens magazine reveals that messages about weight loss are often placed next to messages about men and relationships.
Former Head of Mass Media and Communication Department of Kelaniya University, Professor Rohana Luxman Piyadasa speaking on 'Women in Media said most of the themes and characters in tele dramas are woven around women. There are around 46 tele dramas telecast at present during a week highlighting a heroine. In 1960/70 most journalists were men but this has changed. More women are involved in media both in print and electronic. With the scenario changing the question of how women can be fairly treated arises, Professor Piyadasa said.
He said a research carried out by the University revealed that out of the tabloids and magazines published during the weekend, around 14 to 15 magazines target women.
The advertisements placed in theses tabloids direct women to illiteracy. The advertisements that make up more than 40 per cent of the paper are on beauty products, mythology, medicine and food. Some of these products are unhealthy and have no standards. Violence against women is not only physical but also mental. Mother or the housewife who is the decision maker of the family watches these advertisements which will influence the choices she makes and will in turn affect the well being of the society, Professor Piyadasa added.
He also said Sociologists say the family should at least have one meal together but today children consume fast food as a result of both parents being employed. Children are trapped in their own world. Parents are not aware of the activities of children. Thus we see an increase in children being abused mentally and physically, Professor said.
The increase of internet penetration has devoured children. In 2011, there were 20 million telephones but in 2017 mobile subscribers increased to 40 million. This creates easy access to around 4.2 million web pages for pornography and those websites earn more than Google, Yahoo, Netflix, Amazon and Apple. Woman is used to make profits and as a sexual idol. These ideologies should be changed through researches. Social equality should be given to women in estates, Sri Lankan housemaids and other women workers who contribute to the growth of countrys economy, he pointed out.
Women in politics
Women in politics in the modern age are under-represented in most countries worldwide, in contrast to men. Nevertheless, they are progressively being elected to be heads of state and government. Currently, more than 20 countries in North and South America, Australia and Africa have a woman holding office as head of government and the global participation rate of women in politics is approximately 20 per cent.
The media refuses to consider female politicians as regular human beings. They feel the need to emphasize and to some extent exaggerate their emotional, feminine side and downplay the intelligence, power and responsibility. They tend to go into great detail about the personal lives of female candidates, which is contrasting to the way they portray men.
With female representation as low as 6 per cent in the national legislature, despite the 51 per cent of Sri Lankan population constituting of women, appears to be an issue that needs to be addressed with haste.
The governments decision to introduce 25 per cent quota for women in the local government, will bring women who are active in many community based organisations at village level into political engagement in the country which will help ensure a more democratic political culture.
Secretary to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Chandrani Senaratna said the country has to create a safer environment for women. First victim is the girl child and next will be the woman. Woman is a unique and a complete creation. We have to create a safer environment for them and they should be encouraged to do meaningful politics. The ministry will organise training for women entering politics. Most women in villages dont know their rights and lack the knowledge to take up decision making positions. We have more aging population which has to be addressed and they have to be educated on reproduction as well. President granted 76 million rupees to uplift livelihood in rural areas. Lots of programmes are going on but are the people really uplifted Are they informed Media has to take the message to the society, she pointed out.

City Net Congress inaugurated
Embrace change, urges Speaker
A council which recognizes the need to change and adapts to change quickly, will be successful, said former Colombo Mayor and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
He was addressing the 8th City Net Congress inaugural session at the Hilton, yesterday.
Recounting his experiences as the Colombo Mayor between 1997 and 1999, he said, People elected me so convincingly because they needed a change. The search for change is seen in many countries. The change they wanted was from the traditional bureaucratic structure to one that was performance-oriented, he said.
Jayasuriya further explained that politics should be confined only to the time of election and not spill over to local administration.
We see that once there is unity in a citys administration, those cities prospered despite the political or ideological differences. As Mayor, I invited opposition parties to chair statutory bodies, and there was dialogue though we had ideological differences. It was effective power sharing and it contributed to our success, he added.
Local government, the Speaker explained, was a body which closely associated with the public from their birth to death and thus citizen participation in affairs of the city was not only the way to meet the needs of the city but also means to gain the confidence and acceptance of the community.
During his tenure as the Mayor, Jayasuriya and his team had initiated many programmes such as the famed Public Day, advisory committees with leading citizens for the Council to consult with, partnerships with the private sector, NGOs, and the international community to improve services, such as health, roads etc., a poster buster machine to remove posters, partial privatization of garbage clearance to improve cleanliness, the establishment of the Unauthorized Construction Demolition Unit, information desk, strengthening housing development units to improve housing for slum dwellers and keeping the public informed of all programmes through a regular newsletter.

## Title: End malpractices affecting local automobile industry- VIASL
## Supertitle:

End malpractices affecting local automobile industry- VIASL
The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) in a communiqu urges the government to intervene to end alleged malpractices happening in the local automobile industry.
Revenue leakage
The communiqu alleges that there is firstly a revenue leakage caused due to arbitrary valuations submitted by agents of brand new vehicles and this need to addressed and stopped forthwith.
Local agents of brand new vehicles are taxed on their own valuation that is strictly at their discretion as opposed to the used car importer who has to pay a tax based on the maximum retail price mentioned on the manufacturers website the statement alleges.
It says for instance if an identical car is imported by an agent and a used car dealer, the agent will be paying a lower import tax as they are being taxed on a valuation provided by themselves, as opposed to the tax a used car dealer would be paying based on the maximum retail price mentioned on the manufactures website. Used car dealers are only given a 15% discount on the maximum retail price mentioned in the manufacturers website. This however, does not reflect the actual value or the purchase price of the vehicle since the dealer discount in most cases amount to more than 15%, and the value of a 5-year-old vehicle is considerably lower. Furthermore, this retail price mentioned on the website includes - local taxes, provisions for local warranties, road side assistance, local road taxes and a comprehensive service plan that amount to well over 20% of the price mentioned. Hence these factors need taking off when calculating the actual product value of the said vehicle which is why a 15% discount is offered to used car dealers, even though this should be well over 20%.
Depreciation table annulled
Prior to 2015, a depreciation table was in place for calculating duty of reconditioned vehicles. A 5 year old vehicle was given 55% depreciation from the valuation provided by the agent. However, post 2015, this method of duty calculation was changed and the depreciation table was completely removed when calculating duty for reconditioned vehicles. Instead of the local agents valuations, the maximum retail price mentioned on the manufacturers website has been considered as the base value for the duty calculation of reconditioned vehicles. The payable duty for reconditioned car importers is the higher of the value calculated as per this method or the unit rate, the communiqu alleges.
After considering all these factors, the Ministry of Finance allowed reconditioned car importers a 15% discount on the maximum retail price mentioned on the manufacturers website.
Local agents having a monopoly at Government tenders and supplies
When purchasing vehicles, Sri Lankan governmental authorities are only permitted to buy brand new vehicles. Even though used car dealers are also in a position to import and supply brand new vehicles, due to regulations in country of origin, used car importers are compelled to register the brand new vehicle and deregister it to abide by their rules. Hence once this brand new vehicle reaches Sri Lanka, all vehicles imported by used car dealers are registered as Reconditioned at RMV. This eliminates brand new vehicles imported by used car dealers from bidding for government tenders essentially giving a monopoly to the agents of brand new vehicles enabling them to quote a much higher price. Due to this reason Sri Lankan government is forced to spend tax payers money unnecessarily.
Heavy losses to government
The government is currently incurring heavy losses as the agents of brand new vehicles are manipulating their valuations and changing them on an ad-hoc basis to suit their needs, the communiqu alleges. They adjust the valuation just below the unit rate (minimum tax) in order to pay a lessor duty than the actual valuation of the vehicle imported. Lack of established system to audit these values submitted by agents is the main cause for this revenue loss the communiqu further alleges.
Furthermore, concessionary permits issued to government servants have become an instrument for these agents of brand new vehicles to misrepresent valuations and to change them according to the concessionary permit value. The statement further alleges.
For instance an inquiry regarding an import tax fraud well over Rs. 15 billion is ongoing involving a well known local agent of luxury vehicles. It is alleged that the authorized representative of this brand has not provided the invoices with true market value to the Customs for the cars imported on tax concessionary permits and had instead submitted fictitious invoices through another company established by the same founder member in a different country.
Similarly some agents of brand new vehicles manipulate their values to fit the USD 25,000 valuation of the concessionary permit, the communiqu alleges.
Suggestion for a uniform duty
Due to these anomalies and unfair practice of calculating taxes the VIASL is suggesting having an identical tax and a valuation for both used car dealers and agents of brand new vehicles for each model of vehicle. This is a huge compromise from the used car dealers since they are forced to pay this same tax even when a 5 year old vehicle is being imported to the country. However, the VIASL is willing to make this compromise to put an end to this massive revenue leakage to the country and unnecessary spending of tax payers money.
Lack of safety standards
It is a known fact that manufactures of vehicles, manufacture the best quality products for their domestic market. Since the used car dealers import domestic models of each brand directly from countries such as Japan and U.K. these models are bound to be the best a fact that has been blatantly misrepresented by the local agents of vehicle brands using unethical marketing tactics the communiqu alleges. All vehicles imported by used car dealers are equipped with airbags, anti lock breaking (ABS) mechanism as well as radar breaks. Especially the most used cars imported from some Asian countries are not equipped with such safety standards.
Most vehicle models imported by used car dealers are below the 1500 cc engine capacity and are hybrid models. Some of them are plug in hybrids or electric cars with zero emissions and limited use of fossil fuel.
In an era where most countries are striving for maximum efficiency the bargaining power of local agents of foreign origin has robbed Sri Lankan countryman of efficient high quality vehicles.
Most of the vehicles local agents import are non-hybrids and fall in to the 1500 cc  1600 cc category. These are highly inefficient and will one day become a burden to the local economy since Sri Lanka is a country struggling for foreign exchange and the fuel bill accounts to a large proportion of the country's foreign currency outflow, the communiqu further alleges.

The enduring  appeal of Ikebana
Ikebana Artistry 2017, an exhibition of creations presented by the Ikebana students of Shiromi Soosaipillai will take place November 11 and 12 at the air conditioned JDA Gallery, University of the Visual and Performing Arts, 46 Horton Place Colombo 7.
Shiromi, who grew up on a plantation, always appreciated nature, but formally started learning the art of Ikebana in 1983 under Kamala Pillai, founder of the Shi-en Ikebana and Floral Arts Society of Sri Lanka.
Today she follows the Sogetsu method founded in 1926 by Sofu Teshigahara, whose mantra was that Ikebana can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime with any kind of material.
A qualified teacher, Shiromi has been teaching for four years. Christopher Lim from Singapore fine-tuned Shiromis Ikebana creations and has advised and guided her throughout her teachers diploma training in Singapore and continues to do so.
She has attended Ikebana International Asian Regional conferences in Hyderabad, Manila, Delhi and Taipei, as well as the Ikebana International world conventions in Tokyo and Okinawa.
Shiromis students are all professional women. Some of my students are training to be Ikebana teachers, so its time to give them some exposure, and its also the first time I am exhibiting my own work independently.
There will be 50 pieces on show at Ikebana Artistry 2017, some in traditional style, some unconventional. The Sogetsu School has introduced a new syllabus which permits non conventional material such as glass, wire, metal, paper, cloth and so on.
Exhibitors include Asha Vasan, Durga Dev, Kazuko Isawa, Deenesha Wickremasinghe and Luna Bose who have been Shiromis students for the past three years and more. They are academically or professionally qualified  a medical doctor, an IT specialist, science graduates and a graphic designer and have all found Ikebana to be a therapeutic and meditative art form and gratifying hobby.
The students are at varying stages in the Sogetsu curriculum and will showcase their own interpretation of this wonderful art using fresh material, dried items, drift wood, unconventional material and even coral.
Ikebana is about freedom of expression. You have to be able to create your own thing. Its a great stress reliever and a very therapeutic pastime, Shiromi reiterates. Wherever I go Im always looking at and admiring natural settings, trees, branches, because this is the source of inspiration.

Evra thanks 'real fans' after karate kick attack
Paris: Patrice Evra praised the support he has received from "real Marseille" fans on Sunday, just three days after launching a karate kick at one of his team's own supporters ahead of a Europa League match. The 36-year-old was suspended by Marseille on Friday after he was red-carded for the assault which occurred in the pre-match warm-up before Thursday's game against Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal. Marseille fans made their feelings clear to Evra at the Velodrome on Sunday as the Mediterranean side put their European troubles behind them by thrashing Caen 5-0 in Ligue 1.
"Great result tonight well done guys Im really proud of you. Thanks to all real Olympique Marseille fans... Im receiving so much support from them," Evra wrote on his Instagram account. But chants rang out insulting the former Manchester United and Juventus left-back, while a banner at one end of the ground carried the slogan "This Game is Over" in English, parodying Evra's favourite slogan of "I love this game".

Extracts  from the dentally retarded
One thing that used to terrify me was a date with a dentist. And that dear reader is the tooth, the whole tooth and nothing but...as they say on Hultsdorp Hill. So, whats the big deal about it when there are millions of others who are afflicted with the same dread.
Fear of going to the dentist is relatively common. For some, it may just cause mild anxiety, for others, it is a phobia and can result in going years without dental care. This may be difficult for some to understand, but if you suffer from dental fear, you know how difficult it can be.
Does anyone know the six most frightening words in the world that send me into a nappy-wetting funk You dont! Let me tell you then that they are: The dentist will see you now. As Lucky my old friend, now a professor of dentistry jokes that the dental vocation is the most suitable male profession. His contention is that a dentist is the only man who can tell a woman when to open and when to shut her mouth, and get away with it.
Now my buddy Lucky is an incorrigible punster. He loves pulling your leg as much as he does pulling out bad teeth. He has an affinity to pun on any and everything. Nothing, categorically nothing, could lessen his mania when it came to punning. For instance his favourite wisecrack to all denta-mentally scaredy-cats was: Going to the dentist can be very full-filling!
He also cracked that that well-to-do clients who get gold fillings are those who put their money where their mouth is. It is usually done, he informed me after a cavity search. And similar to the cry that precipitated the California gold rush the dentist can honestly tell his patient: Thars gold in them there fills!
Old Heck Jaya, a former Radio Ceylon announcer was also a playwright, who had perfect teeth. Yes they really were white beauties with no cavities. He took great care of them, always kept them by his bedside in a glass of water. The first time I saw them come out of his mouth, was when he was in bed in hospital. In the middle of talking about some part of the play he unexpectedly reached into his mouth and pulled out his entire set of uppers and lowers. Splash, into the glass of water they went, and suddenly my stomach turned.
I avoided his birthday dinner parties after one of my fellow actors whispered a tale about his harrowing experience at Hecks dining table. He said when Heck was once eating his birthday brisket, he complained that his dentures were hurting so much that he removed them and held them in his hand.
He manually chewed the rubbery meat until it was ground down sufficiently to swallow. The thespian continued his monologue saying that he would take the chewed meat, dip it into a mustard sauce, put it into his mouth and swallow it with great satisfaction. He would then say something inaudible through his toothless gums and his wife would reply: Dont talk with your hand full!
Now, I have been treated by several dentists both here and in several parts of the Asian region where I worked in for more than two decades. A few who come to mind because of the perfect mating of their names and occupation, are, Dr. Pullman in Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Fang in Singapore and Dr. Payne in Hong Kong.
Ive never liked going to the dentist and it really took a lot to get me to go. I guess you could say that getting me to go to the dentist was like pulling teeth. You see, I have been to the dentist before so I know the drill. One dentist explained to me that he had quite a few meditation gurus as patients. He said the yogi-types always seemed to refuse pain-killers during root canal surgery because, they prefer to practice transcend-dental medication.
If the tooth be told, it had been 10 years since I have been to the dentist. It was definitely a bad tooth decade. The last time I went to a tooth clinic in Colombo, I didnt even see my usual dentist. I had a cavity fixed by his son who was just filling in I suppose. I dont even think he had a degree.
Anyway, I went inside the clinic and sat in his chair. My regular dentists name was Dr. Philip Kaviratnage who I had nicknamed Dr. Fill Cavityge. As I eased myself into the chair I began guffawing because I thrust the stand-in son with the moniker Cavityge-ge-Putha.
He said he was in a hurry and needed to leave the orifice, sorry office, by tooth-hurty. This didnt set well with me, but I leaned back and let him look down into my mouth. It was then I noticed how moody he appeared. He really looked down in the mouth. But dont all dentists do the same on a regular basis. I decided to be nice to him because, after all, dentists have fillings too.
They always tell you, This wont hurt. Sometimes theyre telling the tooth, sometimes theyre not. Its usually a 50/50 gamble between searing pain and a mild jerking feeling. But just in general, I dont like pain or inconvenience.
There are several strategies for dealing with this dental fear. The most important, of course, is finding a dentist who is experienced in dealing with fearful patients. A good dentist can make all the difference in the world. Not all dentists have this skill, and in fact, for some people their dental fear began with a negative experience with an unfriendly or rough dentist.
Recently, after almost a decade, I hit on a dental professional named Rozana, who I call the Queen of Dentists, not only because she specialises in crowns and other dentistry procedures with admirable finesse, but knows and understands dental anxiety. Dr. Rozana is very careful to listen and respond in a caring and compassionate way.
Her style is highly professional, graceful and sensitive and will be sure to work with the procedures you are comfortable with. Indeed, she is perceptive enough to give you a break or two during the procedure to help relieve stress.
So now I dont have to call my dentists office a filling station anymore. Anyway I will be sure to visit Doc Rozana root-inely while giving most of you dentally retarded nasty extractors who falsify the tooth the brush off for good. That I swear by Holy Molars! After all, nothing dentured, nothing gained. So until my next dental visit, its tar-tar from me!

Families suffering from shortage of drinking water
Drinking water cannot be supplied to 17,000 families in Ambalantota and Tangalle D.S. areas from next week. District Engineer Hambantota Water Supply and Drainage Board, J. P. G. Jayasuriya told the media.
He said that the drinking water was supplied to these families from Kattakaduwa tank at Ranna and its water level was very low and it was sufficient only for several days. So the Water Board has curtailed the supply of water.
The residents said that the drinking water was supplied by this tank from Hungama to Tangalle for more than 20 years. But it did not have a source of water. The tank is fed by the excess water supplied to Mahaweli paddy fields. The request from the politicians to construct a canal to get water for this tank had fallen in deaf ears.
Udawalawa Zone of Mahawel Authority Residential Manager, I. G. Amarasekara told that water could not be provided to Kattakaduwa tank as the maintenance work of the main canal was being done, as supplying of water to Eraminiyaya tank in Angunukolapelessa is essential for the cultivation of this Maha season.
Amarasekara said that he discussed the problem with Hambantota District Secretary and the best solution was to get water from Muruthawela reservoir.

FIFA corruption trial to begin in New York
New York: The bribery trial of three South American ex-officials is to kick off in New York on Monday, two and a half years after US prosecutors unveiled the largest graft scandal in the history of world soccer.
Forty-two officials and marketing executives, and three companies were indicted in an exhaustive 236-page complaint detailing 92 separate crimes and 15 corruption schemes to the tune of $200 million.
US prosecutors announced the indictments on May 27, 2015, lifting the lid on a quarter of a century of endemic corruption in the heart of FIFA, soccers governing body.
Yet when jury selection begins at a federal court in Brooklyn, scheduled Monday, only three are going on trial -- three fabulously wealthy and once powerful soccer officials from South America.
They are charged with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy.
The most high-profile is Jose Maria Marin, 85, former president of Brazils Football Confederation -- the sports organizing body in one of the premier soccer-playing nations in the world.
Since his arrest at dawn by Swiss police in a five-star Zurich hotel and extradition, he has been out on bail, living in luxury at Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper best known for housing the penthouse and company headquarters of the US president.
Also in the dock is former FIFA vice president Juan Angel Napout, 59, and Manuel Burga, who led soccer in Peru until 2014 and once served as a FIFA development committee member.
20 years
If convicted by the jury, they will be sentenced by Judge Pamela Chen. The most serious counts each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.
Twenty-four others have already pleaded guilty. The rest remain in their own countries, fighting extradition or similar charges at home.
The hugely complicated trial, expected to last weeks if not months, will see prosecutors expected to present 350,000 pages of evidence and dozens of witnesses.
Two generations of soccer officials, then attorney general Loretta Lynch said at the time, used their positions of trust within their respective organizations to solicit bribes from sports marketers in exchange for the commercial rights to their soccer tournaments. They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament.
Tens of millions of dollars were hidden in offshore accounts in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, US officials said.
Chen last month sentenced the first two of those who have pleaded guilty, jailing Guatemalan ex-soccer official Hector Trujillo to eight months and British-Greek accountant Costas Takkas to 15 months.
The other 22 await sentencing, led by Jeffrey Webb, of the Cayman Islands, who admitted to receiving more than $6 million in bribes and whose millionaire lifestyle while under house arrest -- quaffing champagne, gambling and partying -- has infuriated FIFAs lawyers.
While the US investigation did not indict ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter, he was thrown out of the sport in 2015 after FIFAs ethics committee found him guilty of accepting an improper two million Swiss franc ($2.1 million) payment from then-UEFA chief Michel Platini.
Blatter was banned from soccer for six years, and Platini, his former heir apparent, for four years. AFP

FC Research believes point to point inflation will be dip beyond November 2017 despite food shortages due to higher base effect as increased VAT was implemented on November 2016.Further,Core inflation going forward is likely to be around the 5.0% mark over the next few months.
Sri Lankas forex reserves assets dropped by USD 418 Mn to USD 7.29 bn in September which was equivalent to about 4.5 months of imports from USD 6 bn reserve at end 2016.
The CBSL had net purchased USD 1.2 bn on a net basis from currency markets so far this year. FC Research believe Foreign Reserves are now at comfortable levels and likely to end the year around the USD 7.0Bn mark.

Flanagan, Kamworor win New York Marathon
New York: Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman in 40 years to win the New York City Marathon on Sunday, joining Kenya's Geoffrey Kamworor in winning a first major marathon crown just five days after a deadly Manhattan truck attack that left eight people dead.
Flanagan, coming off a back injury that kept her from racing at Boston, captured her breakthrough title at age 36 in 2hrs 26mins 53secs and was in tears on the podium.
"This is a moment I've dreamed of since I was a little girl," Flanagan said. "It's indescribable. These are the moments we dream of to realize our potential and see how incredible we can be."
Expanded security lined the route of the world-famous race, which saw an estimated 50,000 runners from more than 125 nations compete over 26.2 miles (42.1km) across the city streets.New York's recent tragedy revived memories of the 2013 Boston Marathon that was targeted by bombers, but the carnage also helped inspire Flanagan's triumphant run.
"It has been a tough week for New Yorkers and a tough week for our nation and I thought what better gift than to make our nation and our people smile," Flanagan said. "I thought of that when I began to feel the pain."
Not since Miki Gorman in 1977 had a US woman won on the "Big Apple" streets.
Kamworor took his first victory at the distance in his seventh marathon start.
Two years after losing the lead late in the 26.2-mile race, Kamworor held off compatriot Wilson Kipsang to win in an unofficial time of 2hrs 10mins 53secs.
"I'm so happy. I feel so great to be the champion," Kamworor said. "This is my first marathon victory. I'm so happy and so delighted."
Kipsang, the 2014 New York champion, was three seconds back with Ethiopia's Lelisa Desisa third in 2:11:32.Kamworor, 24, settled for second in 2015 to Kenyan Stanley Biwott after being overtaken late in the race.
Kipsang, 35, won in Tokyo earlier this year but quit after 30km in September's Berlin Marathon.
Eritrea's Ghirmay Ghebreslassie, the 2016 winner, started strong in defending his crown, surging ahead twice but being overtaken quickly by the pack each time. Kamworor made his move at mile 21 and held off the fast-closing Kipsang at the line in Central Park."New York is very amazing. The course is fantastic," Kamworor said. "I'm looking forward to coming back next year."
Flanagan, the 2010 New York marathon runner-up, was sixth in last year's Rio Olympic marathon. She was the 10,000m runner-up at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Kenya's Mary Keitany, who was chasing her fourth consecutive New York women's victory, settled for second, 61 seconds behind Flangan, with Ethiopia's Mamitu Daska third in 2:28:08.
After a slow pace in the first half of the race, Keitany took the lead just after the midpoint and surged at 15 miles, shrinking the front pack to nine before slowing the pace once again.At 21 miles, Keitany, Flanagan and Daska pulled away and at mile 23, Flanagan grabbed the lead for good.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the event being staged as planned was "a terrorist's worst nightmare" for bringing together people from a variety of cultures with resiliency despite the deadly attack.
"This day is incredibly important for New York and the entire country," De Blasio said. "We're standing up to terrorists.
"We have 2 million people along this route. It goes off on schedule despite an attack in our city this week. This sends a message to the whole world.
"Look at that unity. Look at that example -- live and let live. It's everyone getting together for a common cause -- it doesn't matter what background you are from. This event is life affirming every year but this year more than ever."AFP

Fooled by Car-Washers..!
Theres no automated car wash around where I live, no fancy water jets that spray my car while I sit smiling inside, imagining Im under the Niagara. All we have are car washers who walk from car to car every morning, and clean the outsides and insides with cloth and water. Have been quite happy with the arrangement till a friend, who sometimes travels with me, pointed to a stain in the cup holder, Dont you have someone to wash your car Bob
Thats when I vowed to catch the car washer at his job.
I watched next day as he walked to my car, his movements smooth and fluid; in a single gesture, he dipped the already dirty cloth into a bucket of greyish brown water and continuing the cycle, the cloth came out wet, and was splashed onto the sides of the car. I watched, dirty grimy water trickling down, then the wiping of same water at a speed which would have left my windshield wipers ashamed. In a jiffy, hed finished my car, moved to my wifes car, then repeated the same with my daughters!
Three cars washed in a few moments. Three cars a little dirtier than before, washed with a filthy rag, with deft, convincing gestures.
I see those same gestures fooling the rest of the world. Even nations that have automatic car washers are fooled by their presidents gestures.
A truck mows down innocents on a cycle track in Manhattan, Well give him the death penalty! gestures the countrys president.
Corruption is rampant in the India! Demonetize! gestures its prime minister.
Terrorism gets rampant in England, Brexit! screams the English Prime Minister.
And fooled people believe their nation is washed clean.
I remember getting into my car, my newly washed car, and my friend looking at the cupholder and his nose wrinkling up.
Noses are wrinkling up today in the world. In the USA people wonder whether the quick twittering gesture their president uses is dirtying their country more than ever before.
In India, reports from financial papers and experts suggest the Indian economy took a nosedive after the car washing demonetization gesture that the prime minister so thoughtlessly made.
In England its the same, as the English gestured to move away from Europe and face the crumbling of their already crippled economy as they try to stand alone.
Closer home I see such car washing gestures in social clubs that are supposed to have dental, diabetic and cancer camps for the poor, having them instead, in places where only the rich will benefit.
Empty gestures, futile, useless, pointless, and all in vain!
Terrorists continue attacking. Gunmen continue shooting. Black money continues increasing, and the poor continue dying of diabetes and cancer, as the car washers in suits, skirts and jackets, fool their people with deft, deceptive, defective gestures..! [emailprotected]

A Force to reckon with
This writer listened to the farewell speech of Admiral Travis Sinniah recently and was inspired intopenning this piece of two other commanders of distinction from the past.
The first Ceylonese-born soldier to command his countrys army became the commander of the Ceylon Army in 1955. When he announced his intention to retire in 1959, Prime Minister Solomon Bandaranaike asked him to stay on. He went on to serve as Ceylons High Commissioner in Pakistan and Australia, and later as Ambassador to Egypt.
After a further spell at University College in Colombo, he went in 1928 to Jesus College, Oxford, to read PPE. After Oxford, Muttukumaru read for the Bar and was called by Grays Inn, before returning to Ceylon to take his oaths as an advocate of the Supreme Court. He meanwhile joined the Ceylon Defence Force as a volunteer and in 1934 was commissioned in the Ceylon Light Infantry.
Muttukumarus last official duty as army chief was to supervise the funeral arrangements for the assassinated Bandaranaike. In 1960 he went to Karachi as Head of Mission in Pakistan (with concurrent responsibility for Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq). In his subsequent posting as High Commissioner to Australia and New Zealand (1963-1966) he composed the melody Ode to Anzac, which was played at the parade held at Canberra on the 50th anniversary of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli in 1915.
In 1966, Muttukumaru became Ambassador to Egypt, where he witnessed the Six Day War with Israel. He was concurrently Ambassador to Jordan, the Sudan and Titos Yugoslavia. He wrote A Military History of Ceylon and an autobiography, Wig, Sword and Parchment. He was also a great collector of walking sticks, amassing some 300 during the course of his life.
Rajan Kadirgamar
Rear Admiral Rajanathan Rajan Kadirgamar, was the second Ceylonese Captain of the Royal Ceylon Navy from 1960 to 1970 and as such the longest serving Commander of the Navy.
He had three brothers. His older brother S.J.C. Kadirgamar Jr., QC was an eminent lawyer in commercial law, his youngest brother was Lakshman Kadirgamar, PC former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his third brother was Selvanathan Bai Kadirgamar was a major in the Ceylon Army. Kadirgamar was educated at Royal College, Colombo.
With the outbreak of World War II, Kadirgamar joined the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force as a cadet officer. After completing his officer training he graduated, winning the Sword of Honour at the passing out parade at Trincomalee, in 1941.
In 1964 his appointment was confirmed and he served as Captain of the Navy until his retirement in 1970 with the rank of Rear Admiral. He established the Naval and Maritime Academy in Trincomalee. Kadirgamar was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) for service to HM Queen Elizabeth II and had been awarded the 1939-1945 Star, the Burma Star for war service from 19391945. For service in the Royal Ceylon Navy he received the service medals Ceylon Armed Services Long Service Medal, Ceylon Armed Services Inauguration Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. He had also served as extra aide-de-camp to three Governor-Generals.
National security
Admiral Sinniah spoke movingly about the Men in White. His words were around the navy and what it stood for in the context of national security. As this piece is being written Parliament has been debating the pros and cons of a new constitution. The arguments are primarily about primacy Vs inclusivity. Primacy which excludes sections.
The examples cited of the role Tamil officers evokes the reality of scores of not only Tamils but Burghers, Malays, Moors, Borahs, Parsis and others who have served, continue to serve and will serve the national as honourable, men and women with dignity and self respect. Our history is replete with contributions of all segments of our society.
Tamils are no less Sri Lankan than anyone else. In a land which believes in rebirth can it said that in cycles of birth the soul would always be born a human being and of only one religious denomination
With utmost respect I say those who doubt fellow Sri Lankans and wish to keep a segment of our society in different halves are secessionists. Mercifully we have history to show that this country survived and prospered due to the acts of many and not of only a select few.

According to Priyantha there were five applicants for the post including him namely  Lalith Priyantha, Jothipala Samaraweera, Indika Prasad, Buddika Dikkumbura and Vajira Wickremasinghe and they were interviewed at the Moratuwa University on October 31. With the exception of Wickremasinghe the rest have represented the country at international level.
When I went for the interview with the relevant documents I expected the interview board to comprise of people who were former national champions or Sri Lanka players but to my surprise the three gentlemen who were present I had never seen during my entire career as a table tennis player, said Priyantha.
I expected them to question me on matters related to the game and on my experience as a player and as a coach but the selection criteria was based on education qualification, professional (sports) qualification, coaching experience, player experience, training plan presentation and question and answer, he said.
Based on these criteria the points given were 66 to Vajira Wickremasinghe, 64 to Jothipala Samaraweera, 60 to Lalith Priyantha, 55 to Buddika Dikkumbura and 40 to Indika Prasad.
The interview board selected by the TTASL comprised KRDC Rathnamudali, PCJ Weerasinghe and PP Weerakkody.
As far as I can gather the interview board went on questions based on documents, they were not looking for the practical knowledge but going only by theory, said Priyantha.
Even the marks they have given are more towards a degree holder than to a national champion or national player. There is a vast difference between a degree holder and a national champion. I have been in the game for over 20 years and have accompanied teams abroad on several occasions as coach and manager and have never gone through such a ridiculous process to select a coach, he said.
This process is detrimental to table tennis and to the current crop of national players and coaches who have done yeoman service in the past and continue to do so at present. I challenge the interview board to show what qualifications they have to sit on it when they dont have any idea of what table tennis is all about, Priyantha added.

A total of 500 title deeds were issued recently to the plantation worker community and another 2,000 title deeds will be issued before the end of this year.
"Earlier, they were granted citizenship under the Sirimavo - Shasthri Pact. Now they are kept on equal status with other citizens, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He was addressing the ceremony to distribute title deeds, organized by the Hill Country New Villages and Community Development Ministry, under the theme 'Our house in our land,' at Hatton Dunbar Grounds, recently.
The Prime Minister said some politicians were boasting for 20 to 30 years that they will be giving lands and houses to plantation workers, but they gave nothing. Instead there was more cheating.
"The housing idea for the plantation community was first mooted when I was a Minister under the late Presidents R. Premadasa and Wijetunga, and the late S. Thondaman was assigned with some Ministerial portfolios to carry out this task. However, it came to a standstill when the then government was defeated. Now we are able to carry out this task as we are voted to power. As our estate housing project is progressing, Indian Premier Narendra Modi during his visit to Sri Lanka, pledged to grant aid to the tune of Rs. 86 billion worth 10,000 houses to the hill country population.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said, "now the housing problem is over. Next we focus on education. There are schools available for the plantation community, but they lack Advanced Level education.
Therefore, we have appointed V. Radhakrishnan as the State Minister of Education to fill this gap.
With regard to the ethnic issue, Premier Wickremesinghe said, "the war is over, and the people elected Maithripala Sirisena as the President in January 2015 with a mandate to rebuild the country. But there is no development without peace. We as Sri Lankans have to unite as one. The Tamil National Alliance have come forward for peace building for the first time. They wanted a political solution for their demands.
An Interim Report prepared by the Steering Committee was forwarded to Parliament for review. A settlement is possible within a unitary state. The people gave us a mandate to final a solution to the ethnic issue. We are bound to do that," he said.
"United we stand, divided we fall. This country belongs to everyone, whether it is Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim or Burgher," he said.
"The people are united, the SLFP and UNP are united. The Sinhalese, Tamil, the Muslims and Burghers are united. But Mahinda Rajapaksa and G. L. Peiris are creating false propaganda to derail this unity by opposing solutions," he stressed.
The ceremony was presided by Minister P. Digambaram and attended by Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathillake, Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan, Ministry Secretaries, Parliamentarians M. Thilayaraj, Vadivel Suresh, Velu Kumar, Provincial Councillors and others.

Healing the past through drama
Strengthening and supporting the voices of children and youth is extremely vital in creating a vibrant society, where diversity is respected, acknowledged, celebrated and tolerated. It is also highly important to realize that the children and youth can propose extremely creative and sustainable remedies to transform complex social conflicts in our country. Therefore, the inclusion of children and youth in post-war reconciliation activities must be given highest priority, said the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum (SDJF) Prof. W. A. D. P. Wanigasundera. He noted this, while sharing the initial findings and observations on the Sri Lanka Forum Theatre programme.
The final phase of Sri Lankan Forum Theatre Programme (SLFTP) is being implemented by SDJF, in the Northern province, with the aim of promoting the culture of non-violence and pluralistic values such as tolerance, accepting diversity, respecting differences, equality, justice, handling social issues, non-violent problem solving amongst adults, children and youth (aged 16-19).
The purpose of this programme is also to help young Forum Artists, to engage children and youth, as potential allies, in promoting co-existence, peace and culture of non-violence. Through the last three phases of the Sri Lankan Forum Theatre programme, it was learned that the creativity, critical thinking, innovative ideas and free expression of young people, is very vital in constructing a collective Sri Lankan identity with due respect to diversity.
Prof. Wanigasundera added that SDJF has trained nearly 48 young Forum Artistes (Male 32, Female 16) to perform forum plays in 40 selected schools in four districts - Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar and Jaffna in the Northern Province.
Forum Theatre
SDJF is working in partnership with the Ministry of National Co-Existence Dialogue and Official Languages, Ministry of Education (Northern Province), Provincial Education Department (North), University of Visual and Performing Arts and University of Jaffna in implementing this programme. This programme is being supported by the U. S. Embassy in Colombo. SDJF is also working with six experts and academicians in producing a Forum Theatre and Youth and Peace building Manual for the benefit of children and youth in Sri Lanka. After attending a series of professional Forum Theatre trainings, 48 Young forum artistes who represent different ethnic and faith groups ended up developing 10 emotionally powerful drama stories that reflect perspectives of children and youth, broadly respecting collective identity and respect for diversity.
Out of 40 proposed forum theatre performances, nearly 30 have been concluded in Mannar, Vauniya and Kilinochchi. Nearly 20 thousand young school kids from the Northern Province are reported to have attended the performances. The evaluation done by SDJF noted that young children and youth have shown active interest not only in taking part as spectators, but also sharing their critical views on various community issues affecting them and their communities.
Enabling school environment, vital for children
The initial evaluation done by SDJF on the effectiveness of the Forum Theatre in empowering young children observed that an enabling culture within the school environment should be created for young children to entertain freedom of expression from an early age.
Looking at the overall enthusiasm shown and kinds of perspectives shared by young children, they need a platform to talk, express themselves and propose their critical ideas. V. Katheeswaran, an artist from Kilinochchi said, This programme has given voice to the voiceless and I am one among them. S. Mary Stella, another young artist from Mannar noted, The Forum Theatre programme has made me realized that I have a strong role to play in my society. It helped me and my colleagues to understand underlying root causes of conflicts. These forum dramas always motivated us to explore collaborative solutions for community issues.
Several school principals noted that the students who came forward with interventions to the Forum plays are young children. One of the notable observations was that most students who proposed alternative interventions to the forum plays were never used to speaking in public events at school. In that case, the forum performances had made them to voice their concerns and bring their perspectives out.
In several cases, it was observed that the young children were extremely creative in proposing innovative, acceptable and sustaining solutions for the complex community issues. Gowri Palan Sribala, a teacher from V/ Puthukkulam M.V School in Vavuniya said he was surprised to see the way some students came forward to participate in the forums voluntarily, as they are the very reserved ones in their classrooms. Through this forum, our children have gained the confidence to bring a change in society and also proved to us what they are capable of.
Expressing hidden emotions
Through the forum, some students also expressed their hidden feelings and traumatic experiences which they had been holding back for a long time, some of which, even the teachers and their closest friends were not aware of.
The students made use of the stage to indicate the kind of differences they wish to see in society.
Sahaya Mary, a student of Mn/ St. Xaviers Girls College, (National School), M. M .V, Mannar, broke into tears when she witnessed a forum performance of a child being hated and ignored by his own family and school. She, who also experiences the same in her family, came forward to indicate a change she wished to see in her own family.
I understand that I cannot change my parents immediately, but this platform has given me the confidence that I can change my parents through constant and effective dialogue.
G. Nishanthan, a student of Mn/ M. M. V, Adamban School in Mannar said, "The forum theatre programme reminded me of my responsibility to take care of my parents and I will ensure that my friends do the same. If we all get-together to change the world, we will be able to do it one day, said Nishanthan with great confidence.
Speaking on the importance of promoting pluralistic values amongst children, the Minister of Education, Cultural Affairs, Sports and Youth Affairs of the Northern Province, Kandiah Sarveswaran said that it is essential to teach students from a very basic level, on how anti-social activities affect individuals and society, as this will help them to bring positive changes in society.Currently, the SDJF is in the process of preparing the Forum
Theatre and youth and Peace Building, Training and Learning Manual, which will enable students/youths to use Forum Theatre as an effective tool to promote pluralism and foster social change. Upon completion of the workbook, SDJF will hold a beneficial summit for the youngsters on the Forum Theatre programme. The manual will be launched during that summit.

Immortal  melody
Everybody did not listen to him. Everybody did not love him. But everyone knew him. He was known across this small island, and was much more than Sir Elton John or the like to the Sri Lankans. Which is why his departure left the Sri Lankans speechless although he bade farewell to a well consummated life.
Thats quite the thing about Amaradeva. He was loved by a major portion of this countrys yesteryear generation. He was imitated all the time. Yet he remained inimitable. He triggered controversy, but his character remains above controversy even to this date.
Amaradeva remained a global figure in the countrys national music. He was born when Ceylon was still trapped in the colonial clutches - 1927. It took a heavy toll on the countrys music scene too. Ceylon had to search its originality following the Independence in 1948. Ananda Samarakone established music unique to Sri Lanka, with Sunil Santha who followed him fusing Western and folk music for the first time. This was a period when hardly anyone bothered about Ceylonese original music.
The maestro belonged to the rare calibre of musicians who can express well. His sophisticated expression betrays his somewhat authoritative knowledge of literature as well as bilingualism. In both Sinhala and English, Amaradeva would articulate his thoughts of intellect in a soft cadence. To see him perform with his unique music instrument now and then was familiar in such instances.
When humans reach divinity, they achieve what deities cannot: immortality. Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra knew that Wannakuwattavaduge Don Albert Perera would make a timeless journey that will make him immortal in many centuries to come. And thus Albert Perera was baptized as Amaradeva, immortal deity.
Professor Sarachchandra and the then Lankadeepa Editor D B Dhanapala, who detected Amaradevas unsurpassable capacity, were instrumental in sponsoring him to further studies in India by setting up a fund. Amaradevas baptism took place just before leaving for Bhatkande University, which turned out a touchstone in his life later on.
Ashokamalas music director Mohamed Ghouse recognised Amaradeva as the best violinist in his orchestra. Sri Lankan cinemas second talkie Ashokamala is not only Amaradevas starting point as a cinema musician, but also as an actor. He could have been the most senior actor alive before the early hours of November 3, since none of the Kadavunu Poronduva (the first talkie) cast is alive today.
If Ananda Samarakone and Sunil Santha could set the platform for a new consciousness in local music, Amaradeva continued the process. His early music compositions were influenced largely by Ananda Samarakone. This influence was very much useful when Amaradeva joined the Radio Ceylon in the 1960s to moderate a number of innovative programs.
Young Amaradeva met Sunil Santha at one of the legendary vocalists concerts. That acquaintance led Amaradeva to Chitrasena studios. And that brief encounter was to have a lasting impact on Sinhala culture.
Amaradeva was not confined to oriental forms. He tried his hands on Western harmonies and counterharmonies and at times he fused it with oriental music forms. His voice has that powerful capacity to breathe life into poetry. Celebrated poems like Ma Mala Pasu and Sinidu Sudu Muthu flourish with life familiar in our realms, when Amaradeva sings in his exceptional voice. Poets such as Mahagama Sekara, Madawala S. Rathnayaka and Sri Chandraratne Manawasinghe could get the best of him.
Had he been with us, Amaradeva would have entered his ninth decade next month. He caused the flourishing rains to fall in this land which was left parched. May there be more rains in this land so that we would miss the legend less.

At present, around 2,000 dentists serve in Sri Lanka. When I entered university, the number was around 35, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, only 10 or 12 students were recruited to the Dental Faculty in the late 1940s. The Peradeniya University had produced around 2,500 dentists during the past seven years, he said.
The minister was addressing the Annual Scientific Sessions of the Sri Lanka Dental Association, in Colombo, recently. Minister Senaratne pointed out that the dentist profession commenced over 100 years ago. Post intern programmes for dentists will commence soon in Sri Lanka, he said, adding that Sri Lanka has dental institutes with all modern medical equipment and technology.
The association maintains a close relationship with dentists in the country which helps their educational and professional development, the minister added.

Indian rice in Sri Lanka: ministry
The first batch of low priced rice out of the 100,000 MT Indian rice tranche has been offloaded and is now moving within the Sri Lankan retail market, ending any supply fears, the Industry and Commerce Ministry said in a release.
Meanwhile, the open international tender call for 200,000 MT rice in three varieties, also successfully closed in Colombo last week.
By the weekend of October 4 to 5, a total of 20,000 MT tranche of parboiled nadu rice sent by an Indian private sector supplier to the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) of Sri Lanka had been offloaded at Port of Colombo and been distributed to CWE warehouses.
The value of the received 20,000 MT rice stock is US $ 8.9 million (Rs. 1.36 billion). This rice stock is now being re-distributed from CWE warehouses to Lanka Sathosa outlets to be sold at only Rs. 74 per kilo. Any consumer purchasing more than 25 kilos of this rice from Lanka Sathosa can buy them even lower- only Rs. 73 per kilo.
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen addressing a press briefing on November 1 in Colombo, highlighting his efforts to end rice supply shortages through another global tender call, said: Our international tender to import 200,000 MT rice closed on October 31. Rice samples submitted with tender bids are being forwarded to ITI for lab tests.
The latest tender is, unlike previous Government to Government (G2G) tenders, a Sri Lanka government to local and international private sector call.
A total of 34 local and international private sector suppliers have quoted for the 200,000 MT tender that closed on October 31 and announced initially on October 19.
The Ministry has forwarded all the submitted quotes to the Cabinet Appointed High Powered Tender Board which will compare prices of these international and local private sector suppliers with government to government prices quoted in previous G2G tender calls, before making final selections.
The international tender was floated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka on the directions of governments Cost of Living Committee.
The Cabinet Appointed High Powered Tender Board is expected to pick the qualifying suppliers for this 200,000 MT international tender by October 10. Private sector suppliers from Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand, India, and Vietnam quoted. Several Sri Lankan suppliers too submitted their bids in this 200,000 MT total which consists of three varieties-90000 MT Parboiled Nadu rice, 60000 MT Samba (Parboiled) rice and 50000 MT White Raw rice.

The public and private sector partnership is essential to prosper the education of children and Sri Lanka too needs diversity strategies to help all children to access to higher education opportunities.
Prof. Savithri Goonesekere made these remarks at the annual convocation of the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) held at BMICH recently. Over 200 graduates obtained globally renowned undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, offered by the University of Westminister, United Kingdom. The degrees offered at the convocation were in the field of Information Technology (IT) and Business.
University of Westminster (UOW) Deputy Vice Chancellor Prof. Alexandra Hughes, University of Westminster Computer Science, Head of Department Dr. Aleka Psarrou and Westminister Business School Internationalization Director John Pike also attended the convocation at the invitation of Informatics Group Managing Director Hiran Wickramasinghe.
Speaking further, Prof. Goonesekere highlighted the importance of receiving higher education by our youth after their school career and thanked the private sector educational institutions such as IIT for extending their unstinted support to create much needed undergraduate and postgraduate degree holders who could largely help the countrys development activities in the future.
While highlighting the development of the countrys IT sector, Prof. Goonesekere also reminded the key role played by the late Prof. W.K. Samaranayake to help school children to gain a knowledge of IT.
IIT Chairman Dr. Gamini Wickramasinghe said that IIT was established in 1990 as the countrys first private higher education institute to conduct internationally recognized British degree programmes in the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Business.
He said IIT was established with the sole objective of producing innovators and entrepreneurs who could contribute to both local and international corporate and government entities.
Our institution has so far produced over 3,000 graduates who are currently involved in over 250 organizations worldwide, he said.
IIT Dean Naomi Krishnarajah said the institution has been recognized both locally and internationally as an institution that produces graduates who are competent in their field and contribute to the growth of the companies they are employed.
She also said that IIT in collaboration with the University of Westminister provides programmes that match the requirements of the job market and the graduates are able to secure employment easily in a competitive environment.

Keating reveals  big mistake  in turning down U2 song
Boyzone star Ronan Keating revealed he made a big mistake by TURNING DOWN smash hit Sweetest Thing when fellow Irishman Bono offered it to him.
Chatting to co-host Harriet Scott on their Magic Radio Breakfast Show, Keating - who famously cameoed in the video for the single - confessed that the U2 hit was initially offered to him and he will always regret declining and insisting that U2 took the song instead.
He said: It was U2s, they had to sing it, I knew they had to sing it.
Harriet shot back: You idiot! Why would you do that!
He explained: Because it was U2s. They had to sing it. I knew they had to sing it. I had to give it back, because I knew.
When she asked if the U2 singer-songwriter had ever offered to write anything else for Ronan, he confessed he hadnt: No. Big mistake. Huge!

Late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera to be commemorated
The second commemoration of late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera will take place on November 8 at 9.00 am at Ape Gama, Battaramulla, with the presence of President Maithipala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo, yesterday, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) Chairman and Attorney-at-law Ravi Jayawardana said that a monument will be constructed near the Parliament and Ape Gama to commemorate the late Thera. The government will spend the funds required for this purpose.
The President and Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone for the monument at 9.00 am on November 8. Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya will deliver late Maduluwawe Sobhitha Theras commemoration speech.
According to the SLRC Chairman, the monument will be different from the other monuments in the country and the surrounding of the monument will keep open for the public to move around freely in a calm and quiet environment.
The late Thera worked hard for a new constitution and to abolish the Executive Presidency ignoring his ill health. He was an excellent communicator and dedicated his entire life for the betterment of the country and the people.
The Commemoration Foundation Secretary Palitha Lihiniya Kumara said that the Commemoration Foundation will continue all social welfare activities carried out by the late Thera and as the first step, 153 new houses will be constructed with the assistance of the Indian government for the people living at Alapathgama village which was established by the late Thera with 153 houses during the terror period and at that time, the village was considered as a border village. This village and its villagers were discriminated by the previous regime.
Alapathgama has already been developed up to a certain extent with a fully carpeted road, two useful tanks, etc. A CTB bus has been provided for the use of the villagers. A pre-school, health centre, library, an economic centre and many more facilities will be provided for this village soon and it will be fully developed beyond the level expected by the late Thera by the time of his third commemoration, which falls on November 8, 2018. The Indian government assists development projects, he added.

Lindsey Stirling: The 'dubstep violinist' gets festive

How early is it acceptable to start listening to Christmas music
Maybe you already are. Maybe, like us, you start hammering Christina Aguilera's classic 2000 album My Kind Of Christmas around July.
No Oh. Just us.
"I usually wait until mid-November," says the much more sensible Lindsey Stirling, who's just released her first Christmas album. "Maybe early November, but that's as early as I'll go."
The violinist is among a string (here all week etc.) of artists releasing Christmas albums this year - including Gwen Stefani, 98 Degrees, Hanson and Sia.
But Lindsey has enlisted some friends to help out - and as a result her album, Warmer In The Winter, features guest vocals from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Becky G.
"Christmas music was such an important part of our family. It brings all the feelings to life, whether you want to feel happy and jolly or spiritual, romantic or reminiscent," she says.
"I've never done so much homework for an album as I have for this one. I spent a solid week sitting on my couch listening to Christmas music, picking up my violin, and really finding the songs that created a nice emotional arc through the album, but also finding songs that I really enjoyed and had memories for me."
Lindsey adds that she had to look for songs which "really sang on a violin, because not every melody sings as well on different instruments".
The final set list of Warmer In The Winter includes 13 tracks - many of which are the classics you'd expect: Jingle Bell Rock, Silent Night, Let It Snow and a brilliantly jazzy rendition of You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch.
The original songs include the super-catchy Christmas C'Mon and the title track - which features Trombone Shorty, who you can probably tell from his name alone is someone you need in your life.
This is Lindsey's fourth album since she shot to fame as a quarter-finalist on America's Got Talent in 2010.
While she now says she "wouldn't change anything" about her musical journey, she adds that the series "was a really hard experience for me".
"It almost caused me in a way to give up. I was so discouraged after that show. I thought it was going to be my big break and yet it didn't turn out how I wanted.
"I got off the show and nothing happened. I thought, 'Someone's gonna call, some record label, some producer's going to be interested', but nobody was. And I think that's because what I was doing was so different. I don't think anyone really knew what to do with it.
"It wasn't until half a year later that I discovered YouTube and started to explore that world, and that's what changed everything for me.
It certainly did.
Lindsey's channel currently has nearly 10 million subscribers. Her most popular video to date,Chrystallize- which saw her style herself as the "dubstep violinist" - has notched up 181 million views.
Who needs a sneezing panda.
"YouTube has done everything for me - I don't think I ever would've made it if I hadn't had it," Lindsey says.
"It was the perfect platform for me as an artist. I was having a hard time getting anyone to understand this art form, and then I found YouTube and I was so excited because I didn't have to wait for someone to believe in me, or a record label to invest in me."
"I thought, 'I know how to edit video, I know how to create content, I was a film major in college' and I had lots of film friends so I started making these little music videos, putting them online and it was amazing for me, the reaction was very strong. And this time I was in my own court, I could direct them."
Lindsey's career may now be going from strength to strength, but she hasn't shied away from speaking openly about her struggles along the way.
In an article published inThe Telegraphearlier this year, she explained how a habit of counting calories when she started university led to a battle with anorexia, which saw her drop to a "dangerously unhealthy" weight.
"When I first realised I had depression and anorexia, I felt like it was such a black mark," she tells the BBC.
"Like, how could I have these really horrible mental diseases I just remember feeling so different suddenly to everybody else. Very hopeless.
"So my biggest message to anyone struggling is that it's actually very normal. Everybody goes through it, it's natural, I think to some degree every single person has to cope with and deal with it throughout their lives.
"It doesn't mean you're tainted or have a black mark on you or that you're never going to be happy ever again - it's quite the opposite, it's something everyone can work through."

Magical animations in  'My Little Pony' series
Filipino animators have worked their magic in the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series and the My Little Pony: The Movie.
Unknown to many, the My Little Pony franchise, which has become a pop-culture phenomenon, especially after the 2010 series reboot My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, has been tapping the services of the homegrown animation studio Top Draw Animation, Inc. for all of the popular cartoon shows seven seasons.
The Filipino artistry is now on full-length display in the movie adaptation, which is on its second week of showing in cinemas. Its the first-ever feature film for the 19-year-old Ortigas-based animation company.
Top Draw acquired the big-screen job being a longstanding outsourcing studio for the Vancouver-based DHX Media. The latter was commissioned by the My Little Pony franchise owner Hasbro, a US multinational toymaker that has expanded into gaming and entertainment.
About 80 percent of the film was made in the Philippines. It took a crew of at least 70 people and a year to finish not only key animation, but also other production services like layout, background and rigging or the process of modeling characters for animation.

Missile attack 'an act of war' by Iran, Saudi Foreign Minister says

Saudi FM: We have zero tolerance for corruption14:05
Story highlightsSaudi Arabia to take "appropriate measures" against IranAnti-corruption arrests linked to investment drive, Foreign Minister says
Riyadh (CNN)Saudi Arabia regards the failed ballistic missile attack on Riyadh's international airport Saturday as an act of war by Iran and will take "appropriate" measures when the time is right, the country's Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir told CNN Monday.
Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for firing the projectile on Saturday, which was intercepted by Saudi defense forces before it hit the ground. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies accuse Iran of providing material support to the rebels.
"It was an Iranian missile, launched by Hezbollah, from territory occupied by the Houthis in Yemen," al-Jubeir told CNN, referring to Shia militias in Lebanon and Yemen closely allied to Tehran.
"We see this as an act of war," he said. "Iran can not lob missiles at Saudi cities and towns and expect us not to take steps," he added, citing article 51 of the UN Charter whereby a nation can act if an armed attack occurs against it.
Al-Jubeir said the missile was made in Iran and smuggled in parts into Yemen, where he claimed "operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah" helped put it back together again and then launch it.
"We reserve the right to respond in the appropriate manner at the appropriate time," said the softly-spoken career diplomat.
He declined to say what those measures against Iran might be.
"This is a very, very hostile act," he said. "We have been extending our hand to Iran since 1979 in friendship, and what we get back is death and destruction."
Earlier Monday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi described Saudi claims about Tehran's involvement as "false, irresponsible, destructive and provocative," the Iranian news agency Tasnim reported.
CNN spoke to al-Jubeir -- who was the Saudi ambassador to the United States before becoming Foreign Minister -- after an extraordinary series of events at the weekendthat began with the resignation of the Lebanese Prime Minister from the Saudi capital and ended with the detainment of a large group of high-profile Saudi princes and ministers on corruption charges, along with other officials and prominent businessmen.
Saudi to close ports and borders with Yemen
Al-Jubeir said Iran could not just "sit there" and expect to get "a free pass" to meddle in countries in the region, citing Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Bahrain.
He added that Saturday's missile was similar to one fired from Yemen in July that was shot down close to the Saudi city of Mecca, a month before the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Islam's holiest site.
Al-Jubeir confirmed to CNN on Monday that his country was closing its ports and borders with Yemen to stop Iranian penetration of the Kingdom.
He insisted however that humanitarian aid would still make it through to the millions of people suffering from malnutrition and cholera brought on by the years-long proxy war between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia.
"Our objective is to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance in Yemen, but do it in such a way that Iran and its militias and its proxies cannot use that access in order to smuggle weapons and technology that can be re-assembled into missiles in Yemen, that will then be used against us and against the Yemeni people," he said.
Al-Jubeir: Hezbollah calling shots in Lebanon
With regard to Hariri's bombshell resignation Saturday, al-Jubeir said: "It is very clear that Hezbollah is undercutting him at every turn, that it is doing Iran's bidding, that the Lebanese political system became paralyzed, that the issue of a government that could act independently was a sham, it was Hezbollah who were calling the shots

## Title: Modern grocery retail sector in Lanka to expand - Fitch
## Supertitle:

Modern grocery retail sector in Lanka to expand - Fitch
Fitch Ratings expects the modern grocery retail sector in Sri Lanka to expand in the mid-teens in the medium term, supported by aggressive expansion and growth in same-store sales.
Increasing per capita income and rising urbanisation should make modern grocery retail more affordable and accessible to a larger portion of the population. Sri Lankas supermarket penetration is still around 15% compared to 30% for regional peers with similar social and economic characteristics, which indicates the potential for the industry to grow.
Positive Customer Perception: We believe more people are now willing to shop at supermarkets and hypermarkets compared with five years ago, helped by the competitive prices offered by modern retailers, which are equal to or even below the prices of traditional retailers.
Modern retailers are able to source products at low prices due to their larger scale while most of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) they sell are subject to maximum retail prices which reduce the price difference with traditional retailers.
We believe customers will gradually prioritise convenience and quality over price amid rising income levels, which also bodes well for modern grocery retail.
Stable Credit Profiles: Fitch expects the credit profiles of the three largest operators of modern grocery retail chains in Sri Lanka - Cargills Food City, Keells Super and Arpico (the retail arm of Richard Pieris & Company PLC (A(lka)/Stable) - to remain stable in the medium term despite high capex.
We expect strong top line growth and stable profit margins to help generate sufficient operating cash to meet the companies expansion needs.
Consequently we expect gross leverage (defined as lease adjusted gross debt/EBITDAR) of the companies to remain in the 2.0x-3.0x range in the medium term until cash inflows from new stores allow meaningful deleveraging. In addition, all three companies, which run supermarkets and hypermarkets, are supported by strong parents that have diversified sector exposures and strong access to funding.
Large Formats and Regional Expansions: We believe the companies that focus on hypermarket formats with extensive product portfolios are likely to make the most gains in urban areas, where customers prioritise convenience, variety and quality. We do not expect the established players to aggressively expand outside of the Western province in the near term, but provinces such as North Central, North Western and Uva provide strong growth potential as they are supported by high per capita income growth and low supermarket penetration. We expect growth in the Western province to stagnate in the medium term, especially for companies that focus on FMCG products, as demand for such products tends to be inelastic.
High Entry Barriers: We do not expect competition in the modern retail sector to be much changed by new entrants in the medium term. The incumbents have secured a mix of owned and leased properties in prime locations in main cities that would be difficult for a new player to replicate at a time when property prices and rents are rising. A potential entrant will also have to build strong relationships with suppliers to secure lower costs, which could take years.
The significant investment required to set up sophisticated warehousing and transportation facilities could also deter new entrants in the absence of third parties that provide such services.
Online Sales Still Small: We believe modern grocery retailers will benefit from online sales only in the long-term because delivery costs are likely to remain high compared to the average basket-size in the next three to four years.
Positively, the established operators have the necessary infrastructure, such as extensive warehousing and transportation facilities, to cater to this market. At the same time, rising internet penetration, increased use of credit cards, and a preference for convenience amid rising income levels have created a conducive environment for online retail.
Regulatory Risks Remain High: We believe regulatory changes in the form of taxes and price controls are the key risk for the industry. The industry was affected by previous ad-hoc changes to value added tax (VAT) that significantly reduced sector margins. The large modern retailers were affected the most as the VAT is imposed on high revenue generators. We believe the tax environment has improved for modern retailers with the removal of deemed VAT - a sales tax that retailers were not allowed to pass on to consumers. However even a slight change in taxes could have a material impact on profitability, which is already thin.
From time to time the government has imposed price ceilings on essential items which have forced supermarkets to sell existing stocks at lower margins or losses. Price controls have also led to supply shortages and low quality products hitting the market, but the impact of such actions have been short term and negligible on the credit profiles of the large grocery retail operators.

Murray, Djokovic, fall out of ATP Top 10
Paris: Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic dropped outside the ATP top 10 for the first time in years in the latest rankings released on Monday.
The 30-year-old Murray plummeted from third to 16th after not playing since July with a hip injury.
The Scots last appearance outside the top 10 was in October 2014.
The three-time Grand Slam winner last appeared on court at Wimbledon, losing in the quarter-finals to American Sam Querrey.
Shortly after that he was nudged off the top of the world rankings by Rafael Nadal, who sealed the end-of-year top spot at the Paris Masters last week.
Murray is due to face world number two Roger Federer in a charity exhibition match in Glasgow on Tuesday before he starts his preparations for the Australian Open by playing in Brisbane.
Djokovic, struggling with an elbow injury, was also last seen in action in the Wimbledon quarter-finals when he retired against Tomas Berdych.
The 12-time Grand Slam winner ends the year in 12th, down five places, for his lowest ranking since March 2007. Djokovic is hoping to make a comeback at the exhibition World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi next month.
American Jack Sock, who beat Filip Krajinovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 in the Paris Masters final on Sunday, climbs 13 rungs to ninth in the ATP chart.
Socks exploit in the French capital earned him a ticket to the World Tour Finals next week.
Nadals participation in the season-ending tournament in London is in doubt after the world number one and 16-time Grand Slam champion pulled out of Paris before his quarter-final with a knee injury.
ATP rankings on November 6 -
1. Rafael Nadal (ESP) 10645 pts, 2. Roger Federer (SUI) 9005, 3. Alexander Zverev (GER) 4410 (+1), 4. Dominic Thiem (AUT) 3815 (+2), 5. Marin Cilic (CRO) 3805, 6. Grigor Dimitrov (BUL) 3650 (+2), 7.

A nation energised with Gal Oya mission
Sri Lanka which was a colony under the British gained independence as the Dominion of Ceylon within the British Commonwealth on February 4, 1948, eight years after I was born on February 4, 1939, seven months prior to the beginning of World War II on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by the Germans.
Don Stephen Senanayake who was honoured later in his life by the honorific title Father of the Nation had a flair for agriculture from the early years of his life. With the ambition to sharpen this inherence he entered the School of Agriculture in Kundasale with the first batch of students and obtained a qualification.
As he became the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon in 1948, his earnestness was to develop the country to work for the welfare of the landless, homeless and hard up people. Determined to find a way to uplift the way of life of the hapless people, he selected an uninhabited area of 150,000 acres or 60,750 hectares in the Gal Oya valley a kingdom of jumbos in the east of Sri Lanka, 40 miles (64 kilometres) from Batticaloa and 318 kilometres from Colombo. The only people who lived then in the middle of those thick forests were the people who wore a pinafore dress similar to the prisoners dress supposed to have been brought to this country by King Gajabahu as prisoners from India and distributed in several parts of the country, and the Sinhalese from Wellessa chased away by the British. They were found when clearing operations began, and they came to limelight when jungles were felled.
Gal Oya Irrigation and Power Project
Prior to the commencement of development work, the premier hastened to provide the main infrastructural requirements, videlicet, irrigation and power. In line with this decision, on August 24, 1949, he inaugurated the Gal Oya Irrigation and Power Project. The construction of a dam (the existing one) across the Gal Oya (a river 62 miles or 99.7 kilometres long having its fountainhead in Madulsima hills in the uplands of Badulla) was entrusted to the American firm Morrison Knudson International Construction Company incorporated in San Francisco laying the foundation on August 29, 1949, and the Hydro Power Project (linked to the national grid at Laxapana) to the Canadian Engineers who were here under the Colombo Plan to assist in the development work in early 1949. On November 24, 1949, Gal Oya Development Board was passed by an Act of Parliament as a statutory body to undertake the development of the Gal Oya Valley.
The work commenced auspiciously with the blessings of the partisans and the well-wishers not without brickbats from the opposition in parliament especially from Dr S A Wickremasinghe of the Communist Party and Member of Parliament for Akuressa who said that miserable people were being driven to an insanitary and insalubrious area infested with crow size mosquitoes moreover when malarial fever existed in epidemic form. In spite of these remarks and vehement protests, as planned, men and machinery were moved to the valley and, operations continued for 21 years successfully with the unreserved cooperation, the assistance and aids of many friendly countries and the toil and sacrifice of people from various countries and our people and ended as an apotheosis  a perfect example to the developing world and especially to the satisfaction of all those who observed its progression from beginning to the end.
Today, the Gal Oya valley which is well-known as Ampara has become a place of prosperity as our dear premier anticipated when he declared Gal Oya has become a household word. It is symbolic of the New Lanka. May it obtain fulfillment speedily and herald the progress of our march towards self-sufficiency as he inaugurated the Gal Oya Irrigation and Power Project, inscribed in the commemoration pillar erected at Inginiyagala roundabout.
Unity and co-operation among the people of Sri Lanka and donations from people of many foreign countries was the cause of the success of this scheme. Among the Sinhalese in the Directorate of the Board were H J Luxham from England an ex-financial secretary to the colonial government of Ceylon, the first Chairperson, R L Brohier, a director, R Kanagasundaram, the second Chairperson, W T I Alagaratnam, T C S Jeyaratam, an ex-governor from India, D Caspersz and A R Mansoor were other directors.
Construction projects and colonization schemes
The Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers worked for this board in unison in real comradeship. Over 15,000 men and women in the permanent cadre and over 200,000 casual employees contributed their skills, toiled hard to ensure this success living there for 21 years under a wide range of climatic conditions undergoing untold hardships, suffering from various diseases, dying owing to sicknesses, owing to accidents whilst on duty, killed by elephants and other beasts, vicious serpents and other creatures until the fruition of this onerous objective.
The Board Secretariat, the Base Workshops, the Carpentry workshop, Hardy Institute of Technical Training, the tile factory at Irakkamam, Rice Mill at Chavalaakade, Gal Oya Sugar Industries, jungle felling and land preparation for the plantation, the massive housing scheme for the resident employees, Agriculture Extension Division, Paddy Extension Division, Massive stores complexes, Paddy and Sugar Cane harvesting, construction of several tanks including the Inginiyagala tank named Senanayake Samudra, road construction projects and colonization schemes were on which these people were deployed during two decades and one year. Its worth to repeat and place on record that it was their unity, cooperation and determination that gave them the staying power to steadfastly continue until the end.
Today, that once existed unity among us does not exist. The people are divided. In disunity, as a result, nothing is initiated properly, implemented properly and ended properly. Its a turmoil and turpitude that is visible, unity is not in the vicinity. The appeal in earnest from all corners of the world for this countrymen is to unite leaving the fight for political power. If the remaining few desist from rabble-rousing and trouble making and co-operate with the majority favouring unity and peace among all, our country will become a place in the seventh heaven to live. The success of any organisation depends on the proper placement of personnel and goodness of man management. In this establishment, the labour force spread in offices and sites in 150,000 acres was very large in number. They included from underworld people, island reconvicted criminals, murderers, rogues and thugs, amongst the others. So, it was not as easy as managing people at work in a compact area or in front of a manager.
They were people at work miles and miles away in the jungles. Managing these people needed dynamism. This board had a large number of dynamic people who were competent in directing and commanding personnel and obtaining the cooperation of all of them until they attained their goal during an era when management was not taught in this country. Among them from era to era were these prominent people at the higher echelons who were the driving force. Shirley Amarasinghe, M S Perera, I M de Silva, Wijayabahu Wijesinghe, a planter by profession, N E Weerasuriya, a retired judge of the Supreme Court, G R de Silva, Neville Jayaweera, B K Abeyratne, Harry Jayasinghe, M J Perera, B C Perera, M W F Abeykoon, Kapila Ratnayake, Attorney-at-Law, Nanda Alagiyawanna and D W R Kahawita who served as Chairpersons, Directors, Resident Managers and General Managers many of whom were civil servants.

Older, badder  moms!
The cast of Bad Moms had such a good time filming their 2016 hit comedy, they immediately jumped at the chance to make a holiday-themed sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas.
Stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn tell ET Canadas Matte Babel they didnt even have time to be apprehensive about jumping on board a second film.
We didnt have any time you dont understand. We went from one to two, Kunis admits.
The 34-year-old actress filmed Bad Moms, gave birth to her second child with husband Ashton Kutcher and went back to work filming the sequel. It was like, Now take a deep breath. Pop out a baby. And have a movie,' the actress says, taking a deep breath. I got pregnant the day we wrapped. And I was on-set with a 3-month-old.
While the production wasnt put on hold for Kunis to return, she says it was worth it to return to work earlier than she planned. I mean I went to work a little bit earlier than I anticipated. It was a little earlier than I wanted to. But, it was a great movie and it needed to be told and the story was awesome and I got to work with these girls, so my kid got schlepped with me and they had to suffer though a lot of [breast] pumping, she laughs.
Their new sequel pairs the Bad Moms with their own mothers for the holidays, casting Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and Christine Baranski as their opinionated mothers who arrive just in time for Christmas. While their on-screen moms are eager to impart their holiday wisdom, Bell, Hahn and Kunis have some holiday traditions of their own. ET

Omani yacht skipper charged with rape
Le Havre: Leading Omani yachtsman Fahad Al Hasni appeared in a French court on Sunday charged with raping a former girlfriend in a hotel room, prosecutors in Le Havre said. "The instructing judge charged Mr Al Hasni with rape," prosecutor Francois Gosselin told AFP. The suspect is being held for four days while the defence team prepares its case, he added. The woman, believed to be aged in her forties and of French nationality, alleged "she was forced to perform a sex act on the yachtsman," explained a police source.
He said she was then violently pushed out of the hotel room, suffering cuts to her face. Staff at the hotel "found her crying in the corridor...claiming to have suffered a sexual assault," added Gosselin who said she was immediately taken to hospital. The alleged incident took place on Friday night. Al Hasni admits that oral sex took place but insists it was consensual, explained Gosselin. Al Hasni was arrested on Friday and kept in police custody before appearing before a magistrate on Sunday. Investigators said the woman is an ex-girlfriend of Al Hasni, the first Omani to cross the Atlantic on a trimaran in 2012. He was in the French port to take part in the Transat Jacques-Vabre race.

Monsoon rains begin in Anuradhapura
Plans afoot to cultivate over 130,000 hectares
The long-awaited monsoonal rain season has begun in the Anuradhapura district. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that if the major tanks receives rain up to spilling level, it has been planned to cultivate 129,000 hectares with paddy during the 2017/2018 Maha Cultivation Season.
He further said that depending on an adequate rainfall, it is envisaged to get a paddy harvest of 830,000 MT during the current Maha Season and 2018 Yala Season in the Anuradhapura district.
"Around 140,000 farmer families in the district have had heavy cultivation losses during the last three consecutive cultivation seasons.
We are making arrangements to provide every possible support for them to cultivate the full acreage in view of the untold hardships they have been undergoing.
Especially nearly 500,000 bushels of seed paddy would be distributed on a 50 percent subsidized basis, or where necessary, free-of-charge. Also Agrarian Services Department and the Fertilizer Secretariat officials have been instructed to look into ensuring that there are adequate fertilizer stocks available in the open market, while fertilizer subsidy monies are paid in time to the farmers.
It was learnt that around 150,000 farmers have applied for the subsidy," Wanninayaka said.
Referring to the fertilizer subsidy issue, Kachcheri Fertilizer Secretariat Assistant Director Ajith Kumara said that an estimated sum of Rs. 30,00 million required to pay the fertilizer subsidy to the farmers during 2017/2018 Maha Cultivation Season.
He further said that there were sufficient TSP, Urea and MOP fertilzier stocks available in the open fertilizer market in the district.
Farmers used to apply fertilizer to their cultivation beyond the prescribed doses in the past, where solid fertilizer subsidy were offered, with the intention of yielding enhanced harvest. This practice has made the soil infertile and poisonous and as such, farmers are instructed to use fertilizer adhering to the leaf colour chart criteria.
It has been found through recent soil tests that in some paddy cultivation zones, TSP and Urea percentages are high and that soil shall not be introduced to more chemical fertilizer.
Farmers are advised to practice soil testing with the aid of Agriculture Research and Production Assistants to guide them. Such a procedure would minimize the expenditure for fertilizer and help to revive the fertility of the soil, he added.
He said that the maximum selling price of 50 kg of fertilizer is Rs. 2,500.
He appealed to the farmers to complain to the government agent, the divisional secretaries and the fertilizer secretariat officials in case of any fertilizer shortage, alleged hoarding of fertilizer, or selling of them at exorbitant prices by the traders.

Porsche to produce Mission E all-electric vehicle in 2019, boost electrification of lineup by 2023
Luxury automakers the world over have accelerated toward more hybrid and electric vehicle offerings, but there has been one noticeably absent player in the green car game, that is until now.
Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told Manager Magazin, a German publication, last week that the company plans to dedicate half its annual production exclusively to EVs by 2023, with its first all-electric vehicle debuting in 2019.
After discontinuing plans last month to build a hybrid version of the 911 coupe, the German automaker plans on taking its Mission E to production four years after its world premiere as a concept car at the 2015 Frankfort Motor Show. Porsche's Mission E will be able to go an impressive 310 miles on a full charge. With a 90-kWh battery, powering it from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, the Mission E would stand in direct competition with the performance-oriented Tesla Model S.
Those mileage figures should be taken with a grain of salt however, as the New European Driving Cycle (or NEDC) standards tend to be more generous than those of the EPA, and don't reflect real-world driving range. A more realistic estimate, according to Electrek, places the automaker's first ever all-electric vehicle closer to the 250-mile range.
Porsche also claims that the Mission E will get an 800-volt charging system, which should charge it up to 80 percent capacity in approximately 15 minutes, a charge time that handily eclipses Tesla's Superchargers.

The automaker's electrified plans also include an all-electric version of its top-selling Macan SUV following the Mission E, though it released no details on when that vehicle will debut. Over the next six years, Porsche plans to ramp up annual EV production to as many as 60,000 at its Zuffenhausen factory in Germany, an unprecedented feat for any automaker that would equate to a quarter of its total production of 238,000 vehicles per year. This means the automaker could have plans to electrify other models in the future, and possibly incorporate hybrid cars into its projections, according to Autoblog.
Porsche's plans for substantial electrification stem from its parent company Volkswagen AG's requirements to introduce more electric offerings in its lineup as a stipulation for settling the infamous Dieselgate scandal that has cost the automaker $20 billion in the United States alone. The German automaker agreed to include more environmentally friendly vehicles to atone for installing illegally emissions-masking software into the TDI engines of 11 million Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche vehicles worldwide.

Resettlement helps decrease Mullaitivu poverty line
Poverty of the Northern Province is comparatively higher than other provinces of the island due to the war which lasted for three decades. After the end of the war in 2009, numerous development projects were implemented by the government to uplift the lives of war affected people in the North and East of the country, said Minister of Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, D.M. Swaminathan.
After 2015, the present government initiated sustainable development projects to uplift the lives of people in the North and East. As a result of the projects which were initiated by the Ministry of Resettlement, Mullaitivu Secretariat indicators shows the poverty line of the Mullaitivu district had decreased from 24.5 percent in 2016 to 12.2 percent in 2017.
Participating in a livelihood distribution programme in the Mullaitivu district, Minister D M Swaminathan said, This is a rapid development for Mullaitivu district and my vision is to minimize the entire poverty line of the Northern Province by 2019. We have resettled over 75,000 families in the Mullaitivu district and over 80 percent of the lands have been released to the relevant land owners affected by the war. Hundred percent of the private lands in the Mullaitivu district will be released by 2018 and I am certain that I can minimize the poverty line up to eight percent in the Mullaitivu district within the next year, he said.
He further explained that before 2020 he will be releasing all the private lands in the Northern province and uplifting the peoples lives to the maximum level. The minister said this at a function held at the Mullaitivu district Secretariat Office last Friday evening to distribute self-employment equipment for 600 war affected families and Rs. 60 million million was distributed among them to develop their self employment businesses.

Sri Lanka company based in Japan Royal Wain Co. Ltd, has tied up with one of leading Japanese instant food manufacturing companies to set up a plant in the North East to manufacture rice and fisheries based food items and re-export back to Japan. Royal Wain would also bring in two additional investors to Sri Lanka.
Chairman, Royal Wain, Ranjan Costa who is now in Sri Lanka says that he will be launching this operation next year with a Japanese investor. I am now in Sri Lanka on a fact finding mission to identify a suitable area to launch this operation. We are looking for a sea front land the in North East and once it is identified, the Japanese team would visit Sri Lanka towards the end of the year.
He said that they want to open a plant in the North East area to manufacture NORI, a ready to eat rice packet which is wrapped in edible sea weed instead of polythene. This is a very popular instant lunch meal in Japan and we found out that the sea weed that is used to wrap this is also growing in Northern seas of Sri Lanka.
Since both rice and ocean fish are available in North East we are keen to open a factory in North East and plan to re-export via the Mattala Airport via Dubai.
He said this would be a BOI approved project where the investment would be over US$ 50 million.
Royal Wain Co. Ltd, Japan will also tie up with Showa Shoyu Co. Ltd. of Japan to manufacture Soya bean souce and other food items mainly from Agriculture products. Showa Shoyu Co opened their first overseas factory in Bangladesh mainly to manufacture sauce using Soya bean and other agro material grown in Bangladesh.

Activists from Right to Life Human Rights Centre (RTLHRC) and the National Peace Council (NPC), met representatives of Civil Society Organizations (CSO)s in Deniyaya, Weligama and Matara over the weekend to canvass grass root level support in favour of the proposedreforms to Sri Lankas Constitution.
Every Sri Lankan should be given the right to live in peace and harmony, irrespective of their ethnicity or religious belief, said Executive Director of Right to Life Human Rights
Center, Phillip Dissanayaike, explaining the need to make changes to the existingConstitution.
One of the main pre-election promises given by the present government was to abolish the Executive Presidency and it is our duty to compel the government to fulfil their promises, he added.
We look forward to three major changes being made to Sri Lankas Constitution, said the Chief Organizer of Purawesi Balaya (Citizens Power) Senior Journalist Gamini Viyangoda. (Purawesi Balaya is a social movement comprising of artistes, intellectuals, professionalsand civil activists who threw their weight behind President Maithripala Sisrisenas successful bid for presidency).
The first is to abolish the Executive Presidency, the second is to devolve power and the third is to change the electoral system, he noted.
At present it is the ideal time to make changes to the Constitution, as there is peace in the country and the government in power is a coalition between the two largest political parties. We should question ourselves as to why we need a new Constitution Is it because we are not satisfied with the present Constitution If so why arent we satisfied with it and what changes do we need Each and every citizen of Sri Lanka was given the opportunity to propose what changesshould be made. Please convey this message to your members, he said.
This Constitution was introduced in 1978 by president J. R. Jayawardena, but from 1994 onwards every presidential candidate who was elected had promised to abolish the Executive Presidency which they never fulfilled. Each one of them have proved to varying extents how the power they yield could be abused. And it is for this reason that we should take this opportunity to see that it is abolished.
Power should be devolved to the provincial administrations to prevent ethnic unrest in the future. Devolution of power is not a threat to the sovereignty of the nation but ethnic uprising is!
The interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka is not a draft. The suggestions made are open to discussion and only the most agreeable changes would be included in the initial draft, he added.
The present Constitution is destroying our political culture, said reputed author, poet and actor Lucien Bulathsinhala. Bribery and corruption is rampant in the state service. The people have distanced themselves from arts and cultural activities. We need to change this system, he added.
You are misleading the audience! accused V. G. Piyadasa. You mentioned that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party promised to abolish the Executive Presidency. That is not true because senior ministers like Nimal Siripala de Silva have reiterated that the SLFP was against abolishing it. You also specifically named some Buddhist clergy of making racist statements which is also incorrect, he said before being interrupted by a section of the audience permitting Gamini Viyangoda to answer the accusations and prevent further criticism.
Power should be devolved to a certain extent with the provincial administrations, said A. J. Munasingha while Journalist Jayathissa Tennakone suggested, The Constitution should guarantee that every citizen of Sri Lanka has the right to free education, free health services and is provided with a house to live and guaranteed of suitable employment.

Russia faces 'very real' threat of attack
Moscow: Russia says it will take extraordinary measures to combat any terrorist threat when it hosts the World Cup next year, as its military campaign in Syria makes the country a prime target for jihadists.
A bombing on the metro in Saint Petersburg in April that left 15 people dead was among the recent high-profile terror attacks on Russian soil. The fear of more attacks was heightened after seven people were stabbed in Siberia in August in an attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, while the authorities have reported breaking up several jihadist cells across the country.
"There is a very real threat of an attack in Russia" during the World Cup, which runs from June 14 and July 15 2018, said Alexander Golts, an independent Russia expert specialising in security.
Russia has experienced a number terror attacks over the last 20 years and during two wars in Chechnya, but the threat has increased since Moscow's military intervention in Syria in September 2015 to support President Bashar al-Assad's regime, making it a priority IS target. AFP

Six Lankans jailed for stealing Dh 1.1m in Dubai
Six Sri Lankan guards of a security company in Dubai have been jailed for three years each for robbing Dh1.19 million from a cash transfer van.
The six Sri Lankans earlier admitted in the Dubai Court of First Instance to the charge of theft of the funds that belonged to several branches of a shop in Dubai.
They will be deported after serving their jail terms.
Two Sri Lankan cleaners have been charged in absentia with possessing some of the stolen amounts and with aiding and abetting the main accused. One of them was sentenced to one year in jail, to be followed by deportation, while the other was cleared.
The two cleaners - who are at large - helped the guards by letting them use their IDs to transfer some of the money (Dh84,000) to Sri Lanka.
The six guards staged the theft and covered for one of them while he stole the cash. They gathered at a flat in Al Rashidiya, later where each of them received Dh160,000 and left the remaining amount for various expenses.
The incident took place between May 6 and 10. The main accused admitted during the investigation that they planned the theft a few days in advance. They rented a flat for the purpose and decided to split the money and transfer most of it back home through money exchange outlets. They hid in the Dubai flat and also in Sharjah.
At around 1.30 pm on May 6, they went to a shop at the Deira Metro station where they were supposed to collect funds. One of them pretended he was going to the washroom. As his accomplices distracted the staff at the shop, that accused went to the cash transfer vehicle and stole the money bags after the driver - who trusted him - opened the safe for him. The driver thought the guard would be taking empty bags as usual.
Once they took the cash, the guards fled the scene in two cabs and went to Sharjah, where they changed their clothes. In the evening, they gathered in the rented flat in Al Rashidiya.
The Police arrested the main accused shortly later and recovered a part of the money from him. He told the Police that some of his accomplices managed to transfer their shares outside by using others' IDs.
Apart from Dh1.1million, the guards also stole SR 976, RO 118, QR 1,190 and USD 740.
The cash in different currencies was later recovered from them. They paid Dh 2,500 to one of the cleaners, whom they met in Sonapur labour accommodation, to let them use his ID.

The SLMA called on the academic staff of all state medical faculties and their trade unions to create, ensure, and sustain an environment in which students can commence and continue with their interrupted academic activities without any further delay, and on the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure that all staff of medical faculties perform their duties.
The SLMA also called on medical doctors to maintain the highest standards of professionalism when providing healthcare services. The SLMA requested the government to ensure that all agreements reached with relevant stakeholders be carried out without compromise.

Sock wins Paris Masters, makes Tour Finals
Paris: American Jack Sock battled back from a set down to beat qualifier Filip Krajinovic 5-7, 6-4, 6-1 and win the Paris Masters title on Sunday, snatching a place at the World Tour Finals.
The 16th seed ended his Serbian opponent's fairytale run in the French capital to break into the world's top 10 for the first time and take the last place for London from Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta.
Despite dropping a tight opening set, the 25-year-old upped his game and stormed through the decider to claim the biggest title of his career.
"Incredible week. Hard to describe honestly. I don't think it's really hit or soaked in yet," Sock, who trailed 5-1 in the third set of his opener against Briton Kyle Edmund, told a press conference.
"Coming in this week I had no idea I could even make London.
"To come back from the deficit I was down in my first match here, and to have this trophy next to me now and talking to you guys has been an incredible achievement."
Sock, who was 24th in the 'Race to London' standings before arriving at Bercy, will become the American number one for the first time, after beating the man who knocked out his compatriots Sam Querrey and John Isner earlier in the week.
Krajinovic showcased the game that took him to the brink of becoming the first qualifier to win a Masters title since Albert Portas in 2001, but ultimately he failed to become only the second Serb after Novak Djokovic to triumph at this level.
"This was the best week in my life," Krajinovic said. "I will never forget this moment in my life. Coming from qualifying to the final was a dream come true."
Any worries that the world number 77 would struggle with nerves were quickly put to bed as he held his opening service game with an exquisite drop shot.
Sock had dropped serve eight times going into the final and Krajinovic brought up the first break point of the match in game five.
The world number 22 saved it with a drop volley, but the underdog quickly created another opportunity and Sock gifted him the break with a double fault. Sock immediately hit back as Krajinovic, also 25, produced a sloppy game, finished off with a wild forehand into the tramlines.
But Krajinovic, who will rise to 33 in the world rankings on Monday, brought up a set point in the 12th game as he made the most of his freedom to attack the Sock serve at 6-5 ahead, and the American dumped a forehand into the net.
The enormity of the situation appeared to hit Krajinovic at the start of the second set and Sock broke in the opening game.
The top-spin on Sock's forehand was causing all sorts of problems, helping secure a double-break as he looked set to take the match to a decider.
He took his foot off the pedal to give one of the breaks straight back, but closed out the set with a confident hold to love.
Sock had come from a set down to win the pair's only previous meeting at a Challenger in the United States three years ago, but he failed to strike another early blow in the third set as Krajinovic held after a lengthy first game.
The vital breakthrough came shortly afterwards though when Sock crunched two magnificent passing shots from well behind the baseline to leave Krajinovic stunned.
That was the moment that the momentum the qualifier had built up through the week was finally halted, and he fell further behind when Sock stretched to send a backhand flying into the corner.
He wasted no time in wrapping up victory with a run of six games on the spin as Krajinovic fired long on match point. AFP

A sound move
The astounding revelation made by a Deputy Minister that only four cases of corruption have been successfully prosecuted during the last 23 years says a lot for the willingness of the governments during that period to bring the necessary changes to the law to seriously tackle the canker of corruption that has eaten into the body politic of this country. All governments, when in opposition, pledged to shake heaven and earth to try its opponents, then in government, once ensconced in office, for swindling public funds and looting the Treasury. One Presidential candidate, we recall, even promised to hang the corrupt elements in the government at Galle Face. However, no opponent was brought to book during the entirety of the two year term of that President. Instead, corruption reached new heights, and thrived, under the government of that incumbent as well culminating in the individual concerned even having to pay compensation for a questionable transaction, following a court order, while out of office. Hence, the ballgame has been going on, with no serious attempt made to tackle corruption by politicians, their kith and kin and associates. Will there be a break in the trend this time around Or is it too much to expect
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P. Perera, who is also the UNP Spokesman for the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs and Media announced the governments decision to appoint a new Anti-Corruption High Court, since the Bribery and Corruption laws, as they stand, were completely outdated. He said, the necessary amendments to the Bribery and Corruption Act have already been sent to the Legal Draftsmans Department.
He also made the stunning revelation that, only four persons have been convicted with regard to bribery and corruption, during the last 23 years. Is the Deputy Minister telling the public that the Bribery and Corruption Commission have all these years being maintained by tax payers money, to bring only four cases of corruption to a successful conclusion There was a recent claim that thousands of files were gathering dust at the Bribery and Corruption Commission. Were the investigations into these files blocked through political intervention
The Deputy Minister disclosed that the Anti-Corruption High Court, which has received Cabinet approval, will be functional within the next six months. The number of High Court judges will be increased from 75 to 100 and ten new High Courts will be established in selected districts and Colombo, while the number of State Counsel in the Attorney Generals Department will be increased from 118 to 218. He said, resistance may come from people who are involved in bribery and corruption, but assured that the government will go ahead with the mission to create a proper environment for the proper administration of justice in the country.
Well, the Yahapalanaya government has certainly taken its time to beef up the Bribery and Corruption law, given that the chief plank of the platform of the Common Candidate was to bring to book the big time crooks and swindlers of the former regime. But, as they say, better late than never.
However, adding muscle to the law alone will not suffice, unless a genuine effort is made to seriously deal with those involved in mega corruption. We say this because the efforts, so far, in this connection, have not been convincing, even where provisions in the existing law were sufficient to effectively deal with the corrupt. The inordinate delay in the prosecution of blatant cases of corruption too have not impressed the public. Whatever will happen to the corruption cases already pending in the High Courts Will they be dealt by the new Anti-Corruption High Court There is the case of a former minister who could not explain how he acquired Rs. 400 million worth of assets, and, when, asked to report to the Bribery Commission that worthy claimed he could not make the trip since he was stung by a russels viper polanga. This case has been dragging on now for a lengthy period. Will the New Anti-Corruption Court take up this matter and dispose it off expeditiously, since speedy disposal of corruption cases was the reason for the formation of the new court, according to the Deputy Minster. Whatever has become of the aircraft deals, under the Rajapaksa regime, where, it was alleged, that purchases were made dispensing with tender procedures
Having a new Anti-Corruption Court, alone, would be of no use if the investigations are not thorough and carried out with the certainty of successful prosecution. Yahapalanaya spokesmen are often heard saying that cases are held up at the Attorney Generals Department due to insufficient material to effect a successful prosecution. Hence, the delay in bringing the corrupt to book.
What guarantee is there that the same excuse will not be trotted out, following the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Court, as well Hence, it is vital that the investigating arms of the Bribery and Corruption Commission and FCID be staffed with professionals who are experts on the subject of white collar crime, who are able to successfully follow the paper trail.

Sydney: Australia's pace spearhead Mitchell Starc sent a warning to England's batsmen with a hat-trick for New South Wales in a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney on Monday.
The left-armer ripped through the Western Australia tail, first bowling Jason Behrendorf, then trapping David Moody leg before wicket before scattering the stumps of Simon Mackin with consecutive deliveries.
Starc finished with four for 56 from 20 overs to go with his career-best haul of eight for 73 against South Australia at Adelaide Oval late last month.
It capped an impressive domestic match for Australia's two Test strike bowlers -- Starc and Josh Hazlewood.
Hazlewood took three for 13 on the way to figures of three for 24 in Western Australia's first innings of 176.
Starc and Hazlewood are expected to share the new ball in the opening Test of the Ashes series against England in Brisbane, starting on November 23. AFP

Clearly, country music fans missed Shania Twain. The singers new album Now, her first in 15 years, debuted at Number One on the all-genre Billboard 200.
With the equivalent of 137,000 copies sold in its first week, Now claimed both the all-genre top spot and the Number One position on the country albums chart. Its only the second all-genre Number One of Twains career  Up! went Number One in 2002  and just the second country album to take that title in 2017. Thomas Rhetts new album Life Changes also accomplished the feat.
Twain wrote all of the songs on Now and also co-produced the album, a vulnerable but empowering record that draws on her personal life. The Canadian entertainer will hit the road in May on her Now Tour, which kicks off in Tacoma Washington.
Even when I was realizing maybe I could record another album, then the fear was, Where do I begin Twain told Rolling Stone recently. It took a while to build up the courage to even share the songs.

An eye witness of the incident, a worker connected to the construction work of a nearby bridge, H. G. Chandrapala told the Police that he had seen the two children bathing and suddenly, a volume of water had carried them away, drowning them.
He further said that he had tried to save a person who had hung on to an iron rod of the bridge, before that individual was carried away by the stream.
The deceased hotel owner Kingsly Rathnayake had been constructing a tourist hotel in the area near this Oya and had asked one of his co-workers to keep lunch prepared for them after they come back from the Oya. The co-worker sadly added that Rathnayake had been a nature lover throughout his life and was concerned about the environment when building his tourist hotel.

## Title: Uphill road to becoming an actuary

Uphill road to becoming an actuary
An aptitude for math and statistics and a bent for problem solving is what it takes to become an actuary, says Milanthi Sarukkali, Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, USA.
That's putting it mildly, for there's just some half-a-dozen actuaries who hold fellowships in Sri Lanka, the discipline being that exacting. In fact, the world over, actuaries, although much in demand, are a limited number.
"It takes six or seven years on average to become an actuary. There are about 15 exams and modules to pass to obtain a fellowship," says Sarukkali, explaining why so few opt to become actuaries. "All you need is a background in math, but it takes a lot of time and effort to make the grade." She also said that although not a prerequisite, most students embark on actuarial studies after a first degree.
So, who is an actuary An actuary is a risk manager who quantifies the risk in financial transactions, risk being any situation where there a possibility of loss or gain, a situation of uncertainty. An actuary also proposes measures to mitigate risk or specifies how much a firm would be compensated for taking on the risk.
Traditionally, actuaries worked in the insurance business, Sarukkali says, hastening to add emphatically that they are not insurance professionals. Now actuaries are branching out into non-traditional sectors such as banking and finance. They can however, work in any field, as for example, in manufacturing, for every business involves risk, which needs to be assessed.
At an insurance firm, an actuary would look at risk from the macro level, whereas an underwriter would look at the risk involved for every individual policy.
Functions of an actuary
In assessing risk, apart from using quantitative techniques, an actuary would also look at external factors such as the political climate, the business environment, marketing, the regulatory environment and so on. In the case of health insurance, for instance, the health of the population, preventive measures such as vaccination and the state of the healthcare system would be considered.
Actuaries also design and price insurance products by considering what losses should be compensated for and the return required by the insurance firm for taking on that risk. Similarly, actuaries also design and price other financial products such as annuities and loans.
Every insurance firm has a requirement from the regulator to have its liability to policyholders assessed by an actuary who quantifies the amount the firm would have to pay out in claims and incur in expenses in the future on account of the policies it has underwritten. The actuary advises the firm on how much funds it needs to set aside to meet claims and, additionally, how much capital it needs to maintain in an extraordinary situation such as a number of unexpected claims occurring together.
For a bank, an actuary would, for example, advise on how to make provision for credit losses. The International Financial Regulations Standards (IFRS) 9 will come into effect on January 1, 2018, setting out the new rules of accounting that banks must adhere to in order to make provision for credit losses. IFRS 17 which will come into effect in 2021 will completely change the way insurance companies report liability and recognize revenue and profits.
What does it take
"It takes a combination of quantitative techniques, business knowledge and soft skills to be an actuary," says Sarukkali, who now heads her own firm, Spark Actuarial and Risk Consultants in Colombo. Unassuming herself, it was nevertheless patently clear that the discipline was for a chosen few, on account of its rigour - the road to a fellowship being an uphill and arduous one.
Armed with a BSc in Physical Science from the University of Colombo and an MSc in Industrial Mathematics from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, she enrolled for a PhD in Mathematics with a concentration in actuarial science (her research was in this field) at the University of Connecticut, USA. By this time, she had taken six of the exams of the Society of Actuaries, USA.
She continued her actuarial exams and modules while studying for her PhD and working at ING Financial Services in Connecticut, the better part of which time she "had no life", as she ruefully admits. Modules are taken online and are business cases which mirror problems in the real world. "An actuary has to be creative, because there is no set answer to a problem," Sarukkali says, adding that completing eight modules could take up to two years. To complete a module, a final report has to be submitted where financial, technical and other business factors have been taken into account.
Just before receiving an associateship or a fellowship, an actuary has to participate in a mandatory one-day seminar by the Society of Actuaries on the code of conduct that it expects its members to follow. Apart from the US Society of Actuaries, the UK has its Institute of Actuaries, while closer home is the Institute of Actuaries, India, which follows the UK syllabus.
Returning home
Returning to Sri Lanka in 2015, she worked for sometime at Allianz Insurance Lanka as its Chief Actuary/Chief Risk Officer. Preferring to venture out on her own, she took on several consultancy projects, which when they proved too much to handle on her own, made her set up Spark.
Sarukkali has a staff of seven in Colombo who are studying for their associateships, while three others holding fellowships work from overseas. Most of her clients are based in the USA. One objective in embarking on Spark was to expand the profession in Sri Lanka by providing her staff with the opportunity of global exposure. She works in insurance, banking and finance, enough exposure for her young protgs to perhaps opt to remain in the island.
"The salary scales in Sri Lanka are not even close to those abroad," Sarukkali says. "An entry-level position in USA commands more than a senior position here."
Nevertheless, the sky's the limit for opportunity, if not remuneration and perks, as regulators become more stringent on minimum holding requirements to prevent a debacle such as the world experienced in 2008.

The United States is committed to staying with Sri Lanka through its period of reconciliation and reform, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon said Monday evening.
He was addressing media in a joint statement with Foreign Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam, following the second official US-Sri Lanka partnership dialogue. Secretary Kariyawasam said they had also met informally in New York in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
The heightened level of interaction between our two countries  is indeed heartening, Kariyawasm said. He said that relationship intensified after the 2015 elections. I commend Sri Lanka on its courageous decision to commit to a process of reform that promotes greater equality and prosperity for all Sri Lankans regardless of ethnicity or religion, Ambassador Shannon said.
Shannon announced a variety of new changes in policy towards Sri Lanka, such as working to reestablish the US Peace Corps to teach English in the country.
He also said the US Department of Agriculture would award $21 million to strengthen Sri Lankas dairy sector, and the US Coast Guard would offer a second cutter to the Sri Lankan Navy as a sign of strong bilateral ties.
Shannon said that although he commended positive steps towards a new constitution, reconciliation, and accountability, we always want these things to go faster. The whole world is watching Sri Lanka, he said. We all want a fast pace (towards reform), and nobody wants it more than the Sri Lankan people.

US Mourns Texas church massacre
US: The United States was in mourning Monday after a gunman wearing a bulletproof vest opened fire with an assault rifle on the congregation of a smalltown Texas church, killing 26 people and wounding 20 more in the nations latest shooting massacre.
Five weeks after the worst shooting in modern US history President Donald Trump said the nation was living in dark times, and ordered flags be flown half-staff at the White House and federal buildings in the aftermath of the most recent tragedy.
The victims, who ranged in age from five to 72, were gunned down at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a rural community of some 400 people located 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio.
The gunman, widely identified as Devin Kelley, 26, was described by authorities as a young white male who was found dead in his vehicle after being confronted by a local resident. The Air Force said Kelley served at a base in New Mexico starting in 2010 before being court-martialed in 2012 for allegedly assaulting his wife and child. He was sentenced to 12 months in confinement and received a bad conduct discharge, Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told AFP. He was discharged in 2014.
Wearing all black, he fired outside the church before entering the building and continuing to spray bullets, said Freeman Martin, regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
As he exited the church, a local resident grabbed his rifle and engaged that suspect. The suspect dropped his rifle, which was a Ruger AR assault-type rifle, and fled from the church. Our local citizen pursued the suspect at that time, Martin said.
Law enforcement later found Kelley dead in his car, which had crashed on the Wilson-Guadalupe county line. It was not clear if he had killed himself or was shot by the resident who had confronted him.
President Trump, in Japan as part of his nearly two-week long Asia tour, called the horrific shooting an act of evil. Our hearts are broken but in dark times -- and these are dark times -- such as these, Americans do what they do best: we pull together. Multiple weapons were found in the car, which was processed by bomb technicians.
We have multiple, multiple crime scenes. We have the church, outside the church. We have where the suspects vehicle was located, said Martin.
We have been following up on the suspect and where hes from. We have Texas Rangers at all the hospitals locating those and interviewing those who were injured. Theres so many families who have lost family members. Fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters, Governor Greg Abbott said, warning the toll could rise.
The tragedy, of course, is worsened by the fact that it occurred in a church, a place of worship, where these people were innocently gunned down. We mourn their loss, but we support their family members. The wounded had been transported to various hospitals with injuries that vary from minor to very severe, Martin said.
The dead included the 14-year-old daughter of pastor Frank Pomeroy, the church leader told ABC News.

Uva Chief Minister defends himself
Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Dassanayake declared that he would resign from his post if anyone is eligible enough to disprove the statement he made yesterday that a majority of graduate posts are granted by the Uva Provincial Council.
The Chief Minister revealed information about the issue that has emerged due to a complaint made against the graduates who passed an examination held by the Public Service Commission of Uva Province refraining them from getting posts by the graduates who did not pass the examination.
The Uva Province had been able to secure good results with a record of islands fourth place in the Grade Five Scholarship examinations this year. It is an achievement for the entire Uva Province. Today, the education of Thanamalwila, Siyabalanduwa and Sewanagala areas had been nourished. Also, we have been able to attain 180 Science Faculty posts, said the Minister.
A new principal has been appointed for Amilagama School which was closed for a long period. Now at least five students are participating in the scholarship examinations and four of them have managed to pass the exam. Soragune School which was also a school with insufficient facilities is now an active school and had been able to obtain 13 passes at the Grade Five Scholarship examinations with good results in the Ordinary Level Examinations as well, he said.
I have been to about 600 schools in both Badulla and Moneragala districts and know of the problems that the schools, students and the teachers face. Not only agriculture, but also the economy of the villagers is equally important to us. But to keep it balanced, it is mandatory that teachers are appointed to village schools. There are certain schools without teachers in Uva Province. The appointed teachers ask for a change of workplace right after they are appointed to schools in Haldumulla, Kumarathanna or Velanvita. Therefore, I request ministers not to accommodate this, he added.
If the graduates who have passed the examinations are given the chance to be appointed, I am ready to appoint them anytime and I highly appreciate if the complaint would be taken off by the other graduates who were did not pass the examinations, the minister further stated.
He then pointed out that he had appointed development officers and posts for graduates for the last two years and stated that the focus should be on solving legal matters and granting graduate posts furthermore.

This is what keeps Virat Kohli lean and fighting fit
India captain Virat Kohli is probably one of the fittest cricketers in the world right now. While he spends a lot of time in the gym, but his diet is equally important in staying fit and healthy.
In a recent interview on the web series Breakfast with Champions, Kohli revealed his mantra for staying so fit which doesnt just end in putting in the hard yards in training sessions.
Talking about the most important meal of the day which is the breakfast, Kohli said that his day starts with an omelette that consists of three egg whites and one whole egg. To go with that he adds a bit of spinach, black pepper and cheese.
That is soon followed by some grilled bacon or smoked salmon. In fruits, Kohli generally has some papaya, dragon fruit or watermelon and it ends with a big pot of green tea with lemon. Thats what you call a big heavy breakfast.
But thats not it. The lunch is a not as heavy as the breakfast and the 29-year-old generally goes with grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, spinach and veggies.
As the doctors suggest, dinner should always be light and all Kohli eats then is a lot of seafood.
Kohli also spoke about his equation with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, how it has become stronger with the passage of time, the Indian captain is proud of the fact that no external force has been able to affect his friendship with predecessor.
A lot of people try to plug in stories of rift between us. The best part is neither he reads those articles nor do I. And when the people see us together, they wonder wasnt there rift between the two. We laugh among ourselves and say we didnt know there was one, Kohli said during an episode of the show. - NDTV

What the UNP has done and shelter for all by 2025
Im sure you dont need me to explain the importance of homes both for physical and spiritual welfare. We all remember our own homes with fondness and, of course, they set up for life. They are the places we congregate as a family. Here we share experiences and a safe haven for us to return after busy days in the outside world.
Housing is important to people and their families well-being and security. That is why it is our mission to ensure that all Sri Lankans have shelter by 2025 and why, while in government, the UNP has invested over Rs 22 billion into housing over the past two years.
This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans.
Government investment in housing
It is only by building a stronger economy that we have been able to invest so heavily in housing. Our governments management of the economy has meant more money available for housing in poor and rural communities. We are proud to have helped well over 200,000 families secure a home so far and upgraded or made safe tens of thousands more.
Government investment in housing and amenities has doubled under the UNP and increased from Rs 7.8 billion to 19.6 billion in 2016. Under the Housing Plastering Program, 109,423 beneficiaries received Rs 10,000 worth of material. For those living in condition created over 30 years ago the housing conditions of almost 7,000 families have been upgraded and over 800 houses were completed for those working in the plantation sector.
By keeping to our plan to strengthen our economy we can keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future. Colombo is the nations commercial capital and the most important shipping hub for a vibrant region of over 1.5 billion people.
It boasts a highly educated workforce, a clean environment, modern cosmopolitan values, stable democratic governance, and mature investor-friendly structures.
Strong economy
Through the Megapolis programme, we are building a platform for growth that is consistent with social justice. A roadmap to development that is in harmony with the ecology. All this is possible because we are building a strong economy.
This government has helped over 200,000 families secure a home. In the process, we have improved the lives and security of hundreds of thousands of families and contributed to the UNPs mission to ensure all Sri Lankans are sheltered by 2025.
Frankly, our government has the builders. We are building a strong economy and now we are building homes for our people from the proceeds of endeavour. Housing is a human right and we are delivering homes for our hard-working citizens. More homes, a stronger economy and we are building a better Sri Lanka.

Wild elephants terrorising villages in Ambanpola
Invading wild elephants have been terrorising residents in several villages in the Ambanpola DS division in recent times. Among the threatened villages are Waragammana, Kaluperumawa, Kasicote, Amunugama and Udagama.
A herd of wild elephants which invaded Waragammana a few days ago have uprooted and damaged a large number of Banana, Coconut and Cadju trees. A herd which rampaged Amunugama village had damaged the walls of a house and feasted on a bag of rice found inside the house.
Residents said that even though the wild life department had erected an electrified fence around Ambanpola division to ward off elephants, the fence had been broken at several points. Residents said they protected their meager food and other assets with great trouble during the prolonged drought. When the wilted banana and coconut trees got re-energised with the onset of rains, it was catastrophic to see them devastated by rampaging elephants. They said the dearth of Hakka Patas and other explosives also was a factor which stifled their efforts to drive away marauding elephants.

Windies call up Ambris for New Zealand tour
St. John's: West Indies called up uncapped Sunil Ambris for their two-Test series against New Zealand in place of Kyle Hope who was dropped from the squad which defeated Zimbabwe earlier this month.
Hope had innings of 16 and 43 in the first Test win over Zimbabwe but managed just one in the laboured second Test draw in Bulawayo.
Ambris, 24, has yet to play Test cricket and has made just one appearance for the ODI side.
"Sunil has replaced Kyle Hope in the squad, and this is on the basis of his consistent performances across formats and his outstanding returns for the Windies A Team," said West Indies chief of selectors Courtney Browne.
"Kyle is encouraged to return to the first-class championship and turn in the strong performances his talent suggests he can deliver."
West Indies will face New Zealand in Wellington from December 1-5 and at Hamilton from December 9-13. AFP

Chowdhury has also had solo exhibitions at Gajah Gallery, Singapore; Gallerie Foundation for Indian Artists, Amsterdam; and the Fine Art Resource, Berlin.
In 1966, Chowdhury was awarded the Prix le France de la Jeune Peinture in Paris and in 1986, received an award at the Second Biennale of Havana, Cuba.
