Lanka must lobby to defend WTOs  Dispute Settlement Mechanism
Sri Lanka must provide robust defence of the multilateral trading system opined Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, the Chair of the Global Economy Programme at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI).
In a post in their website in view of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ongoing 11th Ministerial Conference in Argentina he stressed that Sri Lanka must lobby other governments to ensure a robust defence of the WTOs Dispute Settlement Mechanism( DSM) in Buenos Aires, while putting its support behind sensible reforms to moderate the US position.
As a small open economy, Sri Lanka benefits significantly from being able to engage with economies many times its size on an equal basis through the WTO. This is one important reason why Sri Lanka was a founding member of the WTO in 1995.
Whats more, Sri Lanka is pursuing several free trade agreements (FTA) with China, India and Singapore and may have to use the DSM to resolve future disputes with FTA partners.
E-commerce also has substantial economic potential for Sri Lanka as the world economy transits to the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (based on digitisation and artificial intelligence). The IT sector in Sri Lanka already employs around 85,000 people and generated export revenue of $900 million last year.
However, discussions of international trade rules remain in their infancy. There is little agreement on what exactly constitutes e-commerce, and several developing economies have voiced concerns about whether they have much to gain from an agreement when they have limited access to technology.
Broadband costs in many developing economies are also high relative to advanced economies. As such, e-commerce seems more likely to be a prime candidate for a plurilateral or sector-specific agreement among like-minded economies in the future rather than a full-scale multilateral deal in Buenos Aires.

Around 20,000 cancer patients annually - Rajitha
Annually about 20,000 new cancer patients are reported from Sri Lanka.There are about 50 oncologists in the country and it is required to double this number, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the Annual Academic Sessions 2017 of the Sri Lanka Collage of Oncologists held in Colombo recently, he said that the Sri Lankan men suffer from oral, lung and oesophagus cancers while Sri Lankan women suffer from breast, cervical and ovarian cancers. Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) is a major challenge faced by the Sri Lankan health sector.
Smoking is the leading cause for oral and lung cancer in men and therefore the tax on tobacco was increased by 90 percent. Pictorial warning of 80 percent for cigarette packets was also implemented with the same intention. Cancer treatment has been modernized and expanded, he said.
The Rs. 1.5 million limit for cancer drugs for the treatment expenses of patients was lifted, and now there is no limit for the expenses for cancer patient's drugs. Cancer screening should be done from house to house. All Asian countries should fight against cancer together, he added.

Sydney: Raelene Castle shattered the glass ceiling Tuesday by becoming Rugby Australia's new chief executive, making her the first woman to oversee the sport anywhere in the world. She takes over from Bill Pulver, who quit in the fallout from Western Force being axed from Super Rugby.
Castle, a former boss of Netball New Zealand, has been tasked with unifying the sport after the protracted and acrimonious Super Rugby saga.
She beat more than 200 candidates, including highly-fancied former Wallabies captain Phil Kearns.
"Raelene is an extremely impressive executive who covered every base as far as what the board was looking for in a chief executive officer to lead our game into an important new chapter," said Rugby Australia chairman Cameron Clyne.
"She offers an incredible wealth of experience in sports administration and business, with an outstanding track record in commercial, marketing and communications roles."

Cabinet committee to study rail workers woes
A four member Cabinet subcommittee was appointed yesterday to look into the demands made by striking railway trade unions.
The Ministerial subcommittee is chaired by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama. The other members appointed to the subcommittee are Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
Minister Dr. Amunugama told the Daily News that the subcommittee has already sought out a date to discuss on the matter with the strikers. Railways General Manager S.S. Abeywickrama told the Daily News that workers of seven trade unions have reported to work by yesterday and five more trade unions are yet to report to work.
The GM believes that the strikers should report to work since a Cabinet subcommittee was appointed to look into their salary anomalies and other issues.
Now that a subcommittee was appointed, they should report back to work. I think the workers who are striking are not really aware of the fact that the government is already looking into the matter.
Then there is the gazette notification which declared the railway service as an essential service. We cannot take strict action against those workers who are not well informed or made aware of the situation, Abeywickrama said. A contingency plan was arranged yesterday by the Transport Ministry to provide transport services for students sitting the GCE Ordinary Level Examination inconvenienced by the train strike continued by the trade unions for the seventh day yesterday.
The numbers of train journeys had increased to 40 by yesterday, Transport Ministry media spokesman Viraj Abeysinghe said in a press statement. It said that express trains will be operating as semi-express to facilitate students sitting for the O/L examination as well. Three trains from Polgahawela, two from Aluthgama and short distance trains from Panadura and Ragama bound for Fort Railway station were available to students.
The Sri Lanka Transport Board had allocated 1,000 buses, 60 luxury buses and 650 school buses to the service from yesterday as well.
The National Transport Commission has also allowed permission to any bus that has licence from the Commission to provide services in any route. It has also allowed using railway tickets in private buses as well. The Railway Department also said that 15 trains reached the Fort Railway Station by 9.00 a.m. in the morning yesterday and that the Kankesanthurai - Mount Lavinia Intercity Train was also in operation.

## Title: Can shippers benefit from liberalization  through low freight rates
## Supertitle:

Can shippers benefit from liberalization  through low freight rates
Reading a few articles written in the last few weeks on how liberalization will bring down the freight rates benefiting the exporter, I was rather surprised about the little knowledge the authors of these articles possess about shipping and logistics. It is evident that whoever pushes for liberalization is misguiding both regulators and the general public by providing wrong information.
Freight rate is the income of shipping lines and ship owners and is determined by cost and commercial considerations. Freight rates are fetched globally based on demand and supply for cargo between destinations and largely on the ship owner's cost structure.
They are based on various factors such as distance between two ports, size and costs of the vessel, crew costs and insurance and bunker costs. Port cost also form a large part of the ship owner's cost structure. The agency cost for a shipping line is insignificant and is not a determining factor for freight rates and even if the foreign lines had their own office in Sri Lanka, they would still have to bear the cost of performing the agency function and hence not have a huge cost saving which can be passed to exporters and importers.
The global marketplace has seen a severe decline in freight rates over the last few years due to oversupply of large container vessels. However, prices have become stagnant as a result of shipping lines controlling supply through measures such as scrapping. Apart from this, world oil prices will also play an important role in freight rates.
Theres a myth among many Sri Lankans that agency offices decide freight rates and therefore a Sri Lankan cartel decides the price shippers have to pay. This argument itself shows the ignorance of the so called experts. Shipping agencies DO NOT decide the freight rates.
The Principals decide the freight rate based on the dynamics which I have mentioned above. However all this time, Sri Lankan agencies have played an active role in negotiating better rates with Principals on behalf of the shippers. Especially when the Principals were not allowed to recover THC (terminal handling charges) from shippers, many Principals started losing interest in Colombo and the agencies had to fight hard to retain this business in Colombo. In fact, it is the freight forwarders who mark up the freight which is quoted by shipping agencies.
However, in the future, if we pave way to full liberalization these Principals will take full control of pricing and reintroduce cost recoveries such as THC which will affect our importers and exporters adversely. If any shipping line says that they can lower the freight cost if trade is liberalized, we need to ask them why they cant reduce the rates now as they already control the prices.
We should also ask the percentage in which they could reduce the rates. Currently they are not reducing rates as they prefer to cater to markets which derive a higher revenue rather than Sri Lanka which places constraints on their cost recovery.
Currently we can see many shipping lines forming mergers so that in the future the number of players in the industry will be much less and its a continuous battle for survival.
Collaboration and mergers are therefore a global phenomenon which can be seen in the local market as well. If we do not strengthen our local agencies, these global lines will start controlling prices which will adversely affect our economy and there will be no local interest in these negotiations.
Besides, after controlling prices and recovering the total costs from our locals they would happily repatriate all profits without investing a cent in Sri Lanka. As usual we will be sitting here wondering what happened. Shippers should be aware that they are being used by a few interested parties with personal agendas and incorrect justifications.

Central Bank holds international research confab on macroeconomic reforms
The 10th International Research Conference of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was held on December 8 at the Bank's John Exter International Conference Hall.
The conference was organised under the theme Macroeconomic Policy Reforms towards a Vibrant Future with the aim of encouraging innovative theoretical and empirical research on current macroeconomic policy issues, while providing a platform for researchers from policy making and academic institutions to share their experiences and views from diverse perspectives.
As in the past, the International Research Conference attracted eminent researchers from renowned universities, research institutions and central banks around the world.
This years conference featured a keynote speech by Prof. Keith Houghton, Emeritus Professor of the Australian National University (ANU), who has been an influential figure in the Australian academia.
Delivering the keynote speech, Prof. Houghton said that public expenditure needs to be driven with the objective of providing value for money for the taxpayer. He said that public spending on government universities should be efficiently allocated using innovative evidence-based techniques.
The inaugural address of the conference was delivered by Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank. Addressing the gathering, the Governor said the importance of developing robust frameworks for macroeconomic policy formulation in Sri Lanka and institutionalising those frameworks through legislative enactments.
He emphasised the importance of revenue-based fiscal consolidation and the process of transitioning to a flexible inflation targeting framework and highlighted the importance of the Central Bank's independence and accountability.
He also acknowledged the importance of maintaining a flexible exchange rate to strengthen external resilience and the need for public liability management to achieve debt sustainability.
The Governor also highlighted that not only strong macroeconomic fundamentals but also structural reforms are essential for sustained economic growth and employment generation.
The two technical sessions of the conference were chaired by S Gunaratne and H A Karunaratne, Assistant Governors of the Central Bank. The technical sessions included eight research papers on macroeconomic issues and financial sector issues presented by researchers from Australia, France, Germany, India and Sri Lanka, including researchers from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
These research papers were selected by an eminent external panel of reviewers from local and international universities, the International Monetary Fund, the SEACEN centre and other reputed research institutions of the country.
The Dr. D S Wijesinghe Memorial Award for the Best Research Paper was awarded to Harsha Paranavithana of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka/University of Western Australia, for the paper titled The Transition from Exchange Rate Targeting: The Case of Sri Lanka.

Chinas strong growth seen in imports
Chinas imports jumped 20.9 percent year-on-year to 11.29 trillion yuan ($1.71 trillion) during the first 11 months of the year, on the back of strong domestic demand for commodities, electrical and mechanical products, the General Administration of Customs said on Friday.
The country purchased 991 million metric tons of iron ore, 386 million metric tons of crude oil and 60.7 million metric tons of natural gas from the global markets during the period, up 6 percent, 12 percent and 26.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
Gao Peiyong, director of the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said the import scenario remains promising as demand for and prices of big commodities have been rising. It also showed that the recovery in the domestic market has remained stable.
Eager to support its ongoing industrial upgrading boom, China also imported 5.22 trillion yuan worth of mechanical and electrical products, up 14.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, including 1.13 million units of vehicles.
Chinas foreign trade volume rose 15.6 percent year-on-year to 25.14 trillion yuan between January and November of 2017, while exports increased 11.6 percent to 13.85 trillion yuan. The trade surplus shrank 16.7 percent to 2.56 trillion yuan during the same period.
Both the trade volume and the share of private enterprises increased, as their combined volume rose 16.9 percent year-on-year and accounted for 38.5 percent of the total, larger than the share for the same period of 2016.
Many opportunities also arose from the countrys growing demand for consumption-related products and services, diversified market channels created by the Belt and Road Initiative and free trade deals with partner countries, as well as the hunger for more homemade sophisticated industrial products, said Gao Feng, the Ministry of Commerce spokesman.
He said cultivating new growth points via technology upgrades, high-end foreign machinery imports and investment has become integral for China to boost its economy.
Despite rising protectionism and anti-globalization sentiment, Chinas imports and exports with its major trade partners remained strong.
The countrys trade volume with traditional markets including European Union, the United States, Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, saw 16.2 percent, 16.5 percent, 13.8 percent and 18.4 percent growth on a yearly basis.
Eager to accelerate the pace of opening-up and boosting global trade, China will hold its first international import expo in Shanghai in November next year, as well as continue to optimize its range of products and approach to the global market through new trade routes and regional cooperation arrangements.
As part of its efforts to enhance its trade ability with other partners, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that China and Canada have nearly completed the feasibility studies for a free-trade agreement after more than a year of talks.
China has so far inked 15 free trade agreements with 23 countries and regions.

China donates 1,000 tons of rice for drought victims
Sri Lanka on Monday, received the second consignment of 1,000 tons of rice from China, to be distributed to the drought-struck victims in the country.
At the request of the Sri Lankan government, China has agreed to donate 2,752 tons of rice for humanitarian emergency relief. The first consignment of 1,000 tons of rice arrived in Sri Lanka in November while the second consignment arrived on Monday.
Officials said the third and final consignment with the remaining 752 tons would reach Colombo before the end of December. The consignment was accepted by officials at the Disaster Management Ministry in Colombo.
Speaking at the handover ceremony, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said Sri Lanka had this year experienced the worst drought in recent years with over 1 million people affected in 11 districts.
Most of the lands affected were agricultural lands which could not continue to be used for agricultural purposes.
He said China had been prompt in helping Sri Lanka and this donation further strengthened the strong ties between the two countries.
Sri Lanka has been suffering one of its worst droughts in 40 years due to a delay in monsoonal rains.

The President of the Sri Lanka  China Friendship Association, Ananda Goonatilleke, warmly welcomed to Sri Lanka the visiting Chinese delegation headed by Deputy Minister Wang Yajun, a high ranking personality of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
Vice Minister Wang arrived in Sri Lanka to deliver a thematic briefing at the BMICH today, on the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which concluded on October 24 this year. During the past few days he also visited Bangladesh and Pakistan where he made presentations on the importance of the recent CPC Congress.
As the people and the intelligentsia of Sri Lanka are very keen to understand the latest political developments in China, this briefing would definitely be timely. The nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of China, demarcated principles and guidelines for the next five years and hailed General Secretary Xi Jinpings thoughts on Socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
The Report of the Congress ensures the international community that no matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony and engage in expansion.
Wang Yajun, comparatively a younger leader who is 49 this December, served as a leading diplomat in Belgium, France, European Union, and held several high positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was also the Director General of the Policy Research Bureau of Foreign Affairs Office of the Party Central Committee.

Be emphatic, strikers!
It is a common culture in Sri Lanka that the employees of departments, corporations and other government and private institutions use the monster weapon of the strike to resolve their issues. This is not a healthy and acceptable culture because in each and every activity of strikers the innocent general public will become the scapegoat.
The present railway strike has severely affected the public especially the daily railway commuters. There are two main modes of transport in Sri Lanka, the bus and the railway transport that is not even to the satisfaction of passengers. The thousands of commuters who completely depend on the railway transport underwent untold hardships and inconvenience during the last three days strike in the country. The commuters had to use the bus transport as an alternative option for their present crisis. The real problem arises here is the SLTB along with private bus service cannot accommodate both the bus passengers and railway commuters at a time.
As a result, all the buses became jam-packed and overcrowded paved the way for accidents and unpleasant incidents for the travellers. Besides the officers and students who used to travel on warrant season tickets left helpless and there were thousands of tourists who came here to spend their holidays stranded at the railway station without a proper solution. There were loads of essential goods to be sent through the railway transport stored in the stores of the railway stations without any preservative arrangements.
Moreover, the GCE O/L exam is now taking place. This railway strike probably will have a psychological effect on students to make them think whether there will be enough transport for them to reach the exam hall on time, subsequently this dismay about the transport may hamper their performance at their exams. In the meantime, the teachers who are supposed to perform their exam duty also will get affected by this strike. This strike will also create conflict between the employers and employees because no employer will entertain their workers late arrival to work and offices were compelled take leave because of the strike. In the meantime, the government has already declared the railway service as essential service in the country but the workers still continuing with their strikes whereas the Minister of Transport has stated those who are away from work these days will be considered as vacated their posts. How far these statements going to help and console the minds of people who are facing numerable problems due to this inhuman and unscrupulous strike. The strike has severely affected the women workers a lot, when a woman misses her train she will have to wait for a bus for a long time, especially in the late evening the situation is worse because the robbers who are hanging around the bus stations will probably attack them or rob their money and valuable things. The same thing will happen to the tourists which will bring discredit to country and people as well.
We Sri Lankans never think about others inconvenience and loses to people and the government due to this strike. When we compare our country with western countries it is quite different in the sense the strikers in the western countries protest against the government to fulfil their demands in a manner the strike affects neither people nor the government. Although we are given permission to protest against the government for our rights, there is a limit to it.
We Sri Lankans abuse and overuse our democratic freedom to a certain extent. One mans freedom cannot be depriving another mans rights. First of all, we should do our duties and know our responsibilities. Thats why one of the former presidents of America John F Kennedy once advised his countrymen like this: dont ask what the country has done for you, ask yourself what you have done for your country. This thought-provoking verses quite applicable to our country. We must not misuse our freedom for our personal gains. Strikes and protests should have a limit in our country in order to restore democracy in the country. In the meantime government also one reason for this strike, they should have started early negotiation with the strikers so as to prevent the strike.

Coming out of a rut
It is not the first time that the Sri Lankan cricket team has fallen into a rut and then emerged from it strong and confident to give other nations a good run for their money. The Himalayan mountain serving as the backdrop in Dharamsala provided the ideal setting for Sri Lanka to end their 12-match losing streak in One-Day Internationals when they pulled off a comprehensive seven-wicket win over India to go one-up in the three-match series.
Twenty seventeen has not been a good year for Sri Lanka and quite so because their team rebuilding process ran into a road block that comprised shocking selections to satisfy the whims and fancies of certain top officials of Sri Lanka Cricket, injuries and poor physical fitness  all of which contributed to the losses.
Prior to the first ODI against India on Sunday, Sri Lanka had just four wins from 26 matches against 21 losses. The 21 losses included a streak of 12 consecutive defeats for 2017 that fell three short of their record run which is 14 from January 11, 1987 to January 10, 1988.
During this period Sri Lanka also had another unique and comical record because the ODI team was led by no less than four captains  Angelo Mathews, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera and Lasith Malinga. One can imagine how anyone can sit down and plan out strategies against the opposition when there is such a constant change of captains.
With a new selection committee in place headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy the changes brought about by them basing selections largely on consistency has to some extent started to bear results.
In Tests after being routed 3-0 at home by India, Sri Lanka performed much better in India cutting down on the losing deficit to just 1-0 when the detractors were looking forward to another 3-0 drubbing. The final last Test played at Delhi brought out the best of Sri Lankan cricket to fight till the end and to never give up. That they came out with an honourable draw denying India a win was in itself a morale victory that was to some extent carried onto the first ODI played at Dharamsala where under a new captain  the fifth for the year Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka finally brought to an end their 12-match losing streak.
From the way the players trained and the amount of workload put in by the support staff to uplift the fortunes of the team had to bear fruit at some point of time. It all came together at Dharamsala, much to the relief of the team and everyone connected to cricket including the ardent fans who brave the vagaries of the weather in the open stands just to cheer our cricketers.
What a great feeling it would have been in the Sri Lankan camp when Angelo Mathews drove Indian fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar past mid-off for a four to signal a seven-wicket win and bring to an end the dry spell. Mathews had gone through some hardships first as captain and then as a player fighting off injuries and form but when he scored the winning runs there was hardly any reaction from the former captain or his partner Niroshan Dickwella, just a smile of satisfaction that the losing streak had finally ended. Mathew not only had the honour of making the winning hit but also picked up the first Indian wicket that started their batting collapse. At one time Sri Lanka had India reeling at 29-7 and in danger of being dismissed for their lowest ever ODI total  54 which was also against Sri Lanka at Sharjah in the Coca Cola Champions Trophy final in 2000.
However India was denied that embarrassment by Mahendra Singh Dhoni who has been a thorn in the Sri Lankan side denying them of many victories in the recent past with his unique batting skills and tenacity. Dhoni on this occasion could not bring victory to India but he at least ensured they reached a decent total  112, which in the circumstances they were placed at one stage looked a huge contribution. Dhoni scored a fighting 65 off 87 balls but unlike on previous occasions he could not find a partner to stay long enough with him to take the game away from Sri Lanka.
Credit to the new captain Perera for having the common sense to bowl out Suranga Lakmal his full quota of ten overs in one spell. Seldom do captains take that gamble always holding back their best bowlers for the slog overs. Lakmal was on song as he used the conditions to the maximum to wreck Indias top and middle-order batting that was sans their captain Virat Kohli to finish with a career best 4/13 off 10 overs and win his first Man of the Match award.
Sri Lankas win meant that India will not end 2017 as the number one ODI side, to achieve that they needed to win the series 3-0. In the meantime Sri Lanka with the confidence gained from their victory will be looking to wrap up the series with a win in the second ODI at Mohali today.

Dance girls in the eyes  of foreigners
Performing and practising dance in Indian Hindu temples was a part of Indian life. Historical evidence and accounts of numerous foreign travellers who visited India in various periods had given valuable information regarding the practice of dance in temples. The practice of Devadasis dancing started at temples in India mainly to entertain the deity of the temples.
The dancing at the temples started from time immemorial. According to Padma Puranam which was believed to have been written in the 4th century AD, anyone who offers a beautiful woman to dance will go to heaven. The Chola period was considered as the golden era of Tamil culture and literature. The Chola kings made a tremendous contribution to the development of art and culture. They employed dancing girls in the temples to serve in the temple rituals, poojas and festivals.
Young slaves
A French traveller named Travenier who visited India during the 17th century said courtesans bought young slaves to whom they taught dance and music. The girls were between the age of 11 and 12 years. Their mistresses sent them to the temples with the belief that it would bring fortune.
In the 13th century, Marco Polo who visited India wrote that for the male and female idols the people offered their daughters to dance and sing to cheer the idols. The Portuguese traveller Domingo Paes who visited India in the 16th century said in temples they fed the idols with food while women danced.
In the 17th century, Fray Marique wrote about the car festival of the Durga pooja of West Bengal where the dancers danced in front of the car.
The famous historian Ferista indicates that when Sultan Alauddin Bahmani conquered certain parts of Karnataka he also captured certain temple dancers.
One writer had written during the period of temple festivals in north India that girls danced at temples. One of the reports of Madras Music Academy indicated that daily worship of the temples was performed with Natyam.
Assam Devadasis
In Orissa, Devadasis were known as Maharis attached to Vaishnava and Saiva temples. In Tamil Nadu, temple dancers danced in Saiva and Vaishnava temples with the same enthusiasm. For instance, in Sri Rangam and in Rameshwaram temples we can find such evidence. Assam Devadasis were known as Natis. In Maharashtra, dancing girls were known as Murlis. In Tamil Nadu temple dancers and Devadasis were called by several names like Devaradiyarkal and Thaliyeyalallarkal.
There is evidence that many temple dancers danced in the festival processions. For instance, during the Tirupathi car festivals, dance girls danced in front of the car. The girls were selected from the crowd by the Brahmins. The temples generally maintained the records of the numbers of the dancers of the temples.
The evidence revealed that the Suchindram temple in Kerala had dancers. And the temple followed many customs practised in Tamil Nadu. According to Abbe Dubois, the 19th-century scholar, every temple had a minimum 8 to 12 dancing girls.
Yet another writer wrote that some large temples like Kanchipuram had more than 100 dancing girls. Abbe Dubois mentioned that singing and dancing twice a day in the temple were important functions. In some temples, the best dancers were selected to dance before the chief idol.
Later this function had become a hereditary right of the dancers. The Godwari district report provided that the funeral pyre of each dancer was lighted with the fire brought from the temple. Legally dance was banned in temples during the British era in India. But this tradition was followed and practised in Pudukkatai. Some Devadasis danced till old age. One Devadasi named Kamakshi of Tanjore danced till she turned 75. Hence the bond between the dancers and temples was an integral part of the Indian culture.

Family remains untouched by PM Narendra Modis rise
Around mid-day, 75-year-old Sombhai Modi blows the conch shell at the newly-constructed Sirdi Sai temple in an old age home run by the Sarvodaya Sewa Trust headed by him. The compound recently acquired gates but there is nothing to detract from the relative obscurity and ordinariness that marks the aarti and other rituals that are part of the daily routine at the ashram.
Sombhai's younger brother Narendra Modi's rise to the prime ministership has not changed things at the Vadnagar ashram where Sombhai has lived since the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Modi became chief minister later that year, launching him on a journey that took him to the PM's post, but Sombhai's life remains unchanged as he tends to the elderly and organises blood donation and healthcare camps.
The PM's first cousin Ashokbhai Modi with his wife Vimlaben and their daughter.
Unlike the more common trend of relatives gaining in affluence and influence, Sombhai objects to being called the prime minister's brother and feels comfortable with the lack of attention. Despite repeated requests, Sombhai refuses an interview, saying, It kills the purpose of not using the position of my younger brother.
He adds, There are several people running old age homes like me but you chose to interview me simply because I am Narendra Modi's brother. It encourages dynasty, and may be, relatives and other acquaintances will try to influence people and misuse the power.
Sombhai suggests a visit to Vadnagar town, which has witnessed changes recently with the construction of a new railway station, the one where Modi used to sell tea at an outlet run by his father Damodardas Modi.
Sombhai is not an exception. The Modi clan, descendants of Moolchand Mangilal Modi, Narendra Modi's grandfather, are quite widely spread out. Most lead relatively unremarkable lives. In the time Modi became CM in 2001 and PM in 2014, his extended family remains much the same.
Modi's first cousin Ashokbhai cooks meals at a sevashram in Vadnagar. Ashokbhai cooks khichdi and his wife Vimlaben Modi washes utensils. The couple earns Rs 4,000-5,000 a month to take care of three daughters and a son. In the festival season, he sells kites, firecrackers and puts up stalls at nearby fairs. I wish Narendrabhai attends my daughters wedding, says Ashokbhai, who is considerably younger to the PM.
With assembly polls approaching, most family members are cautious, avoiding media glare. One of them says, Why do we need to even prove that we have no political dreams. We want to live like 125 crore Indians and gain in life through hard work.
Modi's younger sister Vasantiben and her husband Hansmukhbhai Modi, who retired from LIC, live in a row house at Vishnagar, some 90 km from Ahmedabad.
The Modi family's modest means plays a key role in BJP's aggressive attacks on rivals for promoting dynasts as leaders. Rahul Gandhi is the prime target as was Akhilesh Yadav in the UP elections. BJP's slogan of politics of performance is buttressed by the lack of change in the Modi family's fortunes.
Modi's youngest brother Pankajbhai, an officer with the state information department, is the most well known, thanks to mother Heeraben staying with him in his three-room house in Ahmedabad. Modi visits on occasions, including his birthday to take his mother's blessings.
Another older brother, Amrutbhai, retired from a private company as a fitter in 2005. He settled in Ghatlodia Colony in Ahmedabad.
His family's austerity has helped Modi avoid being tagged for nepotism though some family members rue that the PM should attend a family dinner. That does not seem very likely though. - TIMES OF INDIA

Follow the  rhythm of heart
Bound to the grace of hypnotizing sound-waves, many a heart beat together on a night so remarkable whenRhythm of HeartSahakampana music CD was launched recently at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Colombo 07.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who was to grace the event as the chief guest, could not participate due to unavoidable circumstances.
Rhythm of Heart  Sahakampanawas composed under the guidance of Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, S. B. Nawinna and the Deputy Minister, Palitha Thevarapperuma. And the project received the consultancy of Secretary of Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, D. Swarnapala. The music album, a composition by those who are differently abled but with talents beyond measure, was launched in collaboration with the State Arts Festival for the persons with special requirements, 2017.
Rhythm of heart  Sahakampana was brought to life with the voices and words of 22 young artists who also contributed to the endeavor by adorning most of the songs with their own tunes.
Graduates and individuals who have studied music in depth are among the artists, said Anusha Gokula, director of the Department of Cultural Affairs.
Through this endeavor, we intend to bring the community of differently abled persons to an equal level with the rest of the society, Gokula said further. We intend to make their talents known nationally and even internationally.
Gokula also added that the Department of Cultural Affairs expects to hold music concerts island-wide, bringing the endeavor to a further step.
Tremendous artists
Most of the songs in Sahakampana are based on the writers own personal experiences, said artist Buddhadasa Galappaththi who contributed to the project as a part of the panel of judges who selected 14 songs for the album out of numerous lyrical confessions.
Most of the songs are woven around the subject of love, he said further.But there are also instances when the writer looks at certain social phenomena with satire. Through their lyrics, the writer plays the role of social observer and thus, gives life to creations with a social conscience.
These songs contain more beauty, enchantment and love than the lyrics that come with modern music where most of the based concepts are meaningless, Galappaththi added.
And converging love into words is something that one can never quite accomplish.
But a creative writer has the ability to explore the same subject without losing its artistic essence.
These young artists have capabilities beyond our own, he remarked. Their creations are wonderful and full of meaning.
Along with Galappaththi, judges Yamuna Malini and Dammika Pathiraja also contributed to the process of selecting the best lyrics.
This is a new experience to me, said artist Janaka Fonseka, music director of Sahakampana and consultant of State Music Ensemble which provided music for the album. I have no words to describe the support the singers provided to make this endeavor possible.
The reason behind the success of Sahakampana is the dedicated support given by all the artists, he added. There were nights when we worked till the breaking of dawn and the work was enjoyable all throughout.
Sarath Fernando, Asoka Indunil and Dammika Pathiraja also were in the panel of judges who selected the best vocals for the album.
Unforgettable night
I am really happy about the success of Sahakampana, said Maduranga Jayarathne, one of the singers who contributed to the project. This is the first opportunity I received to sing for an album and I am really thankful.To Pradeep Sanjeewa, it was an unforgettable night. I feel genuinely happy about the opportunity I was given, I have no words to express it,he said. I am thankful for everyone who made this possible, said Dinesh Premakumara. I hope we all can move onwards as children of one family. We belong to one Mother, so, lets work together and go a long way forward. Yes, indeed, we all belong to one Mother. And we all know that the word differently-abled should arouse nothing but a sense of kinship in our hearts. And our fast-paced society would be more complete and would achieve greater victories if we proceeded together, for each and every one of us is able of something beautiful.

Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka builds lives of local dairy farmers
Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka, the company behind 'Anchor', has been working closely with a network of Sri Lankan dairy farmers for the past 20 years, supporting and empowering their entrepreneurial spirit.
One such dairy farmer who has championed her own potential over the years as a successful entrepreneur is Anusha Rathnayake from Doluwa, wife to an army soldier and mother of two boys aged nine and two.
After I got married, it was important to find a job to help cover daily expenses because my husband was working in Colombo. I decided to start a small-scale dairy farm which was successful and have since been able to expand my business and earning by selling milk, said a proud Anusha.
The first farm went through a temporary hiatus after the birth of Anushas second son as she was unable to manage all duties. She restarted work on the farm a few years later when caring for him became less intensive, but the second time around she wanted to do things differently.
Before resuming the farm I met and received advice from a Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka Supplier Relationship Officer at the companys local Milk Collection Centre, she said.
Anusha was taught the proper daily concentrate of nutrition for the cows and the benefits of letting the animals graze in the open field instead of being tied up. She was also introduced to the correct milking process to help her increase the quality, value and shelf life of the milk she produces.
It was then that I was made aware of how Fonterra sources milk from local smallholder dairy farmers for their Anchor Newdale yoghurt and liquid milk production. This is an immense benefit for us local dairy farmers because with Fonterra, we are able to sell our milk consistently at a fair and profitable price. With this kind of support, Im proud to say I was able to become the most successful dairy farmer in my area, said Anusha.
With an early start at 6 am each morning when milking begins, Anushas two milking cows produce on average 15-20 litres of milk per day. By 7 am, she then proceeds to other dairy farms in the area for her milk collection duties. Having started out by collecting 40 litres a day, Anusha has now increased her daily collection to 90 litres per day thanks to the efforts made in increasing the productivity of her own farm as well as expanding her milk collection network.
Today whilst being a successful smallholder dairy farmer, she has big goals in aspiring to upgrade to being a large-scale dairy entrepreneur by improving her collection network to achieve 300 litres of liquid milk a day.
It is not just about her farm work that has helped Anusha get to where she is today; she is also very focused on the business side of things. One of the most important aspects is making sure she manages her income efficiently, dividing her earnings between her childrens education and the daily expenses; reinvesting the remaining income in her farm to develop it even further.
At 30, Anusha is one of the most successful and inspiring dairy entrepreneurs in Doluwa. She is held in high regard among her fellow dairy farmers and is a true legend of the soil in her own right.

Geopolitics and Security, the view from South Asia
The following is a lecture delivered by the Director General of the Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka, Asanga Abeygoonasekera at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.
It is indeed a privilege to speak on the topic of geopolitics at the prestigious LKY School named after Lee Kuan Yew who is considered a guru of geopolitics and also called the Kissinger of the orient. According to Dr. S. Jaishankar after being a driver of development and serving as an example for the continent, Lee Kuan Yew evolved in the eyes of the world to be sort of a geopolitical guru, guiding Asia and explaining the continent to the rest of the world.
The great game in the Indian Ocean
According to Harsh V. Pant, The Great Game of this century will be played on the waters of the Indian Ocean. Though Indias location gives it great operational advantages in the IOR, it is by no means certain that New Delhi is in a position to hold on to its geographical advantages. China is rapidly catching up and its ties with Sri Lanka, are aimed at expanding its profile in this crucial part of the world. Indian policymakers realize that unless they are more proactive they might end up losing this game for good. Colombo matters because the Indian Ocean matters
Former Secretary of State John Kerrys report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009, urges the US government to forge closer ties with Sri Lanka to prevent it from drifting into the Chinese orbit. Fast forward to this year, a visit by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs - Alice Wells - to Sri Lanka, in September 2017, saw her tout the Trump foreign policy that: the US was seriously concerned over the unsustainable debt burden on Sri Lanka due to non-concessional loans from China.
According to Robert Kaplan, Sri Lanka is a geostrategic hub. He considers Sri Lanka part of the new [maritime] geography. He also explains the geo-political symbolism of Sri Lankas location. Its part of Chinas plan to construct a string of pearls  ports that they dont own, but which they could use for their warships across the Indian Ocean. In this regard, Hambantota Port is centre stage due to its geographical position and its Chinese-led development. Situated at the southern tip of Sri Lanka, Hambantota is adjacent to the busiest shipping lanes of the world.
Most western scholars alike see Chinas posturing in the IOR for military strategic reasons. However, Sri Lanka and China continue to emphasize the fact that the Sino-Lankan partnership is for economic reasons and not for military reasons. Currently, not many ships dock at Hambantota, the Chinese built port in the South of Sri Lanka and it is not as busy a harbour as the Colombo Port. Yet, this position will change with the development of the Gwadar Port and CPEC in full operation.
Sri Lankas Geographical position
The Indian Ocean covers approximately 20 percent of the water of the earths surface - 70,560,000 sqkm. The IOR is surrounded by the land masses of Asia, Africa and Australia and Antarctica. The Indian Ocean is named after the Indian subcontinent and has several choke points such as the Bab-el-Mandeb, the Strait of Hormuz, the Lombok Strait, the Strait of Malacca and the Palk Strait.
14.6 percent of the worlds fish stock is caught in this region, according to the FAO. Around 36 million barrels per day - equivalent to about 40 per cent of the worlds oil supply and 64 per cent of oil trade - travel through the entry ways into and out of the Indian Ocean, including some of the aforementioned straits.
The land masses surrounding the region are densely populated with over 2 billion people.
Many Sri Lankan governments from time to time promote Sri Lanka as a hub. Actually this is not necessary, since we are already a hub geographically from ancient times.
In ancient libraries of Alexandria, the island was called Taprobane, mapped in an oversized proportion by Ptolemy, the Greek-Egyptian cartographer. Sri Lanka was elongated on Ptolemys map due to its rich civilization and trade relations with the rest of the world.
After the discovery and mapping of the Cape of Good Hope and the subsequent discovery of the Indian Ocean, Henricus Martelluss world map (c.1489) also clearly depicts Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka could be defined as Sir Halford Mackinders outer crescent touching the rim land. Two other nations which have similar geographical positioning are the islands of Britain and Japan, having access to the Atlantic and to the Pacific oceans respectively, close to the continent, but separated by the ocean.
Since Mackinders land-based-pivot-area strategy, the pivot area has veered towards having control of the oceans. In the same vein, Alfred Mahans statement that whoever controls the Indian Ocean will dominate Asia, the destiny of the world will be decided on its waters, has never been more apparent.
Chinese Sphere of influence in IOR - Sino-Lankan Relations
The Sino-Lankan relationship is one that dates back to the Chinese mariner - Zheng His visit to Sri Lanka in 1405, a century prior to Vasco Da Gamas visit to this region in 1498. This confirms the Chinese interest in the IOR and Sri Lanka in particular, before the colonial period. The Sino-Lankan relationship has moved to a strategic relationship after the visit of President Xi and the resurrection of the One Belt One Road initiative.
Today, China is Sri Lankas second largest trading partner, surpassing the US and just behind India. Sino-Lankan trade remains at more than US $ 3 billion. Our economic partnership will only grow with the Chinese economic zone and Hambantota Port in full operation. By 2025, China will become Sri Lankas largest trading partner due to the significant investments in the island as well as in the region.
Nevertheless, caution is being touted that, Sri Lanka will not have the negotiation capacity and the economic strength to deter China when it wants a military base in the future. The foreign policy of the Sri Lankan government is explicitly clear in the face of such conjectures: The Sri Lankan Government does not make its bases available to foreign forces.
Its also important to consider Chinas geo-strategic disadvantages in the Indian Ocean when examining this point. According to Dr. David Brewster, Chinas strategic vulnerability is reinforced by the scarcity of overland transport connections between Chinese territory and the Indian Ocean. He further states that China currently has no ability to exert control over the choke points nor has it any regular naval presence in any of the IOR ports.
Chinas presence on Land and Sea
According to Abhijit Singh, Despite denials by their regional leaders, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh are poised to witness a substantial expansion of Chinas maritime footprint. The expansion of PLA Navy submarine activity in South Asia is quite in keeping with a powerful navys need to familiarise itself with alien operating conditions. The pattern of Chinese submarine visits reveals that the PLA Navy has been incrementally raising the complexity of its deployments, sending both conventional and nuclear submarines to learn more about the Indian Oceans operating environment.
Indian observers fear that Sri Lankas reluctance to allow basing facilities for PLA Navy warships and submarines immediately, will lead Beijing to consider Gwadar, Maldives, Chittagong (Bangladesh) or Kyaukphu (Myanmar) as alternative options. For New Delhi, Chinas growing maritime involvement with these states, indicates a tightening strategic hold over the South Asian rim, a traditional Indian sphere of geo-political influence.
This cautious atmosphere has been trumped up by the recent Chinese submarine encounters in the IOR that have arguably created a few ripples in the geopolitical context. According to Prof. Shen Dingli at Fudan University, it is wrong for us to believe that we have no right to set up bases abroad. He argues that China needs not only a blue-water navy but also overseas military bases to cut the supply cost.
In the South China Sea Abijith Sing warns that China itself has plans to build its own Great Wall under the South China Sea, through which 30 percent of the worlds trade passes. On the surface too, China has been increasingly assertive, having built a string of installations that include airstrips and other military facilities. To listen to underwater battle, India and Japan plan to install a sea wall of hydrophonesmicrophones with sensors, placed on the seabedbetween southern India and the northern tip of Indonesia.
The One Belt one Road Initiative (known commonly as OBOR) was a construct of the scholar - Wang Jisis strategic thinking, to have a significant Chinese footprint in Eurasia, especially to recalibrate the existing world order. The OBOR is the project of the century, according to President Xi Jinping. This trillion-dollar initiative aims to integrate Eurasia through the development of infrastructure. It is unquestionably the most ambitious project ever launched in recent times, which seeks to revisit and resurrect the Ming dynastys - admiral Zheng Hes global legacy. Thus, the OBOR, when it comes to fruition, will symbolize what I have been talking about in this section  the twin powers of Chinas economic and military strength in the IOR.
According to the World Economic Forum, by 2030 the US will no longer be the only superpower and China will be well placed among the many countries to become one of the great powers. The OBOR is the medium through which China envisions this new world order. Sri Lanka, with its geostrategic position at the centre of the Maritime Silk Road, is a super-connector linking the east-west sea lanes. Therefore, as a nation we have a choice in how we calibrate our foreign policy based on this strategic advantage.
Not all nations support Chinas OBOR, India recently was absent from the OBOR Summit. According to LKY Prof Kanti Bajpai the real reason for Indias absence from the OBOR are quite different and its not the CPEC. It is galling to New Delhi that the entire world is lining up to do business with a rampant China and no one is paying India much attention. Envy apart, there is the strategic worry that China will encircle India. That China with an economy five times the size of India, needs the BRI and an encirclement of India to deal with its weak neighbour is unlikely, but clearly this assumption motivates Indian strategic thinking.

GMOA braces for another round  citing minimum standards
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said will take the toughest trade union action possible if the Health Minister gazettes 'distorted minimum standards' for medical education which is three simple passes (S).
"No Sri Lankan student can enter university (even for the Arts stream) with three simple passes", GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said that the minimum standards of medical education was decided during a discussion held in presence of the Prime Minister's Secretary, scholars and the GMOA and said it should be gazetted.
But it was reported that the Health Minister has presented a cabinet paper with distorted minimum standards for medical education with the support of the University Grants Commission Chairman. The minimum standards for medical education should be decided based on every previous year's minimum qualification for university admission (medical faculty).
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said that there are two sections in the original minimum standards for medical education and the first part which is schedule - 1 contains the minimum standard methodology. Schedule 2, which is the second part, contains the system of implementing law, especially when the minimum standards for medical education are violated. The Health Minister has presented the cabinet paper with only Schedule - 1 (first part).
"The Health Minister stopped gazetting the minimum standards for medical education in 2006, as a member in the Opposition and he did the same as a Cabinet Minister in 2010.Now he does it as the Health Minister. Students will agitate again if the distorted minimum standards for medical education are gazetted," Herath said

Happily ever after
If someones going to crash a wedding, its usually an estranged family member, bitter ex, or just some random stranger looking to score free booze. One couple in Brazil, however, received an uninvited guest of a more furry, four-legged sort, and a truly heartwarming story unfolded.
Marlia and Matheus Pieroni were just beginning their tented So Paulo ceremony when, instead of the bride herself, a stray dog who had wandered in from the storm outside marched down the aisle to the bridal chorus. The canine was removed as the young couple entered, but just as they prepared to read their vows, he returned  and laid down to sleep right on top of Marlias veil!
Some women may have gone into full Bridezilla mode at this point, but Marlia insisted the pup be welcomed as an official guest, which he certainly was.
It was a very pleasant surprise for me, because I love animals, Marlia said.
As the night wound down, the newlyweds searched for their surprise acquaintance, but he had crept away unnoticed. Determined to take him in as their very own, a city-wide search commenced for the stray that stole everyones hearts.
After more than a week of searching all over the city, the couple finally received the news they were waiting for. The surprise guest from the best day of their lives had been found, and was promptly reunited with them. They named him Snoop, and have taken him in as part of their happy family.
I showered him, Marlia said.
He is very happy and slept super good the first night. Were all very happy
Looks like Snoop sniffed out the right place to nap, and found the forever home he so deserved.

Under the Sustainable Development Programme implemented by the Education Ministry, a home garden project was implemented growing crops such as vegetables and other supplementary food crops, at selected schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.
The schools are greatly interested in home gardening and fruit cultivation under the national programme. They are also benefited by this programme, said Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A.M.Rahmathullah, when he visited the Pottuvil divisional schools during an inspection tour recently.
Cultivation of vegetables, other supplementary food crops and fruits also have been given priority under the national programme in the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Pottuvil divisional schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.
Twenty seven schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone have implemented the special Sustainable Development Programme activities. Rs. 50,000 has been allocated for development of each school. The Education Ministry has allocated the funds for this scheme.
Under this programme, home gardening, environmental protection, drug prevention, kidney disease prevention and child protection work programmes are underway, he further said.
A supervisory committee has been appointed to monitor the works within the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai and Pottuvil Divisional schools in the Akkaraipattu Educational Zone.

If we play like we did in Dharamsala we will  win series  Thisara
MOHALI, Tuesday - Captain Thisara Perera believes if Sri Lanka produce a repeat of the Dharamsala performance against India in Mohali, they will win the three-match ODI series.
Sri Lanka produced a near flawless performance in Dharamsala and the captain is expecting an encore from his team in the second ODI to win a maiden series in India.
It is a good opportunity to win the series. Not many teams have won series in India. We want to do something special like we did in Dharamsala, Perera said on the eve of the second match of the three-ODI series.
Adverse weather conditions in Dharamsala meant Sri Lanka had to spend an extra night in the hills and only arrived on Tuesday morning.
They arrived at the PCA Stadium late afternoon and practiced amid cold and overcast conditions.
Asked if there is an added pressure on the Sri Lankan team, Perera replied in the negative. It is not pressure. It is another game for us. Everyone knows if we win on Wednesday we will win the series. We will give our 200 per cent, the all-rounder said before hinting that they would go with the same XI that beat India by seven wickets in the series opener.
The visitors are a confident lot, having ended their 12-match losing run in Dharamsala but they expect India to come back harder, just like they did against New Zealand last month after losing the opening game of the three-match series. Yes they can but we are focused on our job. It was good to win after 12 losses and we know if we can repeat that performance, we will win on Wednesday, said Perera.
The Sri Lankan captain has the experience of playing at this ground, having represented Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League. It looks like a good batting track, he said referring to the surface, which was covered for major part of the day due to overnight rain.
Talking about the squad, Perera said only Dhananjaya de Silva has fitness issues.
Only he is not fit out of the 15, said the skipper. Asked about India not playing Ajinkya Rahane in Dharamsala on a pacer-friendly track, he said: I am not an Indian selector, so I cant say why he did not play. Obviously he is a good batsman. I cant say anything more than that.
Rohit Sharma leading the side in Virat Kohlis absence, was not amused in his first ODI as captain. Though, he promised that the team will learn from Dharamsala debacle and bounce back in the remaining two games.
It is important to thrive in these conditions and come out good. It is an eye-opener for all of us, Rohit had said after the seven-wicket loss.
He is unlikely to tinker with the playing eleven but there is a possibility that Ajinkya Rahane is picked to shore up the inexperienced batting, especially the middle-order. Rahane sat out of the opening game as the team management only sees him as the back-up opener in the presence of Sharma and Dhawan.
However, he has batted in the middle-order in a few games out of the 84 ODIs he has played.
In the bowling department, the worry for India will be the performance of Hardik Pandya, who again leaked runs as the hosts tried to defend a paltry 112.
He is picked as the bowling all-rounder for the South Africa Test series and needs to be at the top of his game ahead of the crucial tour starting next month.
Considering Sri Lanka cantered to victory in 20.4 overs, spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav did not come on to bowl. They would be itching to get back into action after a months gap.
The win must have done a world of good to the islanders confidence after the beating they have taken at the hands of India at home and away this season.
Lakmal was lethal again on a helping pitch while Angelo Mathews too made a promising return with the ball.
Also effective on a seaming surface was pacer Nuwan Pradeep. The batting too clicked and completed the modest chase rather comfortably.

IFS hosts customers, partners for knowledge share session in Colombo
IFS Sri Lanka hosted over 225 of key business executives and partners at a knowledge sharing session at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo recently.
The event was hosted under the theme Digital Shift is Taking Place Right Here Right Now with the objective of bringing together customers, partners and prospects with IFSs senior management to educate them about the opportunity presented by the digital shift that is currently taking place on a regional and global scale.
Alastair Sorbie , CEO of IFS, took the opportunity of educating customers about IFS global operations update while Jayantha de Silva, President IFS Sri Lanka and Vice President IFS South Asia, provided the attendees with a review of the 20 year journey of IFS in Sri Lanka.
Alastair and Jayantha both highlighted the growth of the company, which stated with just 20 employees 20 years ago and at present with over 1,000. During this time, IFS is proud to have implemented IFS Applications at over 120 leading companies in the region, many of whom were present at the gathering. The keynote address was made byAntony Bourne, Vice President Global Industry Solutions at IFS, who presented about the Digital Shift that is currently taking place in the world as well as in the South Asia region. He spoke about the top 5 factors for Digital Transformation and specifically highlighted case studies of how companies had transformed their business using Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D printing, Robotics, Augmented Reality and Drone technology.
Jayantha de Silva (OP1) commented  in my opinion, companies today are more (OP2) risk adverse and unwilling to change. This hinders the ability of organisations transforming their businesses in line with this digital shift that is taking place. Companies should embrace change and view it as an opportunity for competitive advantqge if they want to stay relevant in this digital age
The event created a platform for IFS to further strengthen the relationships with existing and potential clients as well as partners. Attendees provided feedback that they were pleased to have had the opportunity to meet and network with senior management from IFS as well as peers in the industry.

India gives up Asia Cup 2018 hosting rights
The political and cross-border tension between India and Pakistan has prevented an on-field faceoff between the teams from two extremely passionate cricketing nations.
The arch-rivals last met each other in the Champions Trophy amidst uproar and calls for a boycott. Thus it was always going to be tough for India to host the Asia Cup 2018 and with Pakistan involved.
Reports suggest that the BCCI has now decided to pull out as hosts for the tournament.
The matter was discussed in the Governing Body meeting and the office bearers werent certain whether the government would allow them to invite Pakistan since the relations continue to remain strained.
Thus the BCCI has conveyed to the Asian Cricket Council their inability to serve as hosts for the Asia Cup.
Earlier, India was supposed to host the Under-19 Asia Cup this year but had to give it away due to the same reason. The tournament was eventually hosted by Singapore where beating all odds the Afghanistan junior team emerged victorious.
The Indian government holds a stern stand against their neighbours and thus the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had failed to honour the MoU signed with their Pakistani counterparts to play bilateral series at home and away.
The last India v Pakistan bilateral series was played 5 years ago in 2012 when India hosted their neighbours for a limited-overs tour. And thereafter the contest has just been witnessed in multi-lateral tournaments.
BCCI has time and again tried to approach the central government for an approval to invite or accept Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCB) offer to play bilateral or triangular cricket in Indi or even at a neutral venue. But the government is in no mood to allow cricketing ties to resume before the political standstill is resolved. - Cricktracker

India to host the  World Cup in 2023
In what should come as a great news for the fans, India will host the 13th edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2023.
This will be the first time that the World Cup will be held in the cricket crazy nation alone as they have partially hosted previously in 1987, 1996 and 2011.
The Men in Blue had won the coveted title under the leadership in 2011 and became the first team ever in the history of the tournament to win at the home ground.
The fact that all the teams will be visiting India for the biggest cricketing event for the second time in 12 years is sensational news for the cricket fans where the sport is touted as the religion. In 2011, the tournament had garnered a huge response from all over the World and it was hosted together by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
In 1987, however, India and Pakistan had jointly hosted the tournament in which the former side had entered as the defending champions after historically defeating West Indies in 1983.
Champions Trophy also in India
In another elating news, India will also host the ICC Champions Trophy which is touted as the Mini World Cup in which top eight Test playing nations battle it out for the ultimate glory. Both the developments were confirmed by ABP News as it was discussed in the ongoing BCCI SGM on Monday. India had entered the final of the tournament earlier this year which they lost to Pakistan comprehensively by 180 runs.
Though they had won it against all the odds in 2013, also under the captaincy of MS Dhoni in England, by beating the home side. The next edition of the tournament is expected to be scheduled in 2021 which will be played in India as the proud cricketing nation will get ready for ICC Cricket World Cup two years later.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is expected to release the Future Tour Programme (FTP) soon after the SGM on Monday as more details will be cleared after that.

Kelido Beach strip which attracted hundreds and thousands of local and foreign tourists, is polluted and becoming little by little a less-attractive area, due to various human illegal activities, and we should get together to transform it into a fascinating and useful tourist attraction said the Kalutara district (UNP) Parliamentarian and the Kalutara District Coordinating Officer Lakshman Ananda Wijemanna, recently. He expressed these ideas at a discussion held at Kalutara district Secretariat Auditorium attended by the Tourism promotion Minister John Amaratunga, with the participation of the Kalutara District Planning Director Siriwardena recently.

Lanka at make or  break point -PM
Sri Lanka has received so many opportunities and has never grasped them for the countrys advantage, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
A new opportunity has now emerged and Sri Lankans must grab this last chance, he said speaking at the inaugural Best Sri Lankan Brands Awards ceremony at Colombo Hilton on Monday.
We have come to the make or break point, he cautioned.
The Premier said that not only Sri Lanka, but the whole of Asia missed the industrial revolution. However it must be said that without the resources of Asia there would not have been an industrial revolution.
Wickremesinghe said in the 1950s Sri Lanka was on par with countries like Japan and Singapore and they took the Sri Lankan model to mould their economy. However since then Sri Lanka never grabbed the opportunities that came their way in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
He said that today the Indian Ocean has become one of the key development points in the world and Sri Lanka is right in the middle of it. In addition, the Silk Route and the Japan-Africa-India Corridor is also opening up with Sri Lanka being strategically located and Sri Lanka must grab this opportunity as this is the last chance for the island.
Sri Lanka must use its geographical location to tap into the growth that is happening around it.
He said that he had confidence that Sri Lanka can go forward. I have no doubt that given the environment we can do the job. We should not have another occasion for someone to come and show us that we have missed this opportunity as well.
The Premier quipped that if this opportunity also goes by Sri Lanka would be put down just two points ahead of Afghanistan.
The launch of the Best Sri Lankan Brands was also lauded by the Prime Minister who was the Chief Guest. The event was organized by Interbrand, the worlds largest and most influential brand consultancy.
The inclusion of Sri Lanka in the Interbrand catalogue of countries is a chance for local companies to be on the global stage. Wickremesinghe said that he was pleased to see state banks among the top six in the list of 20 but they would have to still face the restructuring process.
He said that local companies should now look at going global as it is the future and businesses should look at technology, semi-automation and innovation.
The winners of the Best Sri Lankan Brands Awards in order of rank: Bank of Ceylon (BOC) (Rs 31.12 bn); People Bank (Rs 26.03 bn); Dialog (Rs 21.87 bn); Commercial Bank (Rs 20.33 bn); Hatton National Bank (Rs 17.53 bn); National Service Bank (Rs 13.27 bn); Lion Brewery (Rs 10.59 bn); Sampath Bank (Rs 6.96 bn); John Keells Group (Rs 6.99 bn); Elephant House (Rs 6.13 bn); Cargills (Rs 5.67 bn); Sri Lanka Telecom (Rs 5.52 bn); Hayleys (Rs 4.56 bn); Cinnamon Hotels Resorts (Rs 3.62 bn); Hemas (Rs 3.37 bn); Sri Lanka Insurance Rs 2.95 bn); LB Finance (Rs 2.52 bn); Dilmah (Rs 2.48 bn); Aitken Spence (Rs 2.16 bn); Rocell (Rs 1.92 bn).

Last porn cinema in Paris shuts down
The rise of internet porn over the past couple of decades has made adult entertainment accessible for people across generations and age groups. While effects of internet porn on peoples sex lives are widely debated, it was always bound to come as bad news for other ways of bringing porn to viewers.
Once a thriving venue catering to porn viewers, the last surviving porn cinema in Paris has finally closed its doors. The owner of the cinema decided to shut shop when sales declined to a third of what they used to be two decades back.
The Beverly Cinema had been showing vintage erotic films to customers since 1960. Its owner Maurice Laroche told Le Parisien that while they sold as many as 1600 tickets a week, they were happy to be able to sell 600 a week now.
There used to be 110 porn cinemas across France with 20 in Paris alone till 1980 and even The National Film Center had 44 screens devoted to X-rated movies. But Laroche blames the rise of internet porn for taking away all the customers.
He recalls how people aged 18 to 100 visited his cinema and a couples night meant the establishment would become a space for reproduction. He says now even a 10-year-old kid can watch porn.
He also mentioned an incident from 15 years back when a couple introduced him to their child who they said was conceived at his cinema.

The limits of Rajapaksa magic
The National Unity Government passed its third budget and the first by Minister Mangala Samaraweera with a two third majority in Parliament in all its three readings. With the end of the budget debate, the entire political focus now shifts to the impending local government elections due to be held in mid-February next year. Nominations are due to close by mid-December.
Two-way or three-way contest
The political activity of the past several weeks has been attempts by various members of the SLFP to seek to unite the governing and Joint Opposition (JO) factions of that party. As this article is being penned, it certainly seems like the most likely outcome is a three-way contest, between the UNP, the SLFP and the JO under the SLPP. With the core SLFP base divided, conventional wisdom would have it that the UNP would emerge on top though well short of either fifty percent of the popular vote nationally and also with many hung councils. The contest between the SLFP and the SLPP is harder to predict for several reasons.
A local government poll is generally disadvantageous to an opposition since it is a non-government changing election and hence essentially a vote for the opposition is only a protest vote. The mainline JO leaders themselves are not the candidates and their ability to the campaign may be limited through legal jeopardy to their parliamentary seats. Also, the attractiveness of the SLPP is almost exclusively to a section of the majority ethno-religious community only, so it will struggle in the more pluralist urban centres such as in the Colombo and Kandy, Municipal Councils. Let us not forget that the UPFA failed to elect a single Muslim at the August 2015 General Elections, all their Muslim MPs, Faizer, Fowzi and Hisbulla entering Parliament on the national list.
Rajapaksa administration
The JO and the SLPP are convinced that the Rajapaksa brand is alive and well and that it will emerge victorious, if not in 2018, then in 2020. Overconfidence is rather endemic in the Rajapaksa set up, after all calling an election, two years early; only to lose it while deeply entrenched in power was symptomatic of that overconfidence.
Moreover, the Rajapaksa run UPFA campaign in August 2015 also ensured they ended up second best. So, the Rajapaksa political project is hardly a sure winner. In 2005, it barely scraped through with the narrowest win in presidential poll history and only because the LTTE ensured a boycott of the Tamil vote in the Jaffna District.
The role of Emile Kanthan and whether money changed hands would forever be a mystery. In the immediate aftermath of the war in 2010 was the only notable and historic election or rather re-election of the Rajapaksa Administration and under fortuitous political circumstances that would not be repeated.
What the two elections of 2015 proved was that while the nation was grateful for the end of the war, it will not consistently vote to look back at the past.
The Rajapaksa Administrations governance track record was appalling and the electorate delivered its verdict in 2015, not once but twice. The SLFP should actively consider the new path being articulated by President Sirisena and not seek to return to the past under Rajapaksa. Further, the Rajapaksas have not internally resolved their own succession issues.
Is the 2020 Rajapaksa standard bearer Mahinda, Basil or Gota. Given the implications of that choice for young Namal. The plot thickens. Any student of Sri Lankan history would know that most of ancient Ceylons dynasties collapsed due to succession battles.
The LG elections impact on policy
The LG elections have the potential to play several useful roles. Firstly, it is the first election since quotas were introduced for female representation and accordingly there will be a significant increase in the participation of women in public life in general and local governance in particular after this election.
Secondly, the momentum on the reform agenda of the National Unity Government has slowed somewhat from the early days and the election has the potential of solidifying political alliances.
The rather plain reality of the balance of social and political forces is that as long as President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe stay together, it is sufficient to keep out and decay the Rajapaksa comeback project. If the President and Rajapaksa politically unite, it could potentially be a political game changer.
Now what was proposed in the unity talks between the SLFP and the JO was not such a radical political realignment but a return to the status quo ante or the August 2015 electoral arrangement where the SLFP led UPFA though divided between the pro-National Government and the pro-Rajapaksa faction contested together and parted company thereafter.
The benefit of the two factions contesting separately is that it forces a decision one way or the other.
Post the LG election, after a three-way contest, the main political protagonists would need to affirm their political direction, either confirm their commitment to the mandates of 2015 or oppose the same.
For the JO/SLPP, the expectations of their rank and file are very high. A part of the Rajapaksa attraction is supposedly its popularity, a third defeat would further dent that image.
Most recently we see an electorally minor but rhetorically major star of the JO, Wimal Weerawansas National Freedom Front, imploding as its members desert their leader and flock to President Sirisena and the SLFP. A loss by the JO would increase its internal tensions further.

Many politicos will come forward to strengthen SLFP victory: Amaraweera
Many politicians would come forward to strengthen the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to confirm a clean victory at the forthcoming Local Government election, UPFA General
Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He added that a considerable number of political parties had expressed their concern to join the SLFP, aiming to create a broad alliance to face the next election.
Discussions are being held with several political parties and politicians. Politicians from several levels including national, provincial and grass root levels, would join the SLFP in due course, he said.
According to Amaraweera, there is no doubt about SLFPs victory at the forthcoming LG election. The SLFP will sweep the board, he said.
He added that there was a huge demand for receiving SLFP nominations to contest at the next election. Those who wish to create a SLFP Government in 2020, are rallying round the SLFP and President Sirisena. He requested the persons who wished to create a clean government free of malpractices by 2020, to walk hand in hand with the SLFP.
The Minister added that it was reported that certain persons were trying to put the government in trouble by levelling various allegations and creating displeasure over the government.
According to him, the long standing SAITM issue and trade union actions of railway workers, may be the result of such coups launched to create displeasure over the government.
He said that it was unethical and an injustice to put the general public and students who sit the Ordinary Level Examination in difficulties through unjustifiable trade union action.
Asked whether the NFF and JO members, who joined the SLFP have demanded anything when joining, Minister Amaraweera said that they joined the SLFP only with the intention of strengthening the hands of President Sirisena.
They havent demanded anything, he said.
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana, addressing the media, said that the Joint Opposition had no intention of assisting the SLFP when they come for talks. The JO representatives requested several unfair demands at the discussion table, with the aim of not joining the SLFP.
Even though the JO representatives demanded to quit the government, while three of the JO representatives who came for talks were ministers of the 100 Day Unity Government, he said.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, addressing media said, it had been scheduled to hold 22 political meetings at district level, based under the patronage of the President. Besides, there would be 360 political meetings at the electoral level and there would be more than 20,000 pocket meeting at GS division level.

MURDER most foul
December 1 was a flurry of theatrical activity at Gateway College, Kandy as the middle and senior schools staged two productions; Ion and Murder at Dharmarama Road directed by a mother and son duo; Dayangi and Dhisal Kapuge.
Ion, a Greek play directed by Dayangi Kapuge and performed by the middle school was a delight. The young actors and actresses were quite powerful and boasted signs of future expertise in the domain of theatre. The play had a number of lovely original songs and musical pieces, and the presentation on stage was very colourful and dynamic. It was heartening to see such a lot of promising talent being utilized in this manner.
Upcoming director
The principal event of the evening was the Senior Schools production: Murder at Dharamarama Road, written and directed by Dhisal Kapuge, an undergraduate of the Faculty of Arts, University of Peradeniya. It proved to be nothing less than what was expected of this upcoming director in Kandy whose first production Hecuba performed by university students earlier this year proved to be an immense success.
This play was what Kapuge called a dark comedy. True to this term, it was replete with very sensitive scenes as well as very sophisticatedly crafted humour; there was also plenty of cringe-worthy slapstick humour involved, which as I saw, was deliberately used with the very intention of poking fun at it.
Murder at Dharmarama Road can very clearly be called a revolutionary attempt because it wasnt anything that could be traditionally expected from a school play. As Kapuge mentioned later in his concluding speech, this was definitely a risk; it was a risk simply because it certainly did not stick within the confines of what one might suppose a school to perform and also because as a play itself, it set to question and challenge several daunting societal issues that are quite rarely addressed in such a forum.
Contemporary Sri Lanka
The very usage of all three languages, English, Sinhala and Tamil was a bright move, and setting the drama in contemporary Sri Lanka also facilitated the spectators ability to relate further with the play and its concerns. The academic staff of Gateway College, especially Ianthe Rajadurai, Nissanka and Lakshmi Amaraweera should be commended for enabling the performance of this play.
The plot on its own wasnt that entire complex; it followed the familiar structure of the whodunit genre where the most unassuming character winds up the culprit at the end. However, the plays remarkability lies in the way in which Kapuge decided to go about with his plot, incorporating much thought-provoking and insightful dialogue that elucidated issues of rampant racism, classism and even language disparities.
Spectacular manner
Of course, this script was brought to life in the most spectacular manner by a very powerful cast comprising Poshia Hettiarachchi, Kaushal Agalakotuwa, Santhush Bandara, Duvini Attygala, Risigaran Nagendran, Jacinta Richards and Amaruwan Jayasinghe as the main characters and Suha Hamza, Sakya Rathnayake and Isuthil Sentil in their supportive roles. The script demanded the kind of energy and vibrancy that this wonderful cast did not fail to fulfill. They were all in perfect synchrony with each other, which helped in technicalities like generating sharp humour, as well as moving their spectators to tears and in short, gripping the audience and keeping them at the edge of their seats. There was never a moment in which the play failed to maintain the interest of the audience, and all credit for this goes to the cast.
Cleverly illustrated
The stars of the evening were Risigaran Nagendran who provided the play with comic relief that kept the audience in fits of uncontrollable laughter, and Jacinta Richards in opposition, who stirred the audience with her heart-rending portrayal of a character undergoing the pain and plight of being downtrodden and abused on account of her lower class and status in society. In fact, classism was one major theme addressed in the play, and it was cleverly illustrated visually on stage, and not merely through dialogue. Though Nagendran and Richards depicted very different characters in personality, the characters share the bond of belonging to the same class; one, a peon and the other, a domestic aide. Owing to this alone, there is much congeniality between the two, which was skilfully depicted by how the peon, Freddie constantly looks out for the domestic aide, Deepthi as they are both being sidelined by the other characters who are agents of higher social classes and statuses. In fact, this congeniality between the two on the basis of their class, trumps their differences in race (Freddie being a Tamil and Deepthi being a Sinhalese) and language (Freddie being fluent only in Tamil and English, while Deepthi can speak only Sinhalese). Victimization on the basis of their class was brought out in a very chilling scene in which the lady of the house manhandles Deepthi, slapping her, clutching her at the hair and even throwing her to the ground, screaming verbal insults. This was also projected in a light-hearted and very humorous scene where the best friend of the victim engages in a comic physical fight with Freddie on being called a murderer, despite all the other characters also accusing him of murder. This class factor was brought out through these two scenes as well as other subtle actions throughout the play.
Majoritarian ignorance
Delving into racism, which was perhaps the most controversial of the issues explicated in the play, we see the victim of the play, Sachin Siriwardana (portrayed by Amaruwan Jayasinghe) encompassing values that might be seen as typical of those festering in majoritarian ignorance and entitlement, which makes him a very disoriented racist. He voices without any reticence, his prejudices against the Muslims and also harbours patronizing sentiments towards the Tamils. Much of his dialogues came as a shock because they were bluntly racist and created a painful unease within the audience who reacted with pin-drop silence during these instances as it was unsure as to how to react. However, he was powerfully contested by Nafaz Marzook portrayed by Santhush Bandara, in his moving rendition of the difficulties faced by the minorities, about how they are judged not according to their humanity, but by their race and religion.

Naples pizza twirling wins UNESCO intangible status
Naples pizza twirling joined UNESCOs list of intangible heritage, securing the coveted status alongside a host of cultural treasures including a Saudi art form traditionally practised only by women.
The art of pizzaiuolo - which has been handed down for generations in the southern Italian city - was given the nod by the UN cultural bodys World Heritage Committee, who met on the South Korean island of Jeju.
It comes after some two million people signed a petition to support Naples application, according to Sergio Miccu, head of the Association of Neapolitan Pizzaiuoli -- no doubt buoyed by his offer of complimentary pizza if the age-old culinary tradition joined the prestigious list.
Well be giving out free pizza in the streets, Miccu earlier told AFP.
The custom goes far beyond the pizzaiuolos spectacular handling of the dough -- hurling it into the air in order to oxygenate it -- to include songs and stories that have turned pizza-making into a time-honoured social ritual.
Victory! Maurizio Martina, Italys minister for agriculture, food and forestry, wrote on Twitter. Another step towards the protection of Italys food and wine heritage.
In a statement, Martina said the recognition came after a years-long campaign. The art of the Neapolitan pizza-maker contains Italian know-how ... especially traditional knowledge that has been transmitted from generation to generation, he said.
Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, a former agriculture minister who attended the proceedings in Jeju, said in a video posted on Twitter: Long live the art of Neapolitan pizzaiuolo!
The pizzas humble ancestor, a plain affair usually tarted up with a bit of lard, initially emerged as a cheap, easy and fast way to feed the citys army of poor, said historian Antonio Mattozzi.
But despite being an immediate hit with the locals, pizza failed to take off outside the city at first, Mattozzi told AFP.
It took Queen Margheritas love of the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil version to fire up the imagination and taste buds of diners far and wide - at least that is how the story goes.
Hoping to win the hearts of the commoners, the Italian queen asked in 1889 to try their favourite dish. And while she was unconvinced by anchovy and Parmesan-topped versions, the basil delight won her over. AFP

New York bomber not on Bangladesh terror list
BANGLADESH: Bangladesh police Tuesday were scrambling for details about New York subway bomber Akayed Ullah, but uncovered little about the extremist sympathiser who detonated a homemade pipe bomb in the underground.
The 27-year-old immigrant from Bangladesh set off a crude bomb strapped to his body in a crowded New York subway passage on Monday but the device failed to detonate properly, leaving him the only one seriously harmed.
Ullah told police investigators he wanted to avenge US airstrikes on the Islamic State group and was also inspired by Christmas terror plots in Europe.
Bangladesh police are investigating whether Ullah was radicalised in his Muslim-majority homeland, where foreigners have been among those targeted in deadly assaults claimed by the Islamic State group and Al Qaeda.
But a probe into his background has revealed little apart from the fact Ullah did not have a criminal record and was not on a watchlist of extremist suspects.
So far, his name is not on our wide-range list of radicalised persons or members of terror groups, both from Bangladesh and outside, senior counter terrorism police officer Sanwar Hossain told AFP.
We are trying to gather more details, he said.
Ullah arrived in the United States seven years ago as the member of a family already living there under what is known as chain immigration.
Bangladesh police said Ullahs family hailed from Sandwip, an island off the coast of the southern port city of Chittagong, but his father had migrated to the capital Dhaka some 30 years ago.
Police could provide little else at this stage about Ullahs early life in Bangladesh.
The impoverished riverine nation of 160 million has been waging a war against homegrown extremism in the wake of numerous attacks by radical groups in recent years.
In July last year militants stormed a Dhaka cafe and massacred 22 hostages, including 18 foreigners, in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group.
Bangladesh last month arrested an alleged militant from Ansarullah Bangla Team, a homegrown extremist group with links to Al-Qaeda, over the 2015 stabbing murder of a prominent US blogger in Dhaka.
The secular government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed to root out extremism but says international radical groups do not operate inside Bangladesh.
Security forces have killed more than 70 alleged militants in a fierce crackdown since the high-profile cafe siege last year. - AFP

New Zealand plan works as hostile Wagner bounces out Windies
Hamilton: New Zealand congratulated themselves on a smart plan as they decimated the West Indies with a day to spare in the second Test to sweep the series 2-0 on Tuesday.
The tourists struggled to cope in their second innings against New Zealands three-pronged fast bowling attack in Hamilton, particularly against a barrage of bouncers from Neil Wagner.
A brutal spell from Wagner produced three wickets and a broken arm as the hosts romped to a 240-run victory.
The West Indies, set a target of 444 to win after losing the first Test by an innings, folded at nine for 203 with the injured Sunil Ambris unable to continue batting.
The way we were able to keep putting pressure on them with the ball and bat was a credit to the way we executed our plans, said captain Kane Williamson.
Here the bounce became a little bit variable which is great in a Test match. You want to see the surface age a little bit and the way (the bowlers) were able to execute plans was outstanding.
Wagner, who tormented the West Indies throughout the series with his aggressive short balls, took three for 42 while new-ball pair Tim Southee and Trent Boult grabbed two wickets apiece, as did spinner Mitchell Santner.
The victory improved New Zealands home record to 13 wins, three losses and seven draws in their last 10 home series.
While Wagner was the chief destroyer, Williamson said the two significant factors were Boult and Southees 61-run stand at the tail of the first innings and Ross Taylors unbeaten 107 in the second.
West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite laid the blame on his batsmen for failing to learn from the first Test when Wagner took nine wickets.
We didnt bat well. The key was to take it over by over, session by session. Obviously it didnt work out that way, he said.
Its key to have your plans worked out and be very decisive in your shot selection.
Ambris was taken to hospital after a vicious blow to the forearm during a blistering spell by Wagner.
It ended a tough Test baptism for Ambris who made unwanted history in the opening Test when he became the first person to be out for a golden duck in his debut innings by stepping on his wicket.
In the first innings of the second Test, his misfortune continued when he became the first person to step on his stumps in consecutive Tests.
Shai Hope, on 23, was also hit on the forearm by a rising Wagner delivery. When play resumed after medical treatment, he tried to take on Wagner only to be caught at long leg.
Shane Dowrich lasted two balls after Ambris left, fending a Wagner bouncer to Henry Nicholls at short leg.
Roston Chase and Raymon Reifer manufactured a solid 78-run partnership until Chase, on 64, went in similar fashion to Hope, pulling a Wagner bouncer to the safe hands of de Grandhomme.
Reifer was out soon after for 29 as the tail folded with the last three wickets adding 45.
The series now moves to three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s with the tourists to be reinforced with the inclusion of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels for all six matches, while Andre Fletcher, Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard will play the Twenty20s. AFP
New Zealand defeated West Indies by 240 runs to seal a second comfortable win and the Test series. AFP

On the other side of the comfort zone
The Motto of Holy Family Convent is to Glory be to God alone. This has helped Head Girl of Holy Family Convent Anjalee Wanduragala to understand that your power lies in your originality because she understands that God does not create duplicates. Each life is unique. Perfect Prefects features Wanduragala who believes in keeping things simple and effecting change from the top through being yourself.
We live in a world where the youngsters are trying to be the next Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. They do not realise their self- worth. They do not realise the value of their uniqueness.
Something in this world we lack a lot is that people do not realise their worth. That is what leads to these problems like suicide rates going up and people harming themselves. I think something that children need to know is that you are worth a lot more than what you think you are. If people realise they are worth more than they think they are, that helps you focus a lot on what you are doing and helps you use your talents so that you may help someone else. Also when we live in this world we see people trying to idolise someone else and become a duplicate of someone else. I think that people have to use their difference to make a change in the world. You should be yourself. Be original, said Wanduragala.
Right friends
Wanduragala over the years has developed this ability not to get rattled by anything. She believes in not getting agitated over anything. She has a great support system. She has the right friends and she believes that your friends can influence your personality. Once she re-evaluates the problem she can calm down.
When a problem comes up, I can think on my feet. I think that is from debating and all that. I was the Debating captain of the school team. That has helped me think on my feet. That is a quality a leader should have because when you face a difficulty you cant get flustered. If you get flustered you wont be able to face that challenge. That is an ability I have. Of course, at the moment I am facing that difficulty I do say a prayer. That helps me get over that situation. It gives me strength in facing that situation, stated Wanduragala.
Her education at school has touched every facet of her life. Her education has been spiritual as well as teaching her how the world works. As mentioned before she gives God glory.
Everything I am today I owe it to school, my parents, my sister and my friends. School is the reason why I have such amazing friends. I am honoured to actually be the Head Prefect in School and leading 3000 other students. From Grade 1 to Grade 12, I remember all my teachers because what I am today, the characteristics and qualities I have are because of those people. It is my second home and I have spent way more time at school than I have at home! I have been taught to be punctual and being eco -friendly to another level at school. They teach us about simplicity, our vision is being simple and modest, and our motto is Glory be to God alone. My school has consistently taught us this. I definitely depend on God and I give him such priority. When you do that everything else falls into place, explained Wanduragala.
Different things
Stepping out of ones comfort zone is something one will have to do eventually and it is something you cant avoid. It does not matter what society thinks, just follow your path in life.
The individual I admire is not actually a leader, but in my case, I would look at her as a leader. She is Mother Teresa because it takes courage to step out of your comfort zone, so she was one person where even if society looked at her and had a problem with her she would work regardless of what others thought of her. That is something that would motivate us as children of the 21st century. Martin Luther King is also a person I look up to very much. He actually fought for humans regardless of whether they were black and white. That is where humanity actually came into play. That even has to be highlighted in history, added Wanduragala.
Wanduragala also firmly believes in finishing what you started. If you dont finish what you started then you are neither here or nor there. But if you can finish what you started then you can actually achieve something.
In the times we live in, students would initiate something. Begin something. But they never finish it. My mother is my biggest role model and what she has taught me from my small days is to actually finish what you start. So many start different things, but they dont finish because the ones who finish what they have started are actually those that are remembered, stated Wanduragala.
Wandurugala also feels that without constantly grumbling about what our leaders are doing wrong, if you want to see change then do it yourself. Reach the higher echelons of society and effect change on your own.
Gender inequality
People also spend time blaming the hierarchy or the top people in society. But what we as a younger generation have to do is work our way and get up there and then create change from the top. I am very ambitious and I want to get into law faculty and then become a lawyer. I also like international relations so I would like to get into that field, said Wanduragala.
She sees corruption and discrimination happening all around her and this is not the only gender-based. She feels strongly about gender inequality which is a big problem. But there are other types of discrimination. Your race, religion, colour and country.
There is so much discrimination happening in the world. And you need to think to yourself the person next to you may be of another race or religion but that he/she is another human. Your colour or gender or nationality is irrelevant because that person is a human being. You should know how to handle people in an appropriate way without hurting their feelings, explained Wanduragala.
In addition to debating which is normally done indoors, she excels on the field. She has been playing Tennis since 2011.
I have been representing school since 2011 till now and I have played for National School Tournaments and we were placed second runners-up in 2015. I have senior colours. I have been having junior colours for three years, said Wanduragala.
Big difference
Wanduragala has only one message to the youth. The power of being yourself. Because that is the message that will change the world. Your abilities and personality have been personally designed.
There is only one you. There has never been a person quite like you in history.
What I would like to tell all these girls and boys is that if you want to get up there, just be yourself. You do not have to be a duplicate. You could make a big difference in this world if you would just be yourself. Originality is better than being a duplicate, said Wanduragala.

My favourite movie would be Invictus. It is about Nelson Mandela and it is one touching movie and I would advise everyone to watch. I also like Cassandra Clares books.

Persistent efforts needed to secure gains we already made: Finance Minister
"Although the conflict is over, it will take years to heal the wounds, and it will take persistent efforts to sustain and secure the gains that we have already made," Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was participating in the Franco-German Human Rights Award Ceremony held yesterday (11) at the residence of German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Jrn Rohde.
"The Government has the will and determination to face these challenges including gender-based violence, and promoting and protecting human rights for all, while working towards achieving equitable and inclusive economic development. Yet, Government alone cannot achieve all this," the Minister said.The Franco German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law was awarded for the second time since its inception. It is granted to persons who show significant engagement in the protection and the promotion of human rights and the rule of law.
The French and the German Embassies in Colombo announced earlier this year that Ms. Shreen Abdul Saroor, a human rights defender specialising on womens rights and empowerment and engaged in reconciliation work between displaced Muslim and Tamil communities was selected for the award.
Finance Minister Mangala Saramweera said he was pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the ceremony where a member of task force, Shreen Abdul Saroor was awarded with the prestigious award.
The Minister said Shreen was an example not only to Sri Lankan women but to women and men all over the world.
"You have faced tremendous hardship yourself. Yet, you had the courage to use your personal adversity to reach out and help the most vulnerable in our society. Your courage and sincerity continue to help those who are most in need in our society," the Minister said.
He said he was proud as a Sri Lankan to see Shreen's work being recognised.
"You have touched the lives of so many, and what you have done, and continue to do, stands not only as a contribution to the citizens of Sri Lanka, but to all of humanity," the Minister said. "This is why I hope that the work that Shreen has done, and continues to do, will inspire more young people and more men and women to be engaged, and stand up for the rights of all. I wish you the strength to keep doing the great work that you are doing, and to keep on fighting the good fight," he said.
The Minister thanked the Governments of France and Germany for their joint initiative to recognise the work of human rights activists and recalled that 15 persons were chosen globally this year as winners of the prestigious Franco German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law. "Germany and France have become vanguard of universal human values. Your active interest encourages all of us to strengthen our efforts in preserving those common universal values at this time of populism and integration," the Finance Minister said.

Johannesburg: Former Paralympic champion and convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius has been injured in a prison brawl over the use of a public phone, a South African official said on Tuesday.
The double amputee -- who is serving a 13-year jail term for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp -- was left with a bruise after an altercation with another inmate over the use of a public phone on December 6, according to the department of Correctional Services.
Oscar Pistorius sustained a bruise following an alleged incident with another inmate over the use of a public phone in the special care unit where both offenders are detained at Attridgeville Correctional Centre, spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said.

Portrait conquered
Art lovers had the opportunity to view and enjoy a series of paintings done by Dr Shanaka Kulathunga, when his exhibition, Concealed, was open to the public at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. He has confined this exhibition solely to portrait and figure paintings, a rare attempt by most artistes.
A great portrait, not only brings out the physical form, but also gives us an insight into the character and the personality of the sitter. It is in this respect that the present collection of portraits succeeded in giving us the true quality of portraiture in keeping with the great tradition. This he seems to achieve by his acute observation and following the steps taken by the great masters of this genre. In fact, observing his work he seems to follow on the footsteps of the great masters.
This artist seems to have gained so much not only by art, but also from his study science (medicine) leading to the observation and depiction of the details of a personality. This I feel is a rare advantage he enjoys as a portrait painter.
While concentrating mainly on portraiture, he has presented a single landscape, which proves his ability in that sphere of painting as well. I have noticed in his previous exhibition his skill as a painter of a landscape was widely admired. On this occasion, however, he has offered a single landscape which proves his prowess as a landscapist as well.

Power devolution, a democratic need - Ganeshan
Power devolution is not an ethnic issue, it is a democratic need, said National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan yesterday, introducing the four slogans for national and religious coexistence in the country.
The Religious Co-existence Convention held at the BMICH brought together religious leaders of the four main religions in the country focused on the four slogans of:
Sri Lankan our identity, diversity our strength, Lets not take up arms to achieve political goals, Let us review our history and correct our mistakes, and One country, power to all.
The era to separate, break apart and divide the country has gone. We all live in one country, noted the Minister and having established this, he remarked that for peace, it was necessary that power be devolved beyond Colombo.
Over the years, through consequent governments, we have seen a certain class in Colombo concentrating power at the Centre. But, our government for the first time is going to devolve power to the provinces in the truest sense, Minister Ganesan said.
Since 2003 we have had the dream to change the electoral system and from next year, the people can reap the benefits of the new system, he added.
A Northern Provincial Councillor recently refused to raise the National Flag though all government servants take office having accepted the Constitution and National Flag. What he did was wrong and we condemn this. At the same time we saw extremists in the South carrying the national flag with the green and orange stripes removed. That too is wrong. We have extremists on both sides, he explained
The President and government has chosen to walk the middle path between these extremes and we need the guidance and direct intervention of our religious to make it a success, Minister Ganeshan said.
We will accomplish this as we have a strong government to implement it, the Minister said.

Qatar Airways sweeps int'l awards ceremonies
It has been a record-breaking year for Qatar Airways, as the airline has claimed more global awards than ever before in its 20th year of operations. Qatar's national carrier has received more than 50 individual awards across multiple categories since January, demonstrating its continued commitment to exceeding passenger expectations with its innovative approach to product development and dedication to customer experience.
At a time when many airlines are scaling back and during a particularly challenging year, Qatar Airways continues to thrive, showcasing its best-in-class cabins, crew, catering, in-flight entertainment, on-board magazine, lounges and more.
Notably, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, received the Aviation Executive of the Year award from industry body CAPA last month, highlighting his leadership and innovative direction in guiding the growth of the airline and the wider aviation industry as a whole.
Leading the host of awards received by the airline this year is the prestigious accolade of 2017 Airline of the Year, awarded by international air transport rating organisation Skytrax.
Known as the Oscars of the aviation industry, Qatar Airways was also named World's Best Business Class, Best Airline in the Middle East, and World's Best First Class Airline Lounge at the Skytrax awards ceremony held in Paris in June.
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, said: The many awards Qatar Airways has received this year stand as firm recognition of our ongoing commitment to our passengers to constantly innovate in order to deliver the finest experience available, both in the skies and on the ground."
Significantly, Qatar Airways was also recognised for its launch of Qsuite, the airline's revolutionary new First in Business Class product, receiving the Best Airline Innovation of the Year award at the 2017 ULTRAS (Ultimate Luxury Travel Related Awards) in London.
Qatar Airways was also voted Best Airline at the 2017 Business Traveller awards held in London, where it won a raft of other major awards, including Best Airline in the Middle East, Best Business Class and Best Long Haul Airline.
Additionally, the carrier was awarded Best Cabin Service and Best Food and Beverage at the 2017 APEX Passenger Choice awards held during this year's annual APEX Expo in Las Vegas.
The airline also received the evening's highest ranking as a five-star airline from more than half a million passengers who took part.
Qatar Airways also took home four wins at this year's TravelPlus Airline Amenity Bag Awards. The airline's new range of on-board products won the awards for First Class Female Amenity Kit, Business Class Middle East Amenity Kit, Children's Goody Bag (over six years old) and Sleeper Suit/Pyjamas as the prestigious industry event.

Rajapaksas, yet to see the Light
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, spearheading the Eliya movement to defeat government efforts at creating a new constitution, in Galle, the other day, stressed that devolution of power to the minority Tamils was not the solution to bring about reconciliation, but it was only through the provision of sufficient facilities and development in the North that this could be achieved. The former strongman, in the Rajapaksa government, has certainly got his wires crossed, and, what is more, is seemingly condemned to live with this school of thought, as did brother Mahinda to his great cost.
The Tamil community is not demanding development, or, freebies by the government. Development of the North, in any event, was carried out at a frenetic pace, led by Basil Rajapaksa, immediately after the conclusion of the war, which changed the entire landscape of the war ravaged territory, erasing all vestiges of the bloody conflict. Not only that, Mahinda Rajapaksa even went to the extent of distributing gold items, among the populace, that were plundered from them by the LTTE, during his presidential election campaign, and, moving freely among the community. What good did this do to him, in terms of the northern vote, at the poll
Nay, the Tamils have demonstrated, time and again, that they did not want the patronage of the government, in terms of special treatment, or, development bonanzas. They only want to live with honour and dignity, and, to be treated on equal terms, with the rest of the population. The scars inflicted by the racist policies of successive governments are too deep to be assuaged by any other means than recognizing the rights of the Tamil community to live in a milieu where they will have an opportunity to decide on their own affairs, of course, without harming the unity and integrity of the country. This is what is sought to be offered under the new constitution, which the likes of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, and, his like-minded cohorts, in the Eliya movement, have rejected outright.
Of course, Gota must be bitter towards the Northern voter, for more than tilting the scales, that spelt disaster to his brother, on January 8. But MR himself invited this disaster upon himself for the way he treated the Tamils after the war ended. They (Tamils) were made to feel a conquered race. Victory Parades were held, day in and day out, that gave the spectacle the patina of conquest of one race by another. Matters were not helped when Rajapaksa, in the days following the victory, addressed parliament in the manner of a latter day Dutu Gemunu, hectoring to one and all that a solution to the Tamil question will be only on his terms and would not condone anything planted from outside'. The war victory was propagated as one won by one nation over another, relegating the North to that other nation, rather than an armed conflict between brethren of the same country.
To cap it all, Rajapaksa banned the singing of the National Anthem, in Tamil, in schools, and, government offices, in the North, out of pique, after a last minute cancellation of his Oxford Union address by the authorities, due to a mass protest by Tamils in London. All these events, no doubt, were decisive in ousting the hitherto invincible Rajapaksas from the seats of power, and, there is no reason to suggest the status quo has changed to any degree, notwithstanding Basil Rajapaksa's recent efforts to make amends, during his visit to the North. Nay, things can only further aggravate the electoral fortunes of the Rajapaksas, with Gota, who may be entertaining ideas of contesting for the Presidency, himself leading the campaign to deny the Tamils their legitimate right to even a semblance of devolution (he has criticized the 13th Amendment), through the Eliya movement.
Be that as it may, this is the first time in our post-independence history that we have come close to enacting a constitution that has the inputs of all, both, across the political and communal divide, and, also the best chance of producing a document that has the consensus of all. After all, it was Mahinda Rajapaksa, as an opposition politician, it is, who agitated most against the present constitution, and, was a minister in the government whose leader described it as a bahubootha viyawasthawa. Hence, on what basis can the Joint Opposition oppose the scrapping of the constitution is difficult to fathom, unless this stems from narrow political considerations.
A phenomenal recovery
The Railway engine drivers, who are currently on strike, perhaps, are without children who are sitting for the GCE (O/L) examinations, that commenced yesterday. Or, may be their offspring are driven to school in luxury vehicles, what with a take home pay of an engine driver topping an astounding Rs. 225,000/- per month. It was at one time suggested that the Railway Department was so broke that the government was planning to selloff railway property and it's other assets to make ends meet. Perhaps it has made a remarkable recovery.

Raviraj murder appeal re-fixed
The appeal filed by the wife of slain TNA Jaffna district MP Nadaraja Raviraj, was yesterday re-fixed for support on February 16, by the Court of Appeal.
Mrs. Raviraj is challenging the Colombo High Courts judgment to release the five accused, including three Navy intelligence officers, in the Raviraj murder case
Court of Appeal Judge, Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe re-fixed the matter for support since the Bench was not properly constituted.
The aggrieved party, Sashikala Raviraj, wife of the slain MP filed this appeal seeking an order to set aside the verdict of the Colombo High Court dated December 23, 2016, to acquit and release all accused from the case. On December 23, 2016, three Navy intelligence officers and two others, accused in the Raviraj murder, were acquitted and released from the case after they were found not guilty by jury trial.
The verdict was delivered by High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, as per the unanimous decision reached by the jury, following a month long trial. The jurys decision was that the accused cannot be convicted based on the evidence in the case.
The petitioner further sought an order to set aside the order of the High Court allowing the request of the accused for the case to be tried before a jury. The petitioner stated that a trial by jury cannot be accepted in this case since three charges out of five had been levelled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).The High Court allowed to proceed with the Raviraj murder trial in absentia of the three accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint who were evading Court since the initiation of investigations. The indictments were filed against six accused Palana Sami Suresh alias Sami, Prasad Chandana Kumara alias Sampath, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda alias Vajira, Sivakanthan Vivekanandan alias Charan and Fabian Royston Toussaint on five counts, including committing the murder of Raviraj and his security officer Lokuwella Murage Lakshman under the provisions of the PTA and Penal Code.
The three accused who were not present before Court, were identified as ex-LTTE cadres affiliated to the Karuna faction.Wijeya Wickrema Manamperige Sanjaya Preethi Viraj was made state witness in the Raviraj murder trial.

The Lanka Sama Samaja Partys Deputy Secretary Anil de Soysa said yesterday, that the government should intervene immediately to resolve the prevailing railway strike since last week causing great inconvenience to the public.
The fact that it had not been resolved so far, was that the government was a failure, he added.
We urge the government to provide a permanent solution to the problem without placing unnecessary burdens on the public or else to go home, he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said that there were indications that other sections of society too would join the strike which would cripple the day to day lives of the people. The train strike had already caused severe difficulties to students sitting the G.C.E. O/L Examination.
Whenever a UNP government was ruling the country, there were communal unrest as well as workers struggles. Therefore, we urge the government to resolve this problem or to go home.
Commenting on the forthcoming Local Government election, he said the LSSP would work towards the victory of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
But, if our party did not receive sufficient a quota in certain areas where we were strong, we would field an independent candidate or we will contest under ender the LSSP symbol of the Key. Anyway, discussions
are underway at present to come to a final decision in this regard.
Meanwhile, the LSSP would conduct its 82nd Anniversary Convention at the Negombo Town Hall on December 17, under the theme of chasing out this anti-people government. He said the government had failed in providing job opportunities to the youth. During the last two and half years, not even a single industrial zone had been set up even though many pledges were given to the people during the election.

Singapore Airlines launches chatbox for customer queries
Singapore Airlines (SIA) today launched a beta chatbot, as it expands digital servicing channels for customers. The bot, named Kris, will initially be available on the SIA global Facebook page, and will later be made available on singaporeair.com.
Customers who visit the SIA Facebook page and reach out to the Airline via Facebook Messenger will be able to chat privately with Kris and receive assistance for pre-flight-related queries. As a beta bot, Kris will be in constant learning mode and its capabilities will develop over time. The bot is currently trained to address queries in English related to baggage, check-in, online booking, as well as travelling with infants and children.
Based on historical data, the beta bot has been trained to address the most frequent queries customers search for on singaporeair.com or reach out to reservations offices for. Using variations of actual questions received from customers, Kris responses have been fine-tuned through rounds of iterations using artificial intelligence, with the aim of training the bot to provide conversational replies that can meet the needs of customers promptly and efficiently. SIA has been progressively enhancing its digital capabilities and the development of Kris was led by an in-house team.
SIA is committed to offering our customers more choices and greater convenience in how they engage with us - at any time of the day or night. Kris will be under constant development as we further develop its knowledge library based on what our customers are most frequently reaching out to us for, said Marvin Tan, Senior Vice President Customer Services & Operations. Customer preferences are changing and with Kris we are taking feedback into account by expanding our servicing platforms beyond traditional contact centre and email channels.

On unjust, unfair, and revengeful act by her opponent, Sirimavo made a short farewell speech and left her seat amidst cat-calls and indecent remarks from some government members; the expelled worlds first woman Head of State was leaving the chamber un-accompanied as the other six SLFP MPs boycotted the sittings; S. Sivasithamparam and A. Amirthalingam, the two gentlemen parliamentarians rose from their seats to escort her out of the floor of the House.
The process of judicial manoeuvring and political manipulations practised in carrying out the worst political faux pas of post-independent Sri Lanka represented yet another blow to parliamentary democracy.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the worlds first woman Head of State who made a tremendous contribution to the development of international relations was deprived of her civic rights. She was expelled from Parliament by JR, under a Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry Law No. 7 of 1978, which was passed in Parliament on October 16, 1980. At the Cabinet meeting, Gamini Dissanayake, Ananda Tissa de Alwis and S Thondaman spoke against imposing civic disabilities on Sirimavo. Sir John Kotalawala, the 85-year-old ailing ex-Prime Minister, personally made representations on behalf of her; but JR was adamant.
Abuse and misuse of power
President JR feared that people would rally round Sirimavo in the future, as she was gifted with the charisma that he totally lacked: This most influential and dangerous opponent had to be distanced from the political arena if the UNP rule were to continue unhindered, JR concluded. Further, removing Sirimavo from political activity, the splitting up within the SLFP would be motivated.
The old-fox in his own incomparable style designed his strategy. The sole objective of this post facto legislation was the removal of Sirimavo Bandaranaike from the political scenery. On March 29, 1978, the President appointed a Special Presidential Commission consisting of two Supreme Court judges and a member of the lower judiciary to inquire and report on quite a few matters stated in a warrant that enclosed the Sirimavo headed United Front government of 1970-77.
Sirimavo was indicted and was summoned before the Commission which held its sittings at Queens Club, Bullers Road, to answer charges of abuse and misuse of power and corruption. Her lawyers challenged seeking a Writ of Prohibition from Appeal Court on the jurisdiction of the Commission on several grounds. Sirimavo made a lengthy statement saying that she had rational grounds to believe that no practical purpose would be served by appearing in it and that she honestly believed it would not be a fair trial. The SPC continued proceedings ex parte.
She did not remain there but withdrew from the proceedings of the Commission.
A C de Zoysa led the team of lawyers that prosecuted Sirimavo before the Commission. In his opening address, he made more of a vituperative speech that fitted a political platform than for a commission of inquiry. He made accusations against the lady but failed to lead evidence. The Court of Appeal granted a Writ against the Commission, stating that the SPC inquiry Law was not retrospective in its function. A superior Courts may invalidate the laws and rules of the legislature if found incompatible with a higher norm. Accordingly, an inquiry of a period before the enactment of the law was declared beyond its jurisdiction.
The Appeal court verdict did not in any way discourage the fortitude of JR. He came back with distinctive swiftness. Two bills labelled as being Urgent were promptly presented and hurried through Parliament; the first quashing the Court of Appeal verdict and the second for an amendment to the new Constitution. The amendment, the first of its kind was made retroactive from 7th September 1978, deprived the higher Courts of its jurisdiction in any potential writ applications! A. Amirthalingam, Leader of the Opposition, speaking on the two bills said,
it is deplorable, the amendment has retrospective effect and, worse still, annulled a decision of the Appeal Court; in doing so the government was setting Parliament up as a court of Supreme Court.  Hansard; Nov 10. 1978
In September 1980, the Commission found Sirimavo guilty of abuse or misuse of power in of six of the ten counts made against her. The Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry in terms of Section 9 of the Act recommended imposition of civic disability and consequent expulsion from the Parliament.
Sirimavos way out from politics
The President was engaged in an exercise of demoting, promoting and even discontinuing Judges of SC and the High Court; he taught a lesson to the Court of Appeal bench who allowed Sirimavos writ application, by nullifying their verdict through the Parliament. JR also communicated an indirect but clear message to the rest of the gentlemen of judiciary when good fortune awaited the three members of the Special Presidential Commission, who suggested Sirimavos way out from politics. Justice Weeraratne was placed 5th in the hierarchy, a jump of 4 places, and Justice Sharvananda leapt from fourteenth to the sixth position that helped him to become CJ before his retirement, which did not end there; he was made the Governor of Western Province on retirement. The other, the DC judge was honoured with a Court of Appeal posting, over many senior colleagues.
Participating in the debate on expulsion, Amirthalingam, leader of the Opposition and TULF stated that,
the only forum before which political offences of this type can be agitated is the forum of the hustings. The people have given the verdict. People have returned Sirimavo Bandaranaike to this House. You must respect the judgment passed by the masses of Attanagalla. You have no right now to sit in judgment on what the voters of Attanagalla have done. Retrospectively and retro-actively you are creating offences and are meting out punishment which is not in keeping with the fundamental rights you have guaranteed and which are a violation of the Universal Charter of Human Rights.
Sirimavo took oaths as the PM of Sri Lanka in 1994, when the SLFP led Peoples Alliance was back in the saddle, and this happened during the lifetime of J. R. Jayewardene, proving that no political movement with a mass base and charismatic leadership can be destroyed by attacking a leader; a lesson our politicos will never learn.

SLs internet penetration far below average in Asia - study
Sri Lankas intranet penetration is far below the average internet penetration in Asia, a study by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) said.
Sri Lanka currently has over 6 million internet users. With a population of 20.9 million, this represents an internet penetration rate of approximately 32%, which is below the average penetration of 46.7% in Asia. Of the many factors influencing internet usage, language plays a key role. With Sinhalese and Tamil being the languages mainly used and English as the main foreign language in Sri Lanka, accessing the internet using Latin script (English letters A-Z) can be a barrier. However, this could change in the near future, thanks to a group of local volunteers. They will be working on a proposal to allow internet access in Sinhala script. Their efforts will pave the way towards better access to the multilingual internet for non-English speaking Sri Lankans in a secure and stable manner.
Another important development that is shaping the future of the internet is the expansion of top-level domains. There are now over 1,200 generic top-level domains (e.g. COM, .ORG, .PHONE, HOTELS, etc.) in use - enabling greater competition, choice and innovation.
This expansion is one of the biggest changes ever in the history of the internet and brings additional opportunities to businesses, communities and brands around the world.

SLMC condemns US for naming Jerusalem
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has condemned the decision by the United States President to recognise the City of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
"On behalf of the SLMC, I wish to reiterate that we subscribe to the universally accepted legitimate claim and assertion that Jerusalem is the shared capital of Israel and the state of Palestine. This has been the collective demand of the International Community endeavouring to witness peace. This is also the position of the government of Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said in a statement.
"We applaud the statement by Foreign Minister Tilak Marapane, who on the record firmly differed from the position expounded by the US President who tilted the status quo by announcing the recognition of the City as the capital of Israel while the people of Palestine are yet deprived of Palestinian statehood.
"We must understand that the histories of Palestine, Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem is far removed from Arab history and Arab States which are traced to Colonial cartography. These are ancient lands of ancient people whose destinies are yet to be resolved. Jerusalem is house of one God, two peoples and the temple of three faiths. The new US position only aggravates the differences and does not encourage Israel to negotiate with the people of Palestine in a spirit of compromise. The US decision, unilaterally taken, not only violates United Nations resolutions but has the potential to alter the character or the status of Jerusalem or the long standing principles and could seriously undermine all the peace efforts in the region.
"Therefore, we urge the United States government to rescind this decision that violates international legitimacy and could dampen the prospect of peace,"the statement said.

Sri Lanka Tourism online  licensing wins E-Swabhimani Award
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) was adjudged the winner in the Government and Citizen Engagement category at the E-Swabhimani award ceremony, organised by the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), at Hotel Galadari in Colombo recently.
The event ceremony, held for the seventh consecutive year this time, aimed to bolster digital application development in the country and to create awareness among the general public on the need to move government services into the digital space.
The SLTDA was recognized for its Online Tourism Business Licensing Service (OTBLS) which caterers to the booming tourism sector of the country.
The key objective of the solution is to project tourism business licensing -a mandatory requirement by law for tourism service providers - as an online service, making the process more efficient and accessible to any tourism business from any part of the country.
The fact that the SLTDA has discontinued its offline licensing process and has opted to rely solely on the platform was recognised and appreciated by the panel of judges who stated it would ensure that a smooth and well-monitored workflow system.
The platform also has an extranet which allows applicants to check the status of the application or renewal and receive status alerts on their submission via SMS and email. The licensing system also uses the Lanka Government Payment Services (LGPS) as the mechanism to accept online payments.
Currently, Sri Lanka Tourism caters to over 3,400 tourism businesses ranging from large five start hotel chains, travel agents to home-stays scattered all over the country and over 3,000 individuals who have been registered as tour guides.

## Title: A thing of beauty
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, December 13, 2017 - 01:00
A thing of beauty
Over the years, the term beauty has given rise to many a concept of varying types. Once the great art critic, Dr Ananda Coomaraswamy, wrote a fascinating resourceful essay titled as Beauty is a state. He underlined several aspects of the concepts on the beauty that paved the way to observe several symbolic references to the literary and art concepts as laid down by great oriental thinkers, creators and aesthetes.
This also paved the way to bring out so far hidden meanings into the term beauty. The art critics had the added advantage of developing their outlook via the contents. It is recorded that one of the closest followers of Coomaraswamys thinking process had been the American scholar Susan Sontag, who also wrote a resourceful essay titled as beauty which appeared in several periodicals inclusive of Atlantis and Harpers and most particularly in her widely praised collection of essays titled as On Photography (1976). Sontag in her essay beauty reveals her extraordinary ability to understand and interpret modern art with special reference to the concept of beauty as accepted and as alternative ways of perception.
Penetrative visions
In this essay, at the outset, she says that for Greeks beauty was a virtue: a kind of excellence. One of the most penetrative visions laid down by Sontag goes as follows.
If it did occur to the Greeks to distinguish between a persons inside and outside, they still expected that inner beauty would be matched by the beauty of the other kind.
The ideology is developed as a comparison. For the young Athenians who gathered around the great teacher, Socrates, found it quite paradoxical that their hero was so intelligent, so brave, so honourable, and so seductive.
But Socrates was not a good looking person. One may have called him ugly, a term used against the term beauty. At one moment of his teaching, Plato the pupil records on what beauty is, and what ugly is. Can a physical appearance be termed as beautiful and ugly
Sontag takes the cue from Socrates to analyse her concept of beauty. It is in the very inception, a pleasing term and used from the long past. Coming down the centuries, the analysis and interpretation of beauty have taken different trends. As Sontag points out: It was principally the influence of Christianity that deprived beauty of the central place it had in classical ideals of human excellence. By limiting excellence (virtus in Latin) to moral only, Christianity set beauty. Adrift, as an alienated arbitrary, superficial enchantment.
Beholders beauty
As such according to Sontag, beauty has continued to lose prestige.
The views held by Susan Sontag may sometimes sound as far searching and perhaps lay a controversy. Still, the question arises on what actually is the beauty. Does it not rest in the eyes of the beholder Quite a number of proverbs emerge from the concept of beauty over the years. I had the chance of collecting a few for my own self-study.
1. Beauty is only skin deep.
2. Beauty is only one layer (Japanese proverb).
3. Beauty may have fair leaves, yet better fruit.
4. Beauty opens locked doors.
5. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder (a sentiment that has beentraced back to the Greek poet Theocritus (3rd Century BC).
6. A thing of beauty if a joy forever (the first line of Keats poem Endymion.
Coming back to Sontag, a pretty good-looking woman is termed as a beauty. But when it comes to a man the term used is handsome. This is the masculine equivalent of beauty. But it is not only the terms that differ. But the concepts too differ from culture to culture. Extending the original meaning of beauty, the concepts are applied to paintings, poetry, and underlying conceptual meanings in aesthetics. The writing down of a beautiful phrase may evoke various communication meanings adduced to the changing concepts of beauty. The term belles lettre in French may mean beautiful writings.
Persuasive power
The privileges of beauty are immense, said the Cocteau the writer. On this matter, Sontag states that to be sure, beauty is a form of power, a persuasive power. It is not the power to do, but the power to attract. This power is not one that can be chosen freely.
In this manner, one can broaden the accepted and traditional patterns of meanings attributed to beauty and the underlying concepts linked. The changing meanings of beauty are traced. Inevitably, one is reminded of the age-old fairytale that goes as beauty and the beast that lurks in the canons of literature in many oriental and occidental cultures. The underlined theme is the transformation of a beast (or an ugly man) through the visionary beauty of a young girl who helps the beast showing the all-pervading kindness and compassion. The same theme is twisted in many a poem, drama and narratives in many ways. So the theme beauty is much more than a mere parable or a saying.

The Railway unions will decide on whether to continue with the strike or not based on their meeting with the Ministerial Sub-Committee on the railway issue chaired by Dr Sarath Amunugama, scheduled to be held at 9.00 am today (13).
We will continue the strike until a favourable agreement is reached, said Railway Guards Union, President Janaka Fernando speaking to the Daily News.
The Union members also refused to accept their vacated post letters yesterday bringing action against the unions to a stalemate.
You cannot remove us and we will not accept it, was the defiant stance taken by the unions as explained that the letter did not come into effect if the employees do not officially accept it.
According to the law, the original letter of vacated posts is given to the employee, and a copy is filed in office. The copy does not become valid if the employee refuses to accept it,he said. If the Department is to send the letter through registered post, then too only the person it is addressed to can legally accept it,
Even if a family member accepted the letter on behalf of the employee, the Department cannot state that the letter has been accepted by the employee, thus he remains in employment, Fernando said.
We are permanent employees and there are certain procedures that need to be met to remove us, the Union leader further said.
The Unions have been on strike since December 8 citing salary discrepancies and problems in the Engine Driver Assistant recruitment exams.

Tusker killers further remanded
The nine suspects arrested on charges of killing the tusker Dala Poottuwa were remanded till December 26 by the Mahawa Magistrates Court yesterday.
Among the nine suspects currently detained in connection with the incident are three Grama Niladharis. The magistrate also rejected a request to bring the tusks and the elephant pearls currently in the custody of courts to Colombo for investigations.
The killing of the tusker came to light when two elephant tusks were seized at Polpithigama in Nikawewa by officers of the Panadura Walana Anti Vice Squad recently. The seizing of the two tusks and six elephant pearls (Gaja Muthu) shed light into the disappearance of the tusker Dala Poottuwa in Galgamuwa as a search for the tusker carried out by Wildlife officials had drawn a blank.
There had been no trace of the elephant since it was last seen on the banks of the Herathgama Wewa in Moragollagama on October 16. The tusker had lost vision in both eyes and had some debility on its left hind leg. Wildlife officials and the Police later arrested the eight suspects after interrogating the persons arrested in connections with the detections of the tusks. They also found the carcass of the tusker inside the jungle.

Two brothers sentenced to death for patricide
Two brothers who were found guilty of killing their father 21 years ago were sentenced to death by the Negombo High Court Judge Ravindra Amal Ranaraja recently.
Warnakulasuriya Kithsiri Premalal Ranjith Fernando and Warnakulasuriya Preethi Sanath Collin Mathew Fernando alias Suddhiya of Bulawatte, Waikkal, Wennappuwa were the accused sentenced to death.
They had killed their father, Warnakulasuriya James Fernando of Bolawatta, Waikkal, on or around February 8, 1996.
High Court Judge Ravindra Amal Ranaraja, who held the non summary inquiry into the case in his capacity as Chilaw High Court Judge, gave the judgement in his capacity as the Negombo High Court Judge.
Recording evidence in the case began as the two accused pleaded not guilty.
The plaintiffs submitted that the father had two wives.
He had two sons (the accused) and two daughters by his first wife and two others by his second wife.
The father had been constantly harassing the two accused and on the day in question he had summoned the first accused to his house and assaulted him. When he wailed in pain, the second accused had rushed and the two had hit the father with a club after stabbing him with two sharp implements.
The father had succumbed to his injuries on admission to hospital.
The first accused in his evidence said he killed his father due to sudden provocation as he assaulted him.
The second accused submitted that he killed the father and the first accused was not involved in the murder.
Both accused were given death sentence since they were proved guilty beyond doubt, the judge said in his judgement.

UK inflation rate rises to 3.1%
Inflation rose to 3.1% in November, the highest in nearly six years, as the squeeze on households continued.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that airfares and computer games contributed to the increase.
The most recent data shows that average weekly wages are growing at just 2.2%.
Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will now have to write a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond explaining how the Bank intends to bring inflation back to its 2% target.
Carney has to write a letter to the chancellor if the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate is above 3% or below 1%.
In November, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the first time in more than a decade from 0.25% to 0.5%.
However, it is not expected to announce a further increase when it publishes the results of the Monetary Policy Committees two-day meeting on Thursday.
Carney had said that he expected inflation to peak in October or November.
The last time he wrote to the chancellor was in December 2016, after inflation fell to 0.9% in October that year.
His latest letter will be published in February, when the Bank of England will also release its quarterly Inflation Report.
Lucy OCarroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said: Its quite possible that inflation is now close to its peak. But some of the latest surveys suggest that service sector costs and prices are rising. Given how dominant services are in the economy, this could feed through to inflation overall.
That means that further interest rate rises are definitely not off the table.
The ONS said that although airfares fell in November - down 10.4% - the decline was not as steep as last year when they tumbled 13.4%.
Data also shows that food inflation has picked up, especially prices for fish, oil and fats, such as butter and chocolate.
Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics, said that the rise in inflation had come at precisely the wrong time for retailers.
In the run-up to Christmas, the cost of living, now rising at the fastest rate in five years, remains uncomfortably high for households.

Uncanny resemblance
Nothing gets past Beyoncs fans. Known collectively as the Beyhive, theyre infamous for their fierce defence of their idol and - woe betide the poor fool who decides to mess with either them or their hero.
This even includes Beyoncs own dad. And Piers Morgan. But even the ever-observant Beyhive have been hoodwinked by Brittany Williams, who bears such a strong resemblance to Beyonc that even fans cant tell them apart.
On the similarities between the two, Brittany, from Detroit, said: She sings, dances, writes and I am gifted in the same ways; were both strong dominant women, fearless, and God fearing.
As for the attention shes been getting, its been pretty extreme at time.
I get approached all the time; whether it be on planes, at the airport or while attending events. Ive also been chased, had pictures taken of me without my consent and pranks done without me knowing. A group of women once chased me and my friend to our car and began singing Single Ladies, beating my friends car with the heels of their shoes until we rolled down the window and took a picture with them.
While at first it was unnerving, now Brittany takes it all in her stride.
Im just a cool, stylish, smart, witty girl with a vision, confidence, and ambition. Im still dreaming that God will allow my visions to come to fruition. He has blessed me so much.
Could she even have designs on fame herself Watch out Beyonc...

When does your smartphone need a new battery
Good screen size Check. Hundreds of downloadable apps Check. Tons of memory Sure thing. Great battery life Not so fast. One of the biggest pain points for mobile phone users these days is battery life. While 8-10 hours of power seems at first blush to be a remarkable improvement over just a few years ago, a few long conversations with your bestie and a couple hours of Netflix binge-watching will drop that battery LED or on-screen meter down to zero in no time. Thankfully, external batteries and power banks from brands such a Mophie and Plantronics can give you extra juice when needed.
But what if you've just charged your Samsung or other smartphone and still aren't getting any juice That could indicate you need either a replacement battery or replacement phone. While the vast majority of smartphones today use rechargeable lithium ion, or Li-ion batteries, they're not created equally. Like all rechargeables, cell phone batteries eventually lose their charge faster over time or don't take a charge at all. There are several ways to determine if the cell phone needs a new battery.
The phone is dead
This may be an obvious one. Either you accidentally damaged your phone by dropping it or dunking it in water for too long, or the battery is dead. If you've eliminated the first as a culprit, check to see if it shows no sign of power - nothing lights up, no sound, nada. If the phone shows no signs of life after charging with a reliable charger, it's time to call it: your battery is dead.
There is a good chance that the battery may need to be replaced. Some manufacturers like Samsung sell models that let the user replace a battery with a Samsung OEM Original Standard Battery or a third-party brand that is compatible. The Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Galaxy S5, for instance, have this option, while the newer Samsung Galaxy S7 does not. Apple, another top manufacturer, keeps batteries behind a sealed case with the iPhone 6s and earlier models. You have to take the phone into an authorized store for repair or replacement.
The phone only shows power when plugged inIf the battery is bad, it does not hold a charge to power the phone from its stored energy. However, if the phone functions properly, the phone may still power up when a power source is connected.
If the phone does not power up after it has had time to charge thoroughly, it is more than likely time to get a new battery, or you can purchase an external battery like the Mophie or USB-powered devices that use lithium-polymer technology to deliver 3000 mAh or more capacity to your phone - good for many hours of average use.
The phone dies quickly
The phone may charge for the recommended amount of time, show a full charge, and then die long before those 10 hours manufacturers advertised. Don't forget about usage. Those advertised times typically are for average usage; manufacturers like Apple and Samsung may say in the fine print what they battery life is if you're playing video all day long - or they may not.
If you're a digital gamer, listen to Spotify or iTunes all day, surf the Web frequently or are simply in an area where service is so poor that your phone is constantly "turning on" to find a signal from a cellular tower, expect your battery to drain faster than advertised.
Either plug the phone in where possible and use it while charging or consider purchasing a power bank.
If none of these situations apply and your phone still dies quickly after a full charge, the battery probably is bad and needs to be replaced.
The phone or battery starts to feel hot
Rechargeable batteries inevitably generate heat as they charge. However, most rechargeable batteries internalize the heat, thereby shielding it from becoming noticeably hot. If it starts to become hot to the touch, it may be time to consider a new battery.
Then, too, consider the ambient temperature near your phone. A hot sun might be the culprit.
The battery bulges
Sometimes, when a battery goes bad, the internal cells rupture, and cause a bulge to appear in the battery. You see this when you hold the battery up or see a bulge on the casing.
Additionally, a bulge makes it able to spin like a top when placing the battery on a flat surface. - www.ebay.com

Who should live and die
Life is a gift we have received. We are thankful to our parents that we are given a chance to live this life. It is not what we chose, our parents considered every child as a wanted child. And now with the development of medical technology, we can detect Anomalies when the baby is in the mothers womb.
As a result of it if there is a foetal impairment, so-called Incompatible with Life, one of the options is to kill the child while in the uterus also called termination of pregnancy.
The sad part is that rather than using medical technology to heal the disease we doctors are killing the child to be born due to the limitations of medical science. Rather than taking the challenge to help the child live a quality life.
The dangers of this trend coming to our country are going to be a danger to the children to be born in the future. As there is a high chance that they may not get a chance to be born
This is a serious decision the doctor puts on the parents where they will decide to kill their own child as the doctor can not cure the disease. This adds to the mental trauma where they suffer from the guilt of killing their own foetus. This painful silent suffering goes on until the end of the parents' lives.
But if we doctors respect human life from the moment of conception until natural death. We have done our best to preserve and respect life. Even if the child dies after birth.
The parents and the Doctor can sleep peacefully saying honestly to their conscience that I have done my best to preserve life.
And the other reality which we must understand humbly is the fact that man is born to make mistakes wrong judgments, diagnosis and prognostic outcomes. As some foetal impairments cannot be diagnosed with 100% accuracy while the baby is growing inside the mother.
Thus a child who will have a chance to live might also be killed by the doctor.
I would like to discuss some of the conditions justifying killing (Termination of pregnancy) that are recommended by the medical professionals as Osteo genesis imperfecta (Brittle bone disease). Where the baby is more prone to have many fractures and this disease has many types, and some types are compatible with life.
Douglas John Herland was a person born with osteogenesis imperfecta. He won the bronze medal at the 1984 summer Olympics. He also promoted adaptive rowing for the disabled. Luckily for him, his parents never thought of him as incompatible with life and a burden to society. Douglas lived for nearly 40 years.
Potters Syndrome is a condition where the foetus has no developed kidneys. And as a result, there is less amniotic fluid and the foetus gets compressed inside the uterus. Thus the air passage is not formed well. According to doctors 100% the child will die, so they advise to kill the child while the baby is growing inside the mother.
But this is what Jaime Herrera Beutler, a US Republican Congresswoman, and her husband did when she was told that her baby has potters disease. And the doctors advised killing the growing baby inside her; she refused and went to a different doctor at John Hopkins in Baltimore who was willing to try a treatment that could potentially save the foetus. The doctor injected multiple doses of normal saline into the congress womans abdomen (uterus) creating enough fluid for the baby lungs to develop. Abigail was born. According to Dr Steven Alexander a paediatric kidney specialist, she was on dialysis. And her father donated the kidney and Abigail is alive still. So who are doctors to decide who should die
Osteochondrodysplasia is a general term for disorders of the development of bone and cartilage. Achondroplasia, commonly called Dwarfism, is also included in this which is not a disease incompatible with life.
Thus where the proper boundaries, the indications for killing the foetus is not clear-cut, these should be killed and these should be preserved. Authorities should be more responsible in these grave and serious matters. As innocent healthy babies will also get killed.
Another mistake the Law Commission of Sri Lanka has made on this serious issue is that post-mortem examination of the killed baby is not included to be sure that the diagnosis of the doctor was accurate. If he has made a mistake of killing a healthy child proper legal action should be taken against the doctor.
Rashmi Gunawardena was born with only one leg. She writes with her only foot. She was the only student to pass the grade 5 scholarship exam with 153 marks for the last 10 years from Deloluwa junior school. If this law was there, chances of Rashmi being born a life would be grim.
It is very unfortunate that doctor does not understand that going against the natural law and against nature will be the downfall of humanity.
Finally, I would like to remind the doctors of the Hippocratic oath which we stood by specifically spells out not to do an Abortion and to safeguard human life from the very moment of conception.
And the other fact the people of this country should be aware is that abortion harms the womans body in many ways. It is safe to continue the pregnancy to term and deliver, quote Jeffcoat gynaecology
Always remember Abortion is always safe for the doctor because it is not his body he is doing the procedure on. But it is the woman who has to live with the short and long-term consequences of an Abortion.
Killing the foetus is, of course, the easy way out. But preserving life is difficult. But what we have to do is the correct thing. Not what is convenient for us!

Why 'Coco' is so much more than your average box office hit

A little boy wielding a special guitar has made beautiful music at the box office since "Coco" debuted in theaters last month.
But how is it Pixar's charming, Mexico-set animated film "Coco," which highlights a culture on the other side of a border wall the current administration aims to expand, found its way to triumph in the age of Trump
Like the film itself, the answer has a tapestry of colors.
Authenticity
"Coco," which is now the No. 1 film at the box office for the third weekend in a row, follows the story of Miguel Rivera, a Mexican child who explores his family's past onDia de los Muertos.
Anthony Gonzalez voices Miguel. Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt and Renee Victor also star.
In pursuit of his love for music, Miguel embarks on a story that touches on themes of family, ambition, loss, and legacy -- qualities, of course, that can be found in essentially all of Pixar's greatest hits.
But "Coco" has struck a special nerve with Latino audiences, who have been fighting to reclaim the narrative about their culture long before the idea of President Donald Trump even became a possibility.
Of course, he certainly hasn't helped.
Since the start of his campaign, Trump has come under fire on multiple occasions for his various characterizations of Mexican immigrants, particularly his comments portraying them as "rapists" and criminals.
Claudia Puig, president of theLos Angeles Film CriticsAssociation, sees "Coco" as a sort of "soothing tonic for a community that's really been beleaguered and disrespected."
"For us Latinos, it's almost like a rebuke to Trump and the way he sees Mexicans as problematic and horribly stereotyped," she said. "This movie is showing a completely different side."
"Coco's" success should only be thought a surprise in that a film like this has taken so long to become a reality.
Much of its beauty is in its details.
Anabuelitawho will straighten any sticky situation with the use of herchancla. ADia de los Muertosaltar surrounded by plates ofpan dulce. A child whose loving family attempts to bulk his slender frame with an overwhelming amount oftamales.
Then there's the fact that the film feels no need to translate any of the Spanish words.
"They're really small details but they mean a lot," Puig said.
Success and what's next
"Coco's" success could prove to mean a lot too.
The film has secured the top spot at the Box Office each weekend since it opened on Nov. 22. This weekend, it earned another $18.3 million, adding to a domestic total that has now reached $135.5 million. The film has grossed more than $250 million internationally.
In Mexico, where it opened Oct. 27, the film grossed 1.07 billion pesos (or $56.1 million) in just 20 days, becoming the highest grossing film of all time, in local currency. The record was previously held by "The Avengers," which made 827 million pesos during its run.
The animated film also has yet to be released in some major international markets. It opens in Australia on December 26, in Brazil on January 4, and in the United Kingdom on January 19.
The film's success comes at the end of a year during which Latinx creators have thrived.
"Despacito" broke streaming records. Netflix successfully rebooted classic sitcom "One Day a Time" with a Latino family at the center and will debut a second season on January 26. Lin-Manuel Mirandacontinued to exist.
The question is one of momentum -- how to turn this big moment for Latinx in entertainment into a new normal. (Latinx is a gender-neutral term for Latino.)
Gloria Calderon-Kellett, executive producer of Netflix's "One Day at a Time," is "cautiously optimistic" that it's possible.
"It speaks more to quality content and the ability for Latino stories to live within, let's say, a world like Pixar and Disney," she told CNN. "They have such an incredible banner of quality storytelling that when they embrace the Latino story, [the result is] so good. It just speaks to keeping your head down and continuing to do the work, which is what we need to do as storytellers."
Calderon-Kellett continues to do her part. In addition to the new season of "One Day at a Time," she's producing a comedy pilot for CBS centered on a Latinx family called "History of Them."
The project, which also has an African American character and an East Indian character, has placed Calderon-Kellett in a position in which she says she's having to "practice what I preach."
She's making an effort to seek out writers from those two backgrounds in hopes of having people in her writer's room who can speak to those experiences. Like with her search for Latinx writers for previous projects, she's found she has had to put forth more effort to find African American and East Indian writers because agencies don't typically have a deep well of them at the ready.
"I only knew that about Latinos," she said. "I feel my eyes are really opened. It makes me want to, in my future work, not just represent Latinos."
Bernal, whoreportedlydedicated the film to children living "with a lot of fear" due to the "narrative" that's been painted about their culture, told CNN the beauty of "Coco" lies in the message of "interconnection."
"This is what will only save us -- humanity. The only thing that will save us is this connection"

President tells religious leaders
Work for reconciliation and religious co-existence
As leaders of the four main religions in the country convened to discuss peace, President Sirisena appealed to them to use their sermons and influence to preach reconciliation and religious co-existence to their respective congregations.
Today, we are gathered here because deep down we know that we have a problem in this country, said President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the Religious Coexistence Convention held at the BMICH yesterday.
The Convention sought to bring all communities together to promote peace and religious coexistence in the country.
The ethnic and religious conflicts in this country resulted in a 30-year war. The war was ended through a military solution. Our Forces were able to defeat a separatist terrorist organisation but we have not managed to defeat the beliefs that led to it, the President said.
Though the idea of separatism has not been openly dealt within the country, the President noted that this belief was very much alive in international fora.
We all know that ideas and beliefs cannot be defeated with arms. It can only be replaced with a better, more positive belief, he added.
In order to accomplish this, he stressed on the need to have dialogue and conventions such as these. An educated society, will be able to choose the right path and the more positive option through debate and discussion, believed the President.
I strongly believe that our local temples and religious institutions do not preach conflict. The religious leaders always try to direct the people in the right direction. All philosophies, be it Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism and Christianity, strive try to correct society, he said.
But we now lack religious co-existence in our society and thus we need to address it, he added.
The main reasons why we have this situation is suspicion and fear created between various religious and ethnic groups.
The President stressed that the government was committed to promote religious coexistence. All societies, he said have extremists in their midst- but this is a minority.
The vision and direction of religious leaders is very important to us in at this juncture. They can calm society, bring in peace and direct them in the right path.
We are seeking the advice of religious leaders in our development path, said President Sirisena further.
The Government has formed national religious co-existence organisations to deal with local conflicts. At the district level, these organizations will function under the leadership of the District Secretariat and bring together people of all religious and ethnic groups to resolve issues which arise at the local level. This would also be extended to smaller groups being formed under the divisional secretariat level, the President said.
The President was happy to note that whilst some would ridicule the idea of reconciliation, the majority of people in the country today were aware of what reconciliation and co-existence is.
I am positive about our future, and let us all fulfil our duty, let us all commit to this, said the President.
It is then that we can achieve; real and long lasting peace, where there will be no more war.
