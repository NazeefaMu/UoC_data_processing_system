Special effects and a great story
It all began in 2008 with Tony Stark developing that famed red suit that would save the world. Not to forget those cocky one-liners that accompanied each successful Iron Man mission. The Hulk transitioned from Edward Norton (2008) to settle on the affable Mark Ruffalo (2012). Despite being a villain, Tom Hiddlestons Loki catapulted to fame, perhaps more than his brother Thor (2011) played by Chris Hemsworth. Then we watched Captain America go from puny everyday man to an immortal patriotic soldier in the same year. Parks and Recreations pudgy Chris Pratt transformed into the hunky Peter Quill/ Star-Lord for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 (2014). Last year, Paul Rudd took matters into his (literally) shrunken hands in AntMan. And most recently, they all came together to battle out their opinions in Captain America: Civil War after two Avengers films and plenty of other sequels.
Quest to heal
There have been a staggering 13 films in Marvels cinematic universe. The latest offering is a new superhero, one that makes all the others seem ordinary. Especially since the films protagonist has the inimitable ability to breathe new life into characters. After all, Benedict Cumberbatch did do for BBC Ones Sherlock Holmes what no one else could have done.
With the latest Marvel marvel, were introduced to Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), an arrogant, self-centred neurosurgeon who thinks he can do no wrong.
Its his fear of failure thats compelling him to constantly succeed. A terrible accident leaves the brilliant doctor with mangled arms that have enough of nerve damage to ensure he doesnt enter the operation theatre for a long, long time.
A quest to heal leads Strange to a secret compound named Kamar-Taj in Kathmandu, where he encounters The Ancient One, a striking sorcerer played by a bald Tilda Swinton. With the help of fellow sorcerer Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Doctor Strange is transformed from an arrogant human into a powerful mystical being.
As with any good story, the conflict in this film comes in the form of The Ancient Ones rogue pupil, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots who aim to unleash the power of Dormammu (also played by an uncredited Cumberbatch) of the Dark Dimension onto the world.
Essentially, this will result in the loss of time paving the way for immortality and of course, plenty of death and destruction.
Mind-bending visual effects
Doctor Strange has plenty of action to keep you entertained; theres hand-to-hand combat, mystical weapons, explosions and exciting fights, enough to avoid blinking lest you miss a moment. The Ancient Ones fight scenes are perhaps the coolest with a suave Swinton barely breaking a bead of sweat while effortlessly annihilating her enemies. Then there are the mind-bending visual effects where the world literally turns on itself; one battle sequence has New York transform into a river of glass buildings. And the films Mirror dimension brings the beauty of the comic books to life  in technicolour.
As for Doctor Strange, Cumberbatch perfectly encapsulates his characters fall from grace and his eventual rise into a superhero who accepts his purpose to save lives using mystical abilities. It does help that hes hilarious along the way. Some of the best lines are saved for Strange trying to make Kamar-Tajs sombre librarian Wong (Benedict Wong) crack a smile. Even his climactic encounter with the big bad Dormammu has giggle-inducing moments. But perhaps most endearing is Stranges relationship with the Cloak of Levitation, a mystical coat thats alive (and kicks the bad guys behinds), akin to a loving pet.
Marvels Doctor Strange subverts the usual superhero trope, focusing on the universal lessons of quashing the ego and rising above it while giving the audience everything theyd need in a film adapted from a comic book. Theres grandiosity, humour, cockiness, plenty of dishy actors and a plot that will capture attention. Once the adrenaline of the effects and thrills has settled, youll see that this Marvel film doesnt simply entertain. Dont gasp just as yet, but there are plenty of spiritual undertones lurking in plain view, only if youre willing to see. If not, its still a great two hours of non-stop fun.

Is Anushka Sharma the new Kareena Kapoor
With Kareena Kapoor Khan on maternity leave, has showbiz found a worthy successor in Anushka Sharma Indicators from her career certainly indicate that. Anushka has found her definite space on top of the marquee. Shes making a name in big budget films with big ticket superstars like Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and even when she pairs with the new crop, like Ranbir Kapoor or Ranveer Singh, she goes home with hosannas.
Anushkas career catapulted into the big league when her film with Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif, Yash Chopras Jab Tak Hai Jaan became one of the biggest hits of 2012. In 2014, her much hyped film with Aamir Khan, PK, shattered every known box office record in India as well as overseas. And now 2016 has proved to be even more bountiful as Anushkas big releases, Sultan with Salman Khan and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil with Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have fast tracked to box office success.

Hrithik to turn director soon
Is Hrithik Roshan planning to turn director soon Going by the interest level he showed behind the camera during the shooting of Kaabil, it would seem Duggu is keen on a career shift.
His proud father Rakesh confirms, Hrithik will surely direct a film, although I cant say when. He has assisted me on several of my films before he was launched as a hero in Kaho Na Pyaar Hai. So you could say he has been training in direction for a very long time. However, he discounts any suggestion that he or Hrithik contributed in any way to the direction of Kaabil. He insists that he and his son worked with director Sanjay Gupta purely in a collaborative spirit.
I went to the sets only on the first day to give the first clap. After that, it was Sanjay Guptas baby. But yes, our involvement was there throughout, as Sanjay, Hrithik and I were on the same page. There were no ego issues among us.

Jacqueline to set a Guinaness World Record
Jacqueline Fernandez with several hundred women will try to set a new Guinness World Record by holding an abdominal plank for 60 seconds at a garden in BKC. The 31-year-old actress, who has always promoted healthy living and eating, will headline the Do You campaign which is close to her heart.
Its a movement which aims to inspire confidence in young girls, encouraging them to express their inherent beliefs, follow their instincts, find their best self, and be who they are, unapologetically, Jacky told Mirror, pointing out that fitness is her way of loving herself.
The actress who plans to run the marathon next year is disturbed by the need to diet amongst young girls, pointing out that any kind of dieting without an exercise regimen to boost it is a waste of time. Our bodies shouldnt feel punished when we try to lose or gain weight. Its only when the body is happy and satisfied that we inch towards fitness, she explains.
Jacky is glad that with advancement in technology a woman doesnt need to squeeze herself into a corset or slip into a killer pair of stiletto to look presentable.
Today, its easy to find a pair of heels that are comfortable while making you feel like a diva on! says the youth icon who cant remember the last time she went into a tizzy over what not to wear or complained of sore feet.
Times have changed and so has the idea of fashion. We should do what we want, wear what we want and not let the world dictate our personal choices! she exclaims. With age, looks fade, health doesnt. Mumbai Mirror

ANANDA DABARES MAGIC ON STRINGS
It was awards night in shimmering splendor. And we forgot the heat and the buzz outside Bishop Collage Auditorium or the noisome birds perching around trees as the choir of Royal Collage rose harmoniously with that wonderful MESSIAH of UNTO US A CHILD Is Born, one great score by Hnadel reminding us that Christmas is around the corner. Surekha Amarasinghe who directed the massive choir gave us such a warm entry after the National Anthems of Sri Lanka and Brazil were sung.
The Associated Board of Royal School of music (Sri Lanka chapter) whose Sri Lanka Representative is Mano Chanmugam who in his short address after welcoming the Ambassador for Brazil, Her Excellency Elizabeth Sophie Mazella Di Bosco Balsa, said that music is the global language that bring people of all nations together where everyone blend into one large family of love and fellowship.
He is the untiring music genius that promote, encourage and revamp the classical music scene in Sri Lanka when more that 600,000 candidate in 93 countries take part annually. He inspires, innovate to develop all young and not so young only chase their dreams but make them a reality. He has seen generations of them not only through examinations but developing their skills and make awail opportunity to bare their talent not only in Sri Lanka but on international stage. His is the voice of music that innovate learning and helping hand to assist those who are in need by way of sponsorship and scholarships.
Pity I never had a god-father like him during our student days of music. But I am happy to be a Royal Colle brat though majority of my collegues were from Trinity college of music but as Mano said it is the language of the world We only had the illustrious Malini Jayasinghe Pieris in small mercy.
The Young Talent most of the students tonight opted for the violin and among them starting from little moppets, all the way their teacher was violin maestro Ananda Dabare whose magical touch inspired and elevated their feelings and emotion. From Grade 2 violin to grade 7, those who opted were Ayoush Senevirathna, Savini Perera, Anagi Gunasekara,Nashon de Alwis, Tiyani Sahabandu and Jascintha Richards among others. They all rose to the occasion and delighted their teachers apart from Ananda Dabare. Antonon Dvoraks Humoresque had the strings of Renuka Lianapathirana steady and in tone with the score. She was confident and poised without missing a note. This young performer ruchly deserved her award. She was presented by Dilpahan Mallikarachchi. She drove me to my early days of music when Humoresque was one of my favourite pieces and still is but of course I debuted on the piano. Dvorak was one of the top most Early Romantics and HUMORESQUE in G flat No. 7 ubiquitous was scored in 1894 was so popular that it was hacked, over-played and ruined but part of its fabric remained in classical aura on the violin as played by Renuka Liyanapathirana.
The star performer was Jascinta Richards. This talented young lady was presented in two categories of Grade 7, on the violin by John Willams with REMEMBRANCES FROM THE SCHINDLERS LIST ; on piano by Moritz Moszkowski with THE SPANISH DANCE No. 1 and snatched Grade 8 award for vocals with SONG TO THE MOON FROM RUSSIA by Antonin Dvorak. From juvenile level, it was marvelous but possible under the training of one of Sri Lankas virtostic pianists and of other talents, Briget Halpe whose commitment to the music scene and dedication has seen many generations of young talent bloom to heights.
I was fascinated by the cello playing of Saranga Cooray trained and presented by Savithri Jayethilake who was awarded the sole Diploma ABRSM that he richly deserved. He elected to play Vittorio Montis ZARDAS....... and the applause he received from the audience, said it all.
All award wineers were excellent no one surpassing the other in their catergories. The concert ended with the delightful Thivanthi Perera making all of us tap our feet to her rendering of RAGAMUFFIN.
It was very encouraging and should be applauded when Mano announced for the first time they had established ABRSM in Jaffna that produed two award winners and in the Galle Branch established two years had two high achievers beside the bulk from Colombo and Kandy; May be you will consider Chilaw as the next ABRSM-link. We have lot of talent over here. Congratulation to ABRSM and its icon. Mano Chanmugam. Gwen Herat

Could Brad Pitt and Rihanna strike up a romance after his divorce

Rihanna is newly single after splitting from Drake weeks ago following an on-and-off romance with the rapper.

As fans will likely recall, Pitt was recently targeted by an investigation after he allegedly got physical with his son, Maddox, during a plane ride from France to Los Angeles.
As the magazines report noted, Rihanna was the victim of domestic abuse in 2009 when her former boyfriend, Chris Brown, savagely beat her after an awards show in Los Angeles. So, when it comes to claims made against Brad Pitt, her friends are hoping she doesnt travel down a dangerous path.
While Brad Pitt has only been single for several weeks, Rihanna has reportedly had her eye on the actor for the past few years. According to the magazine, Rihanna has been a shadow lurking in Brad Pitts marriage since 2012, when the Work singer performed at his Make It Right charity concert in New Orleans.

Tunes powered by youth
The National Youth Orchestra (NYO) was established by the Western Music Unit of the Ministry of Education in 1992 following a grant of orchestral instruments from the Government of Japan. The NYO - the only such entity in the SAARC region to be supported by the state - provides opportunities free of charge to students throughout the island, to appreciate and perform western orchestral music. It could be described as the flag-ship project of the Education Ministry.
It concentrates on developing useful life-skills in students which contribute towards the overall enhancement of their aesthetic values and character-building. It is also aimed at exposing students, mainly from rural schools, to Western Classical music and to enable them to study and perform orchestral music alongside their Colombo counterparts who have greater access to such training and facilities.
Talented students, duly recommended by their respective heads of school, are given orchestral instruments through a lease agreement. They are taught about performing techniques and trained in orchestral playing.
The orchestral rehearsal sessions are conducted at the Royal College premises, Colombo, every Saturday afternoon from 1.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. and are attended by students from several provinces.
Around 100 students would be enrolled each year and students continue to perform in the orchestra until the age of 25. Membership is open to all students in the country, including those who possess their own orchestral instruments. All the students are encouraged to benefit from the experience of performing in a western orchestral setting.
Following their training, students are admitted to the orchestra through an audition process and perform both Classical and Popular music at the annual orchestral concerts.
Through the past 24 years, many students have reached levels of competency where they could join the established senior orchestras in the country and some have obtained scholarships from overseas training colleges to pursue their musical studies abroad.
Concerts have been held in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala so far. In view of a revival in interest from provincial students, out-reach programmes are being devised to attract the attention of more students.
Concert 2016
This years concert was held at the Navarangahala, Royal College, Colombo under the patronage of Masaki Takaoka, First Secretary, Cultural and Information Section, Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka, Kiyoshi Amada, Chief Representative, Japan International Co-operation Agency, Sri Lanka, Ushitha Samarakoon Assistant Director of Education Western and Senior Officials of the Ministry of Education.
The programme included Western classics and popular music together with local popular music, and also featured a 150-voice student choir from Royal College Colombo , Sri Sumangala Balika Vidyalaya Panadura, and Newstead College Negombo - the winners of the All Island Western Music and Dance Competition 2016 and Ushitha Samarakoon Assistant Director of Education Western.

Messi reaches 500-goal mark, Bale keeps Madrid on top
Lionel Messi, with his 500th Barcelona goal, and Luis Suarez saved the Spanish champions from a second defeat in six days as they came from behind to win 2-1 at Sevilla on Sunday.
Victory keeps Barca just two points adrift of Real Madrid, who were 3-0 victors over Leganes thanks to a double from Gareth Bale.
Madrid also announced that Cristiano Ronaldo will extend his contract with the European champions until 2021 on Monday.
Messi inspired a spirited Barca fightback fresh from a 3-1 defeat at Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday after a first-half dominated by Sevilla.
There is no one like him and our objective as a team is to look for Leo as much as possible, Barca boss Luis Enrique told Spanish TV station Movistar.
The capacity Messi has to play in any position and interpret what is happening on the field is laudable. With the cast of the Game of Thrones among those watching on in Seville, the game got off to a frantic start.
The hosts had two shots on goal inside 50 seconds, but from a Sevilla corner Barca broke forward at lightning speed and Suarezs effort from Neymars layoff was brilliantly saved by Sergio Rico.
Sevilla remained on the front foot for most of the first-half and got their reward on 15 minutes when Pablo Sarabias pass bamboozled Sergi Roberto and Vitolo charged through to open the scoring.
Sarabia passed up a great chance to make it two when he took the bizarre decision to backheel the ball towards the edge of the area when he had just Marc-Andre ter Stegen to beat. Barca made Sevilla pay with another brilliant counter-attack to level two minutes before half-time as this time Messi curled Neymars pass into the bottom corner. AFP

No blues as All Blacks fans hail men in green
Rather than mourn the end of the All Blacks world-record winning run Sunday, New Zealanders backed coach Steve Hansens analysis that Ireland deserved their historic 40-29 victory in Chicago.
The right side won... were not going to make any excuses, Hansen declared as the New Zealand news media and callers to talk radio voiced agreement.
Magnificent men in green: Ireland make history, trumpeted the New Zealand Herald.
Sweet sporting history made, Fairfax New Zealand said on its website, highlighting that it was Irelands first win over New Zealand after 29 Tests in 111 years.
In New Zealand, where rugby is almost a religion, Test losses usually cause national mourning and the more surprising the loss the bigger the hurt.
But with nearly one in five New Zealanders also claiming Irish ancestry, this time the usual despondency was replaced by a feeling that if any team deserved to beat the All Blacks, it was Ireland.
The loss put a full stop on the All Blacks winning streak at 18, one more than the previous record which New Zealand shared with South Africa.
Its our friends the Irish who broke the record. We kind of feel OK about it, Radio Sport host Tony Veitch said.
In terms of rugby itself this is a brilliant result. Jim Kayes, in an editorial for MediaWorks Newshub, said it was right to celebrate Irelands victory. Sometimes there is no disgrace in losing. And sometimes it is more important to celebrate success, even if its the other team thats won, he said.
Few, in fact only the most curmudgeonly, will deny Ireland their moment to savour, their day to remember. Herald rugby writer Gregor Paul noted it has been a year of unfancied champions, with Leicester City triumphing in the English Premier League and the Chicago Cubs ending a 108-year drought to win Major League Baseballs World Series. The sporting gods obviously have a taste for this kind of feel good story and they smiled upon Ireland, he wrote. Fairfaxs Marc Hinton also picked up on the baseball similarity.
Well, baseball, rugby will take your 108 years and raise you to 111. Thats how long the men from the Emerald Isle have been waiting to secure their first ever victory over the All Blacks, he said.
World Cup-winning All Blacks winger Nehe Milner-Skudder, who has missed the 2016 internationals because of a shoulder injury, took the philosophical view that the loss was not the end for the top-ranked side.
Theres always next week, he told Sky TV, before adding: You have to give it to Ireland -- they were outstanding today and deserved the game. Theyve done it, Radio New Zealand declared on its website while Television New Zealand said: Staunch Irish break All Blacks 2016 winning streak. AFP

Adele richest celebrity, breaking One Direction's record

Adele has more than doubled how much she's worth to be crowned the richest British celebrity under 30.
She's knocked One Direction off the top spot after their three-year run in first place and is now reported to have an estimated 92m in the bank.
Last year the 28-year-old was in fourth place on Heat's list of the 30 richest British stars under 30.
The magazine's annual list has ex-Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, 27, in second place with an estimated 74m.
Ed Sheeran, 25, is a new entry in third place, with an estimated fortune of 45m.
One Direction now feature on the list individually but before they counted as a band, which is why they always topped the list.
Former member Zayn Malik, 23, is in fourth position behind Ed Sheeran with 38m.
Harry Styles, 22, is in fifth with 37m, while Liam Payne, 23, is in seventh (34m), Niall Horan, 23, is in eighth (34m) and Louis Tomlinson, 24, is in ninth (33m).
Another former Harry Potter star, Emma Watson, 26, is at number six with 35m while 28-year-old Rupert Grint finishes the top 10 on 29m.
This is the sixth year the celebrity magazine has released the list, which is compiled by a number of industry experts.
The panel looks at endorsement deals, TV contracts, film profits and record sales to estimate the wealth of each celebrity.
Heat editor Suzy Cox said: "Adele has been unstoppable this year with her album release and stadium tour, so it comes as no shock that she has come out on top.
"Despite their break-up, the One Direction boys have managed to stay in the top 10 but it will be interesting to see where they all stand next year after the release of their solo material."
This year the list also includes the top five international celebrities under 30.
Taylor Swift, 26, is in top spot with an estimated 192m fortune.
A new addition is also the billion dollar babies list, which Heat says "takes a look at the tots who were born with a platinum spoon in their mouths".
According to its calculations, one-year-old Princess Charlotte is reportedly worth 3.2bn to the UK economy and boosts the sales of baby brands more than any other famous child.
American singer Selena Gomez, 24, has been named the top of this year's Insta-preneurs list - the celebrity who "cashes in" on her Instagram posts thanks to brand endorsement.
