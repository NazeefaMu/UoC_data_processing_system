Count your rainbows
Rainbows could be treated as symbols of divineness that blends reality in this mortal world with fantasy. Rainbows created by the mother nature thus bequeath a heavenly touch with this human world. There exists a mythical belief a rainbow that soothes our eyes with vivid colours may vanish in a jiffy if one points his finger at it.
Nalin Rajapakshe is a young film director who had made an effort to bring the enchantment of a rainbow to cinema screen. The movie presented as Ran Dedunnak aka The Rainbow is his debut film direction that stars Roshan Ranawana with alluring newcomer Ruchini Tanasha who has been a model.
Ran Dedunnak as a family treat has a mix of romance, loathing and humor that makes a perfect combination to provide entertainment to masses. It is rich with a gamut of songs, fights and romancing scenes. Ran Dedunnak may remind a moviegoer of the golden era of Sinhala cinema in which actors like Vijeya Kumaratunga and Tissa Wijesurendra marveled on screen as super stars.
Story revolves around a young man who comes to Colombo in search of life and encounters dashing lass in the city who happens to be a journalist. This stunning female journalist is caught in a drug haul that she has been trying to expose to the public via media. King Pin of the drug mafia is on the hunt for the female journalist. In the midst of this controversy she encounters her lover to be, the young macho man who comes to town out of the blues.
These two main characters of The Rainbow are played by Roshan and Tanasha.
Tanasha with her performances in the movie proves she has acting talents in abundance. Her facial expressions, hearty smile, slender figure, presentation style and charisma catch the viewers eyes.
Ran Dedunnak making emphasis on the villain makes a difference as a contemporary movie. It is a film that projects villain above the hero. Wasantha Kumaravila portrays the villains role so well that he many a time surpasses the heros performances. This scenario reminds us of the 70s decade cinema of the country. In this era an actor called Alexander Fernando who entered cinema to play villain soon became hero in many films due to his striking looks and super performing abilities.
Likewise if given a break Wasantha Kumaravila may prove he has power to project a credible hero on screen. Thus it is high time film directors used him in main characters.
As regards the movie there are many shortfalls in direction, continuity and editing. Editing would have been tighter to bring life to the whole movie. However songs and fight scenes are staged and captured well. Fight director happens to be Wasantha Kumarawila himself. Music enriches the theme of the movie.
Local commercial cinema currently seems to be embracing a South Indian touch and Ran Dedunnak too has become a victim of this scenario. In the 60s and 70s decades a handful of local cinema personnel fought against an Indian invasion to our cinema to bring it a very local and unique touch. Dr Lester James Peiris, Dr Gamini Fonseka, Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja could be identified as forerunners of this valiant effort.
MGR or Sivaji Ganeshan could not act exposing their upper bare bodies like Gamini Fonseka. A masculine Gamini Fonseka clad in sarong was very different to a South Indian actor in a sarong. That is the reason people who flocked cinema halls whistled when Gamini Fonseka made his presence on screen either as a taxi driver or as a posh business tycoon. This uniqueness brought local commercial cinema to helm in that era. Ran Dedunnak lacks such attributes. Roshan Ranawana looks an innocent lover more than a hero.
All in all Ran Dedunnak could be identified as movie that has power to entertain masses. Creating a discussion in social media may attract youngsters towards the movie. Ran Dedunnak aka The Rainbow is produced by Moonlight Films.

This was performed at the Sarasaviya Film Festival in 1991 to Carnatic music and Sinhala Drum beats. The third, Shared Stories,is a short collage of scenes inspired by the memories, experiences and hopes for the future of youngsters shared during workshops conducted in Batticaloa and Colombo. The students from Batticaloa performed.
It showed in action that students of different backgrounds, place and traditions have similar fears needs and dreams. The fourth was Saamaya. This item was originally choreographed by the Jonathan Hollander Artistic Director of the Battery Dance Company, New York in collaboration with CVDF. This was staged as a tribute to the experiences had through the Youth Create Project. Saamaya attempted to touch the surface of a deeper wound of a nation that is only just starting to rebuild.

India to reclaim ICC Test top spot if it wins at Eden
DUBAI: India will reclaim the ICC Test Rankings top spot from Pakistan if it wins the second Test against New Zealand starting on Friday in Kolkata.
The victory in its 500th Test in Kanpur meant that India is now one victory away from reclaiming the ICC Test Championship mace from Pakistan.
India had entered the three-match series against the Kiwis, trailing Pakistan by one point and needed to win the series to move ahead of its traditional rival. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who was the star of the Kanpur win, also climbed one place to occupy second position in the ICC Test Rankings among bowlers.
Ashwins match haul of 10-225, that helped India notch up a 197-run victory in the first Test against New Zealand in Kanpur on Monday has seen him overtake Englands James Anderson by one point. He is now within seven points of number-one ranked Dale Steyn of South Africa, who leads the ICC Player Rankings for Test Bowlers with 878 points.
Another strong performance in the Kolkata Test, which starts on Friday, will potentially see Ashwin top the bowling charts for the second time this year after first claiming the number-one position last year following the Boxing Day Tests.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson also climbed up one place each to occupy second position among batsmen. Williamson has edged Englands Joe Root by one point with innings of 75 and 25 to reach 879 points. Australia captain Steve Smith leads the rankings with 906 points.
However, to move ahead or edge even closer to Smith, Williamson will have to produce strong performances in the remaining two Tests.
Ashwin also contributed with a useful innings of 40 to consolidate his position at the top of the list of all-rounders. Ashwin has reached a career-best rating of 450, opening up a 66-point gap with second-placed Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh. PTI

Hope to be fit for home series against Sri Lanka : A.B. de Villiers ruled  out of Australia series
South Africa have been dealt a cruel blow when AB de Villiers, the One-Day International (ODI) captain, failed a fitness test on Tuesday morning (September 27), ahead of the upcoming five-match series against Australia.
The star South African batsman had complained about the elbow injury which kept him out of the recently concluded Tests against New Zealand.
De Villiers was named in the preliminary squad for the one-off ODI against Ireland, which was played on September 25 in Benoni, but was later granted additional days of rest before the five-match ODI series against Australia to recuperate sufficiently from an elbow injury.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) have now confirmed that the captain will miss the upcoming ODIs against Australia, as well as the three-match away Test series against the same opposition, starting on November 3 in Perth. De Villiers is expected to undergo a surgery next week as he seeks to repair the troublesome left elbow - which failed to respond to treatment as well as rehabilitation.
South Africas team manager, Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: AB de Villiers is still symptomatic and has not recovered from his elbow impingement injury which makes surgery the only long-term solution. We have tried the conservative management of rest, physio, rehab and cortisone infiltration into the elbow, but that has not yielded the results that we would have liked. He will have surgery to the elbow early next week and the target is to hopefully have him back for the Sri Lankan home series over the Christmas period.
Faf du Plessis, who led the team in de Villierss absence, is expected to continue in the hot seat, while Rilee Rossouw will remain with the South African national squad for the five-match ODI series against Australia, starting at Centurion on September 30 (Friday).
