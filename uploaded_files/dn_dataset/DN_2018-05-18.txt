GMOA strike misses the point
A senior government adviser said the State doctors strike opposing the Sri Lankas free trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore was misguided.
I think theyre just plain wrong about the economics, Prof. Ricardo Hausmann at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in Colombo on Wednesday said.
Hausmann is the director for the Centre for International Development at Harvard University and an advisor to the Sri Lanka Board of Investment.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) launched an island-wide token strike on Thursday morning. They argued that the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA would allow foreign medical professionals to take Sri Lankan jobs.
But the people who should be making that argument are the doctors in Singapore,Hausmann said.

Ajith pledges to bring justice to victimised UNPers
The main reason for the three-year delay in meting out justice to UNPers subjected to political victimisation during the previous regime was that certain members of committees appointed at ministerial level to submit recommendations were either the very perpetrators of such victimisation or those who catered to the needs of people responsible for such acts of victimisation, UNP Trade Union Secretary and Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P Perera said.
The State Minister said in his capacity as the Ombudsman of the UNP-oriented Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, he would take steps to bring justice to victimised UNPers after holding discussions at trade union level.
The State Minister who assumed duties as the UNP Trade Union Secretary yesterday, said he called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the previous night and informed him about the assumption of his new post and sought instructions about the new duties vested in him.
He said the Prime Minister advised him to coordinate party trade union activities. He said he in turn pledged to perform the vital responsibilities cast on him by the new post in an efficient manner.
State Minister Perera who added that he would hold discussions with the party trade unions to ascertain the political injustices caused to them, said he would take action to correct them, in close collaboration with UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel. Earlier State Minister Ajith P. Perera visited the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya headquarters at Pita Kotte and assumed duties as UNP Trade Union Secretary after receiving his appointment letter from UNP Parliamentarian Sirinal de Mel. JSS Media Secretary Sunil de Silva made the welcome speech.
Other UNP trade union representatives were also present in the occasion.

Asian investors find Lanka a  compelling destination - Malik
Balancing diplomatic relations and being open to all countries for investment has been a key achievement of the current government, remarked Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama yesterday.
It is easy to disregard how important this is, its not something the Sri Lankan private sector can see and touch, its not visible like infrastructure and you cant put it on a billboard - but it has big implications for our national interests and our economic stability, he said at a meeting of diplomats from Asian countries and the corporate sector, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
He noted that, When our government was elected in 2015, Sri Lanka had difficult relationships with many countries, our foreign policy was skewed, some relationships we had strained, and others we had neglected. It was important for our country that we balance our relationships well; that we renew old ties and pursues new partnerships. And this is what we have managed to do over the past three years.
The Minister outlined three key reasons why Asian investors would find Sri Lanka a compelling destination for business, the new untapped opportunities available; Sri Lankas friendly ties with all Asian countries and the openness to partner with all of them without preference; and the country being an ideal springboard to the growing markets of South Asia and Africa given our unique location placed in the Indian Ocean and on the Western edge of Asia.
There is a lot of untapped potential and many green field opportunities, at a time when competition is fierce in other Asian economies, whether it is for resources or opportunities. Sri Lanka offers Asian investors the chance to be at the frontier of new things, and expand their business opportunities. Secondly, Sri Lanka is unique in this region for having very good diplomatic ties with all countries in Asia.
Unlike several Asian countries that have various tensions with others in the region, either disputes stemming from past conflict or territorial or border disputes, Sri Lanka does not have such issues with Asian countries. Therefore, we provide a unique platform to any investor from any Asian country to come here and feel welcome.
We have no preferred Asian partners. All of Asia is our partner, and all Asian countries are important to us. Thirdly, Sri Lanka is an excellent springboard to other nearby regions, which are emerging growth hubs. Already, we hear of several Japanese investors who see Sri Lanka as a useful springboard to Africa, to Europe, and to South Asia, Minister said.
Similarly, many other East Asian countries find us a useful gateway to the large and growing South Asian market. Sri Lanka is uniquely placed on the Western edge of Asia, as well as in the center of the Indian Ocean. This geography offers very unique opportunities to investors from East and South East Asia, he said.

Best buds
Tarryn McKay and her best bud, Nibbles, are the truest definition of friendship goals.
They dont let their differences  their size, their species, one of them having long ears  tear them apart, instead bonding over what makes them special.
Just to be clear, Nibbles is a rabbit. Tarryn is not a rabbit.
Theyre such good pals that Tarryn takes Nibbles with her everywhere she goes, bringing the bunny to work, on holiday, and even letting her share a bed.
Nibbles is totally house-trained and can communicate with Tarryn by buzzing and licking. She typically hangs out in a specially adapted pocket in Tarryns jumper, whether Tarryn is shopping at her local market or traveling in a taxi.
As Tarryns a teacher, Nibbles is welcome to join her at work, where shes a favourite with students.
Tarryn, from Melbourne, Australia, said: Its really special having her around a lot because its not something that everyone will get a chance to do  and not all rabbits would cope.
Having Nibbles with me so much means we have built a really incredible bond  she knows how to communicate with me. Shell give me three little licks if she wants something. It will usually be if I am standing in the kitchen near food but its also really helpful when were out and about. The place we go to most often is the local market. Because I tend to hold her, sometimes people dont even notice shes there. Its really rare that shes in her cage  shes got one at home but she tends to have free run of the house. The first time she buzzed I rang my vet because I didnt know what it was. It was as she was hopping around and I thought she had hurt her foot, but she was just that happy that her whole body buzzed. For an animal that doesnt make a lot of noise, shes very vocal.
As well as providing Tarryn with companionship, Nibbles has a very important role; teaching students how to care for animals.

Bumrah enhances death-overs reputation to keep Mumbai alive
NEW DELHI, Wednesday: Jasprit Bumrah may not have exactly set alight this years Indian Premier League (IPL) but the 24-year-old showed his death-overs prowess once again to keep Mumbai Indians alive in the playoff race.
The right-arm pacemans awkward sling-arm action is difficult to score off but it is his late innings mastery which makes him an asset, and which India will hope to see reprised on tour in England next month.
Bumrah displayed that skill in Wednesday nights three-run victory against Kings XI Punjab to lift Mumbai to fourth place in the eight-team league.
Bowling the second over of the Punjab innings to the dangerous Chris Gayle and the in-form Lokesh Rahul, Bumrah conceded only one run before being taken out of attack. He conceded four in his second over, the 12th of the innings.
Rahul and Aaron Finch were going great guns when Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma pressed Bumrah into action again and the bowler did not let him down.
He dismissed Finch (46) and Marcus Stoinis in the 17th over and dealt a body blow in his next, getting rid of Rahul (94) to finish with figures of 4-0-15-3.
I think Bumrah has come a long way in the past two years, worked really hard on his bowling, Sharma said at the presentation ceremony.
Never easy to do what he does but he has taken the responsibility. Coming out there and bowling at set batsmen who are trying to finish the job  hes doing it perfectly for us.
His ability to bowl yorkers almost at will and his unpredictable bounce make him a death-overs nightmare for most batsmen. He attributes it all to clear thinking.
Clarity is very important when you bowl at the death otherwise therell be doubt, he said after collecting his man-of-the-match award.
Even on a bad day when a batsman hits you, you just have to execute your plan. (Rahul) has been batting really well so its sometimes difficult to bowl to a batsman like that. But I was backing myself.
I was clear ... On this wicket when the slower ball was bowled on a good length, it wasnt gripping, so I looked to bowl a dipper and it worked.  Agencies

There has to be serious action taken to bring about peace and justice for the Tamil people, he said.

He recalled meeting with then President J.R. Jayewardene in 1984, and urging him to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Sadly, all these years later, that legislation is still there, he said.
Corbyn said he still supported repealing the PTA, as well as an international judicial mechanism to address war crimes, justice for the families of disappeared people, a political solution that recognises the multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious nature of Sri Lanka, de-militarization of the North and East, and the right of Tamils to decide their own future. He called for the release of all political prisoners.
Britain is in a strong position to make that demand, Corbyn said.
He said the full list of demands will be included in our manifesto in any general election.

The Premier said the Unity Government took several measures to ease the burden on the people by increasing the salaries of public sector employees and pensions and reduce the prices of essential goods.
Although it wasnt an easy task to put the economy back on track, the Prime Minister said the government has been able to repay loans and stabilise the economy amid many challenges. In this backdrop, the Premier said it was amusing to note the former leader who left the country in a vicious cycle of debt trying to speak about economic management and policies of the present government.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations at the International Nurses Day-2018 celebration at Temple Trees yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena participated as the Chief Guest at the event which was organised by the Government Nursing Officers Association.
The Prime Minister said that the former President went on a failed election bid in 2015, held two years prior to the due date of polls, with the intention of establishing power before the economy collapses.
The previous government doubled Sri Lankas debt. They knew they had no chance if the elections were held on time as the economy was collapsing under severe debt. This is why they went for early elections, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the previous regime reduced the allocations for the health sector and education and the cost of living had reached unbearable levels at the time. The Prime Minister further said that what they accepted on January 8, 2015 was nothing but an enormous amount of loans to settle. He added that the government has been able to settle them successfully.
By now, we have been able to increase the foreign reserves to USD 9,000 million and we hope to bring it to the level of USD 11,000 by the end of this year, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also said that the the UNP made Maithripala Sirisena the Common Candidate and won the election on January 8.
He added then they have given new life to the economy and allocated more money for the health and education sectors than any other government in the countrys history under President Maithripala Sirisena leadership.
He added that the private sector had no any hope during the previous regime but now they have. He added that the massive allocations made under this would not have been a reality had the Good Governance Government not been elected.
The Premier further said that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne took measures to enhance the Health sector with Rs.25,000 million in allocations. He got more than two fold foreign funds which has to be settled.
In the meantime, money is allocated for the heath sector under the Provincial Councils which is additional to the allocations made to the Ministry, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. A massive amount of money is allocated for the health sector under the finance head of the Higher Education Ministry as well.
Three medical faculties are being constructed with the allocation made to the Higher Education Ministry attached to the North-Western University, Sabaragamuwa University and the Moratuwa University.
Kuliyapitiya, Ratnapura and Panadura Hospitals would be Teaching Hospitals.

Ditch traditional  fairy tales!
In these ultra PC days, telling someone how big their teeth are might have you done for body shamingeven if theyre a wolf dressed up in grandma clothing.
Sounds far-fetched
Well, parents are apparently turning their backs on traditional fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood these days for fear that theyre not politically correct.
Fables like The Gingerbread Man and The Three Little Pigs were deemed the worst offenders, with some mums and dads comparing them to horror films.
The poll, which was commissioned by musicMagpie, included 2,000 parents and revealed one in four parents improvised parts of storybooks as not to be politically incorrect.
Many felt that if you take a deeper look at some of the classics, they have some worrying messages that are not conducive to a progressive society.
In Cinderella, for example, parents felt it was inappropriate that she had to do all the cleaning in the home. Pinocchio encouraged lying, while The Ugly Duckling showed in order to be accepted, you have to be beautiful, some said.
Sleeping Beauty was also thought to be problematic as the prince kisses her when shes asleep, bordering on necrophilia and issues of consent, with Beauty and the Beast posing bestiality issues.
A total of 16 percent found such fairy tales so violent or carrying the wrong message that they banned it from the home altogether.
Other reasons cited included violence.
In Little Red Riding Hood, for example, the child is eaten alive by a wolf, only to be saved by a hunter who cuts her out of the animals stomach with an axe.
The Three Little Pigs also depicts a violent ending with the three pigs killing the wolf and eating it. Similarly, in The Gingerbread Man, the protagonist is eaten by a fox.
Some of these stories have been around for generations  many would have been read to mums and dads when they were children, explained Liam Howley, marketing director at musicMagpie.
But times have changed and there are many elements to these classic tales which for some dont really fit into society as they once did. Not only that but when you think about the storylines, some can be considered very scary for little children.

Enterprising Sri Lanka  with Peoples Bank
The government expects the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) sector to be the backbone of the economy. However, the lack of capital or the difficulty in accessing capital due to both the cost of capital and the requirement of collateral have been the main impediments in the development of SMEs and start ups. Debt capital has been always an issue for many entrepreneurs.
Therefore, they were lagging behind on new investments and expansions. Enterprising Sri Lanka focuses on access to finance with low cost of funding with fixed terms enabling the entrepreneurs to take a long term view in their investments. While Peoples Bank empowers such entrepreneurs in nurturing through a dedicated customer relationship management model.
One of the main proposals of the Government budget, Enterprising Sri Lanka is a programme to empower the entrepreneurship in Sri Lankan entrepreneurs is already in process.

Peoples Bank, being the pioneer in SME Lending since its inception in 1961, has assisted Micro and SMEs not only facilitating debt capital, but also inculcating savings habits, developing financial discipline, establishing good governance and improving managerial competencies of the targeted SMEs. The strategy of the Bank is to develop and maintain a very strong customer relationship through a dedicated branch network across the country. This endeavor very well backed up by the dedicated SME centers established covering all administrative districts in the country.
The role of the SME center is to identify, nurture and develop potential business customers whose contribution to the GDP is immense and essential. Despite the risk in startups, Bank has the passion of identifying and nurturing them almost similar to the role of incubators.
The advantages of getting into a relationship with Peoples Bank are many. Among them, availability of any type of credit facilities, flexible terms and conditions, competitive or concessional rates of interests, structuring facilities on the need basis of customers, no hidden charges, latest state art of technology for banking transactions, very efficient foreign trade and trade finance facilities, having very friendly relationship and many more.

Eppawela can provide SLs phosphate fertilizer requirement
The Agriculture Ministry has ascertained that the best phosphate fertilizer with minimum cadmium can be found in the Eppawela phosphate deposit, a statement from the ministry said yesterday. The ministry had discovered this upon discussions with the officials appointed to ascertain the reasons for the low fertilizer production in the phosphate deposit.
The officials pointed out that an amount of Rs. 9 billion is needed to develop the melting process of phosphate. They further pointed out that if the government funds this project, the deposit would be able to satisfy the phosphate fertilizer requirement of the whole country. An expert panel was appointed by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera to analyse the economic benefits, long-term potential, estimates for the project and the opinions of the general public of conducting this project. The expert panel is led by Agriculture State Secretary D.B. Bandulasena and includes Dr. W.M.W. Weerakoon, W.M.B. Weerasekara, S.L.G. Bandusiri, Dr. Gerry Jayawardene, W.R.U.D. Bandara and Prabath Withana.
The government pays Rs. 35 million to foreign parties for fertilizer. Spending Rs. 9 billion for local production is not unfair at all. We should all work towards fertilizer production at the Eppawela phosphate deposit by 2019 January and February, stated the minister.

Former dengue patients more prone to depression, anxiety
(Dr. Miyuru Chandradasa)
A recent study revealed that patients who had suffered from dengue are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety more than people who have never been infected with dengue, Dr. Miyuru Chandradasa from University of Kelaniya, Monash University (Honorary)said.
According to Dr. Chandradasa, the study was on psychological effects of dengue fever among Sri Lankan patients. There have been studies in the past of acute psychological effects in dengue from other countries.
Patients who had suffered from dengue have significant higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than the control group according to the DASS-21 and CESD-20 tools.This is the first and only such study in the world.
However, this is understandable considering the stress of having a physical illness. The researchers studied the delayed effects mentally after months from the dengue infection. This may warn health care professionals to incorporate mental counseling for dengue patients, he said.

A funeral coach which traveled from one of the funeral parlors to deliver a coffin to a funeral house with the remains of a dead woman, had reportedly veered off the road and fallen in to a canal after the driver of the coach was knocked out by the husband of the late woman.
According to the police media sources, the relatives of a woman, who had passed away in the teaching hospital in Anuradhapura had given her remains to one of the funeral parlors in Galenbidunuwewa area to do the embalming and make final arrangements. The funeral parlors had arranged a coach to deliver the coffin of the late woman.
However, it was reported that her weeping husband also had got in to the front seat of the funeral coach and traveled in it. After half and hours drive, the husband of the late woman reportedly had a dispute with the funeral coach driver and had knocked him out when the coach was moving at a considerable amount of speed.
This resulted in the funeral coach going off the road and falling in to a canal after the driver lost control of it due to the unexpected incident. It was revealed that the husband of the late woman who is a permanent resident in Galenbidunuwewa area in Kekirawa, was completely under the influence of alcohol at the time of incident.
When this was reported to the funeral parlors, they had come to the place and with the help of the neighborhood they had taken the coffin out of the fallen coach and arranged another funeral coach to deliver it to the funeral house.
Further investigations related to the incident are been carried out by the police.

Germany most likely to win soccer World Cup - UBS
ZURICH, Thursday: Every four years some economists turn their talent for making predictions about global finance to the topic of the World Cup. Will Iceland or Panama lift the trophy this year, or perhaps hosts Russia
Forecasters at Swiss bank UBS on Thursday came up with a more, well, predictable choice: Germany.
UBS sees a 24 percent probability that Germany who won in 2014 will win the July 15 final, with Brazil and Spain the next most likely teams to succeed, with a 19.8 percent and 16.1 percent chance respectively.
Germany and Brazil are set for an easy start, while Spain will have to hit the ground running if they are to beat Portugal, the current European champions, in their opening game, said Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation in a report that used econometric forecasting tools.
From there, the going will get tougher for Spain and Brazil, who will possibly face Argentina and England, respectively, in the quarter-finals, Bolliger said.
Host country Russia, meanwhile, is likely to make it to the round of 16 before losing to either Spain or Portugal.
As for Iceland and Panama: 0.2 percent and 0.0 percent respectively.
The predictions by the worlds biggest wealth manager were based on a statistical model using the results from the previous five tournaments and controlling for factors such as team strength and success in the qualification phase.
UBS said that England, France, Belgium and Argentina could still provide some surprises in the World Cup.
Argentinas fate will strongly depend on the form of their star players in our view, which is an element of uncertainty and hard to capture with our quantitative model, Bolliger said.
France should be able to advance to the semi-final but could face Brazil, another top team, after the possible elimination of Portugal. England, just like Belgium, has a balanced team but would have to get past Brazil to reach the semi-final, he added.  Agencies

Gina Haspel confirmed as first ever female CIA director

Gina Haspel has been confirmed as the next CIA director, making her the first woman to lead the intelligence agency.
Haspelhad faced opposition in the US Senate over her controversial role in the CIA's use of harsh interrogation methods, but was confirmed in a 54-45 vote.
During her confirmation-hearing the 61-year-oldinsisted she does not believe torture worksand would refuse a presidential order she considered "immoral" even if it was legal.
Haspel is a 33-year veteran at the agency currently serving as its acting director.
Six Democrats joined President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in voting for Haspel, and two Republicans voted no.
Haspelwas approved despite stiff opposition over her links to the CIA's use of harsh interrogation methods, including water boarding, a type of simulated drowning widely considered torture, in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks.
An undercover officer for most of her CIA career, Haspelin 2002 served as CIA station chief in Thailand, where the agency conducted interrogations at a secret prison using methods including water boarding. Three years later, she drafted a cable ordering the destruction of videotapes of those interrogations.
Republican Senator John McCain, who has been away from Washington all year as he battles brain cancer, urged the Senate not to vote for Haspel. He did not vote on Thursday.
Tortured himself while a prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain said approving Haspelwould send the wrong message, and the country should only use methods to keep itself safe "as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world."
Haspelalso had strong support from the Trumpadministration, many current and former intelligence officials and a wide range of lawmakers, including Democrats.
Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, which oversaw the nomination, supported Haspel.
"I believe she is someone who can and will stand up to the president, who will speak truth to power if this president orders her to do something illegal or immoral, like a return to torture," he said in a Senate speech before the vote.
Rights groups quickly condemned the vote. Laura Pitter of Human Rights Watch called it "the predictable and perverse byproduct of the USfailure to grapple with past abuses."

Htota Port to develop ro-ro business
The management of Hambantota Port is looking for the development of a marine-related industrial park and the construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power plant for the Port, said Chief Operating Officer of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) Tissa Wickramasinghe.
He said that Hambantota Port has the potential to develop the Roll-on/Roll-off (ro-ro) business, with volumes doubling within the first quarter of the year.
Hambantota could be an important pit stop in the Indian Ocean for ships plying the east-west route, he added making a presentation at the 2018 TOC Asia (Terminal Operator Conference) in Singapore recently.
He pointed out that Hambantota is a unique deep-water multi-purpose port located adjacent to the main east-west sea route and its potential is yet to be tapped.
He also highlighted that the possibility to be then new bunker storage and supply location in the region is huge. Wickramasinghe stressed on the importance of its location at midpoint between Singapore and Fujairah, which are the worlds number one and number two bunkering ports respectively. His presentation titled Hambantota Port  New pit stop in the Indian Ocean emphasised that Hambantota has the potential of becoming the maritime hub for the Asian and African regions. Commenting on the presentation he made to TOC Asia 2018, Wickramasinghe said: Hambantota and its true potential have not been adequately presented to the international port and shipping community. This was therefore an excellent opportunity to place Hambantota on the map. The interest it generated is most encouraging.
The TOC Asia Conference & Exhibition, held in conjunction with Singapore Maritime Week, is the complete Container Supply Chain event for Asia.
This was the fourth occasion that Wickramasinghe was among the eminent speakers at a TOC session, having addressed previous conferences in Dubai and Singapore.

Hameedia, promises to rise  from the ashes
In the aftermath of the massive fire that broke out on Saturday 12th May 2018 at the Hameedia main storage facility at Borupana Road, Ratmalana, causing extensive damage to the building and goods inside, the Hameedia Team wishes to extend its heartfelt gratitude to those who extended their support during this tragedy.
Together with my undaunted Team, I wish to thank everyone who supported us during this terrible catastrophe. Our journey which spans 70 years has had its share of triumphs and challenges. We have always resolutely faced everything that came our way. Ours is a multi-religious and multi-ethnic organization, said Fouzul Hameed, Managing Director of the Hameedia Group.
We are more than just a business since we thrive on giving back to the community, and this is the predominant reason for expansion despite years of facing various storms. Our success thus far has been primarily due to the commitment of our dedicated staff and also our thousands of loyal customers spread across the world. We are determined to face this adversity with resilience and rapidly bounce back as we reminiscence our humble beginnings, when we started the journey with nothing.
We greatly appreciate the instant support rendered to us by our staff, customers, neighbours, Sri Lanka Fire Brigade, Army, Police, Air Force, STF, Disaster Management Unit, Electricity Board, political and religious dignitaries and many, many others. Since the onset of the fire we have been inundated with calls and messages from all parts of the world, and every form of support, and are extremely grateful for it. We humbly request you to keep us in your prayers as we now, Phoenix-like, embark on a new era, he added.

JAT Paints restores temple murals
JAT Holdings recently launched a revolutionary new paint, which combines ancient traditions and cutting-edge manufacturing technology. Petal Paint is a unique paint that has been created with the pigments from dried flower petals and transformed into liquid paint using innovation from the Research and Development team at JAT Holdings.
This unique initiative will breathe new life into discarded temple flowers which are a plenty in the country. Once turned into liquid paint, it will be used in the creation and restoration of sacred temple murals in Sri Lanka.
We created Petal Paint to give something back to Sri Lankas heritage and culture, JAT Holdings, Head of Marketing, Richard Gunawardene said. Petal Paint combines the best of our traditional culture  the use of pigments from nature  with the most advanced technology in paint manufacturing, to create a paint that matches the traditional temple mural colours and also provides a more long-lasting solution to temple artists, he added.
Petal Paint will soon be made available to artists working on temple murals. The initial colors in the range are lotus red, pigeon wing blue, trumpet yellow, marigold orange and temple flower white and will be available in 200 ml tins.
Gunawardene stated that a pilot project using Petal Paint to restore faded murals as well as create new wall murals is currently underway at Sri Sudarmarama Poorana Maha Viharaya, Ganegama, Akuressa and will be unveiled to the public soon. He further elaborated that the ideas were created and conceptualized by Leo Burnett Sri Lanka for JAT Holdings.
It takes around 200 kilograms of dried flowers to make 50 liters of paint, and JAT Holdings will soon launch a public campaign to collect the dried flowers discarded from temples.
In addition to collecting the natural pigments needed for Petal Paint production, this initiative will also reduce the daily waste thrown out by temples across the country.

KOICA grants US$ 7.5 mn for improvement of education in Kilinochchi district
In its endeavour, since 2011, for the betterment of the educational environment in the Kilinochchi district, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is granting US$ 7.5 million to renovate a number of schools in the district, the agency said in a statement to the media.
The agreement between the two countries for the project was signed by KOICA Country Director Lee Dong Ku, Education Secretary S. Hettiarachchi and Director General of the Department of External Resources Priyantha Rathnayake. The event was graced by the State Education Minister V.S. Radhakrishnan.
The destruction of infrastructure was one that challenged post-war reconciliation efforts in the district, particularly - the process of resettling individuals displaced during the war. The areas infrastructure required to be built from scratch.
In this light, KOICA identified the importance of providing for the infrastructure for the education sector. Thus, in 2011, KOICA conducted a US$ 5.6 million project for the improvement of the education environment of Kilinochchi, in line with the government of Koreas partnership strategy with Sri Lanka where education is one of the priority areas.
Yet, recovering from the damage caused by a three-decade war takes time and effort. Therefore, furthering this initial step, the Republic of Korea is extending its support to Kilinochchi district even further to ensure the quality of education in the area is high.
The project will focus components of infrastructural development, teacher training and community awareness activities. Ensuring that the focus of the project will surpass mere infrastructural development and will move on to secure parental support in the process of their childrens education, there is an awareness of the parents segment to the project. The KOICA Sri Lanka office believes that the project will not only bring significant improvement in education, but also offer the chance for a better future for the children in this district. KOICA believes that a proper education will serve as a great asset to overcome the struggles in developing a previously war-torn area.
It is also the hope of KOICA that their effort be fruitful in empowering the overall education environment of the district that was alienated from development for so long due to the war and that the districts children will benefit from their endeavours.

Land Rover celebrates 70 years
Land Rover marked its 70th anniversary with a global broadcast celebrating the worlds favourite 4x4s and the people who love them.
Starring the cars and the people who make and drive them, the online programme paid tribute to seven decades of adventure, humanitarian aid and hard work across classes and cultures around the world.
The broadcast started on Monday 30 April  70 years to the day since the first Land Rover made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show.It went on to tell how Land Rover began as a utility model at the end of the Second World War and grew to become the worlds favourite 4x4, with more than 7 million sold.
Great models from the past as well as inspirational people behind the legend and a look to the future, with a level of insight only available direct from the factory.
Prof Dr Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover CEO, said: Land Rover was born with the launch of a single vehicle. Today our family of SUVs is testament to the pioneering spirit of innovation that has characterised Land Rover for seven decades. Our family of Defender, Discovery and Range Rover models provides unrivalled capability, versatility and luxury, giving us the perfect foundation for another 70 years of success.
A vehicle line-up including HUE: the first prototype Land Rover, the original two-door Range Rover and the seven-seater Discovery, as well as expedition-proven models from across the decades, will share the stage at the Land Rover Classic Works in Coventry. The current range, including the sector-defining Range Rover Evoque and Velar SUVs, will also be on screen as Land Rover celebrates its lifelong status as a favourite among celebrities, politicians and royalty.
The year of 70th celebrations has already begun and one of the vehicles from the start of the story will star in the show. In January, Land Rover revealed plans to sympathetically renovate the worlds most historically significant unrestored model  one of three pre-production cars from the original Amsterdam launch. Now in the hands of the experts at Land Rover Classic, it will take the stage alongside its closest modern relative  the exclusive 405PS Defender Works V8 revealed earlier this year. Only 150 of the powerful 70th edition models will be produced and each of the specially engineered V8 derivatives will be built under the same roof, by Land Rover Classics team of expert engineers.
The Land Rover range is available in Sri Lanka through SML Frontier, the sole agents of Jaguar Land Rover in Sri Lanka.

Lankas immigration laws need reform - Prof Hausmann
In a drive to spur growth and drive innovation, Sri Lanka needs to adopt progressive immigration policies to encourage foreign expertise through immigration, particularly to access the expertise of Sri Lankan diaspora.
These sentiments were expressed by Prof. Ricardo Hausmann, Director of Harvards Center for International Development and Professor of the Practice of Economic Development at the Kennedy School of Government at the second edition of Future of Business - Innovation in Action, conference held at the Galle Face Hotel Colombo, yesterday.
Sri Lanka has restricted its ability to attract talent outside owing to multiple reasons when compared to other dynamic economies like India, Vietnam and Singapore.
Prof. Ricardo suggested that Sri Lanka needs to provide a path to residency and allow highly skilled foreign nationals to become citizens, not only by simplifying cumbersome visa procedures, also creating more visa categories. Many companies in Sri Lanka were started by immigrants with connections made while living abroad.
Noting that low growth of GDP and export, balance of payment crisis, low transformation of export basket, low immigration and foreign direct investment have significantly hampered the countrys growth prospects to a great extent over the recent decades, Prof. Hausmann added that more importantly, Sri Lanka has failed to add new products to its exports basket.
This has clearly led to low FDI, and recurrent balance of payment crisis. Reforming immigration laws could be a proper solution to rectify this issue.
Ganaka Herath Partner, McKinsey & Company speaking at the event stated that Sri Lanka is in a unique position on the digitization front given its proximity to many highly competitive, dynamic economies in the region.
Stressing the need to create an enabling environment to drive innovation, digital capabilities and to develop local talent, Herath pointed out that issues relating to the gaps in best practices and relevance on demand side on this front need to be addressed in a speedy manner to better garner set targets of the economy.
However, despite the fact that Sri Lanka lags behind in terms of aggregated digital maturity when compared to other countries in the region, the country has been able to outperform several Asian pillars in certain categories, Herath said.
Underscoring the need to recognise the usage of consumers, build capabilities and retain existing talent to unleash the Sri Lankas digital potential, Herath added that it is also essential to create revenue streams to figure out how to monetize the growing consumer supply.

## Title: Leopard love

Leopard love
Noel first realised his love of leopards when he was on a school trip to Wilpattu National Park where he only caught a glimpse of one. But that was enough to light a great flame in him that burns brighter than ever today. It is still in Wilpattu that it burns brightest as this is the largest and wildest of the parks offering more space and freedom for the leopards, as he puts it, and is therefore his favourite, and, combined with Yala, constitutes 880 square miles of totally protected wilderness.
From that time onwards, he began to feel increasing affinity for the leopard and why wouldnt he They are truly amazing animals and probably the most majestic of beasts. He has now followed them for so long that he genuinely feels like a leopard  with the way of the world now, he could probably apply for genus realignment. Well, in the West anyway  or is that order realignment Regardless, he is the Diane Fosse, or better still for a happy ending, the Mowgli of Sri Lanka, walking barefoot from a young age with a few Bagheeras and finally meeting a like-minded human, Cecile, who keeps him connected with his kind, while also sharing his connection with the feline kind, and who stops him from going completely wild.
Cecile explains her love of the wild My first encounter with a leopard was seeing a huge male killing a crocodile,  you can see the odd mugger crocodile occasionally with its mouth wide open but dont be too concerned as it is not vainly waiting for something to fall into it, only using it to regulate its body temperature; it is however a similarly accomplished killer. Cecile goes on, My second experience was of a female leopard being chased by an elephant. From then, I have been hooked; Noel and I spend every free minute in the jungle together researching and learning more about them. Those incredibly exciting moments made me quickly realise that I share the same level of passion about leopards as Noel. This is just as well as the life of a leopard aficionado is otherwise a lonely and difficult one although they are fascinating creatures. A great deal of time and effort is required to truly satisfy the passion and the drive to ensure the survival of this king of the bush. Incidentally, as far as passion is concerned, the leopard can mate up to 10 times an hour or 50 times a day, says Noel with a twinkle in his eye. Noel and Cecile have been together for eight years now and are as similarly dogged, or should one say catted, in their pursuit of leopard conservation.
Noel set up his highly successful Noel Rodrigo Leopard Safaris during the thirty year Civil War in Sri Lanka in very dangerous circumstances and was never far from a potential confrontation with the Tamil Tigers in Yala but as he says, My character is such that I do what most people say cant be achieved. I want to be like a leopard and he always has to take calculated risks. I never had armed guards. Also, his choice of animal to follow is much dreaded, saying, People here fear the leopard; rural people believe that hes a vicious man eater. The few killings that have occurred in the hill country and the infamous man-eater of Punami and Panama of 70 years ago have not helped this reputation, but man-eaters are few and far between, and most likely to have been treated very badly by humans before they have turned on them. In truth, though, the leopard is critical to the ecosystem and it has been proven that where a natural apex predator has been wiped out, the ecosystem collapses as there follows a population explosion in the prey animals, which then strip the surrounding area of food, both because their numbers are uncontrolled and because they no longer have anything to fear, which means they no longer lightly graze an area before moving on to keep ahead of the feared predator.
Every trip with Noel is amazing, always starting just before sunrise, the travellers unzip their luxury tents with solar power and four-poster beds that are hard to get out of at 4am, and have their showers beneath a crystal clear night sky lit up with vibrant stars and the full moon. They then head off on another spectacular adventure of leopard hide and seek, holding on for dear life with one hand on the jeep rail, as the roads are hellishly bumpy, with the other hand on sketchpads to draw the voodoo of the location and maybe a leopard if they are lucky. The binoculars swinging above them are vital to get a closer look at the hundreds of incredible exotic birds, later in the morning while eating breakfast at one of Yalas many waterholes. As the track twists and turns in search of ghosts of the jungle, cameras are precariously balanced, held at the ready to capture the National Geographic moments  they will almost certainly not be disappointed as Noel has an encyclopaedic knowledge of leopards and the parks, making every trip an adventure. Rodrigo brings to every safari an inexplicable wow factor with his charismatic leopard-like looks and passion and years of understanding how wildlife think and act. A man that is always some way away from the five-hundred-jeep entourage of a million ordinary photo shots of the more obvious parts of Yala, he instead heads off to remote areas where the roads are muddy and hardly used, where you wont see another vehicle for hours and can sit in isolation, listening to the wildlife chitter chatter and wait for that exhilarating alarm call that harkens of a leopard on the prowl.
Suddenly, the peace is shattered by the harsh alarm calls of the elders of the toque troop of monkeys just above the jeep, who swing as fast as they can to safety. One naughty teenage monkey carries on playing in the trees, ignoring its mothers pleas to flee, and even though we cant see anything, the animals have picked up the whiff of a leopard, from the prevailing winds. Theres a loud scream and then silence in a moment that is so swift that even on video, played over and over again, it is hard to comprehend just how fast a leopard can move in for a kill; in a heart thumping moment, a massive male, after racing across the plains at nearly sixty kilometres per hour, scrabbles up an acacia tree and grabs the terrified teenage monkey by the throat, not unlike a cobra strike. The screams that came from its family troop, now across the valley, ring out desperately, distraught at their loss, leaving everyone deeply moved - cries that are even more deafening than the warnings. A cool reminder to all observers that jungle justice is summarily executed on the unwitting and, as the leopard drags the limp monkeys body further up the tree to devour it in peace, who really is the king of the jungle.

Life-size  cakes  of Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle
Wedding fever has now officially taken over as Britain gets ready to watch Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle .
But how do you celebrate the exciting occasion if youre a budding baker By making a life-size cake of the happy couple - obviously.
Lara Mason spent 250 hours making the incredible cake, and the final result is extremely realistic.
It could feed 500 people and was made using 300 eggs, 15kg of flour, 15kg of butter and 15kg of sugar. To decorate and to hold the whole thing together, she needed more than 10kg of buttercream, 20kg of modelling chocolate and 50kg of fondant icing. Speaking to Mirror Online, Lara said: It really has been a labour of love but Im so please and so proud of myself
Its the tallest cake Ive ever made. Annoyingly, Prince Harry is 6ft 2 so it had to be 6ft 2. But you dont know until you try. Every time I test myself and push my boundaries I learn something new.
We think the cake looks incredible, but the biggest test was when she showed it off to her one-year-old twin daughters Lily and Lyla. She said: Lyla reached her arms out to try and give him a hug, so she must have thought he was a real person. That was the final nod because she wasnt scared of him.
Lara made the cake at her West Midlands home around working a full time job and looking after her daughters. She said: It was just trying to find ten minutes here and there.
Lara says the hardest part was sculpting Harry and Meghans faces from modelling chocolate.
She made the cake for the Cake International event, which will be held in Birmingham in November, so her incredible design will be doing into storage for the next few months.
A spokesman for Cake International said: The cake was designed to stretch the designers boundaries in the art of cake decorating and never intended to be eaten, but enjoyed by thousands as an inspirational feature at Cake International at the NEC in November.
Its also been designed to catch the eye, which it certainly has done so for the artist the cost, ingredients and most importantly the design challenge have been well rewarded.
Lara shared the photos on the parenting website The Motherload and shes been inundated with comments praising her work. This isnt the first time Lara has impressed us all with her incredible cake making skills. In February she made life-size models of her twin daughters Lily and Lyla for their first birthday party. Speaking at the time, she said: I totally get this wont be everyones cup of tea, but not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself Why not!
I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday! Mirror

Market oriented dairy products will strengthen rural economy: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the market oriented dairy project launched in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture would strengthen and improve the countrys rural economy.
He was speaking at the launch of the Market-Oriented Dairy Project by the United States Department of Agriculture in collaboration with the Government at the Movenpick Hotel, Colombo.
The 4.5 year, USD 14.1 Million (SLR 2 billion) initiative is implemented by the US based International Executive Service Corps (IESC).
The Prime Minister said the project was a part of governments initiatives to uplift the rural economy. The project will help small and medium scale dairy farmers and other dairy related businesses to meet growing demand by increasing productivity and expanding the trade of milk and dairy products, he said.
The Prime Minister said the small scale dairy farmers produce around four to five litres per day and the project targets to increase it up to 10 litres per day as the first step. He said that in the long run, the farmers will be able to increase four times compared to their present day production.
The Prime Minister further said similar projects would improve rural economy and the living standard of the small and medium dairy farmers. He said the government will strengthen and grow countrys dairy sector. He thanked the US government and US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Atul Keshap for their support.
Project Director of the ICSE Matthew Krause said the project would address the growing demand for fresh milk and milk products. He pointed out that Dairy is the most important sub sector in the Sri Lankan livestock industry, yet currently the country can meet only about 30-40 percent of fresh milk demand.
The Ambassador and the Assistant Deputy Administrator, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Brian V. Guse reaffirmed their commitment to the long standing relationship and bilateral cooperation between the countries and expresses their confidence on the potential impact of such initiatives towards overall prosperity of the nation.
The project targets an average annual growth of 18 percent in Milk production by 2022 with a life of project growth 127 percent. Approximately, 80 percent of beneficiary farmers are expected to receive a quality-based price premium for their milk.

N. Koreas threat to cancel summit: Trump says well see
US: US President Donald Trump sounded a note of caution on Wednesday about his much-vaunted summit with Kim Jong Un, saying we'll see after Pyongyang threatened to cancel.
Trump said the US government had not received any official word of a change in plans for the June 12 meeting in Singapore.
We haven't been notified at all. We'll have to see, Trump said in the Oval Office.
We haven't seen anything. We haven't heard anything. We will see what happens. Whatever it is, it is. After weeks of warm words and diplomatic backslapping, Pyongyang abruptly threatened to pull out Tuesday, over US demands for unilateral nuclear abandonment. In an angrily worded statement, the North warned if the US is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue. The statement was attributed to first vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan and carried by state media KCNA.
In that case, he added, Pyongyang would have to reconsider its participation at next month's summit in Singapore.
The first vice foreign minister also tore into Trump's National Security Advisor John Bolton for drawing parallels between North Korea and Libya, calling the comparison absolutely absurd. We do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him, he said of Bolton.
Bolton has pushed the idea of a deal with North Korea like that reached with Libya's Moamer Kadhafi, who agreed in 2003 to the elimination of his country's nuclear program and chemical weapons arsenal to gain sanctions relief.
After giving up his atomic program, Kadhafi was killed in 2011 in an uprising backed by NATO bombing.
Experts have not been surprised by the sudden about face, expecting bumps in the road as tough issues to be discussed in the meeting come into sharper focus.
Washington is pressing for North Korea's complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. But so far, the North has given no public indication of what it is offering, beyond a broad commitment to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearization is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States, the North Korean minister said.
In the past, Pyongyang has demanded the withdrawal of US troops stationed in the South, and an end to Washington's nuclear umbrella over its ally. China, North Korea's sole major ally, called for the summit to go ahead. The North Korean warning follows a weeks-long charm offensive that has seen Kim Jong Un hold a historic summit with the South's president and meet twice with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pyongyang also raised hopes ahead of the US summit by announcing it will destroy its nuclear testing site next week. - AFP

Nestle in a  bird  haven
With over 10,500 identified species, birds are found in all corners of the world. Each species is unique and able to survive in a huge range of environments. And Sri Lanka is one of those countries where you can find many species of birds especially during their migration period. Birds just like animals have love and feelings, using different interesting ways to grab attention from their partners- through sounds, chirping rhythms, dance, and fights to win over their competition, and so on. There are plenty of bird lovers amongst us locals here and residing at a location where we get to experience this is just stunning.
Birds habitats are slowly destroyed due to high infrastructure developments and commercialization of cities including urbanization all around the world and its the same case with Sri Lanka. However, the Orchid project at Malabe by Nivasie and ICC has made every effort in preserving this beautiful environment with a perfect balance, giving more weightage and space surrounded by greenery. And yes, if you are a resident you are definitely natures lover, more like birds lover- landscaped parks, natural water bodies, paddy fields and all natural vegetation give serene sanctuary to number of varieties of birds.
Though the project is situated at a highly commercialized city, residents at the luxury housing project Orchid Malabe barely feels that he or she is in a busy, noisy city as the environment is just so calm and peaceful, making it an ideal residence for a responsible, sustainable living.
Interestingly, the project is in a very close proximity to the Thalangama Wetland Sanctuary which is widely regarded as a spot to make bird watching a hobby. The diversity of this wetland is remarkable with over 100 species of birds and a numerous species of butterflies and dragonflies. It includes a variety of water birds namely common moorhen, little cormorant, median egrets, little egret, purple heron, gray heron, pond heron, magpie robin, red watted lapwing, black crowned night heron, little grebe among others.
The wetland is also resident to four species of Kingfishers- Pied Kingfisher, Common Kingfisher, White-throated Kingfisher and the Stork-billed Kingfisher which is by far the largest Kingfisher in the country. The location is a stop by for birds making their journey to the southern coast during their migrant season. Some migrants include golden plover, lesser sand plover, common sandpiper, common greenshank, wood sandpiper, kenish plover and black wing stilt. many species of forest birds including green imperial pigeon, spotted dove, greater coucal, rose ringe parakeet, Asian koel, Indian scopes owl, brown hawk owl, little green bee-eater, Ceylon small barbet, Indian pigmy woodpecker, etc.
More interestingly residents can just wake up to a walk at the newly built jogging track at Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga Mw, a long two and a half kilometer track runs from Malabe New Kandy Road to Pinketha Junction just 500m away from Orchid Malabe.
Its almost impossible to see over a hundred species of birds in a day even in the endemic rainforest such as Yala which provides a matrix of habitats. But here in this area youre assured of coming across more than 70 species of birds within few hours. Thalangama Wetlands urban location demonstrates how rich a wildlife refuge it is and how precious it is as an educational and recreational resource for Colombos growing population.

Parking meter fines suspended in Colombo

Colombo Mayor, Rosy Senanayake instructed the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner to suspend all fines charged from parking meters in the city, today.
The Mayor through her official twitter account tweeted, With regard to the recent complaints on parking meter fines. Pending council approval I have given instructions to the commissioner to suspend all fines charges relating to parking meters.
The new parking meters set up around Colombo have caused a stir among the general public with not only the system of payment but also with many not being aware that a parking meter functioned in the area, thus running fines amounting to several thousands.
The media recently reported an incident where a man in Wellawatte who had failed to pay his parking fee of Rs 30, had been fined Rs 10,120 after a lapse of 13 days. His complaint went viral on social media with the mayor as well as opposition members assuring that the matter would be resolved.
CMC member Milinda Rajapaksha on his twitter on May 15 stated that the CMC had discussed the issue of parking meters at its council meeting and that they had discussed the need to restructure the fine and operating system of the parking meters.
In 2015, the CMC signed a public private partnership agreement with Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd to manage several parking locations in Colombo. The company has been authorized to manage the parking meters and collect the fines.
Tenaga accordingly manages parking along Galle Road (from the Galadari Junction to the Dehiwala Bridge) and Duplication Road (from Liberty Plaza Junction to Dharmarama Road), including all intersecting by-lanes.

Peace prevails thanks to warriors
The last bullet was fired on May 19, 2009 and this is the 9th year since the war ended. Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake requested his soldiers that the whole country has a lot of aspirations on the Army, Navy and the Air Force.
It is our responsibility to ensure that we live and maintain that standard and give confidence to all Sri Lankans that we are your guardians. Secondly, I pray that peace will prevail and if it is a fragile peace, we should do everything in our power, forgetting all differences, politically and work towards a common objective to ensure that this country fast track to reach the lost 30 years, and to ensure that the next generation should not suffer the way we had to. That is the commitment all soldiers should bear in mind. I pray that all disabled soldiers a speedy recovery and we are a victorious army and we should maintain that victory, he said, adding that the role of the army has been changed from a combat army to a capacity based army. The army is now undergoing a process of rightsizing. National security cannot be compromised at any cost, the Commander said.
During the 9 years after the war, we as the armed forces is looking at different ways on how we should celebrate our victory. The army is a glamorous force, but it is not to be exhibited outside. We are very happy with the representations on February 4th which is the accepted day of national Independence. May 19th came about primarily because of the war and that particular operation. As for the Army there are two important calendar days, one being the day of Independence and the other is the Army day on October 10. Our pomp and pageantry can be exhibited if required on these two days and not otherwise, he said.
The ruthless war that plagued the country for three decades led to the loss of thousands of lives both military and civilian. In the Army 877 officers and 19,597 other rankers have sacrificed their lives to liberate the country from terrorism. A further 125 officers are still reported missing in action while 3,363 other rankers are also reported missing during the war. The war has also rendered 1,298 officers disabled while another 36,659 other rankers were also rendered disabled.
Among them around 11 officers and around 275 other rankers who are currently housed at five state run institutions to ensure they are cared for throughout their life. These institutions are Abhimansala in Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya and Pangolls, Mihindu Seth Medura in Attidiya and Ranaviru Sevana in Ragama.
However, while these valiant soldiers have sacrificed their life and limb to liberate the country, their sacrifice has been ignored and the day has been transformed into a gallant ceremony, which has attracted much criticism. In an interview with the Daily News, the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said he is not blaming the government for taking the decision to hold these pageants, but added that these parades were a source of great inconvenience for the very soldiers. There are many who like to come and watch these parades, but it is the very soldier who has to put in a great deal of effort to make these parades a success. Hence, this is not the time to blow our own trumpet and boast to the world that we are victorious. What we want is to remember our brothers who sacrificed their lives for this combat and those who have been made disabled during the war and all Sri Lankans who suffered.
He noted that this year they are not under pressure or no agenda has been given to them with regard to holding a victory day ceremony. Instead he said a series of programmes have been organised at every military establishment throughout the country. I have already issued a message as the Commander appreciating all what our officers, soldiers and predecessors have done to bring about peace. I have also told them what we are supposed to do now to maintain this peace.
When asked about memorial ceremonies that are being organised in the North to commemorate the fallen LTTE members, the Commander said, The Tamils have their own sentiments. If they light a lamp in memory of a relative who had died during the war, it should not matter. We have our own programmes to commemorate this day at all religious institutions. Hence, there is nothing wrong in the people in the North commemorating their loved ones who have died during the war. Moreover, it costs millions of rupees to hold such pageants. With the rise in fuel prices and the rising cost of living, how can we, being the armed forces who are paid by the public, have such functions with public funds We feel that this is not the right way. Instead we would rather conduct religious activities that would bring merit to the souls of these war heroes, he said.
When asked about allegations that the war heroes are being discarded and them being deprived of even their rightful pensions, the Commander said, The war heroes who are dependent, will be taken care of by the military for the rest of their life. With regard to their pensions, the governments have already addressed these issues. But there are policies, governing rules and regulations in terms of finances. There are procedural delays and blocks at several points. Even once the Cabinet approves, there is a process. All those who left the army after injury or disablement have been given their demands even without completion of 12 years of service. But when there is a delay some make a big issue. Others take political advantage and push these soldiers onto the streets to protest. There may be some who are facing disciplinary issues which will have to be sorted out first. The Defence Ministry has done a comprehensive study and taken positive steps to resolve these issues. Many other countries do not pay these disables soldiers like we do, he said, adding that some had opted to leave the army knowing what they were forfeiting and come back after some time claiming for their rights. They are not babies, they knew what they were committing to when they opted to leave, he added.
He noted that a war is an extension of politics. As the countrys military we had to fight but now it is over. We know what the threats to the country are. Now that the war is over we have a two pronged approach for the future of the army for 2020 and 2025 and beyond. In that the role of the army is clearly identified. The strength of the military to achieve these goals has also been identified. That is called rightsizing. All these years we were a threat based army, but now we are looking at a capacity based army where we should have the capacity to face any eventuality. This is the sustainment and modernisation plans for the army, noted Lt. Gen. Senanayake.
He noted it is a concern for him that there are over 300 missing from the army. He said in Batticaloa Police in a day over 600 went missing, in Mulaithivu 200 missing in one night. But no one is talking about these, but we are cooperating with the Office of the Missing Persons. We are very happy to have the four pillars of transitional justice. With regard to the local mechanism, we must understand that this countrys judicial system has a history of thousands of years. Hence we dont need to get judges from another country. But its a matter of someone getting these parties together and building the confidence of the people. We are in fact educating the people of the North and East to make use of the OMP.

President Maithripala Sirisena will chair the Provincial Steering Committee Meetings on the Grama Shakthi programme aimed at alleviating poverty, Presidents Secretary Austin Fernando said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department auditorium yesterday, the Secretary said the first provincial meeting will be conducted in Badulla on May 21 with the attendance of all regional stakeholders. After the Uva Province, the next meeting will be held in Puttalam. The President will be directly involved in these progress review meetings of the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement which was launched by the State for the poor, last year, he said.
Under Phase One, 1,000 underprivileged grama niladari divisions have been selected for a pilot project. The project aims to cover 5,000 grama niladari divisions by 2020. He said the Presidential Secretariat with the coordination of relevant regional stakeholders is currently undertaking the following projects for the socio-economic betterment of the people: National Programme for the Empowerment of Disabled and Elderly Population, Sustainable School Programme, National Child Protection Programme, National Environmental Conservation Programme, National Sustainability Discourse Programme, Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Deveopment Programme, Sirisara Pivisuma District Development Programme, National Food Production Programme, National Agri Business Development Programme, National Drug Prevention Programme, Special Operations Unit for National Cultural Renewal and Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease.
We accept that we have been slow in carrying the message of these programmes to the people, but we have decided to expedite those activities, he added.
Additional Secretary to the President, Jayantha Wijeratne pointed out the poverty rate of the country has been controlled at 67 percent, but there is growth in the lower middle class category.
Those in the lower middle class category are highly susceptible to fall into the category of the poor if they face natural disasters, etc. We have paid attention to these two categories under the Grama Shakthi Programme, he said.

Printed material to be modified for visually impaired
Amendments to Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003 to introduce exceptions related to copyright that would facilitate the reproduction and distribution of printed media for print disabled persons was approved by Cabinet this week.
In 2016, Cabinet had granted approval to amend the Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003, prior to the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty.
The treaty allows for copyright exceptions to facilitate the creation of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works for visually impaired (print disabled) persons. Sri Lanka ratified the treaty in October 2016.

PS members give up lunch allowance
All councillors of the Wennappuwa Pradeshiya Sabha unanimously agreed to use the money that is allocated for their mid-day meal during their monthly meetings, for development of the PS area.
There were about 22 councillors previously and that number has increased to 44. Considering the heavy public expenditure incurred for their lunch, all of the councillors agreed to donate the money for the common good of the people in that area. Each councillor is allocated Rs.600 for each meeting.
However, they decided to accept only the communication allowance granted to them. Each councillor is granted Rs.3,000 per monthly as communication allowance.

PUCSL asks CEB for Generation Plan
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the regulator for the power sector, has written to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) asking the licensee to submit with immediate effect a Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan taking into consideration the policy principals as approved by the Cabinet.
In a document, which the Daily News is in receipt of, PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew has asked the CEB to inculcate four distinct policy principals when drafting a new Generation Plan. The policy directive places emphasis on maximizing attention to environmental conservation by reducing carbon footprint, maintaining a low generation cost at all times, taking into account energy security and developing non-conventional renewable energy and new energy sources.
Mathews refers to the Cabinet memorandum approved by the Cabinet stating that the energy policy of the countrys generation mix should comprise a fusion of 30 percent coal, 30 percent LNG, 25 percent large hydro and 15 percent furnace oil.
The commission requests you to comply with the government policy guidelines with immediate effect, it reads. The letter has also been sent to the President, Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
Meanwhile, representatives from the CEB Engineers Union (CEBEU), who met with the President at the sidelines of an event, had requested him to look into the issue.
We send a letter to the President yesterday citing that the CEB refuses to draft a new plan until the issues relating to the PUCSL are looked into, CEBEU Executive Committee Member Athula Wanniarachchi said. What the PUCSL did with the initial plan sent by the CEB is illegal, and weve asked that advice be sought from the Attorney General. Weve also asked for the removal of the PUCSL Director General as we have no confidence in working with him.
The Union, he said, was in consensus that the issue relating to the Generation Plan initially submitted by the CEB be sorted before drafting a new one. Theres no guarantee they (PUCSL) are not going to meddle with the next plan we submit and make changes on their own calculations.

Rising world prices impacted local LPG gas market - Laugfs
LAUGFS Gas PLC stressed the importance of the recent increase in the LPG retail price approved by the Consumer Affairs Authority, while elaborating on the macro-economic conditions that necessitated it.
The Saudi Aramco Contract Price is considered the primary international benchmark for LPG price regulations within the Arabian Gulf and Asian region, and a significant volatility in this Contract Price was seen directly impacting the LPG retails prices in Sri Lanka.
There have been significant changes in the LPG prices in the international market, which has had a detrimental impact on the local LPG industry.
During the period between May 2017 and January 2018 alone, a metric tonne of LPG price has increased by almost 50%. In addition, the local LPG retail price is impacted by a number of other macro-economic factors.
For example, the world steel prices have been on the rise, which increases the LPG cylinder manufacturing cost. The Rupee depreciation against the US Dollar is another important factor, that negatively affects the local LPG industry, when the costs of imports, transportation, import clearances etc. increase, remarked LAUGFS Group Chairman, W.K.H. Wegapitiya.
These have all had a damaging impact on the local LPG industry, as each cylinder was sold at a loss. With LPG companies continuously operating at a loss over a period of time, it had made the entire industry unsustainable, which necessitated a price increase to address negative repercussions not only to the industry, but also to the countrys economy, he further elaborated.
LAUGFS Gas entered the local LPG downstream industry in 2001, and operates in the domestic, commercial and industrial sectors, employing over 350 staff and creating indirect employment opportunities for thousands.
As a company that takes deep pride in our Sri Lankan heritage, LAUGFS Gas has been able to make a remarkable economic and social impact on our country for over 16 years. Our impact on our country is not simply limited to delivering trusted LPG solutions, assuring safety and quality. There are also hundreds and thousands of families who depend on us through the many employment and livelihood opportunities we have created within the country, commented LAUGFS Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.
On the long term, there will continue to be global price volatility and other macro-economic factors, which are largely unpredictable, affecting the local LPG Industry.
Therefore, we believe a fair and effective pricing formula based on key indicators would help address this situation, where consumers would be able to enjoy price benefits arising from decreasing market prices, while ensuring sustainability of the local LPG industry during times of rising world prices. he remarked.

Royalties brought to book
Not many authors are familiar with that sheet of paper. Not many publishers are interested in providing such material for reasons unknown. The sheet of paper has a name: royalty statement. Only a few publishers in Sri Lanka provide the authors with a royalty statement. The statement is something that triggers hope for authors of any exam-oriented textbook, translation of some popular fiction, a novel in Sinhalese, a coffee-table book and a limited range. Otherwise, be ready to bury your head in the sand.
Book-writing is hardly a lucrative industry if you fail to reach your audience. Everyone is familiar with that ground reality. Thats why the recent announcement of a tax imposed on the royalty stirred a hornets nest. The tax was likened to the daylight robbery of the beggars meal on the social media referring to the vernacular idiom.
The government decision underwent an amendment in the wake of a public outcry. Authors with earnings exceeding Rs 50,000 per mensem and Rs 500,000 per annum will be taxed at 14 percent. The percentage was a four percent increase from the previous 10 percent. Rs 50,000 and Rs 500,000 will be exempted per mensem and per annum. Only the exceeding amount of the royalty will be taxed.
The Inland Revenue Act No 24 of 2017, certified on October 24, 2017, offers a definition to royalty  or book royalty - in a broad perspective.
Royalty means a payment, including a payment of a premium or like amount, derived as consideration for 
(a) the use of or right to use a copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films, software or video or audio recordings, whether the work is in electronic format or otherwise;
(b) the use of or right to use a patent, trademark, design or model, plan, or secret formula or process;
(c) the use of or right to use any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment;
(d) the use of or right to use information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience;
(e) the rendering of or the undertaking to render assistance ancillary to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d); or a total or partial forbearance with respect to a matter referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e).
The Inland Revenue Act definition aside, the book royalty payment is a percentage of a book's sale or a flat fee per book sold, that is paid to a book's author to compensate them for publishing and/or distribution rights. The royalties are usually paid by the publisher after sales are confirmed. There could probably be a lag time between a book's sale and when an author actually gets paid. That lag time could even be months or probably years. The publisher has the sole right to decide the payout period and threshold based on the books movement in the market.
Take a deep breath! Rs 600,000 per annum, or Rs 50,000 per mensem, as a royalty, is a breathtaking figure to the book-length wordsmiths of our country. It is a bumper dividend limited to a privileged few, admit both publishers and authors.
But what worries both categories is the withholding tax, according to Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association President Vijitha Yapa.
We need to pay a certain levy with every royalty as a part of the withholding tax. But it is not clear how and where we can claim it back, Yapa remarked.
On that premise, Yapa also noted that imposing a tax on the royalty payment is against the norm especially as Sri Lanka is the signatory to the Florence Agreement where the government agrees not to impose any taxes on royalties.
Increasing book prices
Majority of Sri Lankan authors are amateurs. Unlike professional authors settled elsewhere, they do not generate many sales. What happens in Sri Lanka is that people engage in authoring books as a leisure time activities rather than a professional industry. And to tax such an endeavour is wrong, Vijitha Yapa noted.
Yapa indicated that drastic measures such as increasing the book prices would have to be taken if the taxation continues to be in force.
We are trying to improve the literary standards of this country. Any royalty is considered an income tax. This is like a default tax that the publisher has to remit to the government, Yapa added. The publishers should be the benefiting cluster from anger over the tax on book royalty, but it is struggling to capitalise. Finally, it affects the authors meagre fee gained from a creative exercise.
The royalty percentage varies in Sri Lanka, though the agreed figure seems 10 percent. If an author is to earn a sum of Rs 600,000 (six hundred thousand) per annum, the sales of his book should be 10 fold of the same. Add another zero, and you get the amount: Rs 6,000,000 (six million). Such a figure for a book sale within a year will be a landmark achievement in the book publishing industry.
Knowing well that such an amount cannot be amassed, the authors engage in the field mostly owing to either the passion or as an extra source of income. Only a handful of authors have permanently settled down in the industry.
According to Dayawansa Jayakody, a past President of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers Association, an average Sinhala book-length fiction is priced at Rs 500.
Any publisher would price the book treble the printing cost. Then only can we generate the income to sort our expenses before thinking of a profit. An average book is about Rs 300 or 350. We used to print 1,000 copies. But now we have to restrict that number because of the sales failure.
Books take time to sell. Books dont sell like hotcakes unless under special circumstances. That said, a book wont generate more than Rs 30,000 as a royalty payment to its author. An author has to produce many books within one year to reach the 500,000 figure.
The first print of 1,000 copies, on the other hand, would hardly make it to the second print. In the second print, the figure will most likely be 500 copies.
Keeping the records of royalty payment is not a habit of the publishers save a few. However, most writers have not so far scrupled about it. The writers, mostly struggling with financial difficulties, bank on the publishers for some advance or another sum which would later be deducted from the royalty payment.
Alternative sources of income
National Property Office Director General Geethanjani Ranawaka, Attorney-at-Law, observes the move as an encouragement for the publishers to streamline their royalty payment process.
The taxation is not unique to the book royalties. It will be relevant to other sources of income. Employees of public and private sector alike depend on alternative sources of income. The government generates income from taxing on those areas. Book royalty payment is only one such area, according to Ranawaka.
According to the Inland Revenue Act, the income of a resident or non-resident individual for a year of assessment will be taxed at a certain point. For instance, four percent will be taxed on the income of Rs. 600,000 while eight percent will be charged when the income exceeds Rs 600,000 up to Rs 1200,000.
We know very well that some writers earn more than Rs 50,000 a month. They will be charged 14 percent from the royalties. The writers earning below that amount are exempted from the taxation.
Every government officer gets a certain amount deducted from their salary according to the PAYE tax. If that applies to the government sector, then why not people of the private sector, Ranawaka questions. As she points out, writing a book is only a source of income for most writers as they are permanently employed elsewhere.
H D Premasiri, immediate past president of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers Association added that the taxation is an odd move.
The creative writers do not have a colossal market here. Its so tough to trace creative writers who earn more than Rs 50,000 a month. It is an unlikely source of income for the government, Premasiri said.
As Professor J B Disanayaka pointed out that the move offers the writer a chance to have a detailed version of book sales. Most publishers would not provide the book sale details, and the governments decision would force the publishers to maintain a record, Professor Disanayaka said. The authors would at least get to know the progress of the book sales albeit at the cost of a tax imposition, he added.
There is a however in this case.
The university don cum author is contradicted by another author. Kamal Perera, Lanka Writers Organisation Secretary, maintains that the creative writers should not be subject to taxation.
We need to find a definition for the writer. He is someone who does things to awaken the creative mind. He guides the society. For that, he uses his mental and physical strength. It is different to what others do physically, Perera elaborated.
Perera cited various advertisements where doctors and other professionals have come forward claiming to be paying tax. What would the writer gain from the society in return to his writing
Even if an author earns more than Rs 50,000 a month that would not be his net income, Perera said.
Creative writers do not just write. They engage in research. They use their own funds to travel. Some writers have to pay for typesetting as well. Some have to finance the maintenance of their computers. They burn the midnight oil to produce high-quality work. That earning of Rs 50,000 a month, if there is any, would not just come. It comes at a price. It is not a nett income, Perera elaborates.
The move offers a false picture of writers living in the lap of luxuries according to Perera. There could be writers of that calibre abroad, but not in this land, he emphasises. In essence, Perera pointed out that writing is not a lucrative career.
Some writers earn quite a lot, Perera was quick to draw attention to another facet. They write to the advertising industry. But the creative authors wont earn that much. Perera also questioned the worth of Rs 50,000 as a monthly sum.
Even a labourer would earn more or less the same amount. With a cost of living on a higher pedestal, you cannot consider this half-lakh as an amount at all. No writer can survive alone with creative work, Perera elaborated.
On the other hand, the writers dont get their pay on a monthly basis. They get their payments randomly. Sometimes they get the payment in advance. Sometimes they get their payment on sympathetic grounds. Some leading publishers issue a monthly report. Some publishers have information available on their ledgers, Perera said.
Although the leading publishers issue cheques in favour of the authors names, Perera added that the otherwise is the much-preferred option. Cheques make things harder as most authors do not have current accounts. They prefer handed over money. If these handed over money enters any records remains a matter worth discussion.
On this premise, Ranawaka directs attention to the publishers.
It is a common factor that most publishers do not settle the royalty payments properly. Taxation or otherwise, this is where the government intervention is required. The taxation encourages the publishers to pay the royalty to authors. Then again, the publishers will also be benefitted from this move, Ranawaka denoted.
According to Ranawaka, the move is not solely meant to target the writers. The royalty could be considered as another source of income.
Lankan Book Writers Association
Vijitha Yapa begs to differ at this stance.
On a personal income tax basis, it is all right to tax your income. Many people have many sources of income. Some earn extra from cultivating lands. There are many sources of extra income. Writing books could be considered in a similar manner. But not in terms of a withholding tax imposed on every royalty payment, Yapa explained.
Ranawaka justified the act of taxing a considerable income.
We all know that most writers are professionally settled elsewhere. For them, writing books is one source of income. The governments intention is to impose a tax on this source of income. There are writers who get a fat royalty. There are writers who dont get much of a royalty. If there are writers who get a fat royalty, then they would have to pay a certain tax. If there are writers who dont get much of a royalty, they dont have to worry. They are exempted, Ranawaka added.
Much of this does not make sense to the Lankan Book Writers Association. The Association will launch a protest movement at Dr NM Perera Mawatha on May 22. The streets have long missed the Booksmith. They would now come up in arms to secure their own rights.
One thing is certain. A monetary move could consolidate two groups, publishers and authors, into one faction. Determining the fate of this drama is up to their audience: the readership.

Sekarage David invents Coco-peat drying machine
Sekarage David, a well-known industrial machinery manufacturer has invented a convenient Coco-Peat drying machine (coconut coir dust) which is an alternative to sun-drying machines.
Sekarage, says, although there are around 60 coconut-coir dust drying machines available in the country at present, they are time-consuming, sun-drying machines.
There is a great demand for coir dust (Coco-Peat) drying machines in the world market, as it is widely used in the floriculture industry. Although there are a number of coconut-producing countries in the world, no country has initiated to make a Coco-Peat drying machine, Sekarage says adding that Sri Lnaka has taken the lead in introducing a convenient machine for drying Coco-Peat.
Sekarage, is a professional engineer with a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Moratuwa University. He obtained his MBA from the Rajarata University and also holds a Masters Degree in Economics from the Colombo University. He also studied at the Pune University, India.
He further said, We can supply this machine to suit the needs of the industry. Sekarage runs his workshop, Technical Services Centre (TSC), in close proximity to the Ekala Industrial Estate, in Ja-Ela.
TSC has manufactured conveyors, agitators, mixers, sieving machines, chemical pumps, blenders, furnaces, deck ovens, rack ovens, rotary ovens, service carts, rice degraders, ball mills - match mixers, stainless steel structures, automated dryers for noodles and papadam.
He also supplies machinery for industries like food, soap, cement, textiles, coconut, rubber, packaging, paint and agro based industries. His clients include, major industrialists who use high-tech industrial tools and machinery in the country.
Sekarage, is capable to modify any ageing imported machinery to suit the local needs and requirements. He has so far helped industrialists save valuable foreign currency by producing machinery locally, instead of getting down expensive foreign machinery.
The machine he manufactured for the then Government owned Ceylon Gas Company for its main gas filling plant ages back to the year somewhere in 1979.
Sekarage, who manifested signs of proven ability of his craftsmanship since the latter part of 1970s, conducted a first-ever five day Industrial Exhibition 25 years ago, Techno 93 in 1993, single-handedly.
This exhibition was inaugurated by the late President, Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Following the exhibition, the then Lever Bros. (now Unilever) gave him the contract to turn out machinery for their use. Ceat-Kelani Tyre Manufacturers was another client which got the best of his service.
Sekarage also has exported several machines from soap manufacturing, washing plants to bottle filling plants to countries such as the Maldives and Vietnam.
He conceded that although his machines would not match the UK, Germany or USA standards, he would assure that the quality and precision of his machines would be amongst the best in South Asia.
Sekarage has also rendered his services to the Sri Lanka Railway, the Ceylon Tobacco Company, Sri Lanka Sugar Corporation and Rhino Asbestos and has served as the Chief Engineer at Baurs Limited.
Sekarage recalls with gratitude how the then Baurs Managing Director Thilo Hoffman helped him in the 1980s, to set up his own workshop to manufacture machinery plants in Ja-ela.
Currently, he exports his machinery to the Maldives, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Nigeria and African countries. His next plan is to write a few books, using his vast experiences in engineering and economics fields.

Setting Lankan theatre  on international map
The Colombo International Theatre Festival is an eagerly anticipated event that has been taking place for six consecutive years. The seventh edition will take place from May 23  30. Daily News spoke to Festival Director, M. Safeer about what to expect this year.
Safeer points out that there is no great financial remuneration but he does it for the love of it and to put Sri Lanka on the map of world theatre.
The purpose here is to let the world know that Sri Lankan theatre has a lot to offer and we want the international community to appreciate its richness and diversity, said Safeer.
Safeer personally feels that holding such a festival should be the duty of the government but since that is not happening, he and some others have taken on this responsibility.
For the last six years we have received more than 400 applications from around 60 countries. This year itself we have received over 150 applications. From that we have shortlisted five Sri Lankan plays and eight international plays. Although there is international recognition, financially we are not doing well as we have little sponsors and little support. Thus it is with difficulties that we run this festival, stated Safeer.
However this time the International Theatre Institute (ITI) is with us. It is one of the worlds biggest theatre organizations under UNESCO. ITI is a patron of our festival. This is a huge honour and achievement, explained Safeer.
The theatre festival will be held at the Lionel Wendt with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, Goethe Institute and the Indian Cultural Center partnering the event.
In Sri Lanka theatre is not an industry. Theatre practitioners in Sri Lanka do it for the love of it. In USA, Europe and Italy theatre is an industry. In doing this theatre festival we are on the international theatre map. Now we are recognized. This is the reason we have got more than 150 applications from countries like India, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Argentina, Kosovo and Austria, Safeer pointed out.
In our country we need good infrastructure for theatre, we need good theatre policies and we need recognition. The first international theatre festival was magical, but over the next few years there were challenges that accompanied it. Now the challenge is sustaining this festival. We need good sponsors. When we did it for the first time we were only amateurs. The first time we only got 16 applications. At that time we did not know anything. It was a miracle! Now we feel the difficulty in sustaining this festival. This is no easy task but now festival work is almost over, explains Safeer.
Safeer says that when he goes on international tours and conferences he gets a lot of positive feedback and inquiries about the festival.
They are very keen to come to Sri Lanka. Some groups come well before the fixed date and some groups stay after the festival to enjoy Sri Lanka. The CITF is in four sections.
This year we are felicitating Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, followed by the performances over six days at the Lionel Wendt and then we have the Colombo Theatre Forum (May 24, 25 and 28) which is an international theatre directors meeting point held at Goethe. Here every year we focus on a specified subject. This year we are making a proposed theatre policy for Sri Lanka. In our theatre forum we are submitting this theatre policy to the global theatre practitioners and we will get feedback from them. This is an exchange of ideas. Finally we have the workshops (May 25  30). This time we have 10 workshops over five days, two workshops per day. They are conducted by foreign scholars and theatre practitioners at the Indian Cultural Center, Safeer added.

Shindig at the Shangri-La
I saw the Emperor - this soul of the world - go out from the city to survey his reign; it is a truly a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrating on one point while seated on a horse, stretches over the world and dominates it.
Such was the reaction of the great Philosopher Hegel when he contemplated Napoleon Bonaparte astride his white Stallion at Jena. That was the end of philosophy, wrote a 20th century philosopher Alexandre Kojve who wrote a critique on the work of the master.
I saw Gotabhaya Rajapaksa at the lectern at the Shangri-La. I pray that it is not the end of our democracy. Men of action are a menace to the human kind.
This is about the Shindig at the Shangri-La. This is about that great event, where Gotabhaya Rajapaksa announced that he is not a politician. That he is the outstanding alternative to the miserable alternatives we are presently saddled with.
By the year 2030, Chinas economy would expand and become twice the size of the economy of the US relegating it to second place. Indias economy will become the third largest followed by Japan and Indonesia. We Sri Lankans, cannot seize the opportunity to develop the country if we are not ready by the year 2030.
That is wonderfully illuminating if only he told us how he proposes to make us ready for 2030. Is it by electing him President in 2020
He did not say it explicitly. But he has gone to great lengths to imply it. This missive is pended on that rather, solid premise.
He told his Shangri-La audience, that Sri Lanka should seize the window of opportunity presented by the shift of global economic center of gravity.
If that was the burden of his thesis, he should agree to open the damned window and not insist on keeping it shut as he did when he was the powerful puppeteer behind his brothers throne.
In his time at the helm, the internet was not freely accessible. His gate keepers were busy devising ways of encryption and decryption. Now he speaks of the virtues of a knowledge-based economy.
If he has gone to a reform school in the interim, he certainly did not mention it in his peroration.
In measured resonance, punctuated by apparently sincere conviction (so we presume), Gotabhaya Rajapaksa explained his weltanschauung  his wide world perception.
We will open our economy for foreign investors whilst protecting our sovereignty and preserving our cultural values. Economic policies, past and present will be reviewed and improved. Policies that harm the economy will be repudiated.
Therein lies the abyss that we are staring at with a Gotabhaya presidency. He is modern and anti-modern. He preaches cosmopolitan economics and practices xenophobic politics.
He is really and convincingly dangerous. His bigotry is genuine. He is a vegetarian with the appetite of a carnivore.
Love your country. Play your part in shaping its future. The future is in our hands.
Noble sentiments indeed. Now we come against an insurmountable barrier. What is our country Is it a multi ethnic plural democracy wherein different groups compete for power and access resources Or is it a majoritarian monument resting on the myth of a cosmic habitat of a chosen tribe
Autocratic leaders do not come through the back door. In most instances they are elected. Dictators enter from the main gate and very often they are carried on the shoulders of adoring citizens. They are given the reins of the state by people maddened by the inefficiency and sickened by the indifference of their elected governments.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is well on his way to the executive presidency in 2020. His Viyath-maga Erudite-Path conclave at the Shangri-La Hotel was a dazzling demonstration of his mastery in managing terror - his specialty and expertise.
The Shangri-La shindig attracted everybody who was somebody in commerce, industry and finance. Why did they come and sit through the proceedings with such contrived patience and simulated attention
They came not to declare their allegiance to the would-be president. They were there because caution and foresight that got them to the top of their businesses, told them that a declaration of obedience was the commonsense option.
By enticing the linchpins of commerce, industry and finance to his presidential circus, he has delivered a body blow to the UNP establishment that has always retained a prescriptive title to the subconscious of the opulent and the affluent.
They did not go there to learn how Zuckerberg made his billions or how the center of gravity of the global economy was shifting to a point between China and India in the coming decade. In this age of internet of things, such pseudo profundities would not have excited anyone but the most moronic and the least connected.
A Harvard historian, Timothy Snyder has explained the 21st century resurgence of tyrannical regimes under the guise of nationalism and economic revival. The process begins when we allow demagogues to seize the monopoly of defining development. The demagogue excels in challenging verifiable reality.
The demagogue insists on the illusion of a Parliamentary opposition. More than that, the demagogue relies on moderate language and extreme institutions.
South Korea, Indonesia and China are the countries that are focused on. India is included more or less as an afterthought. Japan is included but not stressed.
Did these countries achieve economic growth under democratic regimes Unfortunately, no. Economic growth does not go hand in hand with democracy. The East Asian examples tell us that it was economic growth that led those repressive development models to accommodate democratic demands and values. The processes were too painful.
A point that is missed in the punditry dished out by his marketing acolyte and his Mossad funded advisor from Singapore. Democracy in the East Asian tiger economies were the compelled policy choices of their respective dictators.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has forgotten how he arrived at this firmament. He arrived at this point because universal adult franchise made it possible for his great uncle D. M. indeed a great man to represent the peasantry immortalized by Leonard Wolf in the state council.
The people of this land demand economic prosperity. But they are not ready to barter away their independent minds for a deceptive utopia.

South west monsoon rains begin
Meteorology Department Director K.H.M. Premalal said the present rainy and cloudy condition is expected to continue over the most parts of the country until May 20.
This is due to a low level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka associated with Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (the low pressure zone where the Northern and Southern hemispheric winds meet).
Premalal said the South-West monsoon rain is expected to begin around May 25. But this year it has begun early due to the low pressure zone.
He said heavy rain can be further expected due to the formation of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone and the low pressure area in the central Bay of Bengal which can be expected in coming weeks.
We have issued an advisory for heavy rain, strong winds and rough seas in the Western, Southern and Eastern sea areas of the island.
There is a possibility of heavy showers or thundershowers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70 to 80 kmph) in the sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Batticaloa via Galle and Pottuvil.
Naval and fishing communities are also requested to be vigilant in this regard, he added.
The Meteorology Department will deploy two Doppler weather radar in Pottuvil and Puttalam while developing 76 tsunami detection buoys set up across the country to provide accurate weather predictions in the future. Compensation for the damaged houses has been increased from Rs.100,000 to Rs 2.5 million while compensation for human fatalities due to disasters caused by natural hazards has been increased by Rs.25,000 to Rs.100,000 by the government.

Within 12 days after assuming duty, the Sports Minister made arrangements to unite rival parties and request them to give their maximum support to conduct the 2018-2020 SLHF election as soon as possible. Minister Mustapha directed NOC yesterday under the provisions of 39-1 of Sports Law no. 25/1973 to conduct the election.

## Title: SUSANTHIKA JAYASINGHE  QUEEN  of the track
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Friday, May 18, 2018 - 01:00
SUSANTHIKA JAYASINGHE  QUEEN  of the track
Our Legend this week is also a heroine in athletics on the track. SUSANTHIKA JAYASINGHE who was one of the finest athletes in the Asian scene.
Undoubtedly after Mohammed Lafir won the first world title in billiards for the country, and after Duncan White won a silver medal at the 400-metre hurdles in the 1948 Olympic Games in London it was SUSANTHIKA who stunned the local world with her blazing performances in the 200-metre event at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
Something special
When the Sydney Games came around there were high hopes of JAYASINGHE performing something special for such was her determination and confidence. She had confidence writ all over when she got on the blocks in the 200-metre event. The country was watching her on their tv sets praying that this girl would perform a miraculous act.
And running against the best in the world at that time who brushed aside all her opponents Marion Jones and Pauline- Davis Thompson she ran like a mare, but had to be satisfied with the bronze medal finishing third. However all Sri Lankans were over the moon because this was an Olympic medal after the heroics of Duncan White in 1948.
Resounding cheers
Becoming the Olympic medalist for the country she ran around the stadium with the Lankan flag draped around her to resounding cheers from the spectators. But she did not have to wait long for joy when it was proved that Marion had taken performance-enhancing drugs and disqualified and JAYASINGHE handed the silver medal. Wasnt she ELATED JAYASINGHE too found herself in deaths land when she had earlier in 1998 been accused and found guilty of consuming a banned drug Nandrolone. How she proved this allegation wrong and who helped her is given below in this copy.
Coming from a little-known town and school with not much of an athlete or coach to boast about, SUSANTHIKA showed her god endowed talents in running that shocked the athletic coaches who noticed her extraordinary talent in running.
Champ in the making
They saw in her a champion in the making, not only locally, but who could take the athletic world by storm and make world-renowned internationally famous female athletes running for life to maintain their hard-earned medals and records.
Athletes, especially American Marion Jones according to Lake House journalist Dinesh Weerawansa who never missed covering big world athletic meets, told me that Marion used to sweat when having to run against SUSANTHIKA.
Such was the fear she instilled on athletes fronting up to her. Weerawana who followed her growing prowess from the time she faced starters orders, SUSANTHIKA never showed excitement or nerves, but was confident of her ability and sported that certain smile.
Stupendous achievements
Before going on to further describe her fantastic of achievements, I would like to jog the memory of her legion of fans the torture she endured when her detractors went to town to degrade her efforts with allegations against her having taken performing enhancing drugs that finally proved wrong. Being cleared to move on, on the track.
When the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) sent their findings here that she had taken a banned drug, it was heart-rending and the poor girl who was in the world of torment, worried and probably sleepless for many days.
Great innings
This brings to mind the great innings the world famed Acupuncturist Dr.Anton Jayasuriya played to prove the WADA and the test wrong by using his and other experts knowledge in that field to prove the world governing bodys findings as rubbish.
Jayasuriya had the legal expertise of his great buddy the famous Presidents Counsel Eardley Perera and along with and Neurologist Dr Gethanjan Mendis together they threatened to slap legal action against WADA.
In a local inquiry held here, it was proved that the drug was mistakenly prescribed and taken for some other ailment, that unfortunately contained a banned drug named Nandrolone.
Legal action
Jayasuriya, Perera and Mendis with their findings forwarded it to WADA and threatened to take legal action that seemed to have jolted WADA who redid the test, accepted the explanations and to the relief of her and a legion of supporters she was cleared of any wrongdoing.
I was a close friend of Dr.Jayasuriya and Eardley and I am aware of the time they spent proving the allegations wrong. Mention must also be made of former Deputy Editor Nicholas Candappa who carried lead stories daily in the DAILY OBSERVER to prove SUSANTHIKAS innocence.
Memory does not help
Memory does not help me recall others who helped clear the great girl and ask to be excused if I have left out other names. JAYASINGHE never had the good things that the athletes of today are blessed with. Born to a poor family in Uduwaka she didnt have the money to buy a pair of running shoes.
SUSUSANTHIKA who ran in the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan excelled winning the silver medal in the 200-metre event. She also won silver at the World Athletic Championships in Athens, Greece. She also won two gold medals at the 2007 Asian Championships and a bronze medal at the 2007 IAAF World Championships.
Greatly indebted
SUSANTHIKA is greatly indebted to former Sri Lankan high jumper, the first to clear the bar over six feet NAGALINGAM ETHIRIVEERASINGHAM for taking her to America for further training.
SUSANTHIKA undoubtedly the best ever female athlete produced by Sri Lanka and it is sad that she had not received the recognition and rewarded for bringing fame not only to the country, but also Asia.
Will the country ever produce Another SUSANTHIKA JAYASINGHE She, no doubt, could be crowned the QUEEN of the track in the country.

Tailor-made for drama
Tremendous is a fitting word to describe the talent and the exceptional personalities in the English Drama Club at Newstead Girls College Negombo. Dramatic Moves features these girls who are tailor-made for English Drama.
Teacher in Charge, English Drama Club, Hansani Wijesoma said that the workshops are the backbone of drama at Newstead with competent trainers training the students.
Today in the news we see lots of stories about students committing suicide because they cannot face challenges they come across. Drama helps you face challenges and problems. Students understand the behaviour of different characters. It helps them develop their social skills as well. They learn how to move with others in society. As a Drama Club we have come a long way and I am really happy about it. We have become successful and achieved a lot. We have excelled in dramas conducted by the Inter-school Shakespeare Drama Competition conducted by Rotary Club and Dramas under the Ministry of Education. Our students are very talented. Drama offers them the chance to develop their talents more. It develops their confidence and personalities, said Wijesoma.
Thenuri Abeyasingha has so far taken part in two Shakespeare Competitions  Twelfth Night (2016) and Antony and Cleopatra (2015) where she played the role of a guard named Edward, a name that was coined by the girls.
Doing drama we learn about history. We even learn about different countries. We learn about Julius Caesars and Cleopatras era because we do researches to get into our characters. In Antony and Cleopatra we researched almost every detail that was not in the script  the details concerning Cleopatra and Julius Caesars birth. Even about Octavians rise. So we knew more than the other students because we have done drama, explained Abeyasingha.
She commented that through drama she has gained the ability to understand characters and their attitudes.
I have learnt discernment - understanding the good and the bad. So due to that I manage my life. I have seen characters in real life that are similar to those I have done in different plays. I feel that it is much easier to communicate with them. We know their attitudes and reactions and the way they think of us. We can judge them by that. So it is easier to understand them, said Abeyasingha.
My favourite play is Twelfth Night, I like it because it is both tragedy and comedy. I got the ability to understand different characters which are not similar to each other. To me there was a lot of sadness in Antony and Cleopatra. I think Julius Caesar is a much better play than Antony and Cleopatra, said Abeyasingha.
Gayani Dissanayake revealed that Newstead holds the distinction of becoming Champions at the Inter-School Shakespeare Drama Competition (Rotary) in 2010 having started only in 2009.
My favourite play so far is Macbeth (2014). It was a tragedy and I love tragedies more than comedies. My character was one of the best characters I have played. The cast was good and so was the story. In Macbeth I played King Duncan. I have done many male roles. Duncan was a manly and very commanding person. It was very challenging to me. I learnt a lot playing that role, said Dissanayake.
Dissanayake recalls Measure for Measure in 2011 when they became Runners Up, as another memorable play saying they had a good cast and the play was done in refreshingly new way making it very interesting. It was a new concept. There she played a silent role since it was the first year she entered Shakespeare.
When we did Twelfth Night it was very challenging for us because comedy is not our thing actually. We are very good in tragedies. All our seniors have been very good actresses and taught us a lot and our teachers have been very helpful. I started drama in Grade 4 and then every year I did at least one drama, said Dissanayake.
She confessed that initially she was a very shy person. But when she did drama she was able to become more self- confident and talk in public.
I learnt how to work with a team. Doing drama has been a great learning experience for me. I have participated in six Shakespeare Drama Competitions. Apart from that I have done other junior dramas. I remember Villa for Sale which was a comedy. It was loads of fun doing it though we were not able to go to the all island level, pointed out Dissanayake.
Mariah Fernandopulle felt that Macbeth is her favourite play where she played a silent character.
I feel that Macbeth was not really a very wicked character but his wife was able to manipulate him and influenced him into committing his atrocious act of regicide- the murder of King Duncan. When we do drama we get into another world and we start to live in the play which makes it very interesting. In Twelfth Night I played the role of Curio a close associate of the king. This was quite an experience for me with the cast, and the directors who guided us were great. It was the first time we did a comedy and got into the finals. It was so special and we were so happy at the end, said Fernandopulle.
The first time she did drama was in the primary in Grade 4. It was the Magnificent Mango where she played the main role.
It was really fun because I had to carry a mango and start saying Mango! Mango! Mango all over the stage! I enjoyed that role and we won the national level first place, stated Fernandopulle.
Zeinub Baseron said Twelfth Night is a favourite of hers as it was her first drama.
I have always wanted to do drama from the time I was much younger but I had stage fright. Last year I was my first and I got a supporting character. One role I liked was Maria in Twelfth Night. I was the maid of the mistress. I had to run here and there all over the stage. I had a lot of support from my cast members, the directors and teachers. I enjoyed it. Now I am more confident about myself, said Baseron.
She pointed out that there are different emotions associated with different characters. So that when they meet people in society they develop insights.
Teacher Hansani Wijesoma would like to thank the Principal, Gayani Herath and the staff of N.G.C. and staff members of the English Unit of the school Arosha Perera, Dayaneetha Silva, Shiran Croospulle, Ivan Kiriella and Sumeda Ovitigama.

TRIBUTE TO WAR HEROES - ARMY COMMANDER LIEUTENANT GENERAL MAHESH SENANAYAKE
The LTTE organisation which saw its birth in 1983 as a minor group grew to be one of the most ruthless terrorist organisations in the world by the year 2009. LTTE organisation, equipped with infantry, fire-power, naval strength and a certain degree of air power gained world-wide notoriety as the terrorist group which inducted the suicide bomb concept to the world.
The unfailing commitment, tireless dedication, bravery and courage as well as proper planning of Army, Navy and Air Force members enabled them to rescue thousands of innocent Tamil civilians, used as human shields and win over the LTTE which has by then taken to a cycle of terrorism with the support of the international Diaspora for creation of an Eelam state. Accordingly, terrorism was completely eradicated on May 19, 2009 after capturing the last patch of land, held by terrorists. Towards it, Sri Lanka Police and Civil Security Department also made an invaluable contribution.
War Heroes of the Army (23,962), Navy (1160), Air Force (443), together with 2598 Policemen and 456 Civil Security Department members made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the Motherland, thus enabling all Sri Lankans to enjoy the present day's spirits of freedom. All of them sacrificed their tomorrow for our today while defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unitary status of Sri Lanka. Likewise, the selfless contribution and sacrifices made by all Sri Lankans who were under threat of LTTE terrorism for 30 years is worth recalling here. Not only that, all Sri Lankans as of today lead their lives freely, thanks to the fulfillment of timely responsibilities of our political leadership.
Nine years have passed by May 19, 2018 since the eradication of terrorism from our soil. I firmly believe the freedom thus gained should be shared not by exaggerated glorification or through mere rhetoric and hyperbole but by showing our sentiments of deep gratitude to fallen Tri Service, Police, Civil Security Department members and civilians who rooted terrorism out. Great War Heroes, pertinent to mention here, must not therefore be manipulated to serve narrow objectives and personal agendas, nor should they be incited to resort to emotional and anti-social acts.
Sri Lanka Army in order to pay tribute and commemorate fallen War Heroes has launched a special programme. Accordingly, religious observances in commemoration of them have been organised at all regimental formations, followed by reading of my special message of tribute. Besides, National War Heroes Day commemoration, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces will take place on Saturday (19) at the National War Heroes Monument in Battaramulla, followed by a mega Army-supported Aaloka Pooja Pinkama, the same evening at the historic Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya premises.
Many numbers of fearless War Heroes during the course of 30 years sacrificed their valuable lives, sweat and blood to decide on our future. They all sighed their last breath to the air on that day, expecting ever-lasting bonds of peace and reconciliation would prevail. They would never have wished the recurrence of a war even in a dream during their cycle of future births. Therefore, as envisaged by them in the past, we should pursue wisely, avoid recurrence of any war at all and preserve hard-earned freedom for generations, still to be born.
At this moment, I wish all brave War Heroes who sacrificed their lives for protection of the country's unitary status and precious lives of the general public attain supreme bliss of Nibbana. Similarly, let me wish speedy recovery to all differently able War Heroes still under recuperation and medical treatment. Not only that, I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all spouses, children, parents, next of kin of gallant War Heroes and neighbours for their invaluable dedication and sacrifice while we, as brave members of the Army, were leading in the battlefields.

Tricks for remembering  everything you read
Plenty of people admit to forgetting most of what they read, no matter how much they enjoyed the text.
But just because forgetting is a human phenomenon doesn't mean you should simply accept it. In fact, there are plenty of simple, creative strategies for retaining more of what you read  whether that's novels, news articles, or scientific textbooks.
To find out what some of those techniques are, we perused the Quora thread, "How do you remember what you've just read" and scoured the web for advice from other readers.
Below are eight of the most practical techniques  bonus points if you can remember all eight tomorrow.
1. Take notes on the page.
"Never read without a pencil," saysQuora user Deniz Ates. "Underline sentences you find confusing, interesting, or important. Draw lines along the side of important paragraphs. Draw diagrams to see the structure of key ideas."
2. Ask yourself questions about the material.
Ingrid Spielman recommends interacting with the text by asking yourself questions as you go along.
If you're reading a textbook, the question can be as simple as, "What is the main idea of this section"
If you're reading fiction, you can ask, "What are the motives of the character" and "If you could rewrite this reading, what would your version be like"
3. Skim the text first.
An anonymous user cites an article by Bill Klemm, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience, which highlights skimming as a key strategy for retaining information.
The idea here isn't to skip the whole reading process. Instead, you'll want to skim the text for important topics and keywords beforehand so you know what to expect when you actually dig into the material. Being familiar with the general themes, Klemm says, will help you remember the particulars.
4. Impress, associate, repeat.
The first part is impression. You can increase the strength of the impression the text makes on you by picturing the situation in your mind or envisioning yourself participating in the events described.
The second part is association, or linking the material to something you already know. For example, maybe one of the character's names sounds like your friend's name.
The third part is repetition. The more you read the material, the stronger your memory will be. If you don't want to reread a whole book, try highlighting some parts of the text that you can go back to.
5. Introduce the information to others.
Experts say that, if you want to remember what you experience, it's important to do something with that information.
Two Quora users listed talking about what you read as a useful means of processing new material. Venkatesh Rao suggests blogging, or otherwise trying to explain to others what you think you've learned.
Plus, if you find that you can't explain it, you might want to go back and reread.
6. Read out loud.
Another anonymous Quora user says, "I actually have to read out loud to myself most of the time to understand and remember what I just read."
Writing in Psychology Today, psychologist Art Markman, Ph.D., says this strategy might work best when there are a few key items you need to remember. That's because the sentences you speak (or even whisper) out loud take on a distinctiveness. You remember producing and hearing the items and so your memory for them is different from the memory of the words you read silently.
7. Read on paper.
E-readers are convenient tools for when you want to bring a ton of books on vacation and for downloading stories in an instant.But research suggests that they could also undermine the strength of your memories. One study found that, when people read the same short story in a paperback or on a Kindle, the paperback readers were better able to remember the story's chronology.
Lead study author Anne Mangen, Ph.D., says that's possibly because the piles of pages in your hands creates a "tactile sense of progress" that you don't get from a Kindle. (Of course, it's possible that people who are more accustomed to reading online may not have this problem.)
Meanwhile, Mangen's other research found that high-school students performed better on a test of reading comprehension when they read a text in print instead of on a computer screen.
8. Become familiar with the topic first.

Two sides of the same coin
Health Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will certainly not win for himself many friends from the South by his comments at the post Cabinet press briefing on Wednesday where he was loath to draw a distinction between the JVP and the LTTE.
Replying to journalists, the onetime ardent leftist said he saw no difference between the violent campaigns launched by the JVP and the LTTE, the former in its quest for toppling a democratically elected government while the latter towards the goal of achieving a separate state.
This is in reference to the commemoration events of the two groups where both sides have set apart days each year to remember their fallen men and women.
The minister said he saw no difference in the Reds commemorating the dead in their two bloody uprisings in 1971 and 1989-90 and the LTTE doing the same in the North.
If the JVP commemorates its members who died fighting the Police and the Armed Forces at two terror campaigns in 1971 and 1989-90, no one must have any ill will or resentment when parents of those who died at war in the North and East did the same, he told the journalists.
True, he qualified this remark by saying that only civilians who died in the North can be commemorated, implying that no dead member of the LTTE will be so allowed to be remembered during the so called martyrs day. However even the minister is aware that those commemorated on this day are fallen Tiger terrorists like the JVP commemorates only its combatants who not only killed policemen and soldiers (and their family members) but also butchered a countless number of innocent civilians as did the LTTE.
Hence, it is no use wearing blinkers. Like the JVP marks the death of Rohana Wijeweera on the day he was killed in November there can be little doubt that Velupillai Prabhakaran will be the focus on May 19 in the North despite all the bans imposed by the government against the commemoration of members of a secessionist organisation.
However Minister Senaratne should be commended for his frankness in admitting that parents in the North has as much a right in commemorating their fallen sons and daughters as the JVP does their members in the South. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Hardliners such as Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila are bound to find fault with the minister. They no doubt will see a clear distinction in the two events. But the fact remains that the JVP's cause was as macabre as that of the LTTE. Like the LTTE, the JVP too killed members of the police and the security forces and this differed only in numbers. Not only that, the Reds also killed a large number of Buddhist monks who were perceived to be supportive of the government and gunned down charismatic figure Vijaya Kumaratunga and intellectuals such as Prof. Stanley Wijesundera.
The LTTE, at least, permitted schools and universities in the North to function without interruption while the JVP not only enforced shut downs of educational institutions in the South but also forced schoolchildren onto the streets to protest against the government.
Hence, there can be little or no difference in the two groups in their final aim of rising against the state. It is time those in the South do some serious soul searching and stop making a big hue and cry of events to mark the dead in the North. After all, we are in the process of reconciliation where all differences and parochial considerations must be set aside, particularly distinctions based on race and nationality.
GMOA back in business
The docs are at it again. The GMOA went ahead with its strike action yesterday crippling all government hospitals, causing much hardships to the poor patients. How the GMOA can justify inflicting suffering on the innocent merely because the government is to sign the FTA agreement with Singapore and ECTA with India only the likes of the Padeniyas and Aluthges will be able to explain.
The GMOA has once more ventured into areas outside its remit. It should stop telling the government how to run its business. Doctors should stick to the business of practicing medicine instead of meddling in affairs that are far removed from their profession. Running the country's economy is one of them.
It is patently clear that the doctors are once again doing the bidding of their political masters, going by the identity of those who are in the forefront of the campaign against the two trade agreements. At this rate there is no knowing if the government will be allowed to undertake any bilateral trade agreement with any country without the doctors going on strike.
The government should assert itself and not surrender its authority to whomsoever who make use of the vital nature of his/her profession to hold it to ransom. It should tell the doctors, who owe their education to the poor tax payer, where to get off.

Unbeaten Peterites host Kingswood today
Unbeaten St. Peters College Bambalapitiya will play host to Kingswood College Kandy in their second round Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby match at Havelock Park today at 4.00pm.
The Peterites after their morale boosting win against Trinity College Kandy (28- 21) in Pallekelle have only two more hurdles to clear - Kingswood and St Josephs (next week) to get closer to the league title.
Their final match will be against the only other unbeaten side for the season Royal College which will be the decider.
If the Peterites manage to win all three games, they will be crowned as the unbeaten schools league rugby champs for the year.
The Peterires are packed with some outstanding players in their ranks, who are match winners. But they should get their act together if they are to pull off their sixth consecutive win for the season against unpredictable Kingswood outfit.
St. Peters are coached by veteran rugby coach Sanath Martis.
Meanwhile Kingswood under the watchful eyes of their consultant coach Ronny Ibrahim, will know that losing their third consecutive game could also could mean a setback for them in the league tournament as they have lost to Isipathana College (5-10) in their last outing in Nittawela last week.
Hence they will come out with their best outfit for this game and will go out with all guns blazing to try and topple the Peterites.

Vogues Lotus  bridal necklace,  truly a masterpiece
A grand necklace handcrafted by eminent master craftsmen using the finest quality 22 karat solid gold - an adornment that brings so much prestige, a valued family treasure beyond weddings is the dream of any bride who appreciates bridal jewellery of real value. In a day and age where that sound more like a description of wedding jewellery of yore, the awe-inspiring Lotus necklace outshines as the grandest 22 karat gold wedding jewellery of our times.
The symbol of purity, beauty and divinity, the exquisite Lotus is a deeply entrenched metaphorical element of Sri Lankan culture. With its strong association with spiritual awakening and faithfulness, the Lotus takes a supreme position among the Sri Lankans. The grand Vogue Lotus necklace, another masterpiece of Vogue Tusker Collection distinguishes itself from all the rest. A truly grand centerpiece- a padakkama-style pendant depicting an exquisite lotus blossom adorns multi strands of chains, which are held together by Pure brilliance SWAROVSKI Cubic Zirconia-studded gold beads denoting those of traditional beaded chains. The cascading delicate strands of thread like tassels, studded with Cubic Zirconia add to the stature of this divine masterpiece and it is topped up with a quarter sovereign Vogue Tusker Collection trade marked coin. It is truly a masterpiece only a legendary giant in the industry can - or dare to create in the current times.
Today, Sri Lankans tend to be very lavish with wedding celebrations. However, with a growing trend to spend colossal amounts on short-lived aspects of a wedding, some Sri Lankans appear to lose the foresight to invest in elements such as solid gold bridal jewellery that have been traditionally considered as sentimental and prestigious while being a lasting investment. With a view of re-awakening Sri Lankan traditions and values related to weddings, Sri Lankas most trusted bridal jeweller for generations - Vogue continually offers the best in bridal jewellery that can be enjoyed beyond weddings and handed down to the next generation with confidence.

It is a creation painstakingly handcrafted by veteran craftsmen with decades of hands-on experience - a team moulded and guided by the legend, late Mr. Sarath Hemachandra, the founder Chairman of Vogue Jewellers. Today, such highly skilled craftsmen are fast disappearing from the industry, and we will soon feel the void without their handcrafted creations. Therefore, the value of this rare Lotus necklace is augmented further by the great aesthetics and exclusivity that is embodied in it.
This one-of-its-kind Lotus necklace - the exotic blossom of the Vogue Tusker Collection is available at the Vogue flagship showroom on Galle Road, Colpetty.

President to ATtend Investiture ceremony on May 19:
VSV to be conferred on senior military officials
The investiture ceremony will be held at the Presidential Secretariat on May 19 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena to confer Vishishta Seva Vibhushana (VSV) medals to military personnel who rendered a great service to end the war.
The Vishishta Seva Vibhushana Medal is the highest medal given to senior officers in the countrys Armed Forces.
The President will award medals to senior military officers of the Tri-Forces, both retired and currently serving.
The award is for senior officers who have shown an unblemished military record. This year, persons who commanded troops on the battle field will be receiving this award.
These are not the military actors we had before, but those unsung heroes who had rendered a great service to the nation.
The parchment will be signed by the President himself and it is a very important document for a soldier, Army Commander Lt.Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said.
Despite the Army being involved in assisting the people of the North in many aspects of their lives and the resettlement process, there are numerous calls for the withdrawal of the military from the North.
When asked what the Armys role is in the post war era, Lt.Gen.Senanayake said, It is how the different segments of society look at the issue.
Politically, there are parties that want the Army out because that is a promise they have made politically. But, that is not what the real population needs.
The Army is the only organisation that has the capacity in the North and East after 30 years of war. We use our capacity and policies for the benefit of the Northern people.
The Commander noted that the soldiers were engaged in building houses for the people of the North and even the ex-LTTE cadres were rehabilitated, while they themselves have no house of their own. That is our commitment and discipline to ensure there is no more war.
Our role is to engage and assist. In the Jaffna peninsula, the Army has been engaging with those people from 1996 after Operation Riviresa. But, in Killinochchi and the Vanni we cleared the land only after 2008 and 2009 so the people there know us for a relatively shorter period. Our relationship with the people in the peninsula is around 22 years, its a generation. Hence, in time the people in Killinochchi and the Vanni too will understand us better. But by then the politicians will not like it. But, we dont care about politics and our commitment is to ensure that there is never another war in this country, the Army Commander added.
However, the Commander noted that there are several bad eggs even in the Army, but said that the majority of them are committed to helping the people.

Zimbabwe appoint Lalchand Rajput as interim head coach
Lalchand Rajput has been announced as the interim head coach of Zimbabwe.
Rajput, a former opening batsman who played two Tests and four ODIs for India between 1985 and 1987, fills the role vacated by Heath Streak who was sacked, along with the entire coaching staff and captain Graeme Cremer, following Zimbabwe's failure to qualify for the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup.
The 56-year-old has previously coached Afghanistan, helping guide them towards Full Member status after taking the job in 2016 before being replaced by Phil Simmons earlier this year. He was also India's cricket manager when they triumphed at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, before taking charge of Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League a year later.
Rajput's first challenge in his new role will be Zimbabwe's triangular T20I series involving Australia and Pakistan in Harare in July.
