Kittel at the double on Giro dItalia
ARNHEM, SUNDAY: Germany sprint ace Marcel Kittel pulled off an impressive double coup on Sunday by winning his second stage of the 99th Giro dItalia to claim the race leaders pink jersey.
Kittel claimed his first win of this years edition with a dominant sprint finish on Saturday in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.
On the third and final stage to be held in the country on Sunday, the Etixx-Quickstep rider again proved unstoppable in a final dash to the finish line of the 190km race from Nijmegen, which saw the peloton chase down the last remnants of an early breakaway just 1km from the line.
Team Sky fast man Elia Viviani finished a distant second, with fellow Italian Giacomo Nizzolo completing the podium.
Thanks to bonus seconds on offer at the finish, Kittel has taken the race lead from Giant-Alpecin rider Tom Dumoulin.
Kittel now heads Dumoulin by nine seconds, with Movistar rider Andrey Amador in third at 15 behind.
With a fourth stage win overall, Kittel equals Rudi Altig as the most successful German at the Giro dItalia and becomes the first German since Olaf Pollack in 2006 to wear the pink jersey.
Im super happy with this victory, which is my fourth stage win at the Giro, and Ive also got leaders jersey as well, said Kittel.
Im very happy to be able to say that Ive worn the yellow jersey at the Tour de France and now the pink jersey at the Giro dItalia, which is something quite unique.
Kittel admitted hopes of a second successive stage win were kept in check by the windy conditions, and a stubborn breakaway that saw Johann Van Zyl solo away on his own with 12 km to race.
The South Africans move forced Etixx to use precious energy chasing, but Kittels team completed the job with aplomb and delivered him to the home straight ready and willing to put the cherry on the cake.
It was a super tough day, with lots of wind, which made it difficult to stay in position, added Kittel.
The breakaway also got a big gap. But the boys did an amazing job of keeping me out of trouble and then getting Matteo Trentin, Fabio Sabatini and me into position for the sprint.
Matteo and Fabio also did an amazing job, and that made it easier for me.
After a hugely successful three stages in Holland, the local fans were left with memories of Dumoulin winning the opening stage time trial by just one hundredth of a second to wear the pink jersey for two days.
Fellow Dutchman Maarten Tjallingii, meanwhile, is wearing the King of the Mountains jersey after racing into the blue tunic as the race passed close to his house: This is my home crowd. I live in Arnhem and we passed 200 metres away from my house. To have the Giro dItalia here in Gelderland is a gift for me.
I knew there was a possibility to take the King of the Mountains jersey if I made the breakaway again. The legs were a bit sore from yesterday but my morale was extremely high. Im glad Ill wear the blue jersey in Italy.
After Mondays rest and travel day, the race resumes on Tuesdays 200km fourth stage from Catanzaro to Praia a Mare in the south of Italy. The race finishes in Turin on May 29.

Ariya overcomes nerves to become first Thai LPGA winner
LOS ANGELES, SUNDAY: Ariya Jutanugarn fought off back nine nerves to par the 18th hole Sunday and win the Yokohama Tire Classic, becoming the first Thai player to win on the LPGA Tour.
Ariya started the fourth round with a three-stroke lead and despite a roller-coaster ride she managed to close with an even-par 72 to claim her first victory.
It was so tough. I cant control anything. My legs were shaking, my hands were shaking, Ariya said.
The 20-year-old from Bangkok finished at 14-under 274 to beat South Koreas Amy Yang and Americans Morgan Pressel and Stacy Lewis by one shot and finally reach the winners circle after three top-10 finishes this year.
Yang had a 67, Pressel and Lewis both shot 68 as the trio finished tied for second at 13-under.
Ariya needed a par on the final hole to get the victory, and her drive on the 18th hole went into the left rough.
Her second shot fell short of the green but landed above a bunker. Ariya chipped to within five feet before sinking her par putt.
It wasnt the way she drew it up, but Ariya finally broke through after a couple of near misses. She has twice held 54-hole leads but failed to convert those to wins.
Earlier this season at the ANA Inspiration, the first major of the year, she led by two shots with three to play in the final round but bogeyed her final three holes to lose to Lydia Ko.
Ariya was just 17 years old when she let a two-stroke lead with one hole remaining slip through her fingers at the 2013 LPGA Thailand. Her triple bogey resulted in her finishing one shot behind. It was also a special win for another reason as her mom was in attendance on the US Mothers Day. The Thai Mothers Day is August 12. Thank you for my mom for being with me all the time to support me and happy Mothers Day, said Ariya. Lewis, who has won 11 times on the LPGA Tour, has now gone 49 tournaments without a win. Her runner-up finish Sunday was her 11th-second-place finish during her title drought.
South Korean Ryu So-Yeon, who led after 36 holes, had a 72 and finished at 10-under 278. First round leader Laetitia Beck of Israel also shot 72 to finish with three others six shots back of Ariya. AFP

## Title: Hahn beats Castro in playoff to win Wells Fargo title

Hahn beats Castro in playoff to win Wells Fargo title
WASHINGTON, SUNDAY: James Hahn parred the first hole of a sudden death playoff on Sunday to beat Roberto Castro for the Wells Fargo Championship title and end months of misery on the PGA Tour.
Americas Hahn arrived at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week having missed eight straight cuts. He hadnt produced a round in the 60s since February.
He had to fight back tears after sinking a four-foot par putt at Quail Hollows demanding 18th to seal his second career title.
Eight straight missed cuts is tough, Hahn said. You start to question yourself -- are you good enough, will it ever happen again
But he needed only a routine par for the victory as Castro was in trouble right away in the playoff, sending his tee shot into the stream guarding the fairway. His third shot from the bank landed in the shoe of a spectator near the green and after his chip rolled past the pin he settled for a bogey.
Its crazy to call myself a two-time PGA Tour champion, Hahn said. To do this on the first playoff hole is amazing.
Both Hahn and Castro finished 72 holes at nine-under 279, one shot in front of Englands Justin Rose.
Hahn, who earned his first career title via a playoff at the 2015 Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles, bogeyed the 18th in regulation to cap a 70 while Castro closed with a 71.
Rose carded a 71 for solo third place on 280.
Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson and Northern Irelands Rory McIlroy led a group on 281, both climbing up the leaderboard with 66s.
They were joined by overnight leader Rickie Fowler, who carded a 74, and Andrew Loupe, who signed for a 71.
Castro had seized the lead with a birdie at 15, but bogeyed 16 and 17 to let Hahn move one ahead.
Hahn missed a chance to close it out in regulation when his seven-footer for par at the 72nd hole failed to drop.
Castro then salvaged a par from the right rough at 18 to force the playoff, but he couldnt master the notorious hole again.
Fowler collapse
Eighteen was tough on McIlroy as well. He was four-over on the hole for the week, including a bogey there on Sunday.
Any time you walk off the golf course and soot 66, you cant be too disappointed, said McIlroy, who nevertheless regretted that he had a chance on the back nine to post a number for the guys to at least think about, and I didnt.
Fowler had more to regret, after a round that included a double-bogey at the seventh and three bogeys.
Obviously it sucks, Fowler said of his collapse. Its disappointing knowing where my game was at coming into today. I felt really good about being in the final group and getting the job done.
But yeah, some little off swings off the tee and then catching that mud ball on seven -- not exactly good fortune.AFP
