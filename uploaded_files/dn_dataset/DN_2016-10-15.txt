NZ rugby battered by scandal
In the Land of the Long White Cloud, heroes are clad in black. New Zealand are the world's rugby champions and the all-conquering All Blacks are idolised.
But these are dark times for New Zealand's national sport, that has become mired in scandal.
Reports on Wednesday say a member of the Mid Canterbury rugby team has been charged with assault with intent to commit rape in Gisborne, a North Island city, earlier this month.
It follows revelations that star scrum-half Aaron Smith was seen entering a toilet cubicle with a woman at Christchurch Airport. He was dropped from the squad that went on to thrash South Africa 57-15 in Durban.
Earlier this year, members of the Hamilton-based Super Rugby side the Chiefs were accused of sexually assaulting a woman paid to strip at a club function.
There was also anger recently when Losi Filipo, a highly rated teenager at the Wellington Lions, was discharged without conviction over charges of assaulting four people, including two women.
One of his victims was punched and repeatedly struck about the head, leaving him unable to work full-time because of migraines and chronic fatigue.
Then there was a bombshell in France, where the sports daily L'Equipe last week alleged that former All Blacks legend Dan Carter had failed a drug test after his club's victory over Toulon in June. The player's agent has, however, rejected any suggestion Carter was a drug cheat.
Kevin Norquay, a senior sports journalist at Fairfax Media in Wellington told the BBC the scandals and allegations have dented rugby's reputation. They are all slightly different but they all add up to people wondering what is going on and having the ability on social media to actually voice their opinions and say look, we really don't like this, we're not happy, he said.
Rugby is a national religion
But such is the reverence for rugby players, there are Kiwi fans who will forgive them almost anything.
In New Zealand, rugby is a national religion. These guys are put on a pedestal, said Norquay. Even when they do things that most members of society would regard as outside the realms of what is acceptable, there will still be a large group of rugby fans who can't see anything wrong in what All Blacks do.
The BBC has asked New Zealand Rugby (NZR) how it maintains discipline and ensures that players remain role models, and what the organisation does when things go wrong. NZR has yet to fully respond to our inquiry.
So is the sport in crisis
One of Auckland's most respected public relations consultants thinks not, but believes there are serious issues to be addressed.
I think take the incidents together separately [and] it's not so much a crisis, but join them all together and certainly the spotlight is on them [NZR], said Pippa Lekner, director of The PR Shop.
We've definitely had a cluster, which has made it a bit of a tricky one for New Zealand Rugby.
The players will be receiving a lot of advice, she adds. We often refer to them in the business as heroes of the young'. People look up to them, so I imagine that they are being reminded of that on very regular occasions, she added.

Hamilton v Rosberg: How the 2016 title may be decided
We are now very much into the business end of the F1 season, and Lewis Hamilton has his work cut out if he is going to win a fourth world drivers title.
With four grands prix to go, the Briton trails Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 33 points, with a maximum of 100 available in the remaining races.
Can he come from behind to pip the German or will Rosberg be celebrating his maiden drivers crown BBC Sport takes a look at how the title may be decided...

F1 points breakdown
1st: 25 points 
2nd: 18 points 
3rd: 15 points 
4th: 12 points 
5th: 10 points 
6th: 8 points 
7th: 6 points 
8th: 4 points 
9th: 2 points 
10th: 1 point 
Where and when can the title be won
The United States Grand Prix on 23 October will go a long way to deciding which of the dominant Mercedes drivers wins the championship.
Hamilton has prevailed in the States in the past two seasons but is very much on the back foot as the title race heads to Austin.
Even if Hamilton wins the last four races, Rosberg only needs to finish second to him on each occasion to be sure of the title.
A retirement for Hamilton between now and the end of the season would almost certainly be the end of his hopes, although the earliest Rosberg could win the title would be following the Mexican Grand Prix in two races time on 30 October.
Should the fight go down to the wire in Abu Dhabi on 27 November, Hamilton will be able to draw on greater experience in that scenario than Rosberg. The Briton has battled for the title in the final race on four occasions - 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014, with Rosberg a factor only once before, two years ago.
Will engines play a part in deciding the outcome
Quite possibly. Hamilton's engine failure 16 laps from home in Malaysia prevented an almost certain victory that would have left him leading the championship by five points at that stage. Rosberg's subsequent win - emphatically backed up in Japan - has turned the tide dramatically.
Hamilton has had three engine failures this season but Rosberg says he is not worried that he could experience a similar problem, as it is something that I cannot influence.
Both Hamilton and Rosberg have two new engines left going into the final four races, which should be enough to see them through to the end of the season - barring failures of the kind experienced by the Briton in Malaysia - without incurring grid penalties.
Remaining races
23 October: United States
30 October: Mexico
13 November: Brazil
27 November: Abu Dhabi
How difficult will it be for Hamilton to topple Rosberg
A 33-point deficit will be tough to surmount but Hamilton has already wiped out a sizeable gap this season.
He trailed Rosberg by 43 points five races in, but had established a six-point lead six races later, after winning the Hungarian Grand Prix in July. - BBC

Djokovic says format must improve and evolve
World No 1 Novak Djokovic called for tennis to improve and evolve on Thursday after the women's tour signalled a move towards new scoring formats.
Djokovic said different scoring methods were worth considering to make tennis, whose matches vary wildly in duration, easier to follow on TV.
All sports are doing everything they can in order to get their sport to the highest possible level and fulfil their potential, Djokovic said at the Shanghai Masters.
I think tennis has yet to fulfil its full potential. I think we are at a good state at the moment, for sure... but we still have a lot of room to get better. Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chief executive Steve Simon has said he's considering using super tie-breaks and no-ad scoring, already used in doubles, in singles matches.
Djokovic's cautious welcome contrasts with the reaction from Rafael Nadal, who said tennis thrived on long and dramatic matches that become emotional. Tennis has values that we need to follow, in my opinion, the Spanish 14-time Grand Slam-winner said this month in Beijing.
Some exhibition matches play sets up to four games, rather than six, while the International Premier Tennis League has experimental rules including no let serves and a timer between points.
Some of the rules are worthy of consideration... some are not, Djokovic said.
So I guess we all have to come together and figure out the way we want to improve and evolve, because everything else is going in that direction.

How do other sports support mental health issues
World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury is just the latest boxer to suffer mental health issues.
Ricky Hatton, Oscar de la Hoya and Frank Bruno were all larger-than-life characters in the ring, battling demons away from the lights.
After withdrawing from his title defence against Wladimir Klitschko in September, Fury revealed he had been suffering with depression and had abused alcohol and cocaine since winning his world titles.
Former world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan has called for a foundation to be set up to help boxers away from the ring.
But what are other sports doing for those with mental illness
Football 
There are already several place for rugby union players to turn.
Each Premiership club and London Irish in the Championship has a player development manager who helps them with all aspects of life outside rugby.
There are also courses on personal resilience and a confidential 24-hour helpline where counselling is available around the clock.
Calls to the helpline spiked in the wake of Bath prop Duncan Bell discussing bis struggles with mental health in 2012.
In the coming months, the Rugby Players Association, will launch a campaign called Lift the Weight, focusing on players mental wellbeing and sources of support.
It comes after it organised a course in Wales for a group players, including former England captain Tamara Taylor and ex-London Irish lock George Skivington, that featured talks, leadership activities and practical advice to help them prepare for the next stage of their careers.
Rugby league established its own programme - State of Mind - in 2011 following the death of Terry Newton to raise awareness of mental health issues. There are player welfare managers at each Super League club, while the Rugby Football League has a relationship with Sporting Chance.
Cricket 
Cricket has had several high-profile instances of mental health issues with Jonathan Trott, Marcus Trescothick and Michael Yardy all leaving England tours early.
The Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) has seven mental health ambassadors - Trescothick, Andrew Flintoff, Monty Panesar, Graeme Fowler, Tim Ambrose, Yardy and Iain OBrien - who help carry out pre-season visits to all 18 first-class counties. The organisations Mind Matters campaign includes a video tutorial to help players identify when they or their team-mates are vulnerable to depression or addictive behaviour.
If they do have any concerns, they can report them to a confidential helpline which is open 24 hours a day and has been running for 10 years.
This autumn, the PCA is trying a novel way to continue to improve understanding of mental health issues.
A play telling the story of former England and Northamptonshire batsman Colin Milburn, who died in a pub car park in 1990 at the age of 48 after drifting into alcoholism following his early retirement, will tour all 18 first-class county grounds in November.  BBC

Jos Buttlers boys showed depth of the talent pool
That was a special achievement by England. A huge, monumental effort in front of a partisan home crowd with no English fans in at all.
Some people will say its only Bangladesh lets not get too giddy, but lets just think about what happened here.
First of all England were without their regular top four batsmen and then you have to consider the surroundings and all the security that has made this a very unusual and demanding trip.
Finally, just have a look at Bangladeshs record here. Theyve won six one-day series in a row at home and you can see from their experienced side that they know what they are doing.
This 2-1 series win says a lot for the strength of English cricket at the moment. They really do have some seriously good cricketers.
It came home to me when England were four wickets down chasing a tough target and I just looked up and saw Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler at the crease. With so much batting still to come, I thought crikey, were safe here.
A few years ago conditions here in Bangladesh would have been totally alien to English cricketers but now they are sent all round the world to prepare for occasions like this on Under 19, Lions and even club cricket tours.
So that means you get lads like Ben Duckett who comes in and makes two 50s in his first three matches and Sam Billings gets runs as if he has always opened for England.
He doesnt even open for Kent normally. But you still keep your fingers firmly crossed when they first play and to see Duckett and Billings play the way they did on Wednesday night, so cool, so calm augers very well for challenges ahead.
Billings is a talent. England have known for some time that there was something with this lad that meant they had to get him in the side somehow. But it has taken the absence of four batsmen to do it.
Duckett, meanwhile, reminds me of a young Eoin Morgan, the way he hits both sides of the wicket, with fast hands and plays 360 degrees.
He handled the pressure well too. Its one thing doing it for Northants, but its completely different doing it for England in conditions like this.
A tour like this really does bring people together. England would have bonded here. Even the other night when there was a bit of trouble you could see how closely knit they are. They will remember this trip.
Which, of course, brings me to Morgan. I believe he should come back as England captain for the one-day series against India in January.
I said that on the day it became clear that he was not coming here.
He has been the driving force behind Englands one-day revolution, he has turned their white-ball cricket around and he has an awful lot of credit in the bank. Theres no question that he comes straight back in.
But there is nothing that will ever convince me that he was right to miss this tour. And, from what Ive seen since Ive been here, Im even more convinced he should have come. Captaincy and the game havent changed that much.
What this trip has done, though, is show England that they have a very capable deputy in Buttler and if Morgan doesnt score many runs in India they have plenty of batsmen in reserve who could come in.
It wont be easy for Eoin to tell the likes of Billings, Duckett and Jonny Bairstow that they might not be in the side next time because he and Alex Hales are coming back. But this trip has been about good things. It has been a worthwhile exercise  and the Tests are still to come.

## Title: 2016 Asia Rugby Sevens Series-third and final leg in Sri Lanka : Can Sri Lanka embrace home advantage

2016 Asia Rugby Sevens Series-third and final leg in Sri Lanka : Can Sri Lanka embrace home advantage 
Sri Lankan Tuskers are ready to embrace a home advantage that has not always worked in their favour in the final round of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series that gets underway at the Racecourse International Stadium, Reid Avenue today.
A stunning run to two consecutive finals in the first two legs at Hong Kong and South Korea has given the side confidence and belief that they are ready to build on these effort.
Sri Lanka has come a long way since last year being placed fourth to being second this year.
The players are going to have no excuses in terms of being able to come out and be comfortable where they are playing as they are a bunch of professional rugby players. In reality that comes with added experience, expectation as well and a bit of pressure the players put on themselves since they are playing as host in front of their home crowd.
There is plenty on the line for a Sri Lanka sevens rugby outfit that has exuded a relaxed and focused vibe during training for the past two weeks at Racecourse, with the winner of the three-round Asian Sevens series booking a spot in the main draw of next years Singapore Sevens tournament and Hong Kong Sevens. They are bound to give off their very best to qualify as this is their final hurdle.
Furthermore, the top two overall secure their place in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series qualifier in Hong Kong next year and a fast start to the series this weekend is a key factor.
Its always a bonus that doing well will get you to these kinds of tournaments and playing against the top teams in Asia. Chairman of selectors Michel Jayasekara said, After a long time we have got a well-balanced side with a blend of experience and young talent, hence I personally believe that we can definitely look at winning the Cup championship in Colombo. We are also keeping an open mind to see if theres any possibility that we could get selected for the upcoming World Series Rugby Sevens, if we can do that we have achieved our goal.
The Sri Lankan side is now far better placed mentally to deal with the unpredictable nature of Sevens rugby than they were 12 months ago after two successive runners-up wins in the ongoing Asia Rugby Sevens Series. This was proved in Hong Kong where Sri Lanka narrowly lost to the host 22-17 due to a knocked on final try awarded to Hong Kong by the Aussie referee and they were trounced 36-0 in the final in South Korea.
What was really pleasing about is that last season Sri Lanka sort of had a bit of a look at their game, and although they hadnt done much wrong they still finished overall fourth in Asia, Sri Lanka had to get a better team on the day to play the match physically and mentally. Head trainer Nick Groube, who was a vastly experienced trainer with Canterbury Crusaders in New Zealand came in and put it right this time where Sri Lanka managed to learn some lessons and put them in to play It is a lot about the training and work they do purely under Groube to condition the players mentally and physically to be able to handle pressure. Sometimes the players totally get it a bit wrong like we did against Hong Kong in the finals after beating South Korea, but its about how you respond and Groube is definitely the man to take our rugby forward internationally.
A win or a top-two finish in Sri Lanka puts Hong Kong in the box seat to take out the overall series this weekend but playing in Sri Lanka will be tough competition, therefore we have to wait and see whether their power pack display carried throughout the first and second legs will be enough for them to seal victory in the end.

32nd All Island School Athletic Meet : Two meet records set up on second day
Lasith Ranasinghe of Bandaranayake College, Gampaha and M.K. Poornima Jayamali of Leeds International College, Panadura set up two new meet records on the second day of the 32nd All Island School Athletic Meet at Bogambara yesterday.
In the boys under 17 javelin throw event Lasith recorded 66.96 metres while Poornima Jayamali leaped 1.74 metres in the under 19 girls high jump event. The previous record (65.51 metres) of I.A. Paranagama of Nalanda College, Colombo in 2002 was erased by Lasith on the second day of the meet.
The earlier record of 1.70 metres in the girls high jump was held jointly by Tharanga Vinodani of Vijitha Central College, Dickwella (2002), R.A.K. Priyangika Maduwanthi of Maliyadeva Balika, Kurunegala (2008) and Nimeshika Madushani Siriwardana of Galenbindunuwewa Central College (2011).
I have been suffering from diabetes from grade eight. I took to sport to reduce my diabetic level. Now my sugar level is normal, said 16-year-old Lasith who will sit for the GCE O/L exam in December.
Laliths father is the principal of Heenkenda Maha Vidyalaya, Kelaniya while his mother is deputy principal of Henegama Central College.
Lasith earlier participated in the shot putt event but his coach Susantha Kularatne asked him to concentrate on the javelin throw. Lasith competed with older players and became third place at Sir John Tarbet Athletic Meet last year. He was also crowned champion at the Western Province Athletic Meet held in July. My dream is to qualify for the Asian Junior Athletic Championship in 2018, he said.

Sri Lanka A lose, but match serves its purpose
Sri Lanka A may have lost the second unofficial test to West Indies A badly by a massive margin of 333 runs at Pallekele yesterday, but the result didnt matter so much because the national selectors were experimenting with a few players before they selected the squad to Zimbabwe.
Sri Lanka are due to make a two-Test tour to Zimbabwe later this month and also play a one-day tri-series with Zimbabwe and West Indies. The national selectors were making use of the series to pick the squad to Zimbabwe and were not too concerned with the result. The pitches prepared for the series were grassy and had bounce on it.
There was more bounce and pace at Pallekele than at R Premadasa and wewere not upto it, said Sri Lanka A team coach Avishka Gunawardene. Although the pitch was quick the ball came nicely onto the bat and our batters missed out on a good opportunity to put some useful runs on the board.
Leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay a last minute inclusion into the side had a poor game with figures of 1 for 110 and 1 for 80.
Jeffrey was returning to competitive cricket after about six months and his performance clearly showed that he was short of match practice, said Gunawardene. Vandersay broke the middle finger of his bowling hand during practice and was out of action since May.
However Gunawardene said that the two matches in the series so far also had its positives.
Dimuth (Karunaratne) made use of the series to get his form back and Lakshan Sandakan also impressed in the first match, said Gunawardene, a former opening bat.
Karunaratne scored a century in the first test and followed it up with an innings of 68 at Pallekele.
Sandakan who was down to play at Pallekele was in the eleventh hour stood down and Vandersay included as the selectors wanted to have a look at him.
Gunwardene said the other change made to the team was the inclusion of Avishka Fernando for the injured Kusal Perera (hamstring).
West Indies A leveled the three-match unofficial test series 1-all with their win at Pallekele yesterday.
Sri Lanka A set a target of 481 runs folded up rather tamely for 147 to hand out to West Indies A victory on a platter.
Resuming at 36-2 Sri Lanka A were dismissed 34 minutes after lunch on the final day with none of the top order batsmen making any kind of contribution.
They were down to 77-7 before some stout-hearted batting by the late order got them to their final total.
Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka contributed 34 and Jeffrey Vandersay picked for his right-arm leg-spin bowling top scored with a plucky 47 off 70 balls inclusive of six fours and three sixes  his highest score in first-class cricket.
West Indies A came up with an all-round bowling performance with all five bowlers used by skipper Shamarh Brooks picking up a wicket or two. Their key bowler was off spinner Rahkeem Cornwall who made use of the spate of left-handers in the Sri Lanka A team to capture eight wickets in the match.
We were clearly outplayed in all three departments, said Gunawardene. They took all the half chances that came their way whereas we made a crucial miss when (Jahmar) Hamilton was dropped off the third ball and he went on to score 99 out of a partnership of 188 with Vishaul Singh which took the game away from us.
West Indies A invited to bat first piled up a massive 509-9 declared based largely on that partnership.
It was a game where everything went wrong for us and right for them, said Gunawardene. For instance yesterday Roshen Silva was unfortunate to be run out at the non-strikers end when the ball richoted onto the stumps off the bowlers hand. Losing certainly hurts but I am sure we will bounce back in the next match. It was a good comeback by West Indies A after losing the first unofficial test to Sri Lanka A by seven wickets at the R Premadasa Stadium.
The third and final unofficial test starts at Dambulla on October 18.

Jason Dissanayake out of Asia Rugby Sevens
Sri Lankas cracking forward Jason Dissanayake will miss the Asia Rugby Sevens series tournament starting today after injuring a hamstring at practice yesterday.
Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka Sevens player and centre Hirantha Perera, who was overlooked from the 12-man squad will replace Dissanayake.
Its really unfortunate to lose Jason in this crucial tournament, but I am glad that Hirantha who is an equally good player is available for us to replace Jason, said selection committee chairman Michael Jayasekara.
