Intelligent solutions for peoples problems
Dhanushka Ramanayake, to whom President Maithripala Sirisena handed over his media campaign as the common candidate to make a turning point in the political history of Sri Lanka on January 8, joins the political arena from the grassroots level, contesting for the Maharagama Urban Council from the Wattegedara ward at the impending local government elections.
He is a person with experience in the media field, and an administrator with foreign and local education and exposure. He has vast experience in the media field as former Working Director at Independent Television Network (ITN), Working Director and Board Member at Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Media Secretary at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, former Media Secretary at the Technology, Research, and Atomic Energy Ministry and as former Media Secretary at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry. He was also President of Leo Multiple 306 on several occasions and Leo Club Program Advisory Panelist for the Constituent VI which comprises India, South Asia and the Middle East. He also served in the capacity of resource personnel at the panel discussion held in Hamburg, Germany. Ramanayake followed his Masters degree at Cardiff Metropolitan University and is a graduate of Sri Jayewardenepura University and past student of Isipathana College, Colombo. He commenced work as a clerk at the Kingdom of Raigam in 2006 and left there as a creative executive within a short period to reach high.
Following are some excerpts of the interview with him:
Q: What made you join politics
A: First, I had been playing a role for the past seven years that had much to do with politicians. I had a chance to observe how the policies of governments and politicians were implemented. I felt the issues and problems of the common people. I had a desire as a child to join politics and I cant deny that I was frustrated with politics at times too.
However, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka's invitation for me to join politics seemed a golden opportunity. So I promptly accepted it and hope to serve the people.
Q: Is there a reason to initiate your political career from the local government institutions
A: Yes, although I had worked with politicians, I didn't have the experience of a politician. So I decided to commence from the lowest point and deal with the grassroots level. The most valuable thing is that I get a chance to serve the people in my village, which I think is a great investment for my career.
Q: Politicians have policies and some change policies from time to time. What is your policy
A: Following discussions with Minister Ranawaka and a study of the area, I launched a policy called Mawatha (path). It consists of the strategy to develop Maharagama town area and 50 villages in 41 Gramaseva Niladhari divisions including Wattegedara. The theme is "Let's protect humanity and build up the village". Anybody can access the Danushka Ramanayake website and see what it is and comment too.
Q: What is the strategy you expect to maintain in order to win the people
A: Nothing, but to serve them. When I went to meet them, I observed their problems. Some of them could be easily addressed just by coordination. Some could be solved even within the capacity of public officials. Unfortunately, those issues have not been addressed. So I strongly believe that there are ample opportunities for politicians to win the people and rebuild the image of politicians.
Q: Its only a short period since you joined politics as an administrator. How do you see the difference
A:- I never had timeframes like 8 am to 4.30 pm as an administrator. What I wanted was to finish the project at hand before time. And I did it. Here in this campaign too, there is no difference.
Those days, I had to deal with media personnel and institutions, and the work with officers was minimal. In contrast, now I have to deal with the people in my village, elders, youth and the venerable monks.
This has given me unprecedented knowledge. Although I lived in Maharagama for 32 years, I was exposed to issues that I never heard before by the villagers during this short period. This, of course, is a new juncture in my life.
Q: We have experienced an undue delay in solving issues of the people. Do you have the capacity to overcome this situation as a politician
A: The maturity in politics is of paramount importance to find constructive solutions for the people. Intelligence and education are a part of this maturity too.
What I believe is that the policies of a politician are an initial step for massive change in the right direction.
With the exposure I had under a successful politician such as Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, and the free education I received in the country, foreign education and experience, I have confidence that most of the issues of my villagers could be solved easily.
Q: Most politicians have great expectations in their career. You must have yours too
A: My first expectation is to become an urban councillor. Thereafter, I hope to commit myself to serve the public and ensure that they get a better service. If I can become a true servant of the public, this would guarantee a future for my political career. The people would place me where I fit.
Q: What is your message to the people in Maharagama
A: Maharagama is different from other areas. Maharagama is the city of Buddhist revival. There are around 207,000 people living there, of which most are from the educated class. When the Wattegedara area is concerned, where 1,680 families live, there are 55 professors and those who have doctorates and 455 graduates. This is comparatively a high percentage. What we have to focus is to spread this percentage around entire Maharagama and commence an economic revolution based on knowledge and spread it across the country. I think the educated crowd and others would extend their support to me.
The other matter is that we have an opportunity to remove corrupt people, those who use drugs and liquor, those who insult women in politics at this initial stage etc. Or else they would go further and be elected to Parliament.
This would affect the entire social strata of the country.

Australia and India face off in u19 World Cup final today
Both sides will be full of confidence coming into the final, having completed big wins in the semi-finals. Australia comfortably beat Afghanistan by six wickets, bowling them out for 181 and chasing the total inside 38 overs, while India thrashed rivals Pakistan, posting 272/9 from their 50 overs before dismantling the opposition, dismissing them for just 69.
While both sides have been impressive throughout the tournament, India will believe they have edge, being the only unbeaten side in the competition. Furthermore, Australias only defeat came against India in the sides first game of the competition back on 14 January.
The Group B fixture saw Indias top-order batting fire excellently, with openers Prithvi Shaw (94) and Manjot Khalra (86) putting on an opening stand of 180. India made an imposing 328/7 from their 50 overs before their bowlers dismissed the Australians for 228 to secure a 100-run win.
Since then, however, Australia have been ruthless, beating Zimbabwe, Papua New Guinea, England and Afghanistan, with their bowling attack taking the full 10 wickets in each match. As well as beating Australia in the first game, India have defeated Papua New Guinea, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Australia have quite the pedigree in U19 Cricket World Cups, having won the first edition in 1988, as well as 2002 and 2010 titles. International players Stuart Law, George Bailey, Shaun Marsh and Josh Hazlewood have been among previous Aussie players to make a name for themselves at the competition.
India have also won three titles, claiming titles in 2000, 2008 and 2012. Their first competition win owed a lot to Player of the Tournament Yuvraj Singh, while Shikhar Dhawan won the same accolade in 2004, only for India to be pipped to the trophy by rivals Pakistan. Current Test skipper Virat Kohli captained the 2008 side, while India also narrowly lost in the final in 2016 to West Indies.
A fourth title is up for grabs for both sides on Saturday.
India got the better of Australia in their last meeting back on January 14 in their Group B opener. They also won in the last U19 World Cup final meeting between the two sides in 2012. Despite playing at home in Townsville, Australia slipped to a six-wicket loss to India. A side containing Travis Head, Cameron Bancroft, Ashton Turner and Gurinder Sandu were beaten by an Indian team which included Unmukt Chand and Sandeep Sharma.
Squads
Australia: Jason Sangha (c), Will Sutherland, Xavier Bartlett, Max Bryant, Jack Edwards, Zak Evans, Jarrod Freeman, Ryan Hadley, Baxter Holt (wk), Nathan McSweeney, Jonathan Merlo, Lloyd Pope, Jason Ralston, Param Uppal, Austin Waugh.
India: Prithvi Shaw (c), Shubman Gill, Aryan Juyal, Abhishek Sharma, Arshdeep Singh, Harvik Desai, Manjot Kalra, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Pankaj Yadav, Riyan Parag, Ishan Porel, Himanshu Rana, Anukul Roy, Shivam Mavi, Shiva Singh.

Under 14 schools cricket tournament:
Boy wonder smashes 1,045 not out off 515 balls
Two years ago, Pranav Dhanawade took the cricket world by storm as he smashed a mammoth 1,009 not out in Mumbai. Now, another such feat has been recorded in Navi Mumbai.
On January 4, 2016, 15-year-old Pranav blasted 1,009 not out off just 327 balls. He had shattered a 117-year-old record for the most runs in minor cricket. He had hit 129 fours and 59 sixes.
On January 30, another boy from Maharashtra has gone past Pranavs incredible score. 13-year-old Tanishq Gavate made headlines in India with an unbelievable innings of 1,045 from 515 balls. His knock at the Yashwantrao Chavan English Medium School ground in Kopar Khairane, Navi Mumbai, included 149 fours and 67 sixes.
Class Eight student Tanishqs runs scored using MRF Genius bat, came for Yashwantrao Chavan XI (picked by the organisers) against the Yashwantrao Chavan English Medium School in the two-day (January 29 and 30) semi-final of Navi Mumbai Shield Under-14 tournament.
However, Tanishqs score will not been officially part of the record books as the tournament is not recognised by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA). Speaking to International Business Times, India, Tanishqs coach Manish said the boy had scored 316 not out in the quarter-final and followed that with 1,000 plus knock.
Tanishq scored 316 not out in the quarter-final. He carried that form into the semi-finals and constructed this incredible knock, a delighted Manish said.
The coach said he and other officials were in discussions with MCA to get official recognition for the tournament from May this year.
When asked about the ground size, he said, The off-side boundary was about 50 to 55 yards and legside between 60 and 65 yards. This is approximate size.
The right-hander, who turns 14 on April 21, is a big fan of Sachin Tendulkar and has learnt a lot from watching him, according to his coach. No wonder, the youngster uses MRF Genius bat used by Tendulkar.
India captain Virat Kohli, South African superstar AB de Villiers and other international cricketers also use MRF Genius willows.

Christian contribution in the battle for Independence
It is a misconception among many that the Christian community in Sri Lanka was more in favour of continuing the colonial regime that winning national Independence. Many persons, including most Christians including Catholics, believe this to be true. However, this is ignorance of fact. The fact is that the Christian community in the island has been in the forefront of the battle to win freedom for Sri Lanka.
It is historical fact that the Ceylon National Congress led the struggle for National Independence successfully winning freedom from British colonial rule. The leaders of the Congress were the prime movers in this regard.
The history of the Ceylon National Congress is interesting. The first Sinhala president of the Congress was Sir James Peiris, a Christian.
He succeeded its first president Ponnambalam. Arunachalam, a Tamil. One of the first two Joint-Secretaries appointed for the very first year of the Congress 1919-1920 was E. T. de Silva, a devout Catholic. He was also its first Treasurer.
All the office-bearers, except one, of the second year of the Congress (1921) happened to be Christians.
When the Constitution of the then State Council was amended the native who contested the elections in 1921 to represent the whole of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in the State Council, was Sir Marcus Fernando, a Catholic.
The 22nd Annual Session of the Ceylon National Congress was the most significant. After years of agitation and negotiation, it was here that the Congress took its final decision to demand full and complete Independence for Ceylon. This Session was held at the Sri Dharmaloka Vidyalaya in Kelaniya from December 18 to 20, 1942. The meeting was presided over by P. D. S. Kularatne a well-known educationist and Buddhist leader.
Free independence nation
Long drawn discussions took place as to what the Congress should demand from the ruling British. Various proposals were made and most of these were to make a cautious bid for power and proceed step by step finally towards total freedom. Dominion Status for Ceylon was one of the most popular proposals. This was mostly the cautious attitude of the seniors of the Congress. At this stage a group of junior members began losing patience.
Becoming impatient, the young member J. R. Jayewardane (later first Executive President of Sri Lanka) sprang up and made the formal proposal as a resolution that we should demand total independence and nothing less to be a free independence nation. The proposal was forthwith seconded by another junior, the eminent Catholic lawyer Dr. Joseph A.L. Cooray springing up from his seat.
Some seniors including D. S. Senanayake saw this as a disaster. They argued that by trying to get everything in one package, we may get nothing. However, the resolution was adopted by a majority vote. D. S. Senanayake who was earlier irked too, met with the fiery youngsters later and expressed his total approval. This marked the initiation of the great demand that won total Independence for Ceylon.
Incidentally, all the meals and other refreshments for the participants were supplied by the Catholic St. Paul's School, a branch at the time of St. Joseph's College, Colombo 10. (Ref: Records of the Ceylon National Congress  Michael Roberts-Volume II  pg 1486).
The 23rd Annual Session of the Ceylon National Congress was similarly important. It was held in Nainamadama (Dummaladeniya) in the North Western Province. This was almost a one hundred per cent Catholic village. The Organising Committee for the meeting was headed by D. Peter Perera, a Catholic leader of the place. The Bishop of Chilaw at the time the Rt. Rev. Dr. Edmund Peiris OMI attended the Sessions. Being a Sinhala scholar, Bishop Peiris is reported to have provided most of the Sinhala translations to the documents produced at the meeting.
At this Session Dr. Joseph A. L. Cooray is recorded to have made several proposals for the social uplift of the peasant population in the country and the welfare of the worker population. These proposals have been adopted.
The resolution adopted at the previous 22nd Annual Session to demand total independence for Sri Lanka had then been the hotly discussed. Again several young Catholic speakers have demanded quick and prompt action. The young Catholic member, Stanley de Soysa, later Finance Minister, is noted to have been a strong critic of the seniors for their delay in taking action in this regard.
This Session of the Congress too was so significant in the battle for Independence that the venue of the meeting was named Swarajpura and it remains so to date. (Ref: Records of the Ceylon National Congress  Volume II  pg. 1147 and 1149).
Stalwarts in Freedom Movement
It is hardly known among us that a Catholic priest was in the team of delegates that approached the Colonial Secretary in Britain demanding Independence for Ceylon. The priest Very Rev. Fr. D. J Nicholas Perera OMI was in the team that made this demand as far back as 1920. Among others in the team was H. A. P. Sandrasagara, a Catholic layman. (Idem pg.1386). Fr. D. J. Nicholas Perera OMI was later the first Rector of St. Peter's College, Bambalapitiya and finally a Vicar General in the archdiocese of Colombo.
Another Catholic stalwart in the Freedom Movement was E. J. Samarawickrema. Both Samarawickrema and H. A. P. Sandrasagara were paid warm tributes by Sir Edwin Wijeratne, (the father and grandfather respectively of two Diyawadana Nilames of the Dalada Maligawa, Kandy) in his speech at the 22nd Annual Session of the Ceylon National Congress. (Ref: Records of the Ceylon National Congress  Michael Roberts  Volume II  pg 1386).
On this same subject it is well worth mentioning that the architect of the first Constitution of Independence Ceylon was drafted by another Christian  Sir Ivor Jennings.
The very farsighted clauses he built into it guaranteed the fundamental rights of the country's minority groups. It must be admitted that this prevented conflict among the majority and minority groups in the country to a great extent.
The National Lion Flag that flies over all parts of the island today is based on what was discovered by a Christian patriot E. W. Perera of Kotte. With the singing of the Kandyan Convention in 1815, the Lion Flag of the last Sri Lankan King Sri Wikrema Rajasinghe was lowered to hoist the Union Jack of the British. This King's flag then disappeared from the scene for good.
Eminent lawyer E. W. Perera, a great patriot who risked his life taking the petition against ruthless British Governor Chalmers after the Buddhist-Muslim riots, was also a keen historian. He has made a study of the flags and standards of Ceylon and published these in a book titled Sinhalese Banners and Standards.
At this time he was keen to find the whereabouts of the historic flag of King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe. Having made a serious search in England he found it in the Chelsea Royal Army Hospital. He discovered the flag in 1908 among three others, and having made a copy of it he got it printed in colour with the assistance of D. R. Wijewardene, founder of Lake House who was in UK at this time.
I have presented here only some of the important facts connected with the Independence Movement. There are many facts connected both with the Independence Movement and others of national importance that prove beyond doubt that the Christian community in Sri Lanka is second to none in their love and patriotism. With justifiable pride we could say with all sincerity that we have made a substantial contribution to our motherland  Sri Lanka.

Country will never return to dictatorship - Mangala
The country which was rescued from dictatorship by electing the Common Candidate will never be turned back, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera pointed out yesterday.
He also pointed out that the country which was isolated in the international arena, regained its due recognition after the victory of the Common Candidate.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations at a rally held at Weligama, supporting UNP Local Government election candidates.
The previous leaders attempted to push the country into dictatorship. However, we were able to prevent this, in credit of the peoples right to vote. The international community made war crimes allegations against us.
Our fishermen were denied access to the European fish market as part of sanctions imposed on us, Minister Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera also pointed out that the present government was able turn the tide in favour of the country in a very short period of time.
We were successful in getting the EU ban on fish exports lifted after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe personally attended to the matter and discussed with the relevant parties. he said.
He also pointed out that fish exports to Europe from Sri Lanka has increased by 40% within the last few years.
We regained the GSP+ facility in the previous year. Last year Sri Lanka recorded a massive increase in exports. The country also received the highest Foreign Direct Investments last year and this figure is expected to increase this year, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera also pointed out that the present government took over a country which was in a debt trap in 2015.
Following Independence in 1948, this is the first time that we are facilitating the largest amount of debt which amounts to Rs.1.7 trillion, he pointed out.
We will overcome all these challenges. We have well drawn up plans to take up these challenges. This election does not change any positions such as the President, Prime Minister or Ministers.
It also does not change the ruling party.
This election is to choose honest and qualified people to bring prosperity to villages and towns, the Minister said.

Deforestation in Mannar; CA issues notices on Basil and Rishad
The Court of Appeal yesterday issued notices on former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, Conservator General of Forests and several others returnable for March 5, pursuant to a writ petition filed against them for allowing human settlements in the Villattikulam reserve in the Mannar district.
Two public interest litigants have filed this writ petition in the Court of Appeal against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, the Conservator General of Forests and several others.
Malinda Seneviratne, a journalist by profession and Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku, a public interest litigation activist, are seeking a writ of mandamus order compelling the Conservator General of Forests to regain the control of the area of land unlawfully acquired belonging to reserved forest.
The petitioners stated that natural reserved forests are protected by law and are being administered by the Conservator General of Forests and no such forest can be used for any other purposes with strict penal sanctions provided by law against violations.
The petitioners stated that the Villattikulam reserved forests has 2108 hectares of forest cover as per the regulations framed under section 3 of the Forest Ordinance and published in the Government Gazette No 1759/2 of 21 May 2012 and law prohibits abuse of any such reserved forest and the state is under duty to protect such forests from any form of exploitation.
The petitioners further stated that Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen's powers, duties and functions as assigned by the Executive President had been duly published in the government gazette and the said assigned powers and duties do not include any power or authority to engage in appropriation of forests lands for human settlement, clearing of such lands and erecting of houses in the forest land appropriated by unlawful means.
The petitioners further stated that on October 5, 2012 Minister Bathiudeen had convened a meeting at his Ministry to determine the acquisition of lands from Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaithivu districts which included the forest reserve at Pichchai Vanniyakulam also know as bound area (Villattikulam forest reserve) located in Musali DS division in Mannar district for human settlement and allocate 80-perch each for 2,371 Muslim families claimed by Minister Bathiudeen as landless families out of 1,730 families of internally displaced persons from North and registered for resettlement.
The petitioners further stated that on May 7, 2009 on a presidential directive, a 19 member Presidential Task Force (PTF) for resettlement of internally displaced persons in the Northern Province, was formulated with the Basil Rajapaksa appointed as the chairman. The PTF had been afforded with the task of resettling IDPs in their original native places and to restore their livelihoods. This allocation of responsibilities was confirmed by the Conservator General of Forests in report furnished to the Attorney General dated November 9, 2015.

Federer can keep winning Slams till 2020, predicts Scientific Astrologer
In 2013, when the Grand Slams had dried up for Roger Federer, this author had predicted that he would go on to win 20. Now that he has crossed that magic figure, the question for which everyone wants an answer is, how many more Slams can he win
The answer lies in his tormentor, the Saturn. While Saturn was in exaltation during 2012-14, he couldnt win the Olympic Gold and had just won one Grand Slam. During this phase, Saturn was transiting Federers third house of the hands; and his hands let him down in these 3 years. In 2015, Jupiter got exalted into his twelfth house of losses and he couldnt win then too.
Now, since 2017, FedEx is enjoying the transit of Planet-X (2007 RH 283) into his tenth house of career. There is a comeback of sorts in his career. So how long will the maestro weave his magic Well, he can do so till Saturn comes back into his life once again. Saturn is all set to return to its own house in February 2020.
This time Saturn would come into the sixth house of obstacles for Federer. What that means is that he would struggle to win tournaments with Saturn getting stronger and staying till 2022. Beyond that, an even stronger planet, Neptune would enter its own house into Federers eighth house of transformations and the Swiss would just leave the arena to spend time with his family.
So, arithmetically, Federer has a possibility of having a shot at another 10 Grand Slams. Even if he has a 30% success ratio, which is a strong possibility because of his current transit of Planet-X, he can end up with another 3-4 Grand Slams. He may just hang his boots anytime post 2020.
So, FedEx, is not done yet; he would extend the lead that he has over the others. He would end up with another 3-4 Grand Slams or will keep winning Slams till 2020, whichever is later.  SK

Federer keeps his cool through the fierce heat of battle
This turbulent Australian Open has been about longevity, endurance and iced towels, three of the defining features of the modern game.
The wonder of Roger Federers victory against the 29-year-old Marin Cilic on Sunday was not just that it gave him his 20th major in a record 30th final but that the 36 year old Swiss fashioned a fortnight of such sweet perfection to get there, spending less than 11 hours on court while his younger rivals laboured in the killing heat for much longer. Cilic clocked up 17hr 3min en route. At the end it showed.
When the heatwave rolled through Melbourne midway through the first week (and returned like an uninvited guest at the finish), the complaints of the suffering players became the coda to the tournament. Notable was the second-round battle between Novak Djokovic and Gal Monfils. It lasted only 2hr 45min but the Frenchman said he felt as if he had survived a small heat stroke for 40 minutes. Djokovic said he was right at the limit of his stamina.
His conqueror in the fourth round, the Korean bull Hyeon Chung, would also fall, retiring with a nasty foot blister after two games of the second set in his semi-final against Federer. Nobody, it seemed, was immune  young or old, male or female  except one man: the champion.
In the womens draw the three set formula saved most players from enduring too much pain  indeed, a dozen matches did not last an hour and most finished in less than two  but there were exceptions and they hit those players who would feature in the finish.
The 3hr 44min of the third-round match between Simona Halep and the young American Lauren Davis might have been as hard to watch as it must have been to play  and the Romanian winner would pay a price for her courage. By the time she reached Saturdays final against the Danish grinder Caroline Wozniacki, she was red lining. That night she spent four hours in hospital, recovering from dehydration.
The match had dragged the last drop of commitment and sweat from both of them, Halep needing a courtside health check in the second set after looking ready to topple over; she somehow recovered to level at a set apiece. It proved to be a chimera.
After two hours in sweltering heat, Wozniacki brought the crowd to their feet with a volley to end a 23-shot rally in the third game of the deciding set. She was breathing hard  and double faulted to drop serve. In 2014 the Dane ran the New York marathon in 3hr 26min  18min less than it had taken Halep to defeat Davis.
There was not a single serve-and-volley point from either player, with the workload spread overwhelmingly across the baseline, where 226 points were won and lost. When she was broken in the seventh game, Wozniacki called for the physio to work on her left knee.
It might have been that her entire engine was seizing up. But she outlasted her weary adversary, whose last shot, after many glorious ones, was a lame backhand from mid-court into the net.
They had played for 2hr 49min  exactly the time it took Victor Troicki to defeat Alex Bolt over five sets in round one.
The last set of the final took 71 minutes  exactly the time it took Halep to beat Karolina Pliskova in the quarter-finals. The 2hr 22min it took Halep to beat Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals was two minutes less than her third set against Davis. The more it matters, the more time becomes irrelevant.
Ultimately, though, this is what they train for  as Kyle Edmund pointed out. Even when a hip injury cut him down in his semi final against Cilic, he dismissed it as one of those things.
When asked about the heat, he delivered perhaps the quote of the tournament: Its a professional sport. Its meant to hurt. Its not meant to be easy.
As a tearful Federer showed after he had subdued a fighting Cilic on Sunday, that is what makes it all worthwhile.

Federer's phenomenal indoor record leaves Cilic in the shade
The moment organisers decided to shut the roof on Rod Laver Arena, Roger Federer already had one hand on the Australian Open title.
On Sunday in withering Melbourne heat, Federer survived an onslaught from first-time finalist Marin Cilic to win his 20th grand slam title 6-2 6-7(5) 6-3 3-6 6-1 but former players Pat Cash and Greg Rusedski argued the circumstances had favoured the 36-year-old.
Temperatures in Melbourne had hovered in the high 30s Celsius for majority of the tournament and it was a surprise when the match started with the roof shut.
The roofs of the main showcourts at Melbourne Park are usually kept open but the organisers defended their decision in a statement saying wet bulb globe temperature readings had triggered the extreme heat policy.
The conditions favoured Federer, who has a staggering 272-65 win-loss record on indoor courts and has lifted 23 career titles, only behind the American trio of Jimmy Connors (53), John McEnroe (52), Ivan Lendl (42) in the all-time rankings. Former world number one Andy Murray comes closest among the current players on tour with 14 indoor titles, while the 29-year-old Cilic has eight to his name, the most recent win coming in Basel in 2016.
The Croatian fell short of saying the roof cost him a grand slam title but admitted the decision from the organisers did influence the match.
I have to say that decision, you know, could it have been different I guess so, he said.
I think that it was just little bit difficult to adjust, especially the beginning of the match. With the roof closed, it was way, way cooler than I expected.
That was very, very difficult, especially for the final to, you know, be in that kind of a situation.
Having also lost the Wimbledon final to Federer six months ago when he was hobbled by blisters, Cilic must be wondering if he will ever get a fair crack against the Swiss maestro. - Agencies

Fighting corruption 70 years after freedom
The 70th anniversary of Independence celebrated tomorrow comes a week before a major test of the progress of democracy in the country, with the Local Government poll very much taking the image of a national referendum on the progress of the government, and the battle against corruption in the country. It raises questions about success of the present unity government in keeping on its pledge to effectively fight the corruption of the previous regime, and raises major questions on the ability of the government to carry out clean governance in the country.
The independence anniversary will no doubt recall the leaders of the country associated independence, and the path laid out for the progress of democracy in the country. The name of the first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake stands out high, despite certain shortcomings. The issues relating to the later leaderships of the Bandaranaikes as a wide family of leaders, and the subsequent Rajapaksa leadership, as well as, the footprints of the many Opposition leaders, especially from the left parties are also remembered. This also reminds one of the shortcomings the country faced in leadership and politics of governance. The failure to achieve effective economic and social progress, leading to two left wing insurrections; the inability of all governments to properly deal with communal relations in the country, leading to a major terrorist war of separation, defeated by the last government; and the continued failure to achieve good and effective reconciliation will remain issues of concern in the post-colonial democratic process.
This background has a definite impact on the Local Government poll campaign now moving to its strongest rivalry. The UNP, founded by D.S. Senanayake and his supporters that formed the first government in a free, post-colonial country remains the single strongest party in this election campaign. It faces opposition by the SLFP founded by SWRD Bandaranaike, who left the UNP mainly due to the leadership issue, due to DS Senanayake promoting his son Dudley Senanayake to succeed him, and then moved to left wing nationalizations and wider communal politics, and the SLPP clearly led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, who gave a fully family-oriented leadership of the SLFP; moving away from the Bandaranaikes to the Rajapaksas, with continuing emphasis on communal politics, with the considerable achievement of defeating Tamil separatist terrorism of the LTTE.
This is clearly a three-cornered contest, in the majority Sinhala areas comprising seven of the nine provinces in the country. The politics of Tamil and Muslim communalism have a major impact on the other two provinces; and to some extent in urban areas elsewhere with strong communities of the Tamil and Muslim minorities. The Central Province has a very strong population of plantation Tamils, growing in political importance.
National and local politics
The question that arises is what all this has to do with Local Government politics where the focus should be on the management of the local authorities in the country. It is evident the stuff of national politics transcends local government matters, especially with this being the first major event to seek public opinion on government after the major political changes in January 2015, and also the deliberate delays in holding these polls.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who leads the SLFP and UPFA, after failed attempts at an alliance with the Rajapaksa-led SLPP on these polls, did bring the campaign to focus on corruption with emphasis on the Treasury Bond issue, seeing the path to attack both his coalition partner  the UNP, and the SLPP. He has drawn large crowds to rallies addressed by him, with the advantage of government leadership, and public interest in the Bond issue. Yet, he faces a major challenge having to face two rivals  the UNP his own coalition ally and his former leader and party colleagues in the SLPP. He has since widened his anti-corruption campaign by laying new stress on the PRECIFAC Report, which has identified many of his former associates in the Rajapaksa government, and Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, on issues of corruption.
His campaign against corruption does have a resonance with the public, but also has the disadvantages of the delay in acting against the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, as well as his unconcealed support of the corrupt in uniform, with homage to War Heroes, involving Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, too. The recent trend of an outright fight against corruption, with threats to use his sword on them, and punishment in hell, have also led to uncalculated mistakes; especially in offering to form a government with all 96 MPs of the SLFP-UPFA, who are with him and those with Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR). Many of the 51 MPs with MR include many against whom the PRECIFAC Report has charges of fraud and corruption. This raises major questions about his commitment to fight corruption, and weakened his position as the polls draw closer.
He scored a publicity hit by telling the crooks on both sides  in government and opposition (UNP and SLPP) had joined in putting off a parliamentary debate on the Bond issue and PRECIFAC till after these polls, although wanted it before. The reality was that his own SLFP representatives too agreed to this postponement. But, with the date now shifted to February 6, much of the wind has gone out of his sails on this debate and its impact on the LG Poll.
The opposition range
In the context of what is seen as a national referendum on the government, the two opposition parties  UNP (within government) and SLPP  are carrying out their own rival oppositions to President Sirisenas national unity government leadership. The UNP limited with its position within the ruling coalition, and affected by clear links to the Bond issue, is certainly playing it low  in its attacks on the President, but very strong in opposition to the SLPP and MR. It places more emphasis on its own claims on economic progress in the past three years, seeking to win public support for the continuance of the present government, with its goals of the next Presidential Poll in 2019, and the General Election in 2020.
The UNP certainly has major disadvantages with echoes of the Bond issue, where the links between Arjuna Mahendran and Ranil Wickremesinghe are not easily erased, whatever its propaganda seeks to achieve. It has now taken an important step, although far too late, of deciding to remove Ravi Karunanayake from his position as Assistant Leader of the Party. This certainly underlines the many issues about his highly questionable association with Arjun Aloysius and Perpetual Treasures, and the benefits he had from it.
On the publicity front the UNP and Ranil Wickremesinghe has a major disadvantage. But, it certainly has strength as the single largest political party in the country, and the strong commitment of its supporters, to remain with it, as seen in the 2015 Presidential Poll and General Election. The advantage the UNP has in facing a divided opposition  of both the present and past presidents of the country, remains significant and cannot be erased. It is also necessary to note that a considerable number of new voters in this election will be supportive of the UNP  being unfamiliar with the traditional opposition to the party by older voters.
The Lotus bud
Getting the Lotus Bud of the SLPP to bloom as the votes in this poll are counted, is the major challenge facing its leader MR, and the SLFP big names that remain with him. MR does draw large crowds to his rallies  as seen in the campaign for the Presidential Poll in November and December 2014, and the General Election campaign in 2015. However, these numbers did not turn out very helpful as voters. The challenge before MR and the SLPP is to ensure the large crowds turnout to be large numbers of voters.
It certainly has many problems to face on issues of corruption. This could be worse with the government seeking action on the PRECIFAC Report. It, therefore, has to use the Bond issue to best effect to attack both the UNP and President Sirisena, as the leader of the UNP-led coalition with the SLFP-IUPFA. The SLPP and MR certainly have reason to be pleased with the current situation, especially with the delays by the United Coalition, led by President Sirisena, to act on issues of corruption, as pledged to the people in the campaigns for the Presidential Poll and General Election.
Much as the cheering crowds show support for MR and the SLPP, the fact that this is not an election to change a government, certainly places the party and its leader at considerable disadvantage.
The advantage though is in the reality of local government matters being ignored in this poll, and more being said of government changes. But the post-poll reality is that there can be no government change after this poll.
What the public will have to look towards with an interest in this poll is how much the campaign slogans against corruption will be serious, and speedily carried out, unlike the pledges of the Common Candidate for Executive Presidency in January 2015.

Former Mt. Lavinia Crimes OIC detained over Lasanthas murder
The CID had taken into custody the former Crimes OIC of the Mount Lavinia Police on a 48 hour detention order over the killing of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge which took place nine years ago.
CID sources told the Daily News that the then Crimes OIC of the Mt. Lavinia Police, Sub Inspector Tissa Sugathapala was taken into custody on Wednesday by the CID and had obtained a court order to detain him for 48 hours for questioning.
According to CID sources, many details that had hitherto not been revealed, had come to light during the interrogation of Sugathapala.
He is accused of concealing and destroying information pertaining to the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunge.
The CID said he had failed to respond to orders of the CID to record a statement with regard to Wickrematunges killing at Attidiya on January 8, 2009.
The CID official said Sugathapala was scheduled to be arrested and remanded yesterday.
It is also learnt that the CID intends to arrest a former IG, DIG, SP and several others on charges of trying to sweep under the carpet all evidence with regard to Lasanthas killing and trying to pin it on the LTTE.
Further, the CID is also expected to obtain a statement from a former high ranking government official who is believed to have been the main advisor in this crime.
Information had also been revealed that Lasanthas diary which had been found in his car at the time of his assassination, containing all his details, his mobile phone and several other items had been given by SI Sugathapala to an SP who had then given it to the DIG and then to the IG and eventually to the high ranking government official.
This information had also come to light during the interrogation of SI Sugathapala.

Independence Day Message: Nation pays tribute to its true patriots - President
If one is to truly fathom the value of independence, it is essential to understand the pain being oppressed and subservient in the face of a foreign power. This is why we are grateful to all our heroes who sacrificed their lives in order to restore and sustain our nations independence. On a day like today, when the value of freedom is commemorated, the nation pays tribute to its true patriots whose contribution to our motherland was invaluable, states President Maithripala Sirisena in an Independence Day message.
The message adds:As Sri Lanka celebrates seven decades of independence, it is appropriate to reflect on how far we have come as a nation. In terms of achieving human development, and various social, economic, and political challenges we were faced with, the progress we have ahieved over this period is laudable.
I believe that as a nation with a unique identity, we have what it takes to overcome any challenge. We have proven it throughout our history. Today, we must show once again that Sri Lanka is a nation that can rise within a short span of time. We have to undertake many a mission, including achieving inclusive green growth. National reconciliation, and uplifting the quality and competitiveness of our human capital in a global scale.
We must also remember that true freedom does not comprise only of political freedom. Our independence is not complete until economic and cultural freedom is achieved. In our journey towards economic freedom, this year is a crucial one.
As a country, our future successes lie in our commitment to achieve long term goals with firm determination, as we have done in the past. Completion of the Moragahakanda reservoir as the last massive step in the Mahaweli development programme is a testimony to our perseverance and commitment to meet such long term goals.
This year has been declared the National Food Production Year, with hopes to reach the goal of food security, a dream that our nation has had since independence.
On this occasion that we celebrate seven decades of Independence, I pledge to fulfil all my duties towards mother Lanka, and I emphasize that our true strength is in our unity and determination, the message adds.

Independence Day Message: Work in unity for nations progress - PM
This year, we celebrate 70 years of independence from colonial rule. It is an occasion for us to remember that we were only able to achieve independence with the participation of all communities coming together towards a common goal,states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an Independence Day message.
The message adds: It is our responsibility to keep in mind that true independence was only possible when
we can unite as one nation, rising above political, religious and ethnic differences. Only then is independence truly significant and meaningful to all.
Freedom is fulfilled when human dignity and spiritual liberty is attained - in addition to social, political and economic freedom.
Since being elected to power, our Government has consistently focused on creating the right social and political climate needed to build a society that is indeed free and stable.
Under a theme of One Nation, the 70th Independence Day celebrations that are held today,reflect our legacy as a free nation.
My hope is to see all Sri Lanka unite as one to sustain freedom for all.
Lets strive to be a people truly committed to our nations progress on this Independence Day.

[Independence Day messages]
Church of Ceylon calls to shed petty differences
The Church of Ceylon joins all Sri Lankans in greeting the nation on this joyous occasion of the 70th anniversary of the independence of our dear Motherland, stated Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev Dhiloraj R. Canagasabey in a message marking Independence Day.
The message added: Our country has been blessed with abundant beauty and natural resources and a people who are generous, hospitable and intelligent.
As we look back at the past seven decades, there is much that we can be thankful for, and many Sri Lankans that we can unreservedly be proud of.
Foremost among these are our achievements in education, initiated through the reforms proposed and carried out by a great visionary. Education opened the door to the development and the impressive standards of our health care system, comparable to that of many richer countries.
Much as we ought to be proud of what we have achieved, we need also to reflect honestly on where we have failed and gone wrong. This is a duty cast not only of our leaders, although their example is of primary importance, but a duty laid on each one of us.
We need to ask ourselves the reasons why since independence we have not been able to build a nation of justice, peace and fairness to all Why is it that we have had three bloody and hugely costly insurrections and several race riots with the loss of tens of thousands of lives Why is there so much indiscipline, corruption, waste and selfishness in our private and public lives Why are we unable to accept those who speak a different language, believe in different Gods or teachings and have different cultures, as our own Sri Lankan sisters and brothers having equal rights and an equal place in this country Sadly, all this happens in a country which boasts of so many temples, Kovils, churches and mosques and where religion plays such an important part in our daily lives.
Let us on this memorable day, re-examine our hearts and re-dedicate ourselves with honesty to the great responsibility that lies upon all of us; that of making our own contribution, however small to building a free, just and peaceful nation. May God bless Sri Lanka and all her peoples!
Treat all with dignity: Opposition Leader
With gratitude to our forefathers who fought for independence, I issue this message on 70th Independence Day of our Country.
We are at a crucial juncture of our history as we celebrate seventy years of Independence.
As a country, we have not been able to enjoy the true benefits of the independence in the past, stated Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, in his message marking Independence Day.
The message added: As a result of the unresolved national question, we have faced the lack of peace and harmony and development of the country.
The ethnic issue has widened the gap between communities and has caused distrust and disunity amongst our people.
The country as a whole is still struggling to come out of the adverse impact of the armed struggle. As we look back at the past seventy years our losses outweigh our gains. Our failure in genuinely addressing the national question has left us far behind in economic development and prosperity in the region.
The past has left us with more events of grief and sadness than happiness and joy. But we cannot allow the past to be repeated. We must unite as people of one country, and it is only possible when people are treated with dignity and self-respect.
Therefore, I urge all political parties and leaders to cooperate to adopt a new Constitution. A Constitution that will genuinely address the root causes of the conflict and preserve the dignity of every citizen of this country.
We must come together to find a lasting solution through a new Constitution, the supreme law of the country.
My appeal to the leaders and the people of this country is to come together to find a reasonable and acceptable political solution, which will have an enormous impact in rebuilding our shattered economy and in bringing lasting peace and harmony amongst our people.
Let us not miss the opportunity before us to create a better future for our country and its people.
Celebrate by recalling work of forefathers: Minister
It is a well-known fact that Sri Lanka was invaded by the Portuguese, Dutch and the English in different times of history and we have been living with a colonial mentality for a long period in the past.
We commemorate, at this point of time, the National Leaders who dedicated their lives and worked tirelessly towards gaining Independence of our Motherland during the above era with immense respect and the true sense of sovereignty of Sri Lanka, stated Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardana in a message marking Independence Day.
The message added: "The entire history has been documented and the memories of technology, economy and the guidance on the way forward that the Nation has inherited from the foreign rulers remain in the form of numerous memorials.
Some of these memorials have been named as world heritage sites and many foreign and local tourists visit the country to see them.
During the colonial era, the foreign rulers have improved the economy of the country to be on par with the world economy.
However, politicians during the post-colonial period too have given so much to our Nation.
Free education, free health service, electricity, highways and the other things that we have gained through free economy have been vested in the people of our country.
In a way, our country has achieved much more than the other countries who have similarly got independence.
Nevertheless, we should question ourselves as to whether we have a history with artefacts created by us after gaining independence that would attract tourists from other countries of the world.
However, foreign tourists arrive in the country to see the beauty and grandeur of the structures built in the colonial era and our proud history reflected in Sigiriya, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and the like built during the times of ancient kings.
Likewise, as we pass 70 years of independence, we observe that foreigners arrive here to see the history of irrigation works of our country such as Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe and Maduruoya. Further, we all know that by integrating the knowledge, gained through the free education, with the world economy, Sri Lankans disseminate their knowledge throughout the entire world.
One obstacle to going forward as a Nation is the practice of designing our cities to suit the money in hand.
As such, our next challenge in the future would be to create an architectural economy within the democracy and design cities that would attract the entire world and generate income for the country.
For this purpose, all Sri Lankans should stand up with dignity as one Nation in front of the world.
We firmly believe that it is possible to create a new world and win the above challenge with the leadership of His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe.
We have a proud history which is closely knitted with the village, irrigation and religious places of worship.
Therefore, we Sri Lankans who inherit such a proud history step in the 70th year of independence with pride as an Independent and Sovereign Nation.
Further, I would like to mention that we Sri Lankans welcome His Royal Highness Prince Edward and the Countess who represent the Royal Family in Britain, the special representatives from Japan and China and other distinguished guests with heartfelt happiness."
Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter:
Act in unity
Sri Lanka which was a free sovereign State was conquered by the Portuguese in 1505 and the Dutch in 1658. Later low country areas was captured by the British in 1796 and it was completely conquered on February 18, 1815, when King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe was captured at a house of Gahalawatte Udapitiya Arachchi, with the help of a group including Eknaligoda Mohottala. It became a British colony with the signing of the Kandyan Convention on March 2, 1815. Soon after, when laic and ascetics understood that they had been caught in the trap of the British, they fought against them for the freedom of country.
We were able to regain independence on February 4, 1948, as a result of these struggles. The time has come to consider whether we have converted the gained independence to a meaningful one. Many countries that had gained independence with us have reached the climax of development, but unfortunately, we have failed to gain prosperity and spiritual development in the country.
In the event of commemorating the 70th Independence Day, it should be determined to make true benefits of the independence deviating from ethnic, religious, social, cultural and political divisions. May the blessing of the Triple Gem and Sacred Tooth Relic give timely rain and that the country may become developed and prosperous.
Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala
Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter:
Let us determine to gain prosperity
I am pleased to be aware that the 70th Independence Day celebration of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka was arranged to be held ceremoniously as usual.
Sri Lankans have lost their independence as they were divided due to the unwise acts of some leaders with a lust for power. From time to time, there were several invasions to Sri Lanka, eventually it was completely surrendered by English imperialists. The country declined in every aspect including national, religious, social and cultural aspects which led to a decline in unity of people, prosperity of the country and spiritual qualities of citizens.
We were fortunate to win our independence on February 04, 1948, thanks to laic and ascetic national heroes who sacrificed their lives to save the country from this calamity. Although it was seventy years from the independence, we have failed to gain physical and spiritual developments deviating from various religious and political divisions as a country compared to other nations that gained independence with us.
In this 70th Independence Day, let us determine to gain prosperity to the country by establishing peace and harmony among nationalities and religious groups securing national, religious, social and cultural identities. May the Sacred Tooth Relic bless all Sri Lankan citizens for gaining benefits from independence.
Most Ven. Warakagoda Dhammasiddhi Sri Pagngnananda Gnanarathana
Mahanayake Thera of the Ramagna Nikaya:
Massive development strides
This country is fortunate to hold its 70th Independence Day after the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga massive development project being vested in the public with the great efforts of the President.
The service rendered by the leaders who were committed in economical and social development and who have understood their responsibilities towards the country is deeply kept in the minds of the Sri Lankan public. They are grateful to them. Good people never forget what they have done.
If leaders who have won the confidence of the public and who came into power discharge their responsibility locally, the expectation of a prosperous Sri Lanka would be fulfilled soon.
May the Triple Gem bless the government led by the President for achieving strength and courage in gaining prosperity for all citizens, while discharging their duty of protecting the country, nation and religion! May this country which was secured by sacrificing their lives be protected and undivided forever!
Most Ven. Napana Pemasiri
Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Nikaya:
Move fast towards economic prosperity Move fast towards economic prosperity
This is the seventieth year since Sri Lanka regained independence on February 4, 1948 after spending three colonial ages. We can be satisfied about the progress we have gained within these seven decades. After ending a thirty year long war, Sri Lanka had developed compared to the past. The government with its people should move fast towards economic prosperity. Also, we can be satisfied about the growth in the educational sector. Today, the need for a more prosperous future is to select the right track towards development and march forward despite racial and religious divisions.
We as well as other countries in the world tend to use technical development for declining of society, though it has also caused progress of the world. The future of the country depends on good qualities of the next generation. We should act more intellectually for building morality, which will cause peace and ultimately prosperity will occur as a result of that peace.
Many criminal incidents can be witnessed in present society which is caused by the decline of morality. Our people should pay more consideraition in this regard and should grow morality for preventing such situations. Our sole detemrination in this seventieth Independence Day is to grow good morals and to achieve peace and prosperity.
We would like to inform all citizens of the country that above mentioned national-religious determination is what we all should generate within ourselves in this vital Independence Day. We wish a prosperous future for the country and for all citizens!
Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa
Archbishop of Colombo:
Keep racial, religious and political divisions aside
I am pleased to issue this message of greetings with regard to the 70th Independence Day of our motherland.
It is better to scrutinize the past 70 years in this joyous occasion of independence and consider the present status that we are undergoing. When we think relatively of our heroes and political leaders in early age who has fought for independence with philanthropy, we can witness a gradual decline in patriotism, political discipline, civilization and morality.
From the highest point to the lowest social stratum we see theft, fraud, corruption, drug menace and harassment. As a nation, we have failed to fulfil the expectations of the people, though governing political parties have changed, laws are strengthened and constitutional reforms or economic policies were undertaken. We see everywhere, misbehaviour of people's representatives, decline of sincere patriot vision and hesitation to protect our unique culture and identity.
Solutions to this spiritual decline rests upon a broad spiritual awakening and not on constitutional or national policy reforms. There is no way we mislead the way to liberation if we try to follow the teachings of our religious leaders in our practical lives. I think the reason for the present complexity is that we tend to use religion as jewellery and perform external rituals than going deep in a spiritual searching.
The renaissance, political freedom and economic development we expect will not be realized until we determine to act individually as well as collectively in fraternity, aiming a spiritual awakening. Let us affirm in this national Independence Day to act together keeping racial, religious and political divisions aside for gaining such a spiritual awakening.
Rt. Revd.Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
Methodist Church of Sri Lanka President:
Preserve unity, harmony among people
The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka conveys its prayers and God's blessings to our nation Sri Lanka, which celebrates its 70th Independence Day. As a Church, we are thankful to God for the way in which he has blessed and guided the lives of the people who live in Sri Lanka from ancient days. We are a country that had been greatly enriched by the presence of people who belong to different ethnic and religious groups and who have lived and shared their lives with each other. Our history has had its own shares of conflicts, war and destruction of lives and property, but we are also a nation that has decisively made an effort to put aside our differences and live together as one nation.
The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka which has existed for the last 203 years, remains firmly committed to uphold every effort that would be made to preserve the unity and harmony among the people in our country. Our prayer is that our nation will not look for things and issues that would divide people and foster all possible avenues and opportunities to build a united Sri Lanka.
Rev. Asiri P. Perera
All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama General Secretary:
Let us be united as one country and one nation
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama is pleased to release this message of blessings on the occasion of celebrating the 70th Independence Day of our motherland, Sri Lanka.
In order to completely celebrate the achievements of Independence after 70 years, we have come across plenty of challenges throughout its history.
We remember on this year's Independence Day that we as Sri Lankans should take forward this country towards prosperity by living in peace and coexistence with the assurance of good governance by the present government.
Our prayers and expectations are that all communities Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims in this multi-ethnic society, should continue to achieve prosperity, development and progress by following their respective religious advice and developing the ethics of respecting other religions.
One country's development solely depends on the unity and sincere patriotism of the people.
Therefore, it is the duty of every citizen to take initiatives in this opportunity to develop a practical approach to achieve unity and co-existence among communities and religions.
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama prays that the Almighty showers His blessings on every Sri Lankan citizen who would make an effort to bring unity, peace and tolerance through which to build a peaceful and a prosperous nation. Let's be united as one country and one nation!
Ash-Sheikh M. M. A. Mubarak,
Ramakrishna Mission Vice-President and Chairman:
Peace, happiness and prosperity, my wish
I am glad to note that the celebration of the 70th Independence Day of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka will be on February 4, 2018. On this happy occasion, I convey my sincere greetings and best wishes to all the brethren in the country. Along with my best wishes, I pray that the Lord shower his choicest blessings on the nation at large, the President, his ministerial staff and all citizens of Sri Lanka.
At this historic moment, let us to ponder over the basic truth of life, which forms the guiding force of humanity for a peaceful existence. Each soul is potentially divine, says Swami Vivekananda. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Realization of the true nature of man will lead to universal peace and toleration. People themselves have to work towards manifesting it in their life.
The first step towards such a move is to open one's heart to the miseries of people and feel compassionate towards them. And out of this compassion, will be born a natural inclination and a readiness to sacrifice personal prejudices, likes and dislikes etc., in order to come closer to each other and live in harmony.
By the all round development of physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual of every individual, we will be able to live in peace, happiness and prosperity in every field is my sincere prayer to the Lord.
Swami Sarvarupananda

Mendis misses double ton on 23rd birthday
CHITTAGONG, Friday  Kusal Mendis fell four runs short of his maiden Test double century on his 23rd birthday but Sri Lanka cut their deficit to a single digit in the first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong on Friday.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam removed Mendis for 196 before Sri Lanka reached 504-3 by close on the third day to trail Bangladesh's first innings total of 513 runs by just 9 runs.
Pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman earlier broke Mendis' 308-run second wicket stand with Dhananjaya de Silva, who fell for 173 runs after resuming his innings on 104.
De Silva and Mendis dominated the opening session of the day after Sri Lanka resumed their innings on 187-1.
Bangladesh had to wait for the second new ball to get their first success as Mustafizur got a leading edge from de Silva for wicketkeeper Liton Das to complete a high catch.
De Silva faced 229 balls and hit 21 fours along with a six in his fourth Test century and the second in as many Tests.
Mendis added another 107-run with Roshen Silva for the third wicket before he gave a catch to Mushfiqur Rahim at midwicket.
He survived a run-out when he had a mix-up with Roshen in the middle of the pitch after crossing his 150-run mark.
Mehedi Hasan made an awkward throw from extra cover after Mendis drove Taijul, allowing him to return to the pitch before wicketkeeper Liton could break the stumps.
Bangladesh were also unlucky in the morning as de Silva survived a strong lbw appeal on 119 off Taijul when the ball hit him on his toe before going to the slips.
With the hosts having already used both their reviews, they had no choice but to accept the decision of the on-field umpire.
Mendis hit left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam for a boundary to bring his fourth Test hundred off 200 balls.
De Silva reached his 1,000 runs in Tests on 154, joining Roy Dias as the quickest Sri Lankan to achieve the feat in his 23rd innings.
De Silvas and Mendis wickets were the only ones Bangladesh were able to capture on a batting paradise which has proved a heartbreak for bowlers.
By the close Roshen Silva and skipper Dinesh Chandimal had figured in an unfinished stand of 89 to carry Sri Lanka to 504-3 by stumps.
Silva who made an unbeaten half century on his Test debut against India at Delhi followed that innings to remain 87 not out inclusive of five fours and one six. Chandimal was unbeaten on 37.

Much to be proud of; much remains to be done
Sri Lanka has now reached its 70th year of independence. Ninety per cent of the present generation would have not actually witnessed the great moment when our National Flag was hoisted on that eventful eve of our First Independence Day. Yet, they would have heard at the dinner tables how their grandparents talked about the colonial era.
When British left us after centuries of colonial raj and we became a sovereign nation, the euphoria of that time promised much hope for a more united and more prosperous future.
So, what had changed after the independence Or, in simple terms, are we really Independent
What does Independence mean for us Does this mean economic independence or social independence or cultural independence or a mix of all After 70 years of Independence, are we really proud of present status of country
Responsibility
We have tons of unsolved problems from corruption to high cost of living to ethnic harmony. When I discussed this issue with an elderly social scientist, he argued that crying over the inadequacies and shortcomings is never the solution. Its up to you to make the best out of this situation because we are also responsible for those problems.
I agreed with him totally. We (the common citizens) are also responsible for the present status of country (whether good or bad). We need to take responsibility for everything that happened in the past because we have remained silent spectators for changes and actions which took place in and around the society.
Maybe, our country is not the best in many areas (like governance, infrastructure, and education, healthcare). There is no shame in accepting that fact. But at the same time, we should also rejoice our great achievements during the last 70 years.
Achievements
In economic and developmental terms, we certainly have much to be pleased about. Thanks to the ingenuity of our farmers, we have become self-sufficient in most staple food production, and thanks to the vibrant private sector, social goods and services have been delivered to nearly every corner of the country.
There are many success stories in terms of almost every indicator, from women's empowerment to education to health, we have made great strides in independence, though, of course, there is much that remains unfinished.
Acknowledgment of failure and strategies to improve on failed (or weak) frontiers are need of hour. There is always a scope for innovation and improvement.
Income-inequality
While we have cut poverty rates and created opportunity and growth, it has come at a cost. The stubborn income inequality in Sri Lanka still poses a serious question about the ultimate goal of the countrys growth efforts. The countrys rich have been able to maintain their relative position undiminished while the poor have been worse-off.
The high income-inequality, as noted by many economists, threatens the social and political instability of the country. We must redouble our efforts to include everyone in the fruits of independence and ensure that no one is left behind.
Like many nations who were dominated by British colonialism, Sri Lanka also adopted a rote learning approach in education, which has remained unchanged since formal education was first practiced. It is not surprising, then, that we cannot turn out citizens and leaders who demonstrate clear vision and independence The education system of Sri Lanka is not designed to develop leaders, original thinkers, learners, creators, inventors or innovators.
This fact is not just true at pre-primary level, but also, sadly, at our country's universities. The system creates citizens who have memorized a solution for each problem'. But in real life, we constantly face and must respond to new problems that we have never met before. When our leaders encounter problems, they look for solutions that worked elsewhere. But that is not the right solution.
By educating todays students to be flexible, inquiring and creative - we will be guaranteeing of making citizens of tomorrow who will be the caretakers of our national identity. If this happens, it is not too much of a dream to make Sri Lanka an academic centre of excellence in 2030 It only takes one generation.
The people expect the present Government to deliver and rescue the Sri Lankans from this counter-productive and obsolete education system. If we miss this opportunity, we put our children's future at risk. They will experience the results of the choices we make today.
Social mobility
There is also a need to raise the concern about the way of development and unfold the truth about the real beneficiary of development. We need to ensure the accountability at each and every level and it shouldnt stop at the lofty promises of inclusive development.
Social mobility is another factor which needs clear attention. We need to create the access to opportunity and enabling environment for upward social mobility in the society. Unless we offer such a framework we will not be able to bridge the gap between poor and rich and inclusive development will remain a lofty promise for winning elections.
What we are seeing is skewed development with benefits limited to certain section of society.
Although Sri Lanka has risen to a lower-middle-income country and per capita incomes have risen to over US $ 3900 in 2015, there are significant pockets of poverty in the country. The issue of poverty and inequality in all its forms has not yet been fully resolved.
Employment generation
It would be wrong to judge the progress of country only based on GDP indicators. It would be misleading to see the growth of malls or IT industry as growth of real Sri Lanka. Only a small fraction of population had benefitted from such approach of growth.
There is a need to push forward manufacturing for long term sustainable employment generation opportunities. There should be a plan to convert Sri Lanka into a leading country in quality manufacturing We have skilled workforce who are tech-savvy and easily trainable. Something like a national manufacturing policy maybe a step in right direction which can aim to create domestic capability and competence in industries where there is a huge domestic and foreign demand.
True meaning
Our Independence is not something just obtained 70 years ago. Independence is now - it is a state of mind, soul and belief. We need to celebrate what we have now but not forget what we have been through.
Independence is to embrace the courage of our forbearers to make the impossible into possible. Independence is to shun that which deforms our innate values and noble desires. Independence is to free ourselves of the clutches of extremism; to unite all citizens, whatever race or religion, as one and to uphold and respect each other's beliefs in the face of diversity.
Sri Lanka belongs to all Sri Lankans and everyone has a right to call it home.
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Indian political leader, economist and philosopher said, What does independence mean It means a way of life which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from equality and equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many.

The Munich disasters long shadow still falls on us all, 60 years on
There are always moments in this job that you remember more than others. The trips abroad, the sweet-scented nights at all those fabulous old grounds where, even subconsciously, you find yourself quickening your step on the walk in. Or the occasions with the great football men from years gone by, when you know how lucky you are to be in their company, listening to their stories with the shackles off, and it feels like an education.
One of those times, in particular, will always stay with me. I remember how well turned out they all were, in their polished shoes and their smart blazers, and that first moment when Sir Bobby Charlton came up the stairs and brought the room to a respectful silence. He smiled politely but you could see, up-close, that it was going to be an ordeal.
On the next table, Bill Foulkes shook our hands, a generation of football writers who maybe didnt know the story as well as we should have done, and started going through his own memories, half a century on, of that seminal, awful night on the runway of Munich Riem airport. Foulkes was one of the survivors who had pulled others from the wreckage but there was absolutely no way he was willing to portray himself as a hero. We were only a few minutes in before this formidable old centre half  tough as teak, Charlton remembered him  was struggling with his emotions and reaching for a glass of water.
Of all the memories of covering Manchester United, all the matches and trophies and air miles, it was certainly quite something to sit opposite these men at the clubs training ground 10 years ago, building up to the 50th anniversary of the Munich tragedy, and listen to their accounts of the day that changed their lives.
Harry Gregg, another of the heroes, had flown in from Belfast, where the walls of his house are adorned with pictures of Matt Busbys team. Albert Scanlon, who escaped with a fractured skull and a broken leg, talked about the profound psychological scars that had stayed with him and Kenny Morgans, the youngest player involved in the crash, explained he did not usually like to talk too much about it.
Morgans was the last survivor to be rescued from the burnt-out BEA Elizabethan after being found under the wheels five hours after the official search was called off. He spoke beautifully about the team mates who had been lost. All five of the men in our company did. We sat with them, listened and felt a little bit more connected with the clubs history.
Next weekend (February 8), a crowd will gather outside Old Trafford, as it always does before the home match nearest the anniversary, to remember the 23 people who died, 60 years since that European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade. Eight of the dead belonged to the thrilling, youthful team that had won the league championship under Busbys expert guidance the previous two seasons. Other victims included two members of the air crew (though the pilot, James Thain, survived), three club officials and eight journalists including one of my own predecessors, Donny Davies, of what was then the Manchester Guardian, writing with a pseudonym, as many football correspondents did in those days, of An Old International.
We live in an era when football seems obsessed with finding new ways to hold a minutes silence, often when it has nothing whatsoever to do with the sport. But this one always resonates. Before Jos Mourinhos team play Huddersfield there will be a rendition of Flowers of Manchester beneath the Munich plaque. Supporters will be given a commemorative pack, including a book, Remembering the Busby Babes, that has been written specially for the occasion by Ivan Ponting, a prolific author of Uniteds history.
A service will be held at Old Trafford the following Tuesday while, 80 miles south in Dudley, other events are taking place to remember the towns most famous football son. An exhibition about the life of Duncan Edwards, the original boy wonder, opened two weeks ago and on 21 February the great and good will gather for a tribute dinner on the anniversary of his death.
Edwards, an England international by the age of 18, was so catastrophically damaged when the plane skidded off the runway the initial casualty list described him as mortally injured. Instead, it was another 15 days before his final breath, though not before he asked Jimmy Murphy, Busbys assistant, what time kick-off would be against Wolves the following Saturday, and whether he was playing. It was as though a young Colossus had been taken from our midst, Frank Taylor wrote in The Day a Team Died.
Of the players who made it out of flight 609, only Charlton and Gregg are with us now and neither will ever lose sight of the fact that the miracle of life came at a terrible price. Everyone was affected in different ways but the people who know Charlton best, including his brother, Jack, say that was the day he stopped smiling. More than once, I have heard him described as a little stern, or difficult to approach, but what you have to remember is that Charlton was always one of the boys before the quarter-final in Belgrade and the stop, for refuelling, in the snow and ice of Munich. If he lost his sparkle on that runway, at the age of 20, who could ever be surprised
His life since, he told us during that audience 10 years ago, had been accompanied by one unanswerable question: why me Why, he wanted to know, was he able to run his hands over his body and realise he had nothing more serious than a bang on the head and a small cut When he closed his eyes, he could still recall the awful noise of metal on metal, the smoke and carnage and the blare of sirens. He could recall coming to his senses, outside the wrecked plane but still strapped into his seat, and seeing so many stricken team-mates lying around him, some already beyond help.
Charlton found Busby lying on the runway and, in those catastrophic seconds, took off his overcoat to lay it across him. Then it was the following morning, in his bed at Rechts der Isar hospital, when the names of the dead were read out to him. The names of all my pals. Friends I would go to the dance with at the weekend. Friends who would invite me to dinner at Christmas. It felt like my life was being taken away from me, piece by piece.
He is 80 now, no longer so visible in everyday life at Old Trafford, but still feels it is his duty to educate the current squad. Ten years ago, Charlton requested Sir Alex Fergusons permission to speak to the players. His talk lasted an hour and each player was given a DVD about the Busby Babes. This time, he has written a letter that will be given to all the players. I hope they read it, take it in and realise, for all their riches, that Old Trafford is not just the giant fruit machine that is sometimes portrayed.
By pure coincidence, Uniteds under-19s will be in Belgrade to play in a Uefa Youth League tie. A reception will be held at the Majestic hotel, where Busbys travelling party had stayed before that fateful game in 1958, and at least one surviving member of the Red Star Belgrade team is expected to be there.
A minutes silence will be held at the old Stadion JNA and hopefully the latest products from Uniteds youth system will reflect what happened to their predecessors and understand a little better, perhaps, why there is the Munich Tunnel running beneath the stand at Old Trafford that is named after Charlton.
Our own audience with those men, as the football writers who cling to Uniteds coat-tails and lost some of our own on that flight, was certainly time to cherish. We were the best team in the country, Charlton wanted us to know before we left. People dont believe me sometimes when I tell them how good Duncan Edwards was. Tommy Taylor. David Pegg. Eddie Colman. Billy Whelan. All of them. You look at the old black-and-white footage and you think everything is slow and ponderous but, I tell you, they all had unbelievable talent  and I would hate for anyone to forget that.  theguardian

Navy- Havies should be a close game
The high-riding Navy Sports Club will have the edge over Havelock Sports Club in their Dialog A Division League rugby tournament return game today at Havelocks grounds in Havelock Park under lights at 6.30 pm.
Navy lads played a superb game against CR & FC two weeks back at Welisara pulling off a spectacular win by 34 points to 18, hence they will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome Havies with a bonus point victory as they lost their last match to League winners Kandy SC by 17-41 last week.
Forte of the Navy side have been their power-packed forwards and along with their speedy three quarter line and with players of the calibre of skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Raveen De silva, captain Danushka Gertha  Perera, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Adeesha Weerathunga, Stefan Greogary, lanky Supun Peiris, Hashan Maduranga, Musheen Falleel, Budhdhima Piyaratne, Tharindu Maduranga, along with their ever green full back Thilina Weerasinghe are likely to give of their best to earn a bonus point win. Meanwhile the hapless Havies outfit lost to CR & FC by 22 points to 30 after a miserable performance last week at Havelock Park. So they have to really improve their playing standard, get their act together and play a good game if they are to beat the formidable Sailors on t heir home ground at Havelock Park.

Navy SC (Probable XV) Roshan Ranasinghe (Captain), Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Stefan Greogary, Supun Peiris, Lahiru Wishvajith, Danushka Gertha  Perera, Adeesha Weerathunga, Raveen De Silva, Hashan Maduranga and Mohamad Abzal, Budhdhima Piyaratne, Thanuja Maduranga, Musheen Faleel, Saliya Handapangoda, Thilina Weerasinghe, Head Coach : Mothilal Jayathilake, Asst.Coach : Dev Anandh

This Pakistani cricketer left Pakistan for the love of an Indian girl
You all must have heard about love stories of various celebrities that are no less than fairytales! These celebrities didnt mind taking an extra step for their love, and pursued their partner even after facing various difficulties.
One such person is Imran Tahir, who is now a crucial member of South Africa cricket team. But do you know that before playing for South Africa, Imran was a cricketer in Pakistan
Imran used to play for Pakistans under-19 cricket team in the late 1990s. During this time, he once visited South Africa for 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.
There he saw Sumayya Dildar, a South African model of Indian Origin, for the first time.
It was love at first sight for Imran. After their brief meeting in Durban, Imran returned to Pakistan. But his heart stayed in South Africa and he couldnt stop thinking about Sumayya all the time.
He finally left Pakistan for Sumayya and went to South Africa for pursuing her. After he spent considerable time wooing her, Sumayya agreed to marry Imran but under one condition  that she will not leave South Africa.
So Imran decided to move to South Africa for his love, and left Pakistan in 2006. Imran continued to play cricket there, and after playing domestic cricket for 5 years, he finally got entry in South Africas international team in 2011. And after that he never looked back. - TY

Role of Catholics in Independence struggle
On February 4, Sri Lanka celebrates the 70th anniversary of Independence. This year also marks the 200 years of Uva - Wellassa Rebellion of 1818 which paved the way for future struggles to free Ceylon from the clutches of the British Empire. Hence, to say that no blood was shed to win independence from the British Raj is far from the truth.
Perusing the pages of Ceylons struggle to win independence from being a British colony, one could see well that we have failed to give credit where it is due. At the same time, we note that there is something lacking in showing our gratitude to the present generation of the Wellassa people on our part as Sri Lankans.
It is downright ungratefulness that we totally ignore the sacrifices our forefathers made to free the country ever since Ceylon became a colony, with the signing of the infamous Upcountry Treaty on March 2, 1815.
It is also remarkable that Sri Lanka, ever since the day we won Independence, thanks to the 20th century generation, the new generation shows no gratitude to the Catholic/Christian contribution made to win Independence.
But the history is full of stories of their contribution and bringing all citizens irrespective of their ethnicity and difference of faith and belief, to rally round to be a part of the Independence movement.
The Movement for Independence, though political, was claimed to be a very peaceful one. This is because by nature, Sri Lankans are non- aggressive, but firm in their commitment for a cause they aspire and give leadership.
We were a colony under the British Empire for nearly 150 years with the signing of the Treaty on March 2, 1815. The influence of the militant struggle in India reflected well in the Sri Lankan soil and moved the less militant masses to join hands to fight for independence by convincing the British not by waging war but by impressive communication, exchange of ideas, acting with a clever brain and pragmatism.
Some claim that although we won independence, we were a dominion of the British Empire/ Commonwealth until May 22, 1972, where we ended our dominion state and declared our country as the Republic of Sri Lanka. But one must not forget that we were able declare ourselves a Republic, because with Independence, we had the right to freedom of thought, freedom to choose our own government to rule and even to decide the future course of action.
Therefore, we must not make the mistake of saying that the independence given, was for nothing. This is one way of demeaning the efforts made by that generation.
The year 1915 incident moved the people with strong commitment to fight for freedom. The incident was the declaration and imposing of the brutal British law of shooting the Buddhist Sinhalese at site as if stray dogs. The initiative to protest against this barbaric law was taken by the Catholics/ Christians. There was a strong protest against that draconian law imposed here and expressing their strong views, they demanded a Royal Commission to be set up to look into that incident. The proposal came along with the expressing of strong views by Edmund Joseph Samarawickrama, a lawyer by profession, against the British army. He was an ardent Catholic and was conscious and concerned about the way the British treated the Buddhists. But his name is hardly being heard.
A person of his caliber, a man of fearless service to his country and fellowmen created the atmosphere for the emergence of future Lanka Jathika Sangamaya. Catholics of this country feel hurt that their contribution is hardly mentioned. Yet, those who are appreciative of the service and role played by the Catholics, bow their heads when they hear that the Catholics were the guiding stars and pioneers at the preliminary stages of the freedom struggle.
Catholics of that period joined hands with others seeking no favours whatsoever but were moved by the sole purpose of bringing all to the forefront in fighting for Independence. There was an eye opening series published by the magazine Doothya a Catholic publication, and thanks to Stephen Silva, unearthed the facts hidden to enlighten those ignorant.
The others along with Samarawickrama included M. A. Arul Ananda, Edwin Wijerathne from Kegalle, Catholic historian John M. Senevirathne, and Edward Thimothy (E.T.) de Silva, the brother of M.C.de Silva Queens Counsel, who was the one and only Sri Lankan to have held a post in the Privy Council. E.T.De Silva was honoured by Ponnambalam Ramanadan and called de Silva, the Brilliant Star of the political sky of Ceylon.
He was also responsible of publishing Janathaava magazine to educate and awaken those in slumber. Undoubtedly, he remains a shining example to those keen to serve the masses. Sir James Peiris, James de Silva Wijerathne, E.W. Perera, Dr. S.C.de S. Wijerathne, C.J.C. de Silva, Dr. A W. P. Jayatilleke, W.W. Joseph Fernando , Lionel de Silva and Dr Lionel de Fonseka are among those Catholics and Christians who did much to win Independence.

Seventy years of freedom
Seventy years is a life time, a long time in the life of a person and the history of a nation. Tomorrow, Sri Lanka crosses the Rubicon of 70 years since independence. This is a historic milestone at a time when national unity is needed more than ever.
Year 1948 will forever be etched in annals as the year in which Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, was finally liberated from 400 years of Portuguese, Dutch and British colonialism. While no blood was indeed shed in the final act of gaining independence, it was a long, hard struggle that saw many heroes sacrifice their lives. From Weera Puran Appu to Keppetipola, these valiant heroes made independence a reality at the cost of their lives. The British labelled most of them as traitors, which was removed only in 2016 on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena. We should forever be grateful to these heroes who made the supreme sacrifice.
Nor should we forget the efforts of modern-day crusaders for independence, including D.S. Senanayake, F.R. Senanayake, D.R. Wijewardene (the founder of this newspaper, which turned 100 on January 3), Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Anagarika Dharmapala, C.W.W. Kannangara, T.B. Jayah, Edward Henry Pedris, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam and Lion of Kotte Edward Walter Perera. Most strikingly, these heroes represented all communities and religious groups in Sri Lanka. The independence movement brought everyone together to achieve a common goal. It is therefore unfathomable why we could not keep this momentum after gaining independence. Sri Lanka was second only to war-battered Japan in terms of economic prowess and social progress when it gained independence 70 years ago. Today, many of our Asian neighbours who were experiencing abject poverty then have overtaken us by leaps and bounds.
The crux of the matter is that in the years that followed independence, many of our leaders succumbed to insular politics and divisive racism in order to appease their political bases. This led the country down a ruinous path that ultimately exploded in the conflict in the North and the East, hampering development and social progress and consuming countless young lives from all communities for nearly 30 years. Moreover, successive Governments had neglected the aspirations of the youth, which resulted in two insurrections in the Southern parts of the country. We can probably recover from these calamitous events in terms of the economic cost, but there is no index or mechanism to measure the sheer social impact of these conflicts. Other Asian leaders who saw Sri Lankas slide into ethnic division were quick to ensure unity and reconciliation in their own lands. Hence multi-ethnic countries such as Singapore and Malaysia prospered while we fought among ourselves, brother against brother.
Today, almost ten years after the resolution of the conflict, our collective task as a nation is to ensure that we do not ever again relive those dark days. In President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, we have two leaders who are committed to foster national unity and ethnic reconciliation not just by word but also by deed. Under their guidance, the Government has made ethnic reconciliation a priority issue. We should remember the past, but now it is time to move on for the sake of our future generations.
Investing in the future is essential for an emerging nation such as ours, where the majority of the population is young. Just one week from now, citizens will get an opportunity to give the youth of this country an opportunity to serve and develop their respective towns and villages. Indeed, democracy is the common thread that has bound our Governments together  even at the height of Northern and Southern insurgencies, our democratic institutions and structures stood resilient.
At 70, Sri Lankans can be proud that theirs is one of the few developing countries offering free education for children and youth and free healthcare for all. Sri Lanka has some of the most impressive health, education and social indices in the developing world, which sometimes match or even exceed the statistics pertaining to the developed world. There is also no discrimination against girl children in Sri Lanka. The rest of the world watched with envy as Sri Lanka produced the worlds first woman Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1960.
There was a dark period when Sri Lanka was isolated by the rest of the world, but now it engages with the international community on equal terms. Diplomacy, trade and tourism have further integrated Sri Lanka into the global village. However, the next 70 years will prove to be even more challenging. The Vision 2025 programme now being implemented will address many of these including economic progress, infrastructure, environment, renewable energy, education, health, industry, transport and agriculture. Our Armed Forces which vanquished terrorism locally must be further strengthened to face the emerging challenge of global terrorism.
Sri Lankas biggest asset is her people, but it faces the daunting task of forging a truly Sri Lankan identity that still recognizes unity in diversity. The proposed new Constitution should be the starting point for this journey that will reinforce our freedom.

Just hours after Australian Open final defeat:
Simona Halep admitted to hospital with 'severe dehydration'
Simona Halep was admitted to hospital with 'severe dehydration' just hours after her Australian Open final defeat by Caroline Wozniacki last Saturday.
The Romanian runner-up was in hospital over-night and was treated for around four hours before being released on Sunday morning, according to reports.
A picture, released by ESPN in the early hours of Sunday, showed Halep lying in her hospital bed with a drip attached to her arm as she recovered.
This comes following her gruelling encounter with Wozniacki in the Melbourne heat on Saturday, in which she lost in three sets.
Medical timeouts were called by both finalists at the Rod Laver Arena on the weekend as Wozniacki held her nerve to win 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 in two hours and 49 minutes.
Halep, 26, who spent almost 12 hours on court through her first six rounds, struggled in the difficult conditions against Wozniacki due to the blazing heat felt in Melbourne Park.
Halep called a medical timeout at 2-3 in the second set to have her blood pressure taken because she was feeling ill in the 30 degrees temperature.
And after romping home to the second set with renewed purpose as the Dane lost some of her focus, the hard-fought final was then stopped for 10 minutes, under WTA heat rules, allowing for the players to regroup.
The authorities at the Australian Open decided to shut the roof for the men's final between Roger Federer and Marin Cilic on Sunday.

Sreesanth moves SC to appeal against life ban by BCCI
S Sreesanth was acquitted of all fixing charges by a special court in Delhi in 2016. However, the BCCI continued to impose the life ban on him in spite of his repeated request to revoke it. Thus, now the former Indian speedster has approached the Supreme Court in this matter.
This week Sreesanths lawyer put forward his appeal in front of the Chief Justice of India. He has agreed to hear the case on the 5th of February. The Kerala High Court had earlier in October ordered him to stay away from all the cricket activities conducted by the BCCI. Sreesanth has hence challenged the courts decision at the apex court.
The petition claimed that since his ban was revoked by the Single Judge bench of the High Court he shouldve been allowed to play. However, the Division Bench refused to do a judicial review of the BCCIs decision and hence he has filed the petition.
Sreesanth was of the view that as a cricketer, he had the right live with dignity and reputation. He asserted it as a fundamental right of any sportsman. Thus he wants the decision of life ban on him imposed by the BCCI to be reviewed by the bench.
Sreesanth was a part of the World Cup winning team during 2011. Thus the whole world was shocked as he was charged with corruption activities in the Indian Premier League during the 2013 season. Representing the Rajasthan Royals back then, he was accused of spot-fixing.
The BCCI slapped him with a life ban in 2015 as Sreesanth never played competitive cricket ever since 2013. Recently, while he was freed of all charges, the BCCI has refused to lift his ban. He has even requested the Supreme Court to reveal the names in the closed envelope. There were 13 names in the envelope that were indicted by the Mudgal committee for corruption. The names have been confidential for a long time as the court has refused to reveal them in public. Hence, it remains to be seen if there is an appeal as such.  CT

Sri Lanka to become founding member of Solar Alliance
Sri Lankan High Commissioner in India Chitranganee Wagiswara signed the Framework Agreement of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) on January 31 at the External Affairs Ministry of India in New Delhi.
The signed documents were handed over to Joint Secretary (Investments, Technology Promotion and Energy Security Division) Nagaraj Naidu of the External Affairs Ministry of India.
Once the Agreement is ratified, Sri Lanka will become a founding member of the International Solar Alliance, the Sri Lankan High Commission in New Delhi stated in a press release.
With a view to spearheading the UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/36/193 in 1981, which underlined the need for cooperation among developing countries and the mobilization of financial resources for new and renewable resources of energy and subsequent to the 2002 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development, many advocacy organisations were set up, primarily to disseminate knowledge on Renewable Energy, making it a priority area in the future agenda of all countries. The Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of November 30, 2015 stressed on the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology and to mobilize over USD $ 1000 billion investments required by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy and pave the way for future technologies as well, the release added. In this context, the ISA was conceived as a coalition of solar resource rich countries to address their special energy needs and to provide a platform to collaborate on addressing and identifying issues through an agreed common approach. The ISA will provide solar resources rich countries, lying fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to the people.
The objective of the ISA is to cooperate closely with its members and strive towards establishing mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and with non-member countries, the release stated.

Towards a clean city
We should be ashamed that almost 25 percent of the 5,252 constituents of the Cinnamon Gardens ward do not have proper housing even today, SLFP candidate for the Cinnamon Garden ward Pradip Jayewardene told the Daily News.
Cinnamon Gardens is considered the area where Sri Lankas elite live. Even to this day, there are a few colonial mansions still standing within the ward.
Pradeep is the grandson of Sri Lankas first Executive President, Junius Richard Jayewardene. J. R., as he was fondly referred to even to this day, was the leader of the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lankas Prime Minister from 1977 to 1978 and Executive President for two terms from February 4, 1978 to January 2, 1989.
However, Jayewardene is Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) candidate for the Cinnamon Gardens ward of the Colombo Municipal Council at the upcoming Local Government polls.
About 25 percent of the constituents in Cinnamon Gardens that deserve better housing are lower middle class wage earners and are an essential part of the Cinnamon Gardens community as they are the service providers. I believe that they should not be relocated but be provided with modern housing and better facilities. They lose their livelihood when they are relocated. I have seen this happen in other areas, he said.
Traffic is another problem that needs attention.
To provide essential services within walking distance is a solution that many other countries have adopted to ease this problem. As you know Cinnamon
Gardens was mainly a residential area a few decades ago, but with the unplanned and chaotic development of Colombo 7, the many high rise buildings coming up are also disrupting the neighborhood, he added.
Isnt the reason obvious Jayewardene quipped, when asked why he had distanced himself from the political party his grandfather led and joined the SLFP - the UNPs main rival prior to 2015.
It is because, for the past 20 years or so, the UNP has gradually deviated from the partys original principles and conservative values. The ideology of the UNP is betrayed today. I consider myself fortunate that I am not with the UNP now, he added.
The open economy system introduced by my grandfather is not a problem as long as you keep control of your resources such as land and other key sectors which are being handed over to foreigners now.
Cinnamon Gardens has been a UNP stronghold, but I am confident that the people will vote for the candidate who could resolve their problems the best on February 10.
Its time the constituents of Cinnamon Gardens elect a clean citizen for a Clean City! said Pradip Jayewardene.

Vaticans delicate China mission runs into trouble
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis is facing a complex row over the Vatican's warming ties with Communist China, which have sparked a new war of words with a Hong Kong cardinal and growing bitterness among some Chinese faithful.
Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic relations in 1951, and although ties have improved in recent years as China's Catholic population has grown, they remain at odds over which side has the authority to ordain bishops.
The Vatican relaunched long-stalled negotiations three years ago and now seems to be nearing concrete steps towards solving the major stumbling bloc of how to designate bishops.
But the issue has flared up again after two underground Chinese bishops, recognised by the Pope, were asked by a top Vatican diplomat to resign in favour of state-sanctioned prelates, including one who was ex-communicated by the Vatican in 2011.
The news was first reported in January by the Vatican-linked AsiaNews website and since confirmed by Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of semi-autonomous Hong Kong, who is a staunch opponent of any rapprochement between the Vatican and Beijing.
Do I think that the Vatican is selling out the Catholic Church in China Yes, definitely, Zen said in an open letter on Monday, adding that the Communist government had introduced harsher regulations limiting religious freedom.
The Vatican's number two, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, did not deny the disagreement in a post on the Vatican Insider website, but said that the Hong Kong rebel was only expressing a personal point of view and was in no way a spokesman for Chinese Catholics.
Zen said he had appealed to the pope in a private meeting earlier this month in Rome, where he delivered a letter from one of the bishops who was asked to step aside, Peter Zhuang Jianjian.
The cardinal also indicated in his statement that the Pope, who has sought to improve ties with China, was not in agreement with his mediator in Beijing -- a claim which prompted a terse denial from the Vatican.
For Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state, there does not exist two churches in China, but two communities of the faithful calling for a gradual path towards reconciliation and unity.
China's roughly 12 million Catholics are divided between a government-run association, whose clergy are chosen by the Communist Party, and an unofficial church which swears allegiance to the Vatican.
The secretive negotiations between the two sides could come down to the Vatican recognising some of the bishops chosen by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association in exchange for a more benevolent attitude from Beijing.
The last word on nominations for future bishops could be given to the pope, following the suggestion of the China's underground Catholic authorities.
