SAITM issue: SLMC failed to show up for talks with President
Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had not showed up for any of the discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena relating to the issues of granting provisional registrations for medical graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Three meetings were held by President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the SAITM issue but a written letter was sent by SLMC on the third meeting session stating that they will not attend any meeting until they receive a response from the Supreme Courts for their appeal, Kiriella said.
The Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Education and Highways Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
Minister Kiriella also said that the Government could not solve this issue without the support of the SLMC.
Referring to a series of strikes conducted in line with the SAITM issue,the Minister further said that during previous regimes, strikes were conducted to ensure the execution of court orders even though a new culture had been created so as to conduct strikes against Court orders.

Agreement with China, SLs only option: Amaraweera
The government has to enter into an agreement with China for the development and completion of the next stage of the Hambantota Port because it could not raise the investment of $ 600 million needed for it on its own, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera. He said, however, steps would be taken to ensure that this agreement would not create any adverse impact on Sri Lanka.
He said this amount needed to be invested if the section of port already completed was to be utilised for port operations. Now there was a proposal to reduce the term of the lease from 198 to 99 years and discussions were on to seek the possibility of a further reduction of the lease term. Amaraweera stated this when he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates at their respective temples in Kandy and received their blessings yesterday.
Amaraweera who was accompanied by Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake and Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, said $ 600 million amounted to a little over half the investment already made on the Hambantota Port construction work.
The earlier stipulation in the agreement was that Sri Lanka should pay China the full value of the port if it was to take over its ownership after 99 years. Discussions were also necessary to seek further concessions on these terms of payment too.
He said the SLFP had never deviated from its stand of opposing privatisation or sale, but certain people were carrying out false propaganda against the party for political gain.
He said President Sirisena had categorically stated that the pre-eminent position given to Buddhism would be retained in any new Constitution and that foreign judges would not be allowed to sit in a local panel investigating human rights violations. The guarantee given by the President about the Hambantota Port too was now taking shape and he would request people to believe the President's word.

SLMC should clearly outline minimum standards for medical education: Kiriella
Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) has not clearly outlined the minimum standards for medical education although it accuses the private medical college in Malabe of failing to maintain minimum standards.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo, the Minister said the Government was looking forward to gazette the minimum standards in medical education and added the SLMC has the sole responsibility to decide on the minimum requirements.
The Government has no power to establish minimum standards in medical education. We have been requesting SLMC to establish minimum standards even during the previous regime but we still have not received any favourable response regarding that from SLMC. It is a barrier for the Government to proceed further to solve the issue related to granting provisional registration for medical graduates of SAITM, the Minister said.
Kiriella also said that Government has no right to close down SAITM since the legal system of Sri Lanka had accepted SAITM.

US withdraws funding for United Nations Population Fund
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley is overseeing potential funding cuts to the international body
The US has withdrawn funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an agency that promotes family planning in more than 150 countries.
The state department said the UNFPA "supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation".
This is the first of the promised cuts to US financial contributions to the UN by the Trump administration.
The UNFPA said it "regrets the decision" and has not broken any laws.
In total $32.5m (26m) in funds is being withdrawn for the 2017 financial year.
'Erroneous' claims
Earlier this year, President Trump reinstated a ban on US funding of any international organisation that provided any kind of abortion service or advice.
The Department of State referred to the presidential directive from January and a provision called the "Kemp-Kasten Amendment" in its statement on Monday.
"This determination was made based on the fact that China's family planning policies still involve the use of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation, and UNFPA partners on family planning activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for these coercive policies," the state department said.
The UNFPA calls those claims "erroneous" and that all of its work promotes the rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination.
With the support of the US, last year UNFPA says it was able to save the lives of thousands of women from dying during pregnancy and childbirth, prevent unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortions.
The BBC's Nada Tawfik in New York reports that the UN Population Fund has often been the target of conservative Republican administrations. President Ronald Reagan, as well as both of the Bush administrations withheld funding for the same reason.
The money that had been allocated to the UNFPA for the fiscal year 2017 will be "transferred and reprogrammed to the Global Health Programs account," the state department said.
The account will be used by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to support family planning, maternal and reproductive health activities in developing countries, it added.
