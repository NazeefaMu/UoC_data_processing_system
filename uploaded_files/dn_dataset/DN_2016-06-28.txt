Marsh powers  Aussies to  Tri-Nation win

Bridgetown, Barbados, Monday: Mitchell Marsh emerged as the unlikely bowling hero for Australia as the World Cup-holders defeated the West Indies by 58 runs in the final of the Tri-Nation One-Day International Series.
Set a challenging target of 271 after wicketkeeper Matthew Wades unbeaten 57 led an Australian lower-order revival from 173 for six to a final total of 270 for nine off 50 overs, Marsh claimed the prized wickets of Darren Bravo and Marlon Samuels, adding the scalp of opening batsman Johnson Charles for good measure to effectively short-circuit the home sides pursuit.
His disciplined medium-pacers realised miserly figures of three for 32 with the West Indies unable to recapture the impressive batting form of earlier matches in being dismissed for 212 off 45.4 overs at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Sunday.
Josh Hazlewood polished off the tail to finish with the best figures of five for 50, but it was Marshs spell that made the difference when it mattered most.
We really fought well tonight and I always felt we could defend that total, said victorious captain Steve Smith. Its just the way we play. We believe in ourselves and go hard at the opposition every time.
Charles topscored with 45 and featured in an encouraging opening partnership of 49 with Andre Fletcher.
They weathered the early assault from Mitchell Starc but it was fellow new ball bowler Hazlewood who prised out Fletcher in the 11th over of the innings.
Marsh, adjudged Man of the Match, then cemented Australias control of the match when he had Bravo caught behind, Samuels taken at short extra-cover and Charles leg-before within the space of ten runs.
At 72 for four and with the top batsmen gone, West Indies chances of victory had lurched into improbability, especially when leg-spinner Adam Zampa lured the big-hitting Kieron Pollard into hoisting a catch to long-off.
Like his Australian counterpart, Denesh Ramdin attempted to engineer a recovery. His captain, Jason Holder, dominated a 43-run stand in contributing 34 before falling to Nathan Coulter-Nile.
A couple big hits by Carlos Brathwaite then generated some excitement before he was bowled by Hazlewood and from that point on, the favourites closed out the match, Ramdin being eighth out for 40.
Hazelwood took the Man of the Series honours.
Ironically, it was Marshs dismissal to spinner Sulieman Benn in the 37th over that raised Caribbean hopes of upsetting the five-time World Cup-winners who were then in danger of being dismissed for under 200 and confounding Steve Smiths decision to bat first.
Yet Wade somehow managed to survive against his nemesis, mystery spinner Sunil Narine, and prospered against the seamers, crashing three sixes to complete a recovery that saw 97 runs added over the last 13 overs.
West Indies were hampered by the absence of Shannon Gabriel at the end of the innings with the tearaway fast bowler leaving the field after completing seven overs.
We missed having Shannon available at the end of the innings, Holder observed. I felt he was our best chance of knocking off their lower order.
His first four overs had proved expensive but Gabriel returned midway through the innings to account for Smith (46) and the dangerous Glenn Maxwell in the same over.
Aaron Finch led the charge at Gabriel with a robust knock of 47, his highest ODI score against the West Indies. He looked set for a big innings when a miscued heave off Pollard offered Samuels a simple catch on the square-leg boundary.
Holder returned in the midst of the lower-order rally to snare Coulter-Nile, however the captain appeared to have miscalculated his bowling options in only allowing Brathwaite eight of a possible ten overs. AFP

Dominant Royal beats  Wesley to enter semi-finals

Royal led 17-6 at half time.
Wesley shocked the spectators present as they drew first blood in the 3rd minute of play when off a turn over ball their fly half Mursheed Doray put over a brilliant 35-metre drop goal mid left to go into a 3-nil lead.
In the 4th minute off a scrum Royal set their line in motion where centre Janindu Dilshan foxed the Wesley defence and gave an off load to his winger Shabith Feroze who made the overlap and darted down for a brilliant try near the right corner flag. Ovin Askey missed the conversion and Royal took the lead 5-3.
Royal further increased their tally to 10-3 when in the 19th minute when off a rolling maul second row Ashen Fernando touched down for a try mid right. Askey once again missed the conversion.
In the 32nd minute Royal scored again when off a superb rolling maul hooker Azmir Fajudeen fell over for a try mid left. Askey was successful with the conversion and Royal led 17-3.
On the stroke of half time Wesley slotted a 30-metre penalty through scrum half Avishka Lee to make it 17-6 at the breather.
After resumption in the 51st minute Royal scored once more through Fajudeen off their famous rolling maul but Askey missed the conversion. Royal led 22-6.
Four minutes later off a five metre scrum Wesley prop forward Dayan Sabar crashed through for a try near the right upright. Avishka Lee made the conversion to cut the Royal led down to 22-13.
In the 61st minute, off another rolling maul Royal second row forward Harith Lokugamage fell over for a try near the left corner flag and the difficult touch line conversion was put over beautifully by Askey to increase the tally to 29-13.
Wesley again cut down the lead immediately when in the 75th minute their replacement fly half Mohomed Bahardeen fired across a neat 30 metre drop goal to take the score to 29-21.
In injury time off a sweeping three quarter move Wesley scored through replacement centre Dineru Ranaweera a brilliant try near the left corner flag after going through the entire Royal defence covering nearly 55 metres. Avishka Lee missed the difficult touch line conversion and scoreline read 29-21 in favour of Royal when the final whistle blew. - (WAI)

Leo Mexit leaves  Argentinian football in turmoil

Lionel Messis tearful decision to quit the international team left Argentinian football in turmoil Monday after a traumatic penalty shootout defeat to Chile in the Copa America final.
The heartbroken Barcelona superstar left the field in tears after missing a spot-kick in the shootout in the United States on Sunday -- Messis fourth straight defeat in a major final with Argentina.
For me the national team is over, the 29-year-old told reporters. Ive done all I can, Ive been in four finals and it hurts not to be a champion.
Its a hard moment for me and the team, and its difficult to say, but its over with the Argentina team.
Manchester City star Sergio Aguero warned that other players could also quit the national side.
We were all devastated in the dressing room, particularly Leo, Id never seen him in such a state, he said. Its likely that Messi wont be the only one to go into international retirement, said Aguero. Several players are wondering whether to continue. Its our toughest defeat to take.
Aguero did not say whether he would follow Messi in quitting but his name and that of Javier Mascherano were mentioned in media reports.
Dont go, Leo
Fans in Argentina did not want to believe that their superstar was quitting.
He will not leave -- you will see, said Ricardo Miranda, 47, a passerby in a rainy Buenos Aires on Monday morning.
It is really unfair. Messi played well. It was the coachs mistake to field injured players.
Messi and the squad were expected back in Buenos Aires later on Monday.
Fans on social media called on the superstar to change his mind with hashtags such as NotevayasLeo -- Dont go Leo -- and Messiquedate -- Messi stay.
Messis dramatic announcement followed Argentinas third loss in a major final in three years. They were beaten 1-0 by Germany in the final of the 2014 World Cup and lost on penalties, also to Chile, in the 2015 Copa America final. Messi also tasted defeat with Argentina in the final of the 2007 Copa America.
Record-breaker
Despite a glittering career that has seen him named FIFA World Player of the Year five times, Messi has faced persistent sniping from critics in Argentina.
Yet he received support on Sunday from Chiles victorious Argentine coach Juan Antonio Pizzi, who maintained that Messi is the best player ever.
As well as an admiration for Messi, Im driven very much by his numbers, Pizzi said of Messis record-breaking career.
Messis numbers are unmatched, and I dont think they will ever be matched because its impossible for a player to find the things that Messi finds.
While universally regarded as one of the greatest footballers ever, he has regularly been targeted for his inability to land a major title with Argentina. Messis failure to match the achievements of Diego Maradona, who single-handedly carried the team to victory in the 1986 World Cup, has often been held against him. Pizzi said comparisons with Maradona were unfair.
My generation cant compare him with Maradona, because of what Maradona did for Argentine soccer, Pizzi said. But it seems that the best player in history played in the United States. For me the numbers are impossible to argue with. Maradona has often taken potshots at Messi, criticizing him on the eve of the tournament.
Hes a really good person, but he has no personality, Maradona said. He lacks the character to be a leader.
Globe-trotting
Messis bombshell decision comes after a grueling season disrupted by injury last year.
He recovered to help Barcelona win the Spanish title once more and was relishing the prospect of leading Argentina at the Copa America Centenario.
His commitment to playing for Argentina was reflected in his decision to fly from Spain to Argentina for a low-key friendly against Honduras shortly before the tournament, where he suffered a back injury.
He returned to Spain to give evidence at his trial for tax fraud before jetting off to the United States to join up with his Argentina team-mates.
Although he was injured for his teams opening group game against Chile, he came on as a substitute in a 5-0 hammering of Panama to score a hat-trick in 19 minutes.
He then equaled Argentinas international goalscoring record of 54, held by Gabriel Batistuta, in the quarter-finals before setting a new mark with his 55th international goal in the semi-final win over the United States.
In Messis adopted home Barcelona, the press voiced surprise and sympathy.
Everything he has had with Barcelona, he has lacked with Argentina, said Catalan daily Sport.
In Barcelona, Messi is God. Not in Argentina. AFP

Sri Lanka still option for Pakistan home series

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that hosting the countrys series in Sri Lanka was still an option.
We have been holding home games in the UAE at three venues which are very good but very expensive too. This is what led us to explore the possibility of playing these games in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh, said Shaharyar in an interview.
He said that Sri Lanka were very gracious in entertaining this request but the problem in relation to the West Indies series was that those games would coincide with the monsoons and so most of the matches would have been in danger of being effected by rain.
This is why we decided that we will pay the extra sum and continue to hold our home series in the UAE, at least for the series against the West Indies, he said.
He, however, added: We can play our home series in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh in future. England is another option. We did play there in 2010 against Australia.
