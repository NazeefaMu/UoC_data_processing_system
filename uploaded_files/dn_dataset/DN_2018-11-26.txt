Emotional and excited  Healy & Co bask in WT20 glory
For some, it was pretty emotional, Megan Schutt couldnt hold back my tears, while Alyssa Healy was just really proud after Australia won the WT20 2018 final.
It was all rather one-sided in the end, as one can expect from an Australian side going at full throttle.
England opted to bat first, but only Danni Wyatt (43) and Heather Knight (25) got into double figures at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua as Ashleigh Gardner led a stunning bowling effort. She got 3/22, Schutt and Georgia Wareham picked up two each, and England folded for 105.
Australia did lose star batter Healy and Beth Mooney early on but coasted to victory with 4.5 overs and eight wickets in hand as Gardner (33*) and captain Meg Lanning (28*) scored the big runs.
Despite Australia never really looking like their would lose, it was tough watching from the dugout.
Im a really bad watcher of cricket from the sidelines  no, the girls played beautifully tonight, and Im just really proud of the teams effort, said Healy, the Player of the Tournament.
For Wareham, still only 19 and already a world champion, its going to take time to realise just what she and her mates have achieved.
Its pretty unreal, hasnt really sunk in yet. But Im really proud of all the girls, well go an enjoy tonight. I think we were all counting (the runs) down, but we all trusted each other that wed get it done in the end. But yeah, there were certainly some nerves down in the bench, she admitted.
Mooney has been an outstanding foil to the free-scoring Healy at the top of the order, and played her part in the win in the final.
Weve done really well this whole tournament, been really consistent, and it was a really clinical performance by the bowlers today and backed up by the batters. Ash came out and absolutely whacked it, made things awesome to watch from the sidelines, she reflected.
Delissa Kimmince, who has said again and again how lucky she feels to be a part of the playing XI, was emotional and ecstatic.
Its pretty emotional, to be honest. My journey through cricket has been pretty up and down, so to get out here and be a part of the starting XI  yeah, pretty emotional, but pretty excited, she said.
One of Australias outstanding performers has been Schutt, the pacer, who picked up 2/13 in the final to take her tournament tally to 10.
Pretty happy, Im trying to hold back my tears, she said immediately after the win.
And making the whole experience that much more fun was the noise from the crowd  the stands were packed and rocking, like much of the tournament.
Its pretty hard to hear Meg out there, but its a pretty good distraction, joked Schutt. I love noise and all that sort of stuff, so works well for me. But I think the crowds turning out has been fantastic for womens cricket.

Freshwater fish production to mark 352,000 MT by 2025
National Aquatic Resources Development Authority sources said the authority will produce 90,000 MT of freshwater in 2018 and 157,000 MT in next year. By 2025, 352,000 MT will be caught, they said.
The Fisheries, Aquatic Resources and Rural Economy Development Ministry has launched two major freshwater fish harvesting projects called Diyawara Piyasa and Wewak Samaga Gamak on the instruction of Minister Vijitha Vihayamuni Soyeza, the sources said.
The Diyawara Piyasa costs Rs. 185 million and it will provide fund for fisher folks to construct houses and improve the condition of their sanitary facilities.
Seventy two low income families were granted Rs. 21.45 million and each family will receive Rs. 100,000. Rs. 26.62 million will be provided to improve sanitary facilities.
Fisheries Ministry sources said Rs. 393 million will be granted to enhance living standards of fisher folk.
Anuradhapura District Aquatic Resources Development Officer S.D.C. Thusitha Kumara said 16,000 MT of freshwater fish will be produced in 2018. Forty-eight societies with 5,000 memberships exist in the district and many of them have no livelihoods.
Under Diyawara Piyasa, Auruwewa, Wahalkada, Rajangane, Mahawilachchiya and Kalaoya will be developed at a cost of Rs. 25 million. Rs. 3.6 million was granted to renovate houses and each family will get Rs. 30,000, he said.

Ranil has no right to occupy Temple Trees
Ranil Wickremesinghe has no right to occupy Temple Trees as he is not the Prime Minister anymore, President of the All Ceylon Farmers Convention, Provincial Council Member Namal Karunaratne said yesterday.
Wickremesinghe is only an MP now and should be held responsible for the disastrous situation in the country, Karunaratne said.
He was speaking at a press briefing held at Siyapatha Hotel Complex, Dambulla yesterday.
No one worries about Wickremesinghe losing the Prime Ministers post. No one took to the streets to protest against Wickremesinghe being removed from his post. People know the kind of damage that the Wickremesinghe government did to this country. The Wickremesinghe government imposed heavy taxes upon people to minimise the economic repercussions of the Treasury Bond Scam, Karunaratne said.
Parliament has become a circus, Karunaratne further said.

Speaker wants to be UNFs common candidate
Parliamentarian Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena yesterday said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is engaged in a desperate attempt to destabilise Parliament and the country, as he wishes to be the common candidate of the UNF.
He said the Speaker is attempting to implement the UNPs agenda in Parliament with a mala fide intention of becoming the common candidate of the UNF for the next Presidential Election.
The madness over the common candidacy had destabilised the country and Parliament too.
The conduct of the Speaker is an obstacle to the governments programme to provide relief to the people at the grassroots, he said.
Parliamentarian Navin Dissanayake had earlier announced that a UNP member would contest the next Presidential Election and later he said that the UNF will put forth a common candidate for the election.
Yapa Abeywardena said the ruling party members staged a walk out in protest of the Speakers decision with regard to the composition of the Select Committee which disregarded decades-old tradition.The Parliament of Sri Lanka had a tradition of appointing the majority of members from the ruling party to the Select Committee and it has been the practice for decades.
Seven out of 12 members of the Select Committee are appointed from political parties representing the ruling party as a tradition, Yapa Abeywardena said.
Speaking at a press conference in Battaramulla yesterday, Yapa Abeywardena added that the Parliament Select Committee comprised seven members from the ruling party when the number of members representing the ruling party was only 41 in 2015.
He added that the Speaker adopted a novel method when the vote on the composition of the Parliament Select Committee was taken.
The Speaker tried to increase the number of Parliamentarians supporting the Opposition after the vote was over. He waited for over 10 minutes until more members supported the Opposition, Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said that this was an unprecedented move by the Speaker.
Yapa Abeywardena added that this vote was taken only for the appointment of the Select Committee. The vote taken for the appointment of the Select Committee does not show that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has the majority in Parliament.
If the UNP really wants to show that Wickremesinghe has majority in Parliament, they should show it by giving the affidavits of 113 members, he said.
He added that the UNP-led Opposition always tried to show their majority when a vote is taken on other matters such as No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister and vote on the composition on the Parliament Select Committee.
They show reluctance to express support for former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with affidavits, he said.
Yapa Abeywardena added that the Speaker agreed to follow the Presidents instructions first, but later deviated from instructions at the behest of several diplomatic missions based in Colombo.

Sri Lankas e-commerce segment records 34% growth
Visa International, says that Sri Lankas digital payment landscape has been registering a tremendous growth, due to more and more consumers choosing to shop on line and engage in e commerce.
According to Anthony Watson, Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives  Visa International, Sri Lanka has seen the e- commerce segment expand with a growth of 34% for year on year, as at July 2018.
This is mainly due to consumers wanting to adapt new technology and gaining a wider acceptance of digital payments; consumer confidence in the security of on line payments is also growing, Watson said adding that visa understands and is responsive to changing consumer behavior on line.
While digital payments have grown, embracing of new technology in face to face transactions has also become relevant for consumers as they seek faster, easier and more convenient forms of payments. Which is one of the key reasons why contactless cards have been well received by consumers who have experienced the convenience first hand,| he said.
All over the world, contactless cards are changing the financial environment, helping consumers go cashless; as the name suggests, contactless payment cards let users make payments with a mere tap at the PoS terminal.
In India, the Finance Ministry recently came out with a directive advising banks to issue Near-Field Communication (NFC)-enabled contactless credit and debit cards. Despite the Governments push on digital payments for a cashless India, the country remains highly cash dependent.
In Australia, researchers at the Reserve Bank of Australia found that around one-third of all PoS transactions were conducted using contactless cards in 2016, which is a 300 percent jump from 2013. Today, nearly 94 percent of transactions are contactless in Australia.
In order to make way for the widespread adoption of contactless cards in Sri Lanka, payment card providers like Visa are also swiftly upgrading their infrastructure, thereby increasing the touch points that accept such technologies.

Sarath Malalasekera
Epitome of gentility
Having read the fitting tribute to senior journalist Sarath Malalasekera published in the Daily News on November 19 , I considered it my duty to write this appreciation of our friend Sarath with whom my association commenced in 1981 when I was the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) ASP.
Ishara Jayawardane, in his write-up on Sarath, had presented a great tribute to him with relevant facts concerning the most respected court journalist covering the Judiciary, court proceedings and the police for over 42 years in the Daily News, as well as facts revealed during an interview with him.
Sarath was extremely honest and precise in his assertions that he always obtained hard facts and never provided wrong information on court proceedings or police investigations. He always said that the journalists could not add or deduct anything that was said in court, and that accuracy was the most important thing citing the facts contained in the B report filed by police to report the progress of investigations to courts.
I assert the fact that Saraths professionalism won him the admiration of the police; he worked closely with all police officers. Our relationship with him was founded on mutual respect, and he was honest in what he wrote and never presented incorrect facts in his reportings. He never distorted evidence to mislead the public and/or to attract public attention.
I may cite a few instances where Sarath proved his professional trust as a journalist, especially reporting matters concerning National Security. I was the CIDs DIG when I was grievously injured on December 18, 1999, when a female LTTE suicide cadre exploded herself targetting former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga at the final Presidential Election rally held at the Colombo Town Hall.
After surgery was performed on me, I was transferred to the Merchants Ward at the General Hospital, Colombo. I was directing an investigation from my hospital bed when the then CID Director Keerthi Gajanayake and other senior officers were briefing me on its progress. After the briefing was over, Sarath came to my room to check on me and ask about the progress of the investigation.
I informed him that the CID was successful in tracing the LTTE cell operating at Dehiwela and also tracing the shop called Aprakka Stores at Dehiwela town from where the red frock worn by the female suicide bomber at the time of the attack, was purchased. I requested him not to report any matter as it would disrupt the investigation and he agreed.
After the investigation was completed successfully, with the arrests of the suspects who transported the suicide kit from Vavuniya to a kovil at Kotahena, Sarath obtained details and published a detailed report in the Daily News. He thanked the CID for its efforts in arresting the Pusari at the kovil and his wife for planning the attempted assassination of the former President.
Another case was the attack on the Bandaranike International Airport (BIA) on July 23, 2001. The CID traced the safe house of the LTTE at Kattuwa in Negombo by analysing calls taken from a mobile phone. A private telephone company assisted the CID to conduct the analysis of the calls taken by LTTE cadres planning the attack from the safe house.
The CID also traced a mini bus in which a group of suicide cadres travelled to the Raj Fernando playground situated close to the Air Force Camp in Katunayake. Sarath contacted me to obtain the progress of the investigation; I informed him of the progress and requested him not to report anything until the suspects were arrested after mounting surveillance around the safe house.
On completion of the investigation, with the arrest of suspects and the recovery of the suicide kits, cyanide capsules and T50 rifles from the safe house, Sarath obtained details and published the report.
We salute Sarath for his professionalism as a highly-principled journalist, especially when reporting on police investigations into sensitive matters related to national security.
I am personally aware of the intensity of his involvement in exceedingly useful social work and altruism. He was the epitome of gentility.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!
Punya de Silva, Former DIG

Bakthika Simon
A brilliant scholar
It is with profound sorrow that I pen these few lines as a tribute to our ever-loving friend Bakthika Hemasiri Simon of Rajapihilla Mawatha, Kandy.
Bakthi, or Pat, as he was affectionately addressed by all his relatives and close friends, had been a beacon that illuminated the lives of all those who were close to him. His untimely departure from this world has plunged us all into an abyss of darkness.
Writing a tribute of Pat is not an easy task because there are so many things to disclose. To summarise, one could say he had all the good qualities a great person should have, such as intelligence, wisdom, kindness, charisma and above all else, a large heart full of compassion. Our Pat had all these qualities and many more.
He was a product of Mahinda college, Galle and St. Sylvesters collage, Kandy. Although he had studied Science subjects at the school, his knowledge of other subjects were astonishingly wide. He was well versed in literature, sociology, philosophy, history, geography, religion, world affairs and a host of many more subjects. He could easily speak for hours, either on simple gardening or space science with equal proficiency.
Once we had an opportunity to meet a university don from a Western country. Using his eloquent language skills, Pat made a superb description of our ancient kings and the nature of elephants in Sri Lanka. No presenter in radio or television could ever match his proficiency. When departing, the guest told me, Your friend is a walking encyclopaedia and you are so lucky to have a such a scholar friend. My face beamed with pride and pleasure because we all knew that pat was a brilliant scholar to the core.
His door was always open to anybody who sought his help. I have seen hundreds of people of all walks of life coming there to ask his assistance. Among them were schoolchildren who wanted to improve their knowledge of English language, professionals who wanted to get their documents translated into English, Government officials who were going abroad to attend seminars and conferences to get their country reports prepared, of which Pat was an expert. Whatever the work, he handled it meticulously.
He retired from the government service prematurely due to the fact that fate had cruelly robbed his eyesight. However, when he was working, his service was admired immensely by his superiors, colleagues, as well as the public. I was also retired by that time and hence, had many occasions to meet him. Whenever I visited him at his home, to my great amusement, he always used to say, Welcome to my humble abode. He always said that with a charismatic smile and an extended right hand.
When his eyesight was good, Pat had the habit of reading hundreds of books at a stretch; no one in our circle of friends could match him. Even after he became visually handicapped, his thirst for information never ceased. He used to ask his family members and friends to read articles from newspapers and magazines. Apart from that, he was a keen listener of radio and television broadcasts.
After he lost his vision completely, he realised what a pathetic life a blind man had to spend. Henceforth, Pat sacrificed all his assets to give at least a ray of sunshine to blind people. He rendred yeoman service to the blind community in and around Kandy; Pat organised health camps for blind children, devising a scheme to provide them assistance with Braille typewriters, special recording equipment, special software for their computers, as well as cellular phones.
Furthermore, on Pats request, one kindhearted lady recorded textbooks and many other reading materials for such students. Pat became overjoyed to learn that some of these blind children who received his help were able to enter universities for higher education.
He then started raising funds to purchase special electronic equipment that were useful for blind people who often visited the Braille section of the D.S. Senanayake Memorial Library. I have seen many blind persons using this special computers to do their work. Of late, some of his relatives and friends who live abroad sent him a hoard of English audio books (talking books) which are now popular in America and Europe.
Later on, the kindhearted lady friend volunteered to record Sinhala novels and short stories for him and once again, he was able to talk for hours on current Sinhala literature and other such subjects as he did in the old days. Pat had the habit of talking to many authors about recording their books for the use of blind people. Almost all the authors were happy to hear that blind persons were also using their books. A famous novelist had even donated their new books for this recordings.
Pats most remarkable achievement was to introduce these audio books to the Braille section of the D.S. Senanayake Momorial Library in Kandy. Visually-handicapped persons who visited the library were overjoyed to receive this unexpected gift. There is a big demand for audio books. By word of mouth, many blind persons came to know that there are hundreds of audio books in the Braille section of the library. Requests soon flooded from visually-handicapped people who lived in distant places such as Ampara, Polonnaruwa, Badulla and Matara. As you could upload about 15 novels to one pen drive, those persons could use that for months.
Other friends of his who lived abroad had sent a large number of compact discs and pen drives to him. However, purchasing special envelopes to post them to those who live far away, as well as the postage, was borne by Pat using his personal funds. Such was his magnanimity.
It was a moving scene to observe that a large number of visually-handicapped persons who came to pay their last respects to him lamenting around his casket as if they had lost a close relative.
Setting a good example, Pat, in his last will, had asked his wife and son to donate his remains to the Peradeniya Universitys Medical Faculty. His death created a vacuum for all alike.
After he became visually handicapped, his loving wife Pushpa looked after him like a mother who cares for her only child. His son Umanga was the apple of his eye.
To have such a noble friend is indeed a greatest blessing that I had ever received. I firmly wish that during our sojourn in this Sansara, that I may able to meet my great friend again and again!

N.B. Amarasinghe
He lived an exemplary life
Nawaratne Bandara Amarasinghe, who served as a Registrar at the University of Kelaniya, passed away on January 31, 2013. This is in appreciation of his irreplaceable service to the university, as well as for his social contributions. He was born in Kegalle, Mawanella on November 24, 1940.
After receiving his primary education at the Galapitamada Maha Vidyalaya, Kegalle, he received his secondary education from St. Annes College, Kurunegala. Thereafter, he entered the University of Sri Jayewardenepura in 1967 and earned a BA Honours degree in Archaeology in 1970. After finishing higher his education, he served at the Department of Archaeology for a short period.
In 1973, he joined the University of Kelaniya as an Assistant Registrar and rendered a yeoman service prior to taking up the posts of Senior Assistant Registrar and then Registrar in 1990. After retiring, he was a Council Member of the Ruhuna University and later joined the same University as a Visiting Lecturer in Archaeology.
His field of teaching was Numismatics, which is one of the rarest and most significant areas of Archeology. Amarasinghe was a popular Visiting Lecturer among the students who followed the Numismatics course at the University of Kelaniya.
He lived an exemplary life as a Registrar, preserving both the administrative and human qualities that many officers and certain laymen in society lack.
In his honour, I wish to remind how he supported all who were at the University, starting with the Vice-Chancellor, the teaching and non-teaching staff, and particularly, the students. He supported others when a person was met with problems.
After retirement, he carried out a remarkable service to develop the Welfare Society at St. Jude Lane Dalugama, Kelaniya, where he spent a benevolent life until his demise.
Loving kindness, charismatic leadership, philanthropy and audaciousness were some of his qualities, which everybody in society should stick to.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Wimal AmArasekera
Honest and down-to-earth
November 18, 2018 marks the 25th death anniversary of veteran public servant Wimal Amarasekera, who among his many an important posting, occupied the stewardship of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority for over 10 years since its inception in 1979.
The name Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the name of its first Chairman are interwoven and port employees who talk about their days at the Port still remember him as an unmatched personality who commanded high respect.
Born at Imaduwa in the Southern Province as the second son of an estate field officer, Amarasekera received his education at Telijjawila Central College and later at Royal College, Colombo, before he entered the Peradeniya University.
Having graduated comparatively at a very young age, he successfully sat the Ceylon Civil Service Examination.
Those were the days when only six were recruited in a year to that prestigious service as compared with the several hundreds now recruited annually to the Ceylon Administrative Service, which replaced the former Ceylon Civil Service.
As a member of that elite service, Amarasekera had the good fortune to work in the early years of his public service career in provincial administration, initially as a government agent in the newly-carved-out district of Moneragala and later, in Jaffna.
These assignments enabled him to work closely with people at a grassroots level, and to be intimately involved in numerous development projects launched for the improvement of living conditions of the rural folk, who speak of fond memories of him even now.
On completion of his term in Jaffna, Amarasekera was hand-picked by then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike to be the Colombo Government Agent, a position considered to be the pinnacle of provincial administration.
He served in this position till 1977 when he left for France on a scholarship offered by that government to do his postgraduate studies.
On his return to the island, he served as the Ceynor Foundation Chairman for a brief period. When the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was established in 1979 with the amalgamation of three institutions, a government department and two state corporations, the Minister in charge, Lalith Athulathmudali, invited his Royal College buddy Wimal Amarasekera to head to the new organisations.
It was no easy task in bringing nearly 18,000 employees belonging to hundred-odd categories and trades with different salary structures under a single unified administrative set up.
Problems were many, however, Amarasekera was able to accomplish the task within a short period with no heartburn to any sector of employees. Such was the astute administrative ability of this distinguished public servant.
It is no exaggeration that during his 10-year stewardship in the organisation, the Colombo Port developed into a formidable transshipment hub in the region, making it a major contributor to the national economy. People still say that Amarasekeras period was the golden era of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Amarasekera was a technocrat by training and inclination, but he never overlooked the human element when making a decision or analysing an issue. He was approachable by all levels of personnel at all times and was courteous and considerate to everyone. His gentle manner, honesty and integrity, as well as down-to-earth simplicity, were features one would not forget.
Memories of people of outstanding qualities and human values remain in ones memory for a long time. Amarasekera was such an outstanding person. On his 25th death anniversary, we remember him with utmost respect and gratitude.

## Title: Are we doing politics right

Are we doing politics right
Let the clearest and the most straightforward answer be NO, not at all! The series of recent shocking incidents that put the entire country in dismay and tarnished further the international image of this precious pearl of the Indies are most unfortunate and disgusting. The fact that this pandemonium finally raged in the very sanctuary of democracy, the Parliament of peoples representatives, is indeed cause for greater worry and anxiety. There had been many a faulty step taken which ignited this national drama of chaos and disorder never seen before in the history of this beloved country. An almost unbeatable challenge faces us as we struggle to rise from the dust of this political scenario.
Whose responsibility
At whose feet should we lay this national tragedy that has overtaken and tsunamied us in total inundation It is of course national politics but one which involves both the politicians who have mismanaged the national affairs and made themselves unworthy of peoples trust but also the masses at large and the citizens who due to their immaturity and short-sightedness in many ways have in their fool-hardiness allowed themselves to be deceived and duped by politicians who were crafty and most noted for greed for power and self-aggrandizement. National politics, it would seem is no more that noble profession of public service to the people but a wild arena where dishonest politicians look for prey and amass wealth and position.
Why should people allow politics to degrade into such miserable depths and allow themselves at the same time to become purely passive pawns in this dirty game of warring factions
When will the masses have political figures who can speak the truth, take care of the peoples urgent needs and govern with honesty, integrity filled with love and compassion for the people, especially for the most vulnerable and poor  those without food, clothing and shelter, the farmers, the fishermen, the daily laborers, the rural folk in the distant villages and the lower middle-class Do they genuinely open their ears to the desperate cry of the people Instead of feeding them, are they feeding on them, wasting the tax-payers money in banquets, travel and bankrupting the Parliament In which case they are not true servants of the people.
Politics continue unfortunately even today in this country to provide the battleground for those vying for power and no more a hallowed space to engage in work for progress and prosperity of the people. The last seventy years, since the historical break-away orchestrated by the SWRD movement, there had been sifting sands of politics swinging from UNP to SLFP till the Free-economy time of JRJ. Intermingling with the powers that be intruded the leftist and Marxist elements in the arena with MEP coming into the fray. The period of Dudley Senanayake was very unstable.
After the economics of Free Trade and being open to foreign investment policies we witnessed the booming through FTZs. Then came in the emergence of political violence that continued into the 1980s and political thuggery and marketing of politicians in the national scene. All these negative trends weakened seriously the democratic way of elections and life for the people. With the eruption of the ethnic war that lasted three long decades in Sri Lankas recent history, more problems and challenges were added to the countrys life. The war did lot of damage to the country both economically, socially and internationally. Had the war not taken place, perhaps the millions that were dumped on armaments, maintaining the armed forces, their security and other needs, could have been fruitfully invested on making the economy grow in terms of improving the standard of living, national health and transport, winning foreign direct investments, thus enriching the national economy, strengthening foreign reserves and raising the quality of life for the ordinary citizens. On many of these occasions, education policies could not be maintained in a consistent manner.
There were also disruptions in the universities which continue almost daily even today. Enough of blunders were made in the education sector. Skills training was at a minimum. Hundreds of university graduates who came out were stranded in the streets in frustration due to no job-opportunities. Student Unions continuously agitated, thus disrupting universities and their academic programmes.
Historical antecedents
Into the decade of 1990s intruded all the many imaginable political forms of bribery and corruption. Many politicians failed the people who elected them to their office. There had been a brazen lack of accountability, transparency, honesty and truthfulness in the way ministers went about handling their respective jobs. Although Leftist and radically Marxist trends weakened, a polarization clearly marked the elections and the way governments swung between the two major parties of the UNP and the SLFP. Losing the two-thirds majority, which sometimes governments in power abused, major parties began entering into coalitions that proved to be very fragile. While this instability weakened national politics, economic stagnation and war crimes charges began sending shockwaves across the nation. These two same problems are posing a serious threat to the countrys future even at the moment. There is a political impasse that seems to defy any possible solution and national politics is embroiled in a huge mess that gets complicated by the hour.
The recent repeated scenes of pandemonium in the most hallowed sanctuary of democracy, the national Parliament, are symptomatic of the depth of confusion that bewilders every concerned citizen. Every one blames the other for chaos that has affected national politics. Our international image is getting further tarnished with the way that democracy is being wounded and violated by our representatives. There had been mayhem that held all right-thinking citizens at dismay and in a state of severe shock and utter despair. This status-quo cannot continue any longer and must end immediately with right political action in accordance with Parliamentary procedure and ethics. Flouting the Standing Orders and Parliamentary procedures within these hallowed walls is a shame that has to be lamented sadly and condemned unconditionally. Surely, there are other decent, gentlemanly, reasonable and democratic ways and means of resolving this crisis, clearing misunderstandings, mending differences and easing tensions than just being unruly, violent, disruptive and boorish in behaviour. Is this ethically and morally acceptable at all The answer is a clear No, not at all.
The way out
Pro-active dialogue and goodwill require, readiness to give up something of ones comfort-zones. While there is a deadlock in the arguments brought forward by both sides of the divide, there should be enough political maturity and insight to work hard together with the common interest of the good of the people of the country. No one admits of dictatorial or hegemonic actions and short-sightedness in decisions that can adversely affect the present and the future of the country. What transpired in the last few days is by far the worst that had happened in our history, never seen before and without precedent. The global world watches as this drama is being unfolded: politics in disarray, economy in tatters and a country in a mess. The entire episode is not fair by the people, of whom politicians are delegated representatives, thought to be trustworthy and dependable, with each one knowing what it means to represent the people and act as its servant. Politicians do not own this country and their erratic behaviour should not spoil its good name and the benevolence of its innocent and noble people. They should be responsible stewards exercising their responsibility consciously.
While the present status-quo has to be cleaned up and those responsible for it humbly accept their mistakes, the citizens must learn their duty of electing with good judgement who their representatives should be in the seats of authority. Their imprudent and immature choices will be necessarily another unfortunate cause of ruin in national politics. It is a pity, despite decades of franchise, that our people are still so poor in their political judgement and are easily swayed emotionally and en masse by political trickery and manoeuvering. People of Sri Lanka must by now realize that should not allow themselves to be hoodwinked into rosy political agendas of party politics.
The country by now should know, who rules well and for how long, the short-term and long-term benefits they have accrued under consecutive Governments. The citizens alone bear the ultimate responsibility of electing to office those who are of even-temperament, educated, upright, honest, ethically sound and morally beyond reproach, whom they can depend on for serving the interests of their dear Motherland. One should not allow this Pearl of the Indies to fall from the frying pan to the fire or from the brink of political anarchy into a pariah state. Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans deserve better. Our country must be forthwith redeemed from being a battleground for political greed and pursuit of power, making it instead, into an oasis of healthy and clean politics with statesman-like politicians, wise in their ways and serving the people in integrity and honesty. May we soon have a Government built on the Rule of law, demands of democracy and constitutionally established, that will augur well for the countrys peace, stability and prosperity. This is the ideal that politicians and the people at large to whom this country belongs, must strive to work for and the dream they must try to pursue.

Asiri AOI cancer centre launched
Asiri Surgical hospital together with the American Oncology Institute recently launched Asiri AOI, a major new cancer care initiative.
Managing Director and Chairman Asiri Health and Soft Logic Group of companies, Ashok Pathirage pointed out that these times are very exciting times for Asiri Group and for the country as well. He also stated that Asiri is the largest hospital chain in Sri Lanka, and as a group it has done a lot for Sri Lanka providing excellent medical care. They look at their service not from a commercial aspect but believe in compassion and empathy as well.
We have just opened the Asiri AOI Cancer Center, and this will be the first fully fledged cancer center of its kind in Sri Lanka, and is a gift from Asiri and the American Oncology Institute to the people of Sri Lanka. We feel proud and happy to introduce these new technologies although the investments are very high. This is a great opportunity for us to contribute to society, said Pathirage.
Director Asiri Health, Vishal Bali, called this World Class Cancer Center  Asiri AOI, a historic moment for the country. He stated that the rising incidents of Cancer should be a cause for alarm, not just in Sri Lanka but in the world at large, South Asia in particular. Therefore this needs to be addressed very quickly.
It can be addressed in two or three different technological areas. And that is where the collaboration of Asiri and the American Oncological institute comes into play. Part of the vision of American Oncological institute is to bring US standards of treatment protocols in Oncology to Asia, and that was why AOI was started. As we pursued that vision we came to realize that one of the biggest issues in cancer care is a protocol driven patient centric approach.
The best treatment for cancer patients is when there is a combination of technology and multi-collaborative approach of clinical sciences. This is when medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and surgical oncologists come together and put together the right treatment protocols that result in the best clinical outcomes, stated Bali.
Asiri AOI is the first comprehensive cancer center in the country. What we have got in the AOI center now is the most advanced radiation therapy unit in the country. Not just in the country but in the whole of South Asia. The next step is how do we transfer protocols and clinical excellence between the US and Sri Lanka How are these medical professionals going to bridge the gap in terms of the way we treat cancer So these treatment protocols in Sri Lanka will be based on the protocols followed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center which is the anchor of American Oncological Institute.
Treatment planning is an integral part of good cancer care. We will be offering at Asiri AOI, the treatment plans which are offered to some of the most advanced cancer centers in the region. And all that will be done through our network. At the Asiri AOI, the patients in Sri Lanka, will have access to cancer treatment planning processes which are practiced by the best oncology centers worldwide, explained Bali.
Asiri AOI is the only Centre in Sri Lanka to provide PET and CT imaging to diagnose malignancies and monitor response to treatment. The center has a Gamma Camera and all the diagnostic equipment. It all makes the cancer center that much more comprehensive. So cancer is diagnosed early and treated early with the best of US protocols which translates into the best clinical setting created for cancer patients in this country.
We are very proud of offering such superior care, forming the most advantageous cancer care in the region. Because of this, the way cancer is being treated in Sri Lanka has reached a new era which is something very positive for the rising number of cancer patients, said Bali
One of the other areas in the treatment of cancer is the tumor board. The tumor board actually puts together all the science and expertise in terms of reviewing cases and provides guidance in terms of how the patient needs to be treated. So when a patient is identified as a cancer patient, the clinician who is treating the patient would put the patients records to the tumor board.
Chairman, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UPMC Shadyside, Dr. Stanley Marks, commented that the treatment of cancers has become extremely complex.
The decision making has become much harder in the treatment of these cancers. For example there are ten drugs available for us to treat kidney cancers when ten years ago there werent any. What we do at our tumor boards is, we actually have access to the thought leaders in those disease areas. If, there is a difficult case  breast cancer or brain tumor, we have access to experts. These cases are taken to them for their opinion. It dramatically improves the recommendations for those particular patients, explained Marks.
Cancer is complex and multi-faceted. The approach of medical professionals also should be that way. So each oncologist has his or her own unique perspective on how to treat different types of cancers. The best outcomes are when these physicians come together to decide the best protocol/ treatment sequence for these patients. -IJ

In terms of volume, NDB & HNB led foreign purchases while JKH & Dialog led foreign sales. In terms of value, NDB & HNB led foreign purchases while JKH & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets continued to remain in the doldrums, falling ~25 points over the holiday-shortened trading week as the IMF confirmed that it has delayed discussions on Sri Lankas next loan tranche and as ratings agency Moodys downgraded Sri Lankas sovereign rating to a B2 (from B1).
The broadshare Index consequently hit a 4-week low of 5929.98, the lowest value on the Index since the start of the countrys political turmoil on Oct26. Despite an initial sharp rise (+4.5%) on the Index in the immediate aftermath of the political developments on Oct26th, gains on the Index have been wiped off as the countrys political stalemate has worsened over the weeks and the foreign equity sell-off has gathered pace.
In the month since the political events of Oct26th, the Index has gained 1.7% as the initial sharp gain of 4.5% on ASPI has since being pared down by losses in the range of 2.7%. Activity levels on the Index meanwhile also fell over the week, with turnover levels totaling Rs. 1.5Bn, 82% lower than last weeks of Rs. 8.3Bn (due to Softlogics strategic transfer of Odel) but higher than the 2018 YTD daily average of Rs. 0.76Bn.
Compared to last week when Softlogics strategic transfer pushed crossings for the week to 84% of total market turnover, this weeks crossings fell to 48% of total market turnover as local HNI and institutional buying interest in key blue-chips and banks continued to drive volumes.
Foreign investors meanwhile reverted to a net selling position this week, as the sell-off on equities amounted to Rs. 188Mn relative to last weeks net buying of Rs. 129Mn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to look for direction from further political developments and the outcome of next weeks parliamentary session.
Moodys downgrades credit rating to B2 (Stable)
Credit ratings agency Moodys downgraded Sri Lankas sovereign credit rating to B2 (Stable) for the first time in eight years,1 adding that the countrys credit profile reflects heightened refinancing risks beyond levels anticipated in July.
The Agency stated that the countrys tightening external financing conditions and low reserve adequacy was exacerbated by the recent political upheaval, resulting in the downgrade. Moodys also projects a slower pace of fiscal consolidation than previously anticipated in the context of an ongoing political crisis which added to its rationale in downgrading Sri Lankas credit profile.
The ratings agency also added that the stable outlook (from Negative) on the sovereigns credit profile denotes balanced credit risks at the B2 rating level. However, the CBSL is of the view that the Agencys decision to downgrade Sri Lankas credit profile is unwarranted as the countrys macroeconomic position and policy implementation have remained on track in spite of the current political conditions.
The CBSL stated that the current level of gross official reserves amounting to USD7.2 Bn is adequate to meet its external debt obligations in the period ahead. The CBSL also added that it plans to mobilize USD2.0 Bn by February 2019 as a precautionary measure through i) foreign currency SWAP facilities, ii) issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds, and iii) an enhancement to the syndicated loan obtained from China Development Bank.
Hence, the CBSL believes continued fiscal consolidation (particularly in the context of a surplus in the primary balance and effective liability management initiatives) are expected to further strength fiscal operations in 2019 which contrasts with Moodys rationale behind the downgrade.

Australia survive nerves to lift fourth Womens World T20 title
Australia were far from at their usual high standards in the field, but were clinical enough to trump England in an eight-wicket win to put their hands on the ICC Women's World T20 title for a fourth time.
Choosing to bat at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Saturday England began promisingly with 12 runs in the first over. But that remained their best of the innings.
Elyse Villani held on to a skyer to extend Tammy Beaumont's disappointing tournament, and Georgia Wareham's rocket throw from mid-on caught Amy Jones short of her crease at the non-striker's end.
But for those, Australia were unusually sloppy on the field, the nerves and dew causing dropped catches and misfields. Danni Wyatt, who started by launching Sophie Molineux over the long-off boundary for a four and a six, survived chances of varying difficultly at 11, 12 and 34, to finally fall on 43 off 37 balls. However, no other batter, apart from captain Heather Knight, got to double figures.
Ellyse Perry had Nat Sciver as her 100th wicket, Wareham took two in two balls, and Ashleigh Gardner finished with three wickets as England pushed their total to three figures before folding for 105 in 19.4 overs.
Alyssa Healy took the attack to Anya Shrubsole in the second over, punishing her for bowling short. Sophie Ecclestone had the in-form batter of the tournament bowled with a beauty and Danielle Hazell sent back Beth Mooney to add some pressure, but England were allowed nothing else.
Gardner, who began slowly, punched three sixes, and in the company of her captain Meg Lanning, knocked off the winning runs to finally ease the nerves in the dugout.
Australia, the No.1 side on the MRF Tyres ICC Women's T20I Team Rankings, thus regained the title they lost last time, and made their fifth straight appearance in the final a successful one. Gardner was named Player of the Final, while Healy was chosen Player of the Tournament.
Scores: England Women 105 in 19.4 overs (Danielle Wyatt 43, Heather Knight 25, Megan Schutt 2/13, Georgia Wareham 2/11, Ashleigh Gardner 3/22)
Australia Women 106-2 in 15.1 overs (Alyssa Healy 22, Ashley Gardner 33 n.o., Meg Lanning 28 n.o.)

To beat it; know it !
Extracted from Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes authored by Dr.Renuka Jayatissa and published by Sarasavi Publishers.
Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes) is a global problem with devastating human, social and economic impacts. As estimated by the World Health Organisation, today more than 200 million people worldwide are living with diabetes and by 2030; this total is expected to increase to over 366 million people. Each year another 7 million people develop diabetes.
What is Diabetes 
Diabetes is a condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from defects in insulin secretion and/or uptake. It develops when insulin is absent, not secreted in adequate amounts or the insulin is not used properly by the target tissues. There may also be a combination of these factors.
Insulin 
Insulin is a hormone that is needed to properly metabolise the macro-nutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) in the normal way to effectively convert glucose into energy needed for day to day life. It is produced by the pancreas.
How does insufficiency of insulin and excess of sugar lead to diabetes 
If sugar is unable to be transported into cells, the sugar remains in the blood stream and produces a state of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia).
What are the consequences 
This prolonged state causes damage to the body by affecting large blood vessels (macrovascular) and small blood vessels (microvascular). It can cause blindness, heart disease, kidney problems, nerve damage, erectile dysfunction and amputations of limbs.
What are the types of Diabetes 
a. Type 1 diabetes (juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes or IDDM) it is an auto-immune disease that affects the pancreas in a way that it does not release insulin. Insulin is required for a type 1 diabetic to survive; injections are given to replace the insulin.
b. Type 2 diabetes (adult onset of diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes or NIDDM) It is a disease that progressively results in the inability of the pancreas to function properly. Overtime, the production of insulin diminishes by the pancreas. There is no single cause of type 2 diabetes, but some factors put people to a greater risk, including:
* being 40 or over
* being overweight
* born with birth weight less than 2500 grams
* having a family member who has diabetes
* having had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).
* having metabolic syndrome.
Having metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome is having excess fat around the waist (central obesity) with 2 of the other factors listed below. Central obesity is diagnosed when the waist circumference is,
more than 90 cm (36 inches) for men and
more than 80 cm (32 inches) for women
Other factors are:
* High blood triglyceride levels (>150mg/dL or 1.7 mmol/L)
* Low blood HDL cholesterol (<40mg/dL or 0.9 mmol/L)
* High blood pressure (Systolic>130 or diastolic > 85mmHg)
* High fasting plasma glucose (>100mg/dL or 5.6mmol/L)
How do you measure your waist circumference 
* Run a tape measure around your midsection at about the level of your navel.
* Breathe normally, don't hold your tummy in, and don't pull the tape so tight that it presses your skin down.
Type 2 diabetes may require medication to control blood sugar. This may include oral medication and or insulin. Once a type 2 diabetic starts an insulin program, the person does not become a type 1 diabetic; the description for this patient is Type 2 diabetic, requiring insulin.
a. Gestational diabetes only occurs during pregnancy. After the delivering of the baby, the blood sugar returns to normal. Women who have gestational diabetes are at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Meal planning, exercise, and possibly medication are used to control the blood sugar during pregnancy.
b. Pre-diabetic is not considered as diabetic but has blood sugars that are higher than normal. It is a state of increased risk of progressing to diabetes, although it was also noted that many would revert to normal. There are about 3 million people with pre-diabetes in Sri Lanka. Usually diet. Exercise and weight management can prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.
There are two categories under this group; Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG).
IGT falls between normal and diabetes range. IGT is not a disease stage but is a risk factor for future diabetes and/or adverse outcomes. IGT is associated with muscle insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. This is the most important stage for early detection to prevent the onset of diabetes.
IFG, as with IGT, is not a disease stage but rather a risk factor for future diabetes and adverse outcomes. IFG is associated with impaired insulin secretion and impaired suppression of liver glucose output. Identification of this stage helps to prevent the occurrence of diabetes.
Can oneself-identify Diabetes  Many people with type 2 diabetes may be symptomless. Some may present;
* lethargy,
* fatigue,
* weight loss,
* increased urine excretion especially in the night,
* excessive thirst and water ingestion,
* skin infections, such as boils, carbuncles and abscesses,
* white plaques in the tongue due to oral fungal
* infections,
* non healing wounds,
* numbness
* blurred vision.
If you have any of these symptoms, it is better to check your blood sugar levels.
****
Tips to beat Diabetics
There are approximately 1 million Sri Lankans with Diabetes.
Pre-diabetes is the most important stage for early detection to prevent the onset of diabetes.
Good diabetes care and management can prevent or delay the onset of these complications.
Of the total diabetes population 90-95% has type 2 diabetes and the remaining 5-10% has type 1 diabetes.

Madugalle Uda Gabada Nilame
Bicentennial commemoration of a hero of 1817 Rebellion
Today marks the 200th anniversary of the death of Madugalle Uda Gabada Nilame, a hero of the 1817/18 Rebellion against the British. It was a rather dark era in Sri Lankan history. The British had deposed the King of the Kandyan Kingdom, reviled by his own noblemen, leading to his ouster and eventual exile.
On March 2, 1815, the nobility had then signed the Kandyan Convention with the British, subjugating the sovereignty of the island nation to the British Crown.
Madugalle Disawe
The British had promised little short of the sun and the moon. The agreement included upholding the right of the nobility and Sinhala countrymen to practice the Religion of the Boodhoo, and the preservation of Temples among many others. Things turned for the worse when the British neglected their pledges, and soon the Sinhalese noblemen, suspicious of British intent and resentful of their rule, supported intensely by Buddhist clergy of the calibre of Ihagama Thera, soon conspired to enthrone a Sinhala King.
The nobles, resolute in restoring the sovereignty of Ceylon to its ancient glory, rebelled in 1817  1818, led by legendary heroes such as Monarawila Keppettipola Nilame and the heroic subject of this article, whom we are honoured to commemorate  Madugalle Uda Gabada Nilame. The rebellion must have been the silver lining on a dark cloud, and might have changed the course of history, if not for some treacherous Nilames who supported the English. When the Ven. Ihagama Unnanse Thera confided the details of the conspiracy to Eknaligoda Nilame of Ratnapura, the latter promptly informed colonial authorities of the impending revolt. Soon the English set about arresting the conspiring Nilames among whom Madugalle Nilame too was apprehended.
Two charges were levelled at the Nilame including conspiring to move the Sacred Tooth Relic out of the English- controlled Kandy to the Sinhala-dominated area in Uva. The second charge was over a Pooja in Kataragama where he had called for an end to the English Government and the Enthroning of a Sinhala King. Madugalle Nilame was sentenced to a two-year jail term in Jaffna after a trial, becoming the first high-ranking leader to be imprisoned by the British colonials. However, on the August 1, 1817, British Governor General Robert Brownrigg set Madugalle Nilame free under an amnesty, ostensibly to win over his allegiance. But no sooner than being set free, Madugalle Nilame joined the great rebellion of 1817 and fought against the British once again.
Madugalle Nilames heroism and shrewdness as a warrior is unparalleled. While he is well-known for courage in battles against the colonial armies, he is more famous for his uncanny ability to deceive the enemy, which he did spectacularly on several occasions. Once, when he was in Kandy to buy gunpowder, he was surrounded by English soldiers who suspected that he was Madugalle Nilame as the suspect looked like him. However, the wily Madugalle Nilame was able to convince the soldiers that he was not the Nilame, because as he put it, he was not even worth the dust under the feet of the Nilame. On another occasion, when the English surrounded Madugalle Walawwa, a frightened woman with her head covered and a pot in hand emerged from the front door and informed the soldiers that Madugalle Nilame was hiding inside. As the soldiers entered the house the woman who was Madugalle Nilame in disguise escaped after teasing the gullible soldiers.
However, with all his guile and bravery, Madugalle Nilame was captured for the second and final time, at a location near Elahera, on November 1, 1818. Both Madugalle Nilame and Monarawila Keppettipola Nilame were tried at a British military tribunal, convicted on November 15, 1818, of rebelling against the government, and beheaded on the November 26 of the same year.
The Government of Sri Lanka recently removed Madugalle Uda Gabada Nilame, Monarawila Keppettipola Nilame and 79 others making a total of 81 from the list of those who committed high treason and recognised them as national heroes, in an admirable course of action.
May Madugalle Uda Gabada Nilame, Monarawila Keppettipola Nilame and all heroes who sacrificed their lives in the struggle against British colonial hegemony attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana!

President tells foreign correspondents
Bond shattered hopes of good governance
The concept of Good Governance was shattered with the Bond Scam where former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was involved in, within three months into the government under him, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
People elected me to run a corruption free government and I was fully committed to do so. However, the Bond Scam spoiled that opportunity and shattered the hopes of running a corruption free government, the President told foreign correspondents in Sri Lanka yesterday.
This was a major factor that led me to remove Wickremesinghe from the Premiership and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, the President said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said that all recent political decisions including appointing a new Prime Minister, removal of the former Prime Minister, dissolving Parliament and appointing a new Cabinet after dissolving the former cabinet and so on, have been taken by him legally under the provisions of the Constitution.
The President made these remarks after meeting foreign media personnel at the Presidents official residence yesterday morning.
The President said that owing to various acts of misconduct and narrow sighted and wayward decisions of the former Prime Minister, he couldnt move forward anymore or govern the country with corrupt elements, who conspired to assassinate him.
The President said it was not his political policy since he is completely against corruption and fraud. I work in accordance with the Constitution, he said.
Speaking further he added that the proposal of a no-confidence motion forwarded to Parliament on November 14 was not tabled under Standing Orders. It is better to exercise a suitable voting system such as an electronic voting system or voting by name when voting for on important issue as changing a government or appointing a new government, the President said.
The President said that he will never appoint former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister again.I have clearly mentioned this to the UNP, he said.
He further said that a Presidential Commission will be appointed to look into the misconduct of the government, in which Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister from 2015 to 2018.

The brave attempt to regain the Kandyan Kingdom
The Great Rebellion of 1817-1818 was initiated in the Uva and Wellassa Provinces, which were among the main provinces of the Kandyan kingdom. This freedom movement was also known as the Uva Wellassa Uprising of Ceylonese of 18171818. This was the third war against the British colonial government by Kandyan Sinhalese since 1796. The Kingdom of Kandy was a territory of independent regime of the Udarata [Up Country], until it fell under the control of the British in 1815.
Two years after the handing over of the rule of the Upcountry kingdom under the terms of the Kandyan Convention in 1815, the British colonial rulers began to neglect the terms of the Convention and gradually antagonised the Upcountry chiefs who signed the Convention.
Despite promises, the British breached the rights of the Kandyan chiefs and to retain their traditional privileges, they introduced the British administrative system over their customary powers. On the recommendation of John DOyly, Governor Brownrigg appointed Hajji Marikkar Muhandiram, Malay moor, [in September 1817] as Travala Madige Muhandiram of Wellassa, replacing the rights of Millawe Dissawa who fired the unrest of Kandyan nobles against to the British rule. In August and September 1817, Kivulegedara Mohottala, Kohu Kumbure Rate Rala, Butawe Rate Rala and Millawe Disawa organised a riot against this decision, in Badulla. Kivulegedara Mohottala [Weera Vanni Bandara Kivulegedara, Aluth Punchi Bandara Mohottala Disawa] who was involved in the riot is admired for taking responsibility to organise people at the initial stage.
On the one hand, the appointment of a Moor as Disawa with traditional administrative and military powers was conceived by Upcountry natives as a threat to their conventional legacy. On the other hand, the grudge and suspicion conceived by the British administration upon senior Disawas, i.e., Ehelepola, Pilima Talauve, Madugalle and Keppetipola, upset the Buddhist clergy and native leaders. Annoyance amongst most Sinhala nobles, Buddhist monks, and local leaders was growing since the Treaty of 1815 was signed by the by high-ranking British officials and by the Kandyan nobles.
This anxiety of the future of Kandyan Sinhalese [Kandyan natives] was growing even among Buddhist leaders in Kandy, Malwatta and Usgiriya. This anxiety turned into a rebellion from September 26, 1817, with Hajji Mohandirams troops attempting to enter Badulla. The second attempt was made by Major Sylvester Wilson on October 16. He was killed by the rebels. The rebel movement was demonstrated strongly in September and October 1817. At the end of October, when the British sent massive troops to UvaWellassa under Keppetipola Nilame, the rebel leaders had high morale to attack them before entering Uva. Keppetipola Nilame had several negotiations with rebel leaders, and finally decided to join the rebels and lead the battle.
The rebel leaders had prepared to plunder the guns and ammunition of the enemy, but they later changed their minds. Keppetipola Nilame turned back all British military which were under his command, with their all arms and ammunition. Since then, many Kandyan nobles, Disawas, and Mohottalas began to join the rebels with their local followers. From March to September, the riot was well organised and received the support of the masses. By October 1817, the uprising was growing in many Disawas [regions] in Matale, Uva and Wellassa, and Governor Robert Brownrigg remained in Kandy to organise the war to suppress the rebellion.
On recommendation of DOyly, the Governor sent a battalion of 500 British soldiers with 2,000 Sinhala [lascoreyns], Malay and Indian soldiers to Uva under the command of Keppetipola Disawa on October 26, 1817, to quell the uprising, but with Keppetipola Disawa joining the rebellion at Alupotha in Uva as the leader, the British were disadvantaged.
The other leaders in charge of regional battalions who supported this uprising from the beginning of 1817, such as Gode Gedara Adikaram, King Wilbawe alias Doraisamy (a Nayakkar of Royal blood), Madulle Nilame, Megaskumbura Nilame, Kandepola Nilame, Dunuwila Nilame, Iriyagama Nilame, Thanne Adikarama, II Pilima Talauve Adikaram, Kohu Kumbure Rate Rala, Dimbulana Disawe, Kivulegedara Mohottala [Kiulegedara Mohottala was the Dissawa of Walapana and a royal poet in the Court of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe], Madugalle Disawe, Butewe Rate Rala, Galagoda Mohottala, Galagedara Mohottala, Meegahapitiya Rate Rala, Dambawinna Disawe and Kurundu Kumbure Mohottala reinforced their troops under the direction of Keppetipola Nilame.
Keppetipola Nilame ordered the British troops to turn back and returned all arms and ammunition of the British with them, perhaps to prove our cultural discipline to the foreign invaders. In April 1818, Ven. Wariyapola Sumangala Thera of Asgiriya, with help of Madugalle Nilame, fled with the relics casket to Hanguranketa, which resulted in increasing the confidence of the leaders of the rebellion.
During the rebellion, Kohu Kumbure Rate Rala and his supporters were caught by native Lieut. Anna in April 1818. Between May and August, many local leaders and followers of the rebellion were caught by the British army, or surrendered. By September 1818, the British army captured a few regional leaders and chief rebels, including Ellepola who was the Dissawa of Viyaluwa and a brother of Maha Adikaram Ehelepola, and beheaded them in Bogambara on October 27, 1818.
The rebellion was in progress in many districts with random setbacks until the end of August 1818, led by Monarawila Keppetipola Disawe and other leading nobles, and they could have captured Matale and the northern part of Kandy, but Keppetipola fell ill with jungle fever. It was evident that the rebellion failed due to a number of reasons. Since the inception, it was not well planned by the leaders. The territories for crossing were controlled by some chieftains and they helped the British, allowing routes to be used by the military and for British supplies. There has been disagreement of the status of King Wilbawe alias Doraisamy, who claimed hereditary legacy to the Sinhalese throne, among Sinhalese nobles and the common people, as he was of Nayakkar origin.
Lack of weapons, ammunitions and gunpowder was the serious problem faced by rebels at the final stage in October 1818. The rebels fought in small dispersed groups. The Sinhalese rebel army led by Keppetipola and other leaders faced the British army which attacked them on three fronts.
At the defeat in the third week of September 1818, the principal leaders of the rebellion retreated with their retinues to certain secured places in the outer periphery of Uva and Wellassa. There has been some disappointment with the leadership of Keppetipola during the defeat. Keppetipola Nilame and his rebels retreated through Bibile to Mahiyangana.
Keppetipola Nilame and Ehelepola Nilame both aspired to become the Governing Chief of the Kandyan Kingdom under the British Empire, but that condition was not included in the Treaty [Convention] of 1815, which was signed and attested by the principal Adigars of Kandy and by the Governor and high-ranking British administrators. This hidden intrinsic antagonism, and the unfair military power, rules and regulations of the British caused the uprising of the people, at the cost of lives and property of the natives [Ceylonese].

CAA on the watch during festive season
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has taken measures to carry out special raids to nab errant traders throughout the country during the upcoming festive season.
CAA Deputy Director Asela Bandara told the Daily News a special programme is in place to minimise injustice caused to consumers, from November 15 to January 15, next year.
During these raids, the CAA flying squad would not only check the places selling food items, but places selling clothes, electrical items and essential goods as well. "We want to encourage businessmen to sell quality goods and stop fraudulent trading," he said.
He added that raids are always intensified during any festive season because as sales increase, traders tend to engage in illegal acts.
Officials of the CAA have been given special instructions to check even mobile shops as well as places conducting sales, he said.
The raids are carried out on traders who violate the Consumer Protection Act by selling goods unsuitable for consumption, underweight goods, selling above the controlled price, not displaying the retail prices, storing of goods without proper standards, and selling expired products.
He added that the CAA has focused attention on some traders who are using various gimmicks such as discounts and special year-end sales to sell spoiled or expired goods and substandard items.
The CAA flying squad will conduct raids even during the weekends and holidays and stern action will be taken against errant traders. He further said that people should be aware of the consumer laws and the CAA will conduct a leaflet campaign to educate consumers. If any person is violating the law, they can call 1977, the hotline of the CAA, he said.

Calibrated connection
Prove me wrong if you wish, but I believe one of the first seeds of feminism which has today morphed into the #MeToo Movement were planted in Edith Whartons 1920 novel  The Age of Innocence. The book also happens to be the first novel written by a woman to win the Pulitzer Prize.
The story unfolds through the eyes of Newland Archer, a young lawyer belonging to the upper circles of 1870s New York. He is engaged to be married to shy, lovely, cloistered May Weldon. He believes he loves May as much as a man can and that it is not an arranged marriage when in truth it is a calibrated connection between two of the oldest and wealthiest families in New York.
When the narrative begins, the upper crust of the city is at the theatre where the actress sings in keeping with the hypocrisy of the audience,
Mama! and not he loves me, since an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences.
In the middle of this performance arrives Mays newly returned cousin from Europe, Countess Ellen Volenska scandalously separated from her European husband, a Polish count. Archer observes how the gentlemen who are discreetly watching the ladies through the eye-glasses raise their eyebrows and turn their lips down when they see her. In traditional New York it is not the custom for a woman to flee from her husband or be seen in public so soon after her fall from grace, smiling and looking so normal as if she had done nothing thats out of place.
In Ellen, we see the makings of the radical, independent New Woman who challenges social conventions. It is true that Edith Wharton wrote The Age of Innocence in the third person, and that her focus was Archer  and that what we see of Ellen is entirely through his perhaps not altogether reliable perception of her. The picture, therefore, might not be entirely accurate but it is enough to make us realize that Ellen is exotic, and immensely brave - brave enough to leave her unfaithful husband and return home to her grandmother in search of freedom and everything thats good. She is not worried or scared of conventions and would have gone through a divorce in spite of all the horrors attached to it if Archer had not persuaded her to do otherwise. She is surprised that the members of her family rise up as one to denounce her intention to divorce the count. Nobody denies that the count has treated her badly but, as Newland explains, Our legislation favors divorce, but our customs dont. Especially if you are a woman the publicity could be horrible. For in this Gilded Age, people are allowed to behave abominably as long as they dont allow it to become public knowledge. Ellen consents not to file for divorce for her families sake, but cries in agony over their hypocrisy: The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!
She loves art immensely and loves to be with artists and is Archers intellectual equal but tries hard to toe the line and be like everyone else in New York. However, as Archer observes, like the yellow roses he sends her there is something too rich, too strong, in her fiery beauty. She is too free spirited, spontaneous and kind and so, she would always be different. At the party given in her honour by the Van der Luydens, Countess Volenska is seen conversing with the Duke. Then she leaves him and walks across the room to sit next to Archer. She does not seem to care that in traditional New York it was not the custom for a woman to leave the side of one gentleman to seek the company of another. She is honest in her remarks and tells Archer the Duke is the most boring man she has ever met, and she is honest in her feelings  she generously throws her own coat over her maid when she sends Nastashiya out onto the cold winter evening on an errand. An act Archer observes any other lady in his circle would have considered as improper.
It is natural then that Archer who might be an avatar of the HeForShe movement finds himself falling deeply in love with Ellen. Archer believes Women ought to be free - as free as we are. He dismisses rumours about Ellens past considering the fact that most of the men he knows, including himself cannot boast of immaculate behaviour, either. He is broadminded enough to see the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyed and pitied. And does not agree with The belief that when such things happened it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always criminal of the woman.
Archer wishes, at first to break off the engagement with May, but is persuaded by circumstances of his own making as well as Ellens insistence to return to his betrothed and marry May. After his marriage he hopes to liberate May and open up the world of art and literature to her perhaps with the secret hope of turning her into another Ellen but realizes with dismay that Theres no point in liberating someone who doesnt realize she is not free.
When he realizes he can no longer survive as Mays husband in the predictable, often hypocritical rituals of society, and finds himself increasingly drawn to the kind of life that accepts spontaneity and acts on feelings without regard to form, a world to which Ellen has the key, he makes up his mind to go to her. But the tribe moves in, rallying around the seemingly guileless May and successfully schemes to get Ellen away from his life.
And so, Newland Archer gives up his dreams of a life of freedom with Ellen Volenska, chooses to be trapped by duty: He becomes the man who married one woman because another one told him to,
remains a faithful husband and a good father to his three children. It is ironic that by the time Archers son, Ted is old enough to be married the strict conventional codes that imprisoned him have melted away in the same way snow on the sidewalks of New York, melts in spring. Ted is marrying a girl whose father was a scoundrel and a cast-off but no one cares anymore about family history or keeping an immaculate family line.
By the time the book ends The Age of Innocence seems to have come to an end. Albeit temporarily.
For as long as we remain victims of civilization and are homesick for the unexplored there will always be Ellen Volenskas and Newland Archers in our midst.

Cat burglars
What do you do after you fail Purr your disappointment away and try harder. Two devoted art lovers have been trying to get into the Hiroshima Onomichi City Museum of Art for years now, but have been consistently kicked out just as they were entering it.
Meet Ken Chan and Gosaku, the most persistent feline out there. It started a couple of years ago when the meowseum debuted a show entitled Cats - Mitsuaki Iwago Photography Exhibition.
Just days after the exhibit opened, an unusual visitor arrived, creating the best publicity for the event you could imagine.
The security guard, however, blocked its path at the front door.
In March of last year, the same black neighbourhood cat returned. But this time it brought a ginger friend. Sadly, the two of them were forced to turn around. The two have probably taken residence somewhere nearby the meowseum, because they keep coming back again and again. Eventually, its staff started tweeting photos of the times they drop by, making them internet celebrities.And while they havent yet officially made their way inside, at least they receive snuggles and pets from the white-gloved guards when they take the art lovers back outside.

LAWS TO BAN ANIMAL SACRIFICE IN HINDU TEMPLES
Recent newspaper reports say Cabinet has approved a proposal to enact laws banning the ritualistic sacrifice of animals in Hindu Temples and its precincts will be prohibited. It also states the Minister for Hindu Cultural Affairs had consulted Hindu organisations and heads of Kovils. This would mean the existing provision in the Constitution of the DemocraticSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka under Article 14[1][e] has to be amended or changed, especially to include rites and rituals of Hindus -Article 14 [1][e] reads The freedom either by himself or in association with others, and either in public or in private to manifest his religious or belief in worship, observance practice and teachings.[f] The freedom by himself or in association with others to enjoy and promote his own culture ad to use his own language.
The question arises whether those Kurukals or Poosaris have the authority to override a devotees faith as clearly stated in the provision in the Constitution mentioned above. Is this not blatant violation of an individuals freedom and right There are Hindus, I know, who firmly believe in these rituals who say they have been benefitted. If the heads of Hindu Temples and Hindu organisations have agreed as stated by the Minister for Hindu Cultural Affairs, surely they can enforce it by not performing such rituals in their temples rather than involve the government to legalise.
Has the authorities unknowingly creating a rift between those Hindus who believe these rituals and those who do not
Then comes the question why only marginalise Hindus. What about those of the Islamic faith where animal sacrifice is mandatory, especially on Eid-Al-Adha festival. Any killing of an animal for food is done praising Allah.
Then comes our Kattadiyas who sacrifice roosters to drive away devils or evil spirits in haunted houses or those possessed.
All these offerings, after they are performed, come to the table as tasty dishes.
Go to any market, there hangs carcasses of bulls, pig and chicken, all with licenses issued by the authorities.
The other latest news, although not a religious ritual is the lifting the ban of killing wild boar. This is doneto save the Chena cultivator of wild boar damaging their much-laboured cultivation. Could this be a blessing in disguise to Chena cultivators Now, without toiling and keep watch at night, they could hunt for wild boar and make quick money as its flesh could be sold at over Rs.1,000 per kilo.
Whatever it be, it should be the holy duty of our monks of all religions to educate their flock of the age old meaningless practices to desist from killing any animal and convince them they are taking away another life. Also convince them that we humans have come a long way in civilization from that prehistoric homo-sapiens who hunted animals for food.

European Union provides 12 mn in support of global food security
The European Union and FAO along with its Rome-based UN partner agencies, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP), have signed an 12 million deal that will lend EU backing to three separate programs designed to tackle diverse aspects of food security and rural development.
The agreements were finalized by EU Commissioner in charge of International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, and FAO Director-General, Jose Graziano da Silva.
The first project will aim to empower rural women as key actors in improving nutrition and food security; another will support global food security governance mechanisms, including by promoting greater involvement by civil society in policy-making; and the third is looking to leverage private sector funding to support agricultural development projects.
The first two initiatives are collaborative programs that will be co-operated by FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the UNs World Food Programme (WFP). The investment program will be run by FAO in close cooperation with the Commissions Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development.
All three contracts will intensify the cooperation between the three Rome-based agencies (FAO, IFAD and WFP), as well as their collaboration with the EU. I look forward to effective joint work and clear results from the projects, Mimica said.
Graziano da Silva said: The FAO-EU relationship is a strong, well-established partnership with a long track record of successful teamwork and collaboration. We are extremely grateful for the ongoing trust and support the EU has shown us, and are gratified to be able to continue this team effort to build a world with zero hunger.
The first collaborative project, worth 5 million, will build off a joint proposal for mainstreaming gender considerations into rural development drawn up by FAO, IFAD and WFP.
The three partners will work together to develop an improved model for rural development work, one that unlocks and harnesses the many contributions that female farmers and food processes and women heads of household make to economic growth, good nutrition, and economic development. They will then ensure that this approach is firmly embedded in all of the work they do in the field.
The second project, with 3 million in backing, will provide support to the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), an international body convened by FAO that brings international organizations and civil-society groups working on food security together with governments to hash out a common global agenda for tackling hunger and malnutrition.
The program will strengthen participation in the CFS by civil society, facilitate work by an independent panel of outside experts that brings critical studies and independent analysis into CFS discussions, and support production of guidance documents that CFS produces as tools for improved policy-making by governments.
The third project, named Agrintel and worth 4 million, will enhance FAO-European Commission collaboration in the area of investment support, and is geared towards encouraging private investments in agrifood systems that are sustainable and have a strong development impact.
Agrintel will enhance the ECs analytical and decision-making capacity on agricultural investment and help guide DEVCO in in making informed decisions regarding specific investment operations in agricultural value chains, in particular as regards their economic, social and environmental sustainability.

Fiji beat pathetic France to claim historic victory
PARIS, Saturday: Fiji humiliated France 21-14 on Saturday to claim an historic first victory over Les Bleus in more than 60 years less than a year before the World Cup.
The teams have faced each other on 10 occasions in more than half a century and the Pacific Islanders finally claimed a memorable win in Paris despite being denied two debatable tries by referee Matthew Carley and his television match official.
Outside-half Benjamin Volavola scored his third penalty kick with the clock in the red which led to the Fijians on the field to fall to their knees in prayer thanking for an unforgettable evening in the French capital.
Coach John McKee put the momentous feat into context at his post-match press conference.
Its a massive achievement. We told each other this week that if we beat France we would make it into the pantheon of Fijian rugby, the New Zealander said.
All of Fijis points came from backs who play for French clubs as Bordeaux-Begles Semi Radradra and Toulons Josua Tuisova scored tries and Racing92s Benjamin Volavola added a conversion and three penalty goals. France captain Guilhem Guirado crossed twice for the visitors.
He was replaced by rookie Julien Marchand on 68 minutes and centre Mathieu Bastareaud took over the captaincy. Television microphones caught the angry post-match speech he addressed to his players.  AFP

The full text of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksas speech:
Most Venerable Members of the Maha Sangha, Clergymen of all religions, People of Sri Lanka, and friends,
In my speech in Parliament on November 15, I proposed to all political parties that we agree among overselves to hold a general election to enable the people to exercise their sovereign right to elect a government of their choice. the JVP agreed but the UNP has been evasively saying that we should hold a presidential election instead of a general election. The problem is in the Parliament. Hence, there is no need to hold a presidential election at this stage. No party obtained a clear majority at the general election held in August 2015. The UNP obtained 106 seats, the UPFA obtained 96. The difference was just 10 seats.
A UNP led government was formed only on the basis of an agreement entered into with a group of UPFA Parliamentarians. The UPFA group left the government on the 26th October. Thereafter several UNP Parliamentarians joined our ranks. Today, I am the leader of the largest group of MPs in Parliament. After the parliamentary elections of 1994, 2001 and 2004, Presidents D.B. Wijetunga and Chandrika Kumaratunga who held office at that time, invited the largest group in Parliament to form a government. On that basis, governments were formed by the Peoples Alliance in 1994, the UNP in 2001 and the UPFA in 2004.
What we did on the 26th of October was to form an Interim Government that would have lasted only until the conclusion of the general election that has already been declared, but temporaily put on hold by the courts. We never had any intention of running an administration through the government that has been formed at present. The whole country can see that only a few members of the Joint Opposition hold office in this government. That is because this is only an interim arrangement. I have been stressing ever since I took oaths as Prime Minister that our foremost aim was to go for an election in order to establish a stable government. However the objective of the other side is to revive the previous government and to rule the country for as long as possible without holding any election at all. That is the reason for the present political situation.
Some people ask me why I accepted office when there was less than 18 months to go for the next elections. I have heard members of the UNP saying that if I had been patient for another 18 months, I could have won the ensuing election with a two thirds majority. We did not form a government to continuously administer the country but to hold a general election. The President explained in his address to the nation that he appointed me as the Prime Minister only after things reached a stage where he had absolutely no other option. When the government is entrusted to me in such circumstances, I cannot in all fairness, shun the responsiblity. This was not a question of political power. The fate of our country and the futures of our younger generation was at stake.
Furthermore if after everything was said and done, it was still we who would have to assume that responsibility anyway, there was much to be said for assuming office before further damage was inflicted upon the country. The President dissolved Parliament and paved the way for a general election. But the UNP filed action in courts and got the elections put off. If things had gone according to the gazette notification issued by the President, by now the elections authorities would have started accepting nominations. The UNP will continue to engage in disruptive activites until the Supreme Court decides whether anyones fundamental rights had been infringed by the declaration of a general election.
The former finance minister claims that the economy is on a downward trend because of the change of government. The President invited me to take over the government precisely because of the collapse of the economy during the previous government. In such circumstances, what any democratic country would do is to hold a general election and have a new government elected to power. Because the President was in our government he knows how we handled difficult situations. We managed to find the money to fight the war. We managed to complete a large number of major development projects that no previous government had been able to get off the ground. We did not allow the people to feel the effects of the 2007 world food crisis. Even though the worst global economic recession since the 1930s took place in 2008, the people of Sri Lanka were not even aware that there was such a worldwide recession.
Even though the world prices of crude oil rose to levels never seen before or since during those years, we managed to minimise the fallout from the global oil crisis as well. Within a period of nine years, my government increased the US Dollar per capita income of the country threefold. The average economic growth rate during those years was 7.4%. The exchange rate was Rs. 131 to the US Dollar. The debt to GDP ratio was 70%. On the 9th January 2015 we handed over to the new UNP government an economically stable country. Four years later however the country is now in a perilous state. The most serious aspect of the economic crisis facing this country today is the foreign currency debt burden.
When I assumed office as President for the first time in 2005, there was a war in the country. However the economy was not in such a bad state as it is now. At that time too, the debt to GDP ratio was 90% but the proportion of foreign currency debt was not as high as at present. I made it a point to inform the people from time to time in writing, of the foreign currency loans that the UNP government was taking through varous sources such as Sri Lanka Development Bonds, Sovereign Bonds, Syndicated Loans, Currency swaps etc, because I knew that once we were back in power, this debt burden would be the biggest problem that we would have to face. Within a period of about three and a half years, the yahapalana government had taken a total of more than UDS 20.7 Billion in foreign currency loans alone. Due to this debt burden it will take a while to turn things around. It should be plain to everyone that those who are trying to revive the previous government and rule without holding elections, are incapable of turning this country around. It was they who destroyed the stable economy that we had created. This is why they are so reluctant to hold elections.
In 2006, after the war with the LTTE resumed, the people of this country, the trade unions, consumers, professionals, businessmen and all sections of the population made it a point to refrain from doing anything that would disrupt the war effort. It is because of that public support that we were able to end the war that no one else was able to bring to an end. I wish to request the people to extend to us the kind of support they gave us during the war, in order to get this country out of the economic crisis it is now in. This is the last opportunity we have. If our effort fails, this country will end up like Greece.
We will have to work on the assumption that there is a situation of national calamity with regard to the economy. We will have to put a stop to burdening the people with taxes on the one hand and then spending lavish amounts on importing vehicles for ministers, spending money on ceremonies and excessive amounts on foreign travel as the UNP government was wont to do. I have to make it clear that after the next general elections, we will have to appoint a suitable number of ministers so as to be able to have a stable government. Before everything else, this country has to have a stable government. However that new government will have to keep expenditure under strict control.
The President and the people of this country know that only we can extricate this country from the crisis it is in. After we assumed power in November 2005, we had to face many challenges. When we obtained a loan of USD 500 million from the HSBC in 2007 at the height of the war, the UNP surrounded the bank and told them not to give us that loan and if they did, the money would not be repaid under a UNP government. In April 2009 when the war was in its final stages, an IMF loan to which were were entitled as a member state was delayed.
At that stage, I spoke to a friendly Middle Eastern country and obtained a pledge of USD 500 million and we were able to work around that obstacle. Soon afterwards, Prabhakaran died, the IMF released the loan and we never had to take the USD 500 million that had been pledged by the friendly Middle Eastern country. The former finance minister says that the credit ratings agency Moodys has downgraded Sri Lanka. It would have been surprising if they didnt. In 2015 when we handed the country over to the UNP, all those ratings were going up. They started coming down only after 2015.
I have to say that there is a subtle political element in these ratings as well. In 2009, immediately after the war when our credit ratings should have gone up, we were downgraded. But the markets had complete confidence in our government and no one took any notice of the downgrade. The President entrusted the country to us because he knows that we have the capacity to meet such challenges as well. The UNP too is well aware of that fact - which is why they speak to foreign journalists and diplomats on a daily basis in a campaign to convince the outside world that it is undemocratic to hold a general election. They know that if a general election is held and a government led by us comes into power, we will solve all these problems. The government that we will form together with the President will be a powerful and people oriented government.
It is now barely a month since the change of government on October 26. What we have now is only an Interim Government. When a downward trend manifests itself, it is difficult to turn things around in a month or two. As the general election which would have enabled the people to elect a stable government has been delayed, it will take some time for a stable government to be formed. During this interim period, I request the people to stand by us and to participate in the effort to restore economic stability to this country. The people will remember that during our period of rule between 2006 and 2014, we took every measure possible to avoid imposing heavy burdens on the people. This is why we reduced the price of fuel and some essential foodstuffs soon after assuming office on October 26. We reintroduced the fertilizer subsidy and reduced taxes on agricultural incomes so as to reduce the burden on the people and to increase production.
The people living in this country are aware of the difference in the situation that prevailed before 2015 and after 2015. The Cabinet Spokesman of the previous government has publicly stated on numerous occasions that in 2015, the people had not voted for a change of government due to any lack of food and clothing. He said that the people voted for a change in 2015 for the sake of democracy. But after that change of government, the people ended up without democracy, without the right to vote and without food and clothing as well. Is that not what happened The endeavour that we are engaged in now is Sri Lankas last chance to come out of the crisis it is in. Let us all join hands to defeat the forces that seek to destroy this countryby perpetuating their rule without holding elections.
May the blessings of the Triple Gem be upon you.

Govt. Keen to boost tourism industry - PM
The new government is very keen and focused on boosting the tourism industry which had been overlooked for the past three years, said Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was addressing the Tourism industry stake holders on current issues on Friday.
He said he would re look at multiple taxes that are been imposed at various levels for the hotel industry and try to introduce a more friendly tax structure towards hoteliers. The Prime Minister also said that the government would look at introducing new regulation for the informal tourism sector that is now enjoying zero tax.
Airing his views on the travel advisories, Rajapaksa said that there should be a regular dialog with the embassies and update them on the current political situation. The Prime Minister will launch a direct communication strategy through diplomatic missions to inform the global travel industry about the ongoing political situation in Sri Lanka, to ensure the growth in tourist arrivals.
It was pointed out that the advisories only caution travelers from visiting Sri Lanka and not state to stay away from Sri Lanka. The premier said that this matter would be taken up by the Foreign Ministry and addressed.
The main reason for travel advisories is that insurance companies have increased their insurance premium considering Sri Lanka as a risky destination to travel. However, the government will try to get the premium reduced by explaining the real situation, Director General of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Upali Rathnayake said.
Rajapaksa said that thought would be also given to a suggestion made by the Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) and Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators Association (SLITO) to consider allowing India, China and Gulf nations to visit Sri Lanka and offer them free visa on arrival. Currently tourists have to apply online or pay on arrival to obtain a visa to visit Sri Lanka.
We request the Prime Minister to consider a temporarily removal of the Online Visa system for a certain time frame for all countries, said President, THASL Sanath Ukwatte. He said that they have noted that there are no major cancelations due to the current political situation.
Arrivals in October had increased slightly by 5% as against previous year and industry has also showed a 10.6% growth so far this year.
Ukwatte said that tourism stakeholders conveyed to the Prime Minister that they wanted the current political issue settled soon as it may have negative impact to the country.
Colombo City Tourist Hotels Association President M. Shanthikumar said that the City hotels are facing cancelations only in the in the conference (MICE) market. One conference scheduled for December has been shifted to Indonesia which some other events have been re scheduled.
He however said that the tourists are concerned about the ongoing street protests in Colombo and police and riot squads on the road.

Hayleys Agriculture continues Training Programmes with A Level Science Teachers
In response to a request made by the National Institute of Education in September 2018, Hayleys Agriculture Training School; a training institution registered under the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), conducted yet another training programme on Modern Technology in Agriculture on November 1 - 2, 2018 for 55 A Level Science Teachers who hailed from Western, North Western, Central and Southern Provinces.
With the rising of the world population and limited availability of arable land, countries in the developing world are going to face serious problems in the area of food security. According to population forecasts, the world population will rise from 7.4 billion to 8.5 billion in 2030.
Experts claim that 90% of the population growth will be observed in developing countries. There has to be a 50% increase in food production to meet the demand for food. However, only about an additional 10% of current arable, non-protected land will be available for cultivation. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 48% of the crops are damaged because of weeds, fungus, and infestation by insects. In addition, climate change and its impacts such as average increase of global temperature by 0.170C per decade causing frequent occurrences of intense droughts and floods and increase in the number of dry days are posing serious challenges to food production. Sri Lanka has no option but to follow the developing world and turn to innovative and modern technology in agriculture if we are to overcome these challenges and maintain food security.
It is also observed that adoption of technology is not taking place at the required pace in Sri Lanka. According to a research paper titled Factors constraining Farmers adoption of new Agricultural Technology Programme in Hambantota District in Sri Lanka: Perceptions of Agriculture Extension Officers written by K.N.N. Silva, University of Ruhuna, - it is seen that a majority of AI officers perceived that only 40-60 per cent of farmers actually adopted a new technology programme that had been introduced recently. As for the percentage of farmers who proceeded to adopt each stage of the multi-stage process, the majority of the farmers in the community progressed to the awareness stage but only about 50 per cent of farmers continued until the final adoption stage was reached. Among the factors constraining the adoption could be cited incompatibility and complexity of new technology and socio-economic and cultural constraints in addition to lack of resources.
Inadequacies in extension intervention, technical training and information were also seen as the main issues that compromised the information and knowledge network. Therefore it is evident that farmer communities at large should be educated regarding the complexity of some of the technologies which will help better and faster adoption. The training programme of Hayleys Agriculture, targeting A Level Science teachers is right in line with meeting this need.
The traditional methods of cultivating are not yielding profits with social, economic and political factors changing at a rapid pace. The younger generation is moving away from agriculture to other more lucrative vocations.
Hayleys Agriculture, a trailblazer, trendsetter, and a leader in introducing new technology to Sri Lanka has embarked on a programme to inspire the next generation to take up agriculture in a commercial manner. The training programme consisted of sessions such as Agricultural pest and disease management and chemistry, Agricultural mechanization, Agricultural irrigation systems,and protected houses, Drone Technology, and Electro Static Spraying (ESS) Technology.

Heart with nature
If you want a child to learn about discipline, teach him/her the pleasure of maintaining a good home garden. If you want to teach him/her what satisfaction is, then let that child experience the pleasure of maintaining a good home garden. If you want that child to have a balanced personality then make sure he/she interacts with nature.
Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K.N.K. Jayathilake on the principles of maintaining a beautiful home garden.
The success of your home garden depends a lot on the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. If you want to make your home garden sustainable there are some recognized principles. The first principle is combining imagination with order.
First impressions mean a lot in the society we live in. The state of your garden tells an outsider a lot about you. For example if you want to ingratiate yourself with your boss then you might like to invite him over to your house for dinner. While walking into your house if he is instantaneously attracted to your garden, then the opinion he forms about you is very positive. Or maybe you want to start a relationship with someone, then having an attractive home garden should be on top of your list of priorities. If that person walks into your house and is instantaneously attracted to your home garden then the impression you give that person is that you are an individual with an orderly lifestyle, who is efficient and responsible. On the other hand if your garden is disorderly then the impression you give to an outsider is that you are lazy, untidy and you cannot overcome your sloth.
So the first principle is that there has to be some order in your garden, some unity. You need to identify in your home garden how the plants, trees, pathways, arches need to be organized. Maybe there should be matching flower beds on both sides of the pathway, and maybe an arch or two should be above the pathway. Plants with colorful flowers in the sunshine are so beautiful to look at. You can even use various statues in your garden depending on your preference, stated Jayathilake
Maybe there should be a pond with the sunlight falling directly upon it creating that shimmering effect. Perhaps you can also introduce palms which are so beautiful in a garden. Maybe you can position them in a row or on both sides of the path. Just use your imagination and do not overdo it. Stick to simplicity. You can even have some palms near the pond. You can even include a fountain with water moving. The movement of water has a soothing effect. Ultimately the success of your garden depends on the feedback you get, so do not be afraid to learn when you are criticized about your garden.
Also, depending on the colors you have, you can position flower beds of the same color in parallel to each other, or position flower beds of different colors in parallel to each other depending on your taste. There needs to be harmony in a way that pleases the eye. There needs to be a certain order. There needs to be patterns. You need to use your intuition when it comes to shape and sizes. Plants of the same size, height and color can be grown along borders, said Jayathilake
It is quite possible that like art, the knack for gardening maybe inborn. But you can also learn how to be a good gardener. Also there needs to be a sense of proportion.
Small plants for larger buildings are not suitable. The features need to be in proportion to the architecture of the surrounding buildings. Big plants for larger buildings are suitable. The more variety you have when it comes to colorful plants, the greater your enjoyment. But remember the garden needs to be maintained. The grass needs to be cut, the trees need to be pruned and the weeds have to be pulled out. Again there needs to be symmetry, added Jayathilake.
You need to be mindful of soil erosion when you are living near a slope. Also sunlight is important- how long does it fall and where does it fall When dealing with the Symmetry factor you need to position the plants and pathways in places that the sunlight falls. Sun loving plants need to be positioned at places sunlight falls, while being in proportion to the architecture.
You of course need to be a little practical and you cant grow as many plants as you want. After all you are living in Colombo with limited space and you cant grow plants like the Hanging Garden of Babylon. Too much of anything is not a good thing.
The soil condition must be taken into account. Is the soil fertile Is it sandy soil Is it clay soil or gravelly soil A good drainage system is important and irrigation is important. When rain water is not sufficient we need to apply water externally to the crops and this is called irrigation. And getting rid of excess water can be termed drainage. When irrigating there are certain factors to be considered such as the crop type, cropping system, land pattern, soil type and climatic factors such as the Environmental temperature, Relative Humidity (moisture content in the atmosphere) & Wind Speed. The direction of the wind is also of great importance. Strong wind can be harmful to the smaller plants. So trees can be used as barriers that can reduce the strength of the wind and protect smaller plants. If the wind is too strong Perennial trees must be grown or fruit trees can be grown. The trees must be strong. You also need to be mindful as to how much compost or organic manure needs to be used. Organic Manure consists of Compost, Cow dung and poultry litter, explained Jayathilake.
Also even seeing attractive birds in your garden adds to the pleasure of maintaining a beautiful home garden. Birds of different colors add value to your garden in way that water fountains and statues cant.
Sound pollution, dust and traffic fumes from cars can be a problem if you are living near a road. Trees can act as a defense against these problems. An advantage to using plants as noise blockers is that they absorb sounds best in the high frequencies that people find most annoying, added Jayathilake.

The science and secret behind blemish-free skin
How effective is The Body Shops Tea Tree Oil
Tea tree plants have ever-so-cleverly evolved the ability to produce chemicals that stop bacteria cells in their tracks, catching them before they get the chance to multiply. Owing to this property, tea tree extracts can speed up the healing process, getting rid of blemishes more quickly.
Staying true to the brands promise of providing more natural alternatives to skincare, each product in The Body Shops Tea Tree range is enriched with varying potencies of extracted tea tree oil. Fortified further with Tamanu oil -which too possesses antibacterial properties that can blast those blemishes into oblivion-, the Tea Tree series also contains Lemon tree oil with its highly aromatic fragrance and purifying properties, helping to cleanse and soothe blemished skin.
The 100% vegan Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash is infused with Community Trade Tea Tree Oil, which along with its proven antibacterial properties, also deeply cleanses all skin types by removing impurities and excess oil -without over-drying the skin. Use this soothing gel-based face wash daily, for skin that feels notably refreshed, appears less shiny, and looks visibly clearer.
It is a little-known fact that the process by which Tea tree oil is extracted is a tricky one. Let alone the distillation process; even if the wrong variety is picked and at the wrong time, the benefits wont be as effective. Thankfully, The Body Shop works with only the most knowledgeable of suppliers who have perfected the process down to a T!
The Body Shop in Sri Lanka has now expanded its Tea Tree skincare range to include the Skin Clearing Facial Wash in a new jumbo sized 400ml bottle, and last month, The Body Shop visited its fans at the Kandy City Centre to introduce this new product, at the same time rewarding loyal customers with free consultations and mini-makeovers. Customers that visited the kiosk were also awarded free samples, and also participated in an exciting #TeaTreePower selfie competition to stand a chance to win a Tea Tree hamper.
Problematic skin is best tackled byfollowing the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash with the Tea Tree Oil Toner, paired with the Tea Tree Anti-Imperfection Daily Solution serum, and the Tea Tree Anti-Imperfection Overnight Mask.
Shop the new Skin Clearing Facial Wash and the entire Tea Tree range at The Body Shop flagship store in Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel in Alexandra Place, and at the Kandy City Centre.

Part 6: Financial management plan
Your good idea is likely to turn into your worst nightmare if you ignore or are unrealistic about the financial aspect of your business. If youre one of those creative types or a mover and a shaker who hates to work with numbers, you may decide to blow off the financial part of the business plan.
Doing so, might cost you at minimum some thousands of Rupees you need to grow your business and at maximum the very existence of the business itself.
This financial analysis is often the most difficult part of a business plan for small business people. It is easy to wax poetic about your great idea and how it will make the gang rich. But putting real numbers to those projections is hard work. Even so, you have to do it. You have to crunch some realistic numbers to go along with your realistic plan.
Not only the difficult part but financial management is the most-often neglected part of every small-business venture. Dont let it be yours! Before you launch your business, do the research to come up with the financial projections we describe in the following sections. But before you do any of your financial projections, consider the following: Ask your finance advisor (if youre working with one) to show you examples of similar financial projections from other business plans to use as a guideline. Dont bother projecting more than three years out; the assumptions you make will be too vague. (Exception: Some outside investors may require five-year projections.)
Thoroughly identify the assumptions you make. The conclusions you reach will be no better than the quality of your assumptions. Prominently itemize these assumptions in your business plan to allow the reader to know exactly what they are and how they were made.
In the likely event that you dont know how to produce the pro forma profit and loss statement, balance sheet, and cash flow projections (all of which we explain in the following sections), you can (a) hire a finance advisor, (b) hire a business-plan consultant, (c) purchase a business-plan-software package, (d) learn to use spreadsheet software and do the projections yourself.
We recommend that you use a program such as Microsoft Excel for your projections. If you dont know how to use a spreadsheet, either find out how (from computer-training companies in your community or good books on the topic) or have someone else set one up for you. If you dont understand the difference between a profit and loss statement and a balance sheet, let us tell you - . Spreadsheets and financial statements are tools that every successful small-business owner needs to understand. You can find out how to use them now or later  but sooner is better!
A. Pro forma profit and loss statement
A pro forma profit and loss statement is a projected income and expense plan that summarizes your estimated revenue and expenses over a specified period of time. As we said, the accuracy of your pro forma profit and loss statement depends on the quality of the assumptions you make.
If you make good assumptions going in, then you can expect meaningful results. Preparing a pro forma profit and loss statement forces you to think through the questions you need to answer to arrive at the assumptions you make. Estimating your expenses for your pro forma profit and loss statement is relatively easy. The most difficult assumptions you have to make are your sales and other income (revenues) and your gross margin (gross profit).
Many small-business owners generate two or even three separate proformas - for example, a best-case scenario, a middle-case scenario, and a worst-case scenario. Prepare your profit and loss projections for the first three years of your business (unless youre seeking venture capital funding, in which case the first five years may be required). Anything longer requires too many far-out, hard-to-make assumptions.
Compute the firstyears pro forma on a monthly basis and the second and third years on a quarterly basis. If you dont know how to read financial documents, much less prepare them, we suggest that you pick up a book on guide to investing or take a good class in how to read financial statements with a known accountant.
Also, you can take advantage of business plan software (such as Business Plan Pro), most of which include financial projection templates.
B. Balance sheet
A balance sheet measures your businesss resources (assets) and obligations (liabilities) at a particular time.
The balance sheet is important to understand and, incidentally, is just as relevant to your personal financial situation as it is to your business one. As a matter of fact, if you apply for a loan at a financial institution, youll almost certainly have to submit a personal balance sheet. (If you arent currently keeping one to track your familys assets, you should be.)
Although we recommend that every business include a balance sheet in its business plan, its especially relevant for those businesses that have significant noncash assets tied up in such categories as inventory and accounts receivable. As with the profit and loss statement, prepare a projected balance sheet for the first three years of business; project the first year on a monthly basis and the second and third years on a quarterly basis.
C. Cash flow projections
Cash flow is the amount of cash that moves through your business in the form of receipts (representing an increase in cash) and expenses and capital expenditures (representing a decrease in cash). Cash flow is the practical side of the accounting equation, representing the cash required to keep your business operating on a day-to-day basis.
Dont confuse cash flow with profitability, an accounting term that measures the results of the entire operation of the business (of which cash is only one important part) over a given period of time. While profitability provides the benchmarks for measuring the effectiveness of your operations, cash flow is what pays the bills.
As a prospective business owner, you need to project your businesss cash needs before going into business so that you know how muchmoney you need to raise. As with profit and loss and balance sheet projections, project your cash flow needs for the first three years of the business.
Keeping Your Plan Current
Guarantees are dangerous in small business, but we can make two without hesitation: The immediate progress of your business will deviate from your original plan. Your business will change dramatically from what youve envisioned even in the first year. Deviation and change are constants in this sometimes roller-coaster endeavor, but deviation and change are why many small-business owners select this career path in the first place.
To make the necessary adjustments in response to the deviation and change youre sure to experience, you must keep your business plan current. Take a day away from the office every 6 to 12 months to dissect the important parts of your business plan -particularlythose involving staffing, marketing, distribution, and product development -and answer the following questions: Has the business developed according to plan within each of these areas (staffing, marketing, distribution, and product development) If not, why
In areas where the business hasnt developed according to plan, do you want to get back on track What adjustments will you make in each area to get back on track Given the passage of time, where do you want your business to be a year from now, and what changes should you make to support that new direction Then work at making your changes to the plan, remembering that, if those changes have a financial impact on your business (most important changes do), you must also apply the changes to the pro forma profit and loss statement and to your balance sheet and cash flow projections.
A significant change in bottom-line income will obviously impact key balance sheet numbers, which in turn will affect such key measures as the debt-to-equity ratio and the current ratio. Extreme variations in these ratios influence your credit lines, your relationships with lenders and vendors, and your long-range plans for capital expenditures and new hires.
Creating a business plan is a one-time experience, but keeping it up to date is an ongoing task -which, when you think about it, is not unlike the relationship between starting a business and actually running and maintaining one.
Appendix
The appendix of a business plan is usually the last section to appear in the business plan. Although not required, a well-structured appendix can go a long way toward convincing your reader youve got a great business idea, or indeed that you have thoroughly thought through your idea.In general, here are few of the documents you might think to include in your business plan appendix:
Charts, graphs, or tables that supplement information from other sections of your business plan; Any agreements or contracts that you have with clients or vendors; Licenses, permits, patents and trademark documentation; Product illustrations or product packaging samples;Resumes for each of your executive team members; Contracts and supporting documents for anything else; Contact information for attorneys, accountants, advisors, and so on
Finally, it is better if you review your Business Plan every six months, at least, during the first three years.

Joint TU Committee protest calling for General Election
The Joint Trade Union Action Committee (JTUAC) will hold a mass protest near the Fort Railway station on Tuesday (27), demanding early General Elections to end the current political impasse.
Holding a General Election at the earliest is the best option to overcome the current political impasse. All political parties should agree to hold a Parliamentary election and let the peoples sovereignty prevail, Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Leslie Devendra said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
Devendra said that the people were unhappy about the performance of the former UNP led Government and it should be up to the people again to appoint a government of their choice.
He said it was not prudent to hide behind the constitution or the law in an attempt to put off polls and added the best way out of the current imbroglio was to hold General Elections and let the people decide. Devendra said as trade union members and civil society members, the Joint Trade Union Action Committee has come forward to galvanize the people and ensure peoples sovereignty prevails.
While approving the Presidents decision to appoint a new Prime Minister and change of governance, he said the UNP led government had robbed the Central Bank through the Bond scam, Sold state assets to foreign entities and brought the economy down.
Devendra said Tuesdays protest was only the beginning and the the Joint Trade Union Committee will organize similar events until elections are held.
Meanwhile, Public Service Trade Union president W.H. Piyadasa said the UNPs economic policies which are based on new liberal and capitalist concepts were not suitable to Sri Lanka.
He said Ranil Wickremesinghes new liberal economic policies had only pleased the west and had undermined local enterprises and the development of agriculture.

King Kohli steers India to victory in final Australia T20
Sydney, Sunday: Captain Virat Kohli smashed an unbeaten 61 to steer India to victory with two balls to spare in the third and final Twenty20 against Australia on Sunday, ensuring the series ended all square.
The prolific batsmen lived up to his reputation, coming in when the two openers fell in quick succession after an entertaining 68-run partnership to prevent Australia earning bragging rights ahead of their four Test series starting next month.
The home team won a nail-biting and rain-affected first match in Brisbane by four runs, with the second in Melbourne abandoned due to persistent showers.
I thought overall skill-wise we were better today, said Kohli. When out openers get into the zone they are difficult to stop. There were a few nervous moments in between, but (for me) its always easy when the guys at the top do what they do. After losing the toss and being told to bowl, India restricted Australia to 164-6, with all-rounder Krunal Pandya taking four wickets and DArcy Short top-scoring on 33.
Despite losing, Australian captain Aaron Finch said he was proud of the team.
The way we fought was outstanding, he said. Still fair bit of work to do but were going in the right direction which is nice. Feeling good for the Tests.
Australia were boosted by strike bowler Mitchell Starc being back for his first T20 international in two years, replacing Jason Behrendorff.
He caused opening batsmen Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan trouble but they took apart Nathan Coulter-Nile at the other end, each cracking a huge six in plundering 29 runs off his first two overs.
Their confidence was soaring and the strokes were majestic as they hammered 22 off Marcus Stoinis opening over.
Finch brought Starc back in desperation and he delivered, trapping Dhawan lbw for a highly-entertaining 41 off 22 balls.
Adam Zampa then bowled Sharma for 23, giving them a glimmer of hope. AFP

Chasing 327 lose four wickets for 53
Lanka staring down the barrel at 3-0 whitewash
England continued to reap the benefits of blunders done on the field by Sri Lanka to place themselves with a very good chance of making a 3-0 sweep of the three-Test series at the SSC grounds.
When play ended on the third day yesterday, Sri Lanka were struggling at 53 for four wickets in their second innings, still 274 runs adrift of the target of 327 they need to reach if they are to avoid a whitewash, and with only six wickets in hand.
Only two teams before have whitewashed Sri Lanka at home - Ricky Pontings Australians in 2004 and Virat Kohlis Indian side in 2017. Joe Roots side are on the verge of joining them when the Test resumes today on the fourth day.
England has already sealed the series by taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead and Sri Lanka who have always been behind them can show some heart by making a game out of this contest.
The target could have easily been a much smaller one than they have been asked to chase, had Sri Lankan spinner Lakshan Sandakan not allowed Ben Stokes the luxury of two lives courtesy of bowling no-balls by overstepping his mark.
This sort of amateurism on the part of the bowler cost his side valuable runs. Stokes was given a life at 22 when he was caught at cover by Danushka Gunathilaka and at 32 when he was snapped up at slip by Dhananjaya de Silva. He made full use of his luck to help England recover from a shaky 39-4 to 128-5 putting together a stand of 89 with Jos Buttler.
England were eventually dismissed for 230 in their second innings with Buttler making a top score of 64 off 79 balls (3 fours) and Dilruwan Perera helping himself to another five-for (5/88) haul his second in the series and eighth overall in his career.
It was another case of England clawing their way back from a top order collapse to post a competitive total.
In the first innings Sri Lanka used up all their reviews by the 22nd over and had several decisions they could easily have turned in their favour ruled out by the umpire and yesterday it was the case of losing out on no-balls.
All ten wickets fell to the spinners with Malinda Pushpakumara (3/28) and Sandakan (2/76) taking the remaining five.
Sri Lanka began the day well claiming four England wickets for 39 runs within the first hour of play, but undid everything in the next hour to allow England off the hook through Sandakans negligence for which he and the support staff are answerable.
It is usually considered a cardinal sin for a spinner to bowl no-balls and Sandakan was twice found guilty of doing that and to make matters worse when he had dismissed the batsman.
Karunaratne was off the field for the entire England innings recovering from a blow to the chest from Ben Stokes while batting in the first innings, but it didnt affect his batting position as opener.
Umpiring errors were galore yesterday with six decisions being revoked and none of the sides losing their reviews.

## Title: As a librarian, I am truly thankful

As a librarian, I am truly thankful
I spend a lot of time bemoaning the nonsense that patrons get up to in the library (lets face it, its a lot of damn nonsense), and sometimes all that tomfoolery really bums me out. I start to question my lifes work. I wonder why I even bother. This week, in the middle of writing another list of stuff that annoys the hell out of me when it comes to librarianship, I closed the computer and took a mental health break. I drank a beer, watched some very bad television, and cuddled my dog. I refused to check my work email. The next morning, I opened my computer back up and came up with a new list; a list of things that librarianship has given me. A list I feel thankful foreven if those things werent necessarily appreciated at the time.
I. Patience
This is a big one. Whether its waiting for somebody to finish up on the computer so you can close the library and FINALLY eat dinner or being forced to listen to a patron complain about the fact that the temperature is too cold/hot/lukewarm for their liking, librarianship has taught me infinite patience. Its hard to sit and listen to people complain. It makes you want to stuff your fingers in your ears and start humming the theme from Jeopardy.
At the end of the day, library work is a service joband that means that the number one thing youre doing is serving the public. That includes listening to complaints. And sometimes when I am listening to people complain, I realize they just want someone to listen to them. So it has helped me have patience in other areas of my life, to know that at the end of the day we all just want to the opportunity to bitch about something. We want people to listen to us. Okay, yes, some people are just big ol pillsbut its helped me realize that if I have patience for them, I can basically deal with anything. Which leads me to my next point
Article continues after advertisement
II. A Sense of Humor
Oh buddy! Do you think I was always this naturally hilarious Well, I mean, the kernel of humor was inside me all along, but working in a library has allowed me to view all of humanity as a spectacle ripe for amusement. Have I watched someone look up the phrase take me to the search engine that starts with a G on Google Yes. Have I been asked how to spell fornicate while sitting at the reference desk Also yes. Has a small child ever asked me if I was going to have a baby because I decided to wear a peasant top one Storytime after eating six donuts in the staff lounge A hearty HELL YES. I mean, if I cant laugh at myself, then whats the point Being around a variety of people in a community space has allowed me the true and delightful joy of understanding that people are just goofy all the time. So am I, a total dummy, and frankly I think thats terrific.
III. Empathy
Whether its dealing with an angry patron or comforting a crying kid at Storytime, library work has allowed me to better understand and more carefully respond to other peoples emotions.
As a person who has a difficult time parsing what I feel a lot of the timeonce on a date when a woman told me that I made her happy I responded like a human happy meal, huhthis has been extremely important work for me. Having empathy for patrons means that I can better understand their problems and work more diligently to provide answers. Having empathy means that I am sometimes exhausted at the end of the day, true, but it also means that I am giving support to others in a way that will work to better my community. If I cant have empathy for people, then I cant be a librarian. Because above all, serving the community means understanding that everyone needs to be supported and understood. If I want that for myself, then I need to provide it. Its a reciprocal relationship.
IV. Getting to the Root of a Problem
Article continues after advertisement
Library work means that I am daily figuring out the Rubiks cube of the human brain. Trying to dig free the question that library patrons are actually trying to ask me has turned me into a master detective. Whether its someone wanting directions or a person asking me about a book they read as a child but they can only remember that it had a bumblebee in it, my brain is hyperactive; Im constantly thinking-thinking-thinking at my job. This has happily bled into other areas: now when Im trying to solve problems in my day-to-day personal life, I can use the skills that Ive gleaned from assisting patrons with their questions. I can help friends, too. I can better understand the connections between issues. I can say with 100 percent assurance that my own life is enhanced because of helping other people.
V. Better Writing
Okay, to clarify, I mean this has helped me better understand the human condition. To be a better writer, a person needs to readconstantly. Id also like to add that for myself, being a better writer has also meant being around a wide and varied assortment of patrons. Its meant listening to the weird and funny ways that people interact with each other.
Listening to conversations and questions. Watching how people in a community fight and hope and love each other. I am a better writer because of what patrons have taught me. This is truly invaluable. I am extremely grateful for it. Lit Hub

Man City, Liverpool cruise as Spurs end Chelseas unbeaten run
LONDON, Saturday: Manchester City stretched a relentless winning run to eight games by thrashing West Ham 4-0 on Saturday, while Tottenham ended Chelseas unbeaten start to the season with a stylish 3-1 win on Saturday.
With Chelsea stumbling, second placed Liverpool remain the most likely challengers for Citys title after sweeping to a 3-0 win at Watford that keeps them two points behind the leaders.
Manchester United are 14 points adrift of the leaders as Paul Pogba was hauled off by Jose Mourinho as they failed to break down Crystal Palace in a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford.
Everton leapfrogged United to move up to sixth with a 1-0 victory over Cardiff, while Claudio Ranieri won his first match in charge of Fulham in a 3-2 thriller over fellow strugglers Southampton.
City have now won 12 of their last 13 games with the only dropped points coming in a creditable 0-0 draw at Liverpool last month.
If you see the result which was 0-4 especially after the international break it is good, said City manager Pep Guardiola.
You see Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester United they struggle.
David Silva and Raheem Sterling continued their scoring streaks inside the first 20 minutes.
The roles were reversed from Citys flying wingers 11 minutes before half-time when this time Sane showed great composure to turn home Sterlings pass and Sane completed the rout in stoppage time.
At Wembley, Tottenham put Chelsea to the sword as goals from Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min lifted them above their London rivals into third place.
I am so happy. All credit to the players because they were fantastic, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said.
We need to be humble and recognise playing like this we can do big things. Our challenge is to be consistent.
Pochettinos side were on fire from the start and Alli headed home from Christian Eriksens free-kick in the eighth minute.
With Chelsea looking lethargic, Kane blasted Tottenhams second from long-range in the 16th minute.
Chelsea were unable to stem the tide as their 12-game unbeaten league run came to a crashing halt when Son danced through the visitors defence to score a superb third in the 54th minute.
Substitute Olivier Giroud got one back in the 85th minute, but it was no consolation for Maurizio Sarris men, who drop down to fourth place.
Today I didnt like anybody, Sarri groaned. We played very badly in all directions; physically, mentally, technically and tactically.
I knew we had some problems and with this performance it was clear to everybody we have problems to solve.
Liverpool remain on Citys coat-tails as Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino all struck in the final quarter at Vicarage Road.
The first goal was brilliant football and the free kick from Trent (Alexander-Arnold) was a dream. It was a good game against a good side, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said.
Klopps front three clicked 23 minutes from time when Firmino fed Sadio Mane and his cut-back was prodded home by Salah for his ninth goal of the season.
Alexander-Arnold then bagged his first for the campaign at club level with a sumptuous free-kick after opening his account for England in the international break.
And despite having captain Jordan Henderson sent-off, Liverpool added a third through Firmino a minute from time.
How United wish they had the same firepower as after a bright start they again faded and Palace held out for just a second point in seven Premier League games.
Pogba and Romelu Lukaku were fit enough to start after missing international duty for France and Belgium through injury, but failed to spark the hosts and Pogba was even withdrawn for Alexis Sanchez in the search for a winner that never came.
We did not have enough aggression or intensity, lamented Mourinho. We gave the opponent time to have he ball and did not press enough. Ranieri couldnt stop Fulham leaking goals in his first match in charge at Craven Cottage, but did secure a first win in 10 league games as Aleksandar Mitrovic scored twice to edge a five-goal thriller.
Leicester earned a 1-1 draw at Brighton thanks to Jamie Vardys penalty after James Maddison was shown two yellow cards inside 28 minutes. - AFP

Multi-pronged strategy to raise Rupee fall
Investment Promotions and International Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardena said a proper mechanism has been prepared setting several goals to strengthen the rupee value.
He was addressing media yesterday at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo.
The rupee value under this plan will be to strengthen the Rupee to around Rs.160 against the US Dollar within the first year after presenting the first budget of Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It has been planned to bring down the rate further to Rs 140 during the second year.
It has been planned to implement a national programme to establish investment promotions and export promotion industries.
A tax concession package will be introduced aiming to increase investments.
Under this move, 5,000 export processing and export service villages will be established.
Three new free trade zones, which produce readymade garments, will be established centralising the Katunayake, Maharagama and Meegoda areas under the tax concessions provided by the Board of Investment (BOI).
Those investments will receive a five year tax relief period.
He added that the biggest ever package of tax concessions will be implemented by this government.
He added that a significant amount of monies earned through exports by Sri Lankans are in foreign countries.
Only a part of the export revenue earned by entrepreneurs including exporters is sent to Sri Lanka.
As a result of various tax acts, the rest of the monies are kept in foreign countries.
With the Investment promotion tax fee package it has been estimated that the country will receive around US$ 10 billion in two years.

No One Has a Monopoly on Death
Its snowing. Im thinking back to January 1979, when I received a letter whose writer told of his sudden fear of snow; for an instant the snow floating down to earth had been a poison that smothered all life.
Its snowing. Im remembering the farmer on TV who told of walking out into his fields in early November, and the snow, the first very sparse and fine snow, burned like fire. But now, so much later, nobody would believe it. Even though practically every child knows that snow and fire are no longer opposites. Not in a radioactive world.
So. Its snowing. The snow is no longer snow, but its still snowing.
Were now so fearful that were not even fearful anymore, but the fear is spreading anyway, and the closest word for it is sorrow.
We see whats happening, and were happy about whats not happening. We compare whats terrifying with whats even more terrifying. We compare limited nuclear war with total nuclear war, and the comparison deprives us of the last remnant of our natural horror.
We see thousands of dead birds, thousands of dead and maimed soldiers, thousands of death wishes and their violent expressions, but as long as we see all this annihilation in all its well-known forms, at least were seeing something, and as long as we see something, total annihilation hasnt happened yet.
So fear has become a strangely useless feeling, discarded and purposeless, and over these chaotic fragments of a fear that once had a social purpose, sorrow has spread. The future is dead and buried, and the work of transforming ourselves from mourners to survivors, or at least to people capable of surviving, has barely begun.
At night we sit frozen to the TV screen, and night after night the same thing happens: first President Reagan comes on and then General Haig comes on, and night after night Reagan says were optimistic, and night after night Haig says that no one, and he means no one, has a monopoly on virtue.
No, were not really afraid anymore.
Its true that we have a map of Denmark on which someone has shown what will happen when, in due course, an atomic bomb falls on Copenhagen. What will happen is that Copenhagen will turn completely red, and the redness wont pale to gentle, pink radioactive fallout until way out in western Jutland.
But we dont react anymore. We dont pack any little brown suitcases with the things wed need if we were trying to escape, and we dont pile up any sandbags, either, in the bedroom or by the front door. We see whats happening. We cant get alerts, and we dont want any. But occasionally, in the best Jules Verne fashion, in a dream of getting through all dangers, we set out and arrive safely at our destination, where we dig ourselves down into a mountain cave deep under the Siberian snows.
January 1982
Its snowing. It keeps on snowing. The radio broadcasts music and weather reports, music and weather reports, and the call goes out for all civilians to refrain from driving, making unnecessary telephone calls, or contributing to the chaos with their usual defiant attitude toward the weather gods, but to get themselves home, before the roads close, before one part of the country after another shuts down and the whole country ends up paralyzed. At that point, military tractor-tread vehicles will be the only things capable of moving the immovable snow around, the only ones bringing food out to the stricken families, the only ones providing fodder for the radios spirited accounts of birth and death in the drifting snow.
And meanwhile Haig appears on the screen. Ive said before, he says, and Ill say again, he says, that no one has a monopoly on virtue. If the USSR thinks they have a monopoly on virtue, the U.S.A. knows how to break that monopoly. And that goes for every bit of virtue in the world: if it threatens our American interests direct and swift access to virtue, then the U.S. has the power and the ability and the will to use its power to defend that virtue. Virtue is certainly not an inalienable commodity. It must be fought for and won again and again; this means that a great country certainly can lose its virtue, but not without fighting, for a great country can never lose its greatness or allow itself to lose face.

OSheas Italy reeling after All Blacks bashing
ROME, Sunday : Conor OSheas Italy turn their focus to next years Six Nations and the Rugby World Cup with morale at a low after another bruising defeat 66-3 at the hands of New Zealand.
We didnt do many good things but they were too angry and eager to redeem themselves after last weeks defeat, said OShea after the All Blacks avenged their loss to Ireland with a ten-try rampage in the Stadio Olimpico.
Italy have never beaten New Zealand in 15 meetings, losing 68-10 in their last match in Rome in 2016.
But this time the Azzurri didnt even score a try, settling for Tommaso Allans penalty kick in the first 15 minutes.
Italy were also without injured skipper Sergio Parisse for their November Tests.
The Stade Francais No. 8 missed the 26-7 defeat to Australia in Padua the previous weekend and Italys 28-17 win over Georgia.
Dean Budd -- one of two New Zealand-born players lining out for Italy -- said that 12 months of hard work and preparation had come undone within minutes.
The ball was too fast and we couldnt keep up, said the 32-year-old Treviso lock.  AFP

One month on
With the new Government chalking up one month in office today (26), there will no doubt be stocktaking by many on the progress or otherwise of the country during this short period. Some positives were immediately felt with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa reducing the prices of certain essential consumer items and also doing away with the fuel price formula of the previous regime. This had an immediate impact with private buses and trishaws reducing their fares. There is no doubt that the burning issue of the Cost of Living made the previous Government extremely unpopular that led to the February 10 backlash at the polling booth. It is hoped that more relief will be forthcoming once political stability returns and the new Government finds its bearings.
The public might also weigh in the pros and cons of the decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 26, that has led to the present political imbroglio and the sense of uncertainty sweeping the length and breadth of the country. Supporters of the Presidents move would certainly justify his action. To any person observing the passing scene President Sirisena and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did not hit it off so to speak. There was a wide gulf in the outlook and political vision between the duo. Wickremesinghe was wedded to the neo-liberal ethos and bred in the Western school of thought while the President is essentially a son of the soil and indigenous in his way of thinking and political outlook.
True, the SLFP, which he represents, has undergone almost a sea change in its policies, concepts and worldview of things since the Chandrika days and today has almost shed its socialist oriented political philosophy.
Even so, the conduct and actions of Wickremesinghe and the manner in which he pursued his neo liberal policies would no doubt have been too much to take for the President which eventually led to the formers ouster. The massive corruption that was part and parcel of these policies that took place within the Government certainly would have influenced the Presidents decision to a large extent. Of these, the Central Bank Treasury Bond scam that did monumental damage to the economy from which it is yet to recover was often the subject matter of blame directed at the Government by the President.
The irreconcilable differences apart, the moves by Wickremesinghe to usurp the powers of the Executive would also have hastened the hand of the President. As he (the President) stated in a newspaper interview, the former Premier paid scant regard to his directives and acted on his own accord. What was discussed and agreed upon at Cabinet meetings was observed in the breach, with Wickremesinghe and his cabal doing their own thing to the great detriment to the public well-being. The President claimed in that interview that the former Prime Minister was stubborn and arrogant and even when the people registered their warning on February 10 and he (President) asked the former to step down and nominate an alternative from the UNP, Wickremesinghe brushed aside the suggestion. Perhaps the last straw that broke the camels back was the plot to assassinate the President.
Under these circumstances there was no chance that the President could continue with the unity government which when looking at it now had certainly been a misnomer. There was not only a wide disparity between the partners in terms of policy but also chemistry of the two leaders. In this backdrop governance no doubt had been rendered impossible and the situation had to be salvaged if the country was not to suffer dire consequences as a result of the conflict. The President took the only available option in terms of the Constitution.
Be that as it may, a resolution of the present standoff should be given the utmost priority by the warring parties if the country is to be saved from peril. The intransigence on both sides has led to Sri Lanka acquiring a bad reputation vis-a-vis its democratic credentials. The President has offered a way out by suggesting that he was willing to accept as Prime Minister a member from the party that shows a majority in Parliament, provided that Standing Orders are adhered to.
All that the Speaker has to do is follow the correct procedure. The ball is now in the Speakers court. He will have to decide if he going to stick to his guns and prolong the agony or pull the country out of the current impasse. For all intents and purposes the battle is now between the President and the Speaker. The last thing the country needs is a head-on collision between the Executive and the Legislature.
Things could come to a head with plans by both the UNP and the Government to flex their muscles in the form of public demonstrations. This can lead to serious breaches of the law that could have dire consequences. It is time for some neutral party to intervene to break the gridlock and salvage the country from such an eventuality.

The Minister was participating in a conference at the Ministry auditorium attended by ministry officials and Samurdhi Movement trade union officials recently.
The trade union officials who attended the meeting had to stage strikes and protest campaigns in the past demanding job permanency. They said that certain higher officials had given a deaf year to their appeals ignoring their just cause.
The Minister, who gave a patient hearing to the matter, said he will grant job permanency to over 14000 Samurdhi Development Officers and directed officials to grant the appointment letters in a week.
Since appointments of Samurdhi Managers is handled by the Public Service Commission (PSC), the Minister advised officials to make arrangements in consultation with the PSC to grant the appointments.
The Minister also directed officials to ensure that some justice was done to the families of emplooyees in these posts who had died without job permanency.

People rejected party in power  Ranil
A party rejected by the people has come to power through a conspiracy and buried democracy in the country. The people should line up against it, Former Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing a protest rally near the Kandy clock tower on November 24. He said the people should end the Sirisena-Rajapaksa period and protect the Yahapalana government which upheld democracy.
The rally themed Voice of Justice for democracy was jointly organized by the United National Front and the Collective of Civil Organisations.
Wickremesinghe said the Sirisena-Rajapaksa coalition had to accept that they did not command a majority in Parliament.
He said his government has 121 parliamentarians and was prepared to show a further increase on it in the future.
He said the Speaker had faced problems which no other Speaker in the world had faced so far and they highly valued the straight forward actions taken by the Speaker.
He said the group in conspiracy destructed the dignity of parliament through their activities on the first second and third days. They removed the Speakers chair and tried to rob the mace. Even a Christian MP was seen hurling the Bible against the opposition. At last, the Speaker was forced to summon police to the House to control the group which caused a conflict. He said that once the Buddha in a discourse to the Licchavi dynasty had said they should assemble in peace, discuss in peace and disperse in peace. The former Prime Minister said he would question whether people who claimed to be descendants of King Dutugamunus dynasty acted in accordance with that advice.
He said a general election had to be conducted under the tenure of a lawful government.
It should be held after all parties in Parliament agreed on it.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said the so called government had faced defeat at every turn. In the end, it will be wiped out by the people at the election.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Dr. Rajitha Senanayake, Lakshmn Kirella, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Mano Ganeshan, Rauff Hakeem, Ravi Karunanayake and Ven. Dambara Amila Thera spoke.

Prime Minister in A special statement says
President invited me to build country
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, called on all citizens of the country to join hands to defeat the forces that seek to destroy the country by perpetuating their rule without holding elections.
In a special statement Prime Minister Rajapaksa said the people voted for a change in 2015 for the sake of democracy.
But after the change of Government, the people ended up without democracy, without the right to vote and without food and clothing as well, the Premier said.
The endeavour we are engaged in now is Sri Lankas last chance to come out of the crisis it is in, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said.
He also said, What we did on October 26 was to form an Interim Government that would have lasted only until the conclusion of the General Election that has already been declared, but temporarily put on hold by courts. We never had any intention of running an administration through the government that has been formed at present.
The whole country can see that only a few members of the Joint Opposition hold office in this government. That is because this is only an interim arrangement. I have been stressing ever since I took oaths as Prime Minister that our foremost aim was to go for an election in order to establish a stable government. However, the objective of the other side is to revive the previous government and to rule the country for as long as possible without holding any election at all. That is the reason for the present political situation, he said.
Some people ask me why I accepted office when there was less than 18 months to go for the next elections. I have heard members of the UNP saying that if I had been patient for another 18 months, I could have won the ensuing election with a two-thirds majority.
We did not form a government to continuously administer the country but to hold a general election. The President explained in his Address to the Nation that he appointed me as the Prime Minister only after things reached a stage where he had absolutely no other option. When the government is entrusted to me in such circumstances, I cannot in all fairness, shun the responsibility. This was not a question of political power. The fate of our country and the futures of our younger generation were at stake.
It is now barely a month since the change of government on October 26. What we have now is only an interim government. When a downward trend manifests itself, it is difficult to turn things around in a month or two. As the general election which would have enabled the people to elect a stable government has been delayed, it will take some time for a stable government to be formed. During this interim period, I request the people to stand by us and to participate in the effort to restore economic stability to this country. The people will remember that during our period of rule between 2006 and 2014, we took every measure possible to avoid imposing heavy burdens on the people. This is why we reduced the price of fuel and some essential foodstuffs soon after assuming office on October 26. We reintroduced the fertilizer subsidy and reduced taxes on agricultural incomes so as to reduce the burden on the people and to increase production.
The people living in this country are aware of the difference in the situation that prevailed before 2015 and after 2015. The Cabinet Spokesman of the previous government has publicly stated on numerous occasions that in 2015, the people had not voted for a change of government due to any lack of food and clothing.
He said that the people voted for a change in 2015 for the sake of democracy. But after that change of government, the people ended up without democracy, without the right to vote and without food and clothing as well. Is that not what happened The endeavour that we are engaged in now is Sri Lankas last chance to come out of the crisis it is in. Let us all join hands to defeat the forces that seek to destroy this country by perpetuating their rule without holding elections.

Readers of the world unite
As Allen W. Wood observed in 1981, while it is easy to write an above-average book on Marx, it is hard to write a good one. The global outpouring of new volumes, editions and translations this year, the 200th anniversary of Marxs birth, tests this claim to destruction. Too many books Not for me. There can hardly be a subject so rich. Marxs writings, when combined with Engelss, will fill 114 hefty volumes. Only a tiny fraction was published in Marxs lifetime, and of that, far too much was devoted to the ponderous demolition of now forgotten rivals. Some of the most interesting works, such as the 1844 Manuscripts, the German Ideology, and the Grundrisse, were only published decades after his death, sometimes in volumes coloured by ideological editorial decisions. Marx can be interpreted, reinterpreted, analysed, reduced, contextualized, medicalized, flattered, or diminished. He can be lauded for his vision, energy and influence, and condemned for exactly the same things. His vanity and catastrophic money management, but also his medical complaints (boils, liver) and family life of tortured devotion, constitute a tragicomic background to dry economic theory and sometimes petty political machinations. There are many Marxes, even more Marxisms, and therefore there is an unending potential for writing something new and original. But for thinking about Marx there is no time like the present.
If, despite gloomy forecasts, interest in Marx survived the fall of the Berlin Wall, the financial crisis of 2008 brought him back centre stage. Even more recently those of us sardonically shaking our heads at the naive Marxist analysis of capitalisms teenage critics gulped at the nakedness of Donald Trumps apparent determination to live up to the analysis of The Communist Manifesto: The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. Marxs theories of ideology, of alienation, of economic crisis and of class have rarely seemed so apt. Now you can say you are opposed to capitalism in the United States even outside your own four walls.
And so, the cry goes out: will no one rid us of this turbulent economic system Will it be Marx In his early writings he foresaw a future society in which alienation and class struggle would be transcended. For a brief moment, it looked as if the European uprisings of 1848 would be the path. But with their failure Marx realized that revolution must be on a longer fuse, and turned to the economic analysis of capitalism. The main fruit of this work was, of course, Capital Volume 1, published in German in 1867, and reprinted shortly after in several revised editions and translations. It was the only one of his major economic works published before he died. A vast mass of manuscripts, including the drafts of Capital Volumes 2 and 3, were left virtually untouched for the last fifteen years of his life. It is something of a mystery why this is so.
What, though, did Marx hope to accomplish with his economic writings If I were his editor now, writing the catalogue copy, my first draft might be: In this masterly volume of immense learning and erudition, Marx shows that capitalism has developed technology at a pace unprecedented in human history. In just a few short decades society has moved from the sluggish era of the horse and cart to the explosive energy of railways and steamships. But this achievement is also its doom. Capitalisms tragic fate is that it cannot cope with the growth it has stimulated, and will be riven by crisis after crisis until eventually it collapses. At the same time, it has created a class, the proletariat, who will lead a revolution that ushers in a new, classless, society, in which all human beings can flourish.
This, probably, was Marxs hope. Unfortunately, nowhere in his writings, published or unpublished, did he devise a clear account of capitalisms economic demise and its replacement with communism. What does he achieve Perhaps that capitalism has a dirty secret. It is fundamentally unjust, surviving only through the exploitation of the worker. But Marx always distanced himself from moral critique. Could it be that he was, as he says, simply trying to lay bare the laws of capitalism The Cambridge economist Joan Robinson remarked that Marxs dynamic, historical perspective is full of penetrating insight. Yet that alone hardly seems to justify the cult of Marxism or his influence in the twentieth century. What, then, is the secret of Marxs success
The story, if not the secret, is insightfully laid out in Sven-Erik Liedmans heavyweight A World To Win, which begins with a discussion of whether yet another vast book on Marx is needed in the light of Gareth Stedman Joness recent, monumental Karl Marx: Greatness and illusion. Liedman appears shocked at Stedman Joness tendency to emphasize illusion over greatness, and aims to redress the balance. He is a veteran Marx scholar. Not many can say, as he does, I have carefully gone through everything Marx left behind, and his knowledge of the secondary literature is equally impressive.
This is a landmark publication and will, deservedly, become a standard reference point, even if there is an occasional awkwardness in Jeffrey N. Skinners translation. Liedman brings out some underappreciated aspects of Marxs life. For example, contrary to the common assumption that Marxs work for a left-wing American newspaper, the New York Daily Tribune, was a rather minor aspect of his life, Liedman suggests that Marx relied on it as a crucial source of income, and suffered severely when demand for his writing fell. I also appreciated the sensitive discussion of little Freddy, the illegitimate son of the familys maid and companion Helene Demuth. Engels accepted responsibility but Marx seems almost certain to have been his father. It is also fascinating to see the chronicle of Marxs obsessions in his later years with modern developments in mathematics, chemistry, biology and social anthropology. While neglecting his economic work, Marx also turned to the exhilaration of the Paris Commune of 1871, and controversies with other left-wing thinkers, until illness ground him down. Marx found France a fertile source for reflection and it was French politics that made him famous too; according to rumours he took an organizing role in the Paris Commune, a claim he denied in a letter to The Times.
Liedman does not shy away from difficult issues, such as Marxs apparent anti-Semitism, and, less often noted, his sexism. Nevertheless, in his account Marx seems much more flexible and subtle in his thinking than he does in the orthodox Marxist tradition, as it descended from Engels via Plekhanov. He is keen to correct what he calls widely held misinterpretations (although what you think is widely held depends on the company you keep). Perhaps it is inevitable in a work of this scope, but Liedmans tendency to dismiss decades of work by leading scholars with a cursory flick of the keyboard can send a shock through the system. Can it really be true, for example, that Allen Wood has no grip on Marxs theory of alienation from the Theses on Feuerbach and The German Ideology onwards He is perhaps at his strongest taking us through the production and revision of Marxs texts, going into rare detail regarding developing and rejected drafts, different editions, appendices, forewords, afterwords and correspondence about texts, their production and their frequently disappointing reception, even despite multiple enthusiastic reviews by Engels. Yet we remain with our mystery. Why were the remaining volumes of Capital left in abeyance Times Literary Supplement

SLASSCOM urges swift constitutional settlement
The Sri Lanka Association for Software and Services Companies (SLASSCOM) representing the knowledge services and innovation industry, Sri Lankas fifth-largest and highest value-adding exporter, requests a swift, constitutional settlement to the current political crisis.
Jeevan Gnanam, Chairman SLASSCOM, speaking on behalf of the SLASSCOM Board of Directors and General Council, said, As an industry body, we are disappointed to see the current state of indecision and the inability to arrive at a swift settlement by the parties concerned. We are also deeply concerned about the worldwide media publicity on the happenings in parliament and the resulting negative impact done to our image in the eyes of the world. Unfortunately, this damage cannot be easily undone.
We have already heard of companies who are concerned to setup or expand their business operations in Sri Lanka based on the present turmoil. While we understand any nation can and will encounter political changes, we ask for transparency and a consistent application of law and order, upholding the views of the judiciary and the constitution. We urge those in authority to put aside personal prejudices and narrow agendas at this point and collaborate towards the national interest. Unless this is done immediately, Sri Lanka will not be viewed as a compelling or competitive destination to attract foreign investment. In this regard, we also ask for sustaining policies and executing initiatives already put in place with the participation of the industry. In closure, we again request a swift settlement without permitting this uncertainty to continue, while upholding the constitution and the laws of the land.

Sri Lanka steps into lucrative Electronic Sports industry with IGE South Asia Cup
InGame Entertainment in association with the Sri Lanka Esports Association (SLESA) will be hosting the first ever INGAME Esports South Asia Cup in December this year. SLESA is working with the national Esports federations of India, Pakistan and Maldives to select the best team to represent their country in the game League of Legends. The selected teams will be flown to Sri Lanka for the event happening on December 7, 8 and 9 at SLECC.
The teams will be competing for a prize-pool of USD 5,000, one of the largest in the region, which will be awarded to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the event. The event is set to be the catalyst for organized E-sports in South Asia and is expected to have viewership from Esports enthusiasts from across South Asian countries. InGame Entertainment and the Sri Lanka Esports Association are working together to position Sri Lanka as the hub for South Asian Esports - a sport that will soon eclipse the traditional and position itself as one of the most popular sports in the world.
Electronic Sports, better known as Esports is the competitive play of video games. The video games industry has been a juggernaut in the media landscape for decades now, with video game revenue reaching over $100bn in 2017. Esports is a subset of that industry, where video games are played competitively by individuals and organisations and watched by millions around the world. Much like a traditional sport such as Cricket, it is structured around teams and competitive tournaments governed by national and international bodies enforcing rules and regulations. Esports is also increasingly being included in traditional sporting events like the Asian Games; a team from Sri Lanka attended the 18th Asian Games in August this year to represent the country in Esports. The International Olympic Committee is currently discussing the inclusion of Esports in the 2024 Paris Olympic Gamesl.
The massive growth that Esports is enjoying today is due to a fast growing millennial viewer-base. According to Esports analyst firm Newzoo, Esports had an audience of 222 million viewers globally in 2018 - this is on par with sports like Golf today. It is expected to increase to 316 million by 2021. Viewership is fueled by massive prize-pools for tournaments - the largest being a $25 million prize purse awarded at the 2018 Dota 2 International held in Vancouver this year. With this many viewers for the sport, brands are moving towards Esports to associate their brand with Esports teams and events. Sponsors and advertisers are enjoying above average engagement levels from Esports viewers, as the primary form of consumption of coverage is through online streaming on channels like Twitch, YouTube and Facebook. The latest entrant to the Esports advertising landscape is Nike with their Dribble & Carry campaign. Nike signed on League of Legends player Jian Zihao, where the word Carry means a skilled player carrying his team to victory.
The Esports scene in Sri Lanka has also seen tremendous growth over the past few years, with organisations like InGame Entertainment hosting large-scale digital entertainment and Esports competitions annually and running active social communities through Gamer.LK. Esports in Sri Lanka is governed by the Sri Lanka Esports Association, consisting of 10 competitive Esports clans and organisations working together. Sri Lankas largest Esports Championship, the Sri Lanka Cyber Games held within Play Expo, receives over 3,000 participant registrations and has foot traffic of 25,000 over the 3 day event. Brands like Dialog, SLT, Mobitel, Red Bull and MAS have already gotten involved heavily in the local Esports scene by organising and sponsoring events.

Steps to create your own organic garden!
Organic gardening avoids the use of chemicals to make plants grow or protect them from insects, relying instead on natural gardening principles used for thousands of years. Permaculture organic gardening goes a step further and also emphasizes growing plants sustainably, working with rather than against the grain of the natural environment. Permaculture organic gardening is growing in popularity as more people realize that it offers an inexpensive and relatively low-maintenance way to grow their own fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers.
1. Choosing a location
Observe your property at different times of day. Consider which areas receive the most sun, which are in shade for much of the day. Depending on where you live, if sunshine is a scarce commodity, you will want to expose plants to receive as much as possible. On the other hand, in desert regions, you will not want your plants to be in the area most likely to be parched by sun exposure. Also think protecting your garden from the paths where strong winds tend to blow through your property. Even a small property will have microclimates - notice these and plant accordingly to give different plants either more sun or more shade according to their preference.
2. Selecting plants
Avoid disease-prone plants which require time-consuming chores such as spraying and pruning by the gardener. Select plants which will thrive in your area rather than those which will require extra labor on your part to protect them from the environment. Select plants which serve multiple purposes, such as fruit trees which will put forth blossoms in one season, fruit to pick in another, and provide shade for when you want to sit and enjoy your garden's natural beauty. Native plants are also more likely to attract local pollinators such as bees, and to draw butterflies so that your garden contains even more natural beauty.
3. Making a home for your plants
Raised beds require less physical effort on the part of the gardener and also benefit plants, providing better air circulation, more protection from spring chills and improved usage of water. Raised beds also mean a small permaculture garden is an option even for apartment dwellers and others with little available space since you can rely on containers and vertical gardening principles.
4. Feeding your plants
One of the key concepts of permaculture organic gardening is to avoid waste. Having a garden gives you a means of re-using natural waste such as eggshells, apple cores, coffee grinds as well as yard waste which many people throw away. You can either purchase or make a compost bin to turn this organic material into gardening gold which can be used to help your plants grow.
5. Watering your plants
Modern gardeners who do not follow sustainability principles tend to draw heavily on piped-in water resources, often using hoses and sprinklers to make plants which require abundant water grow in a desert climate. Permaculture organic gardening tries to use natural water as much as possible, maximizing the use of groundwater and rainwater. Rain barrels allow you to collect rainfall and extend its use over longer periods of time.
6. Protecting plants from pests
Eschewing the use of chemicals does not have to mean a garden full of pests. You can use companion gardening principles, growing plants which deter pests near those which attract them. There is also a natural synergy between some plants which means planting them near each other increases your yield. Also, just as some herbs have a medicinal effect on human health, they also offer benefits to plants which grow near them. Read all about companion planting here.

Sumanthirans order leaves Kiriella speechless
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera yesterday called for the holding of a General Election. He also criticized the behaviour of the Members of Parliament during the last two weeks.
We feel sorry to see the plight that befell former Leader of the House, MP Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament on Friday after calling for a name vote.
He was admonished into taking orders from MP Sumanthiran,whose party has only around ten to twelve votes in the House,Ven Elle Gunawansa Thera said.
We feel sorry for the UNP and sad to see the pitiful state the UNP has fallen into under these circumstances, the Thera said.
The Thera also stressed that the country needs clean, intellectual and credible politicians.
He urged the authorities to go for a general election and let the people elect proper political representatives for them and for the country, rejecting the wrongdoers of the past. The Thera was speaking at a press conference organised by the Yuthukama National Movement in Colombo yesterday.
Ven. Gunawansa Thera said at present, the there are issues in the economy and in the tourism industry. He also added that politicians should not criticise and speak out of turn by making irrespnsible comments.
Ven.Gunawansa Thera said they expect to present a national agenda before the country and will support those who accept it at the next election. However, the Thera said that the country needed a stable government at present; otherwise it will face to an anarchy in the future.
Yuthukama National Movement president Gevindu Kumarathunge said the only solution for the prevailing crisis in the country is holding a general election.
The Thera said by now, no party in Parliament has either the majority or a mandate to form a government as the mandate given to form a Unity Government in 2015 has been cancelled with the resignation of President Maithripala Sirisenas Sri Lanka Freedom Party forming the government.

Sustainable waste management an opportunity, not a burden
In a recent interview with a national newspaper, Director of the Waste Management Authority revealed that Sri Lanka produces over 7000 Mt of waste per day.
The World Bank estimated that per capita solid waste generation in Sri Lanka is 5.10 kg per day. Arithmetically, it works out to over 20,000 Mt of solid waste produced per day.
According to a document titled Sustainable Approaches to the Municipal Solid Waste Management in Sri Lanka by I.L.N. Hikkaduwa, and others of University of Moratuwa (2016), the collection of solid waste by all local bodies amounts to 3423 Mt per day.
Comprehensive and accurate measurement of waste generation and disposal in Sri Lanka continues to be an issue at national, provincial and local levels. There is no proper mechanism to coordinate this information and research, or to compile results with an intergraded approach. Scientifically drawn estimates and evolutionary predictions are essential to work out an evidence-based strategy to draft and maintain a sustainable waste management mechanism.
Experiences
Leaving statistics aside for the moment and if we move into our core issue, we find that solid waste has become a serious environmental and socioeconomic issue in Sri Lanka. The current haphazard disposal of waste on top of the population growth, migration and rapid urbanization will accelerate the issue further in the coming years.
In many developing countries in Asia and Africa, waste is increasingly being used to produce both materials and energy, and recycling now saves more greenhouse gases than it generates. Yet, Sri Lanka, as a developing country, is still faced with the major challenge of improving its inadequate and unsustainable waste management systems.
It appears we have not learnt from the results of completed and ongoing programmes of other countries, particularly in African and European nations. This writer believes we could learn a number of lessons from Germany whose waste recovery rates are one of the highest in the world. Germany shows how the waste industry contributes to sustainable economic production and management in her country by saving raw materials and primary energy.
German policy
Solid waste management is one of the most important and visible services that German local bodies provide for their citizens. Key to the successful accomplishment of this task is the development of an integrated framework that allows all the relevant aspects to be harmonised.
Many different actors and aspects are taken into account in order to organise solid waste management on an economically and environmentally sustainable basis. The approach identifies three levels that need to be taken into account when developing the framework:
(a) Different interest groups (e.g. local public agencies, citizens, private businesses, associations, NGOs)
(b) Technical aspects of solid waste management and recycling (e.g. waste separation and collection, transport, waste avoidance, re-use, recovery of raw materials, recycling, treatment and disposal)
(3) Frameworks and overarching aspects (e.g. legal, financial and policy frameworks, environmental and health protection, economic and social-cultural aspects).
The solid waste management system will vary from local body to local body, depending on the particular local context.
Objectives
Each local authority will define the specific objectives when developing its solid waste management plan in dialogue and negotiation with the various interest groups. As well as local councillors and administrators, this will also include citizens, and municipal waste management and recycling companies. NGOs may also play a big role.
Integrated solid waste management pursues several overall goals. It aims to solve existing solid waste management problems. It also aims to organise solid waste management and recycling on a cost-efficient, environmentally friendly and socially sound basis.
Above all, the authority understands that in order to ensure success of the system, citizens should support it.
Finally, waste management aims to develop stable organisational structures, create jobs in recovery and recycling loops, and promote economic development.
Activities
The planning process is divided into five phases. The first step involves identifying any solid waste management problems and defining in detail the objectives together with all the relevant actors.
A second step involves analysing the local conditions in detail and collecting relevant data. Key data include information on the quantity and composition of waste, on large waste producers in the area, on the methods of waste collection and transport, and on the existing infrastructure, i.e. landfills and recovery and recycling plants. The next step is to draw up a forecast of the future trend in volumes of waste over the next ten years. In particular, this involves studying the factors influencing this trend. These include e.g. population growth, economic development, consumer behaviour and changes in legal frameworks.
Based on this analysis a draft framework is prepared and an action plan drawn up that contains specific steps for implementation. These can include e.g. measures for waste avoidance, recycling and in some cases, the construction of new waste treatment plants.
Action
The action indicates whether the services are to be provided by private enterprises or by the local authority.
A key role is also played by public awareness-raising measures that can encourage environmentally sound behaviour and improve the separation of waste.
Finally, the framework and the action plan are approved by the local authority. During each step in the planning process, relevant stakeholders such as residents and private enterprises, are consulted in order to include their perspectives and expertise and increase their acceptance of implementation. This also enables stakeholders to experience local democracy for themselves.
Drawing up a solid waste management framework usually involves a great deal of work. In Germany local bodies finance this themselves. On the other hand, training for municipal employees is provided so that it will enable them to draw up and update a framework. This is generally organised in cooperation with other municipalities.
Treatment
Germany does not allow wastes to be landfilled without pre-treatment. The pre-treatment takes place in incineration plants or mechanical-biological treatment plants. Waste must be treated so that it cannot degrade inside a landfill. Pre-treatment and stopping untreated landfilling protect citizens health and the climate. Landfills do not emit landfill gas which contains methane and carbon dioxide. The German waste management system is totally financed by fees. There are no subsidies. There is a polluter-pays principle, means the producer has to pay for waste treatment or disposal.
The responsibility for packaging materials was already enforced in the Packaging Ordinance. It contains provisions on the obligation of producers and distributors to take back used packaging from the consumer. In order to meet this obligation, retailers can participate in a system for the collection and recycling of the packaging materials. With such regulation, Germany significantly reduced the proportion of packaging in municipal waste.
New policy
In Sri Lanka, management of solid waste is the responsibility of local bodies. However, except for a few municipalities, appropriate waste management cannot be seen in other local institutions. Whatever available is weak in planning and implementation. Sri Lanka repeatedly failed to fix longstanding issues despite expert suggestions for improvements.
The entire blame cannot be passed over to the local bodies themselves. They have their own problems. Some may lack the institutional capability and technical expertise to handle projects of this nature. Some do not generate enough financial resources to undertake such projects. Some may not have suitable lands for waste disposal. \The outmoded policy, laws and regulations and weak or total absence of monitoring by civic authorities or civil society are the other reasons. Above all, there is a lack of commitment by most local bodies resulting the least attention for solid waste management. The main reason is that most elected members of local bodies have very limited knowledge of the subject of waste management.
The solution is to rethink and rehaul. The Government authorities need to sit back and take note what is happening in other Asian and European countries in solid waste management. Its time they take a cue from other countries successes (particularly Germany) and draft a modern and sustainable national policy for waste management for Sri Lanka. We have enough and more professionals who possess experience and the knowledge how to do it. What is needed is a genuine commitment to make it happen.

Those no-balls: Sandakan was trying too hard says spin bowling coach
Spin bowling coach Piyal Wijetunge defending the two new no-balls that spinner Lakshan Sandakan bowled that cost Sri Lanka the wicket of Ben Stokes said that it was the first time it has happened with Sandakan and it was something new for all of them.
Perhaps he was trying too hard and trying to get bounce off the wicket. That is not an excuse. We must work on that, said Wijetunge at the end of the third day of the third Test at the SSC yesterday.
It was not only Wijetunge but also off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who came very close to being no-balled escaping on several occasions with borderline decisions.
This is an area that we need to work on. In Dilruwans case we are working on it and we are in the process of putting it right. He might get it right in the future, said Wijetunge.
I was not in the dressing room. I was overseas during the first innings. But I think the message would have gone to the bowlers. It is such a short time and it is not easy to work on. We have to take it seriously from here on, he said.
Wijetunge said that the general tendency is for the umpires to communicate with the bowlers whenever he is no-balled and when it was pointed out that there were 30 no-balls which the umpires had not detected he said: The umpires are there to do a job and it is their job to pick up the no-ball. It is not an easy job to pick each and every no-ball.
Wijetunge said that he had accompanied Sri Lanka spinner Akila Dananjaya to Brisbane where the bowlers action was assessed after it was reported at the end of the first Test at Galle.
He did the test two days ago in Brisbane. We are waiting for the results. The results will come within 14 days, said Wijetunge.
On the status on the third Test as it stands at the end of the third day Wijetunge said, We have not given up hopes. As everyone knows cricket is an unpredictable game. It is not easy to pull off something from this situation. But we are hoping for the best.
Sri Lanka left with a target of 327 to chase finished the third day on a shaky 53-4.
Giving reasons for the Lankan batsmens weakness against spin Wijetunge said, They have planned for each and every batsman of ours. The execution is perfect and working to plan. Our guys are struggling under pressure. We need to work on that as well. How to handle pressure in international games. As we know we have a young side. When you take the top seven apart from one or two others are learning the game and it will take time.
England batsman Joss Buttler stated that winning the series 3-0 would be a fantastic achievement
Itd be a great step. Pre-series Im sure Sri Lanka were favourites having beaten South Africa in that two-match series before. Its a great accolade for us, said Buttler who top scored for England with 65.
Its been a fantastic environment in the dressing room. I feel as a group everyone pulling in the same direction, enjoying each others company, pushing each other. Driving performances. Spoke about being patient a lot with the ball. To gain a 3-0 series win we have to do that again tomorrow.

Tiny ladder used to rescue hamster
Animal rescuers in Britain said they constructed a tiny ladder to rescue a hamster that spent nearly a week trapped inside a pipe.
The RSPCA said animal welfare officer Alison Sparkes responded to a Bridgwater, Somerset, England, home after multiple attempts to rescue Jamie the hamster from the pipe failed.
"Jamie was being looking after by a friend of his owner when he escaped and went down a (4-inch) wide pipe that housed the water pipes," Sparkes said.
"This vertical pipe was (3 feet) deep. The gap between the water pipes he squeezed through was about 4cm wide and was impossible to look down the pipe due to the pipes inside it," she said.
"They'd dropped a piece of thin rope down hoping he would climb up but after six days, still no luck so they called us."
"We knew he was OK as they'd been dropping food down and could hear him eating so I went home and cut a (3 foot) long ladder from some old wire mesh, then went back, fitted it in the pipe and that evening he emerged. Very thirsty, but OK," Sparkes said.

Tobacco during pregnancy increases babys obesity risk
Scientists reveal link for the first time as health officials warn vapes may drive young women to nicotine addiction and cigarettes
Mothers who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy increase the risk of their child becoming obese, new research shows.
The rate of tobacco use among pregnant women in the US is plummeting (though cannabis use is climbing), but health officials are still concerned about nicotine addiction among young women, particularly since e-cigarettes hit the market.
The new study by Kentucky University hammers home the dangers by revealing, for the first time, evidence that combustible cigarettes increase levels of a fat-fueling protein in a womans unborn baby.
The discovery sheds fresh light on a phenomenon that has been identified in previous research but could not be explained.
Tobacco among pregnant women in the US is dropping (as cannabis use climbs), but vapes have officials concerned about young womens nicotine addiction. This Kentucky study shows yet more reasons tobacco is dangerous to unborn babies
Previous studies already identified links between tobacco during pregnancy and low birth weight and premature delivery of the baby.
But evidence is now emerging of the way in which it affects the childs health in the long-term.
In the first study of its kind the team at Kentucky University found cigarette smoke chemicals cross the placenta - boosting amounts of a molecule called chemerin.
The protein is associated with obesity: the greater it is expressed, the stronger the likelihood of a child being overweight, and finding it hard to slim down.
Corresponding author Dr Kevin Pearson said: Our long-term plan is to study the impact of exercise during pregnancy and its ability to improve health outcomes in offspring.
However, as we began to transition our work from laboratory animals to humans, it quickly became apparent that a fairly high percentage of the pregnant population delivering at our hospital continued to smoke cigarettes throughout pregnancy. Thus, we set out to investigate the mechanisms of why babies born to smokers are at risk for later diseases.
The study published in Experimental Physiology was based on analysis of tissue which is normally discarded following birth. The researchers used the foreskins of recently circumcised newborn males to study levels in those exposed to cigarette smoke during pregnancy.
The samples are safe and simple to collect and the researchers had previously demonstrated it to have similar properties to other tissues - like fat. This would have been too invasive to collect from babies, said lead author Dr Leryn Reynolds.
The results showed chemerin was more prevalent in the skin of infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. More detailed analysis suggested that this increased expression corresponded with reduced DNA methylation - a process which regulates it.
Dr Reynolds said this suggests smoking in pregnancy leads to changes in the regulation of genes which play an important role in fat cell development and obesity. The team now plans to measure chemerin levels in isolated cells from the umbilical cord of both baby boys and girls - which is similarly easy to obtain.
They also hope to conduct experiments on smoke exposure during pregnancy in mice, as it is easier to control for other factors which might affect obesity. Further various tissues can also be measured to assess gene expression in order to better understand how smoke exposure in the womb impacts the whole body.
Dr Pearson said: In the future, we would love to work on ways to improve smoking cessation programs or ways that we can increase exercise levels in smokers as a way to combat the negative outcomes in offspring, but we are really just starting to scratch the surface in this area.

Trump confirms refugee deal with Mexico
US: Asylum seekers hoping to enter the US via its southern border will have to wait in Mexico while they are assessed, President Donald Trump announced Saturday, appearing to confirm a report about a bilateral deal published by The Washington Post.
The move was cautiously welcomed by some refugees currently at the border, even as Mexicos incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, who was quoted by the Post as confirming the agreement, later issued a denial.
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court, Trump wrote on Twitter. He added that the US will allow those who come into our Country legally and emphasized: All will stay in Mexico. The deal, which would overhaul US border policy, comes with Trump outraged over the presence of thousands of Central American migrants who marched to Mexicos border city of Tijuana hoping to enter the US for a better life free from the poverty and gang violence in their homelands.
For now, we have agreed to this policy of Remain in Mexico, the Post quoted Sanchez Cordero as saying. The government of new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will enter office on December 1.
But her office later issued a statement saying: There is no agreement of any type between the future federal government of Mexico and that of the United States of America. Trump has sent almost 6,000 soldiers to the Mexican border in support of Customs and Border Protection agents and National Guard troops already there, to forestall what Trump has called an invasion by very bad people. After a trek of more than a month from Honduras, nearly 5,000 migrants -- including women and children -- are now in Tijuana living in a makeshift shelter.
Trump is within his right. He is in his government, but he is not like other Presidents in his views of migrants, said a resident of the shelter, Carolina Flores, 38, of Honduras.
He sees us as a bug that is going to eat there, she added. We come for an opportunity! Another Honduran in the shelter, Orlinda Morales, 31, a housewife, said the reported new asylum rules seem very good because migrants will not be in limbo. We will get work here, she said.
Hundreds of the migrants lined up this week at a special jobs fair set up for them in the manufacturing city, but others remain determined to reach the US.
No formal agreement has been signed, the Post said, but US officials view the deal, which would see would-be refugees cases heard by US courts in Mexico, as a potential breakthrough in deterring migration. US asylum officers will begin implementing the new procedures in coming days or weeks, Homeland Security officials cited by the Post said.
Asylum seekers will be given an initial screening to determine whether they face imminent danger by staying in Mexico, where violence is widespread. In a statement issued on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made no mention of a deal but said that he and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had a constructive meeting with Mexicos future foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard over the caravans. - AFP

A universal alliance to counter gender violence
The International Day for The Elimination of Violence against Women was commemorated yesterday Sunday November 25. The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence is an annual international campaign that starts on November 25 and ends on December 10, Human Rights Day.
It is also a reminder to the world of the obligations and the responsibility we all must own at both the private and the public level to ensure that every woman, every girl, in all corners of the world lives in a world free of violence and fear. They must be enabled to enjoy their most fundamental right to physical integrity and security.
The reality of the problem today is grim. In every country, in every city or village, in conflict zones and refugee camps, in health pandemics such as HIV or Ebola and humanitarian crises caused by cyclones or earthquakes the female population becomes totally vulnerable. In such circumstances one out of three women are beaten, abused, stalked, assaulted, tortured, raped, trafficked and sexually exploited, coerced into slavery or into becoming drug mules. They are also subjected to honour killings, burnt alive for dowry and sold or forced into child marriage. This means over a billion women and girls of all ages are affected by such unspeakable violations.
Violence against women and girls is a horrendous global issue. It remains one of the most persistent human rights violations and a threat to billions of girls and women. Violence against women and girls knows no social, economic or national boundaries. It affects women of all ages and arises in various types of settings - taking many forms including physical, sexual or psychological violence, as well as economic abuse and exploitation. At least one out of every three women worldwide has been beaten, coerced into sex or emotionally abused in her lifetime, most often by a partner. Are you aware that globally, 47 percent of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner or family member, compared to less than six percent of murders of men Or those women represent 55 per cent of victims of forced labour and 98 per cent of the victims of sexual exploitation
The necessary global norms and standards to end violence against women have been set at various global conventions. But the actual shift came as part of the Gender Equality compact in the first ever, universal, comprehensive and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the United Nations in 2016.
We know what the underlying causes of this very complex and pernicious phenomenon is. Harmful traditions, customs and cultural norms, gender stereotypes and inequality and patriarchal political, economic and social structures manifest themselves in this most egregious violation of womens human rights. This in turn creates and perpetuates an environment of impunity for perpetrators. Men typically indulge in violence as an exercise of their inherent power, entitlement, superiority and a sense of ownership of women by them.
This is the mirror image of the sense of vulnerability, fear, shame, helplessness, resignation and dependence felt by women and girls who are victims and survivors of such abuse and violence. Enactment of laws, policies and special measures and their effective implementation including through targeted institutions and interventions by governments is vital. Movement building for mindset change and change in social norms by all sectors of society including the private sector, womens organisations and faith-based groups is a necessary complement. We now have insights on how we can change and demolish these structures that breed violence and despair for both women and their families and communities, hold them back from achieving their potential and leave them behind in every way.
All of this of course requires investment - of political will, social capital and financial resources. Apart from the immense emotional and psychosocial cost of violence against women and girls, there are high economic costs. Beyond the direct medical and judicial costs, child and welfare support, violence against women takes a toll on household and national incomes and budgets and poverty reduction efforts. This is on account of lost opportunities for education, income, productivity and employment of affected women and girls.
Experience has shown that when women are free from violence and have the power to make their own choices, the chains of poverty can be broken as families and communities grow stronger, peaceful and secure. Children are better protected and their chances of a better life become more viable while environmental awareness deepens and opportunities for civic and political engagement based on inclusivity and socially constructive values are able to flourish. As such, allocating adequate and significantly increased resources to ending violence against women is not only a legal obligation and a moral imperative, but a sound investment too.
The time for change is here and now. In recent years, the voices of survivors and activists, through campaigns such as Me Too Times Up, Advocates understand that while the names and contexts may differ across geographic locations, women and girls everywhere are experiencing extensive abuse and their stories need to be brought to light. This is why the UNiTE Campaigns global advocacy theme this year is: Orange the World: HearMeToo
Despite the enormous progress since 1975, women are still underrepresented in too many sectors of society, undermining progress and sustainable development. It constrains creativity and talent and suffocates inclusion and pluralism. This does not just harm women  it weakens the very fabric of societies. For the celebration of International Womens Day 2017, UNESCO will focus on Women and Art, showcasing the work of young women artists and discussing the way forward.
Although entire populations are affected by climate change, it is women and girls who pay the heaviest price. Most often due to the traditional roles they take up, women rely heavily on natural resources and are responsible for securing food, water and fuel for cooking. In times of drought, the search for safe water can take up to eight hours a day leaving them vulnerable to assault, rape or kidnapping. They face social, economic and political obstacles that limit their ability to deal with change that threatens their security.
When a country or a region faces a natural disaster, violence against women becomes less of a priority and mechanisms to protect them weaken. Women and girls often lose their support system after having been displaced and fall more vulnerable to trafficking. They are also disadvantaged in accessing a quality education, which makes them more likely to be unwitting victims of their environment. Women stand at the heart of communities. Their extensive knowledge on the management and use of natural resources are key to tackling climate change processes, in particular with water management and risk preparedness. Women and girls represent an enormous potential that must be integrated in the solutions to climate change. The full participation of girls and women - and their leadership - is critical to adequately respond to the effects of climate change.

Vasu charges sinister JVP, UNP, TNA nexus
While noting that a sinister nexus seems to have emerged between the JVP-UNP alliance and the TNA, Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara yesterday challenged the three parties to contest together at a General Election, if they were sincere about their new found friendship.
Nanayakkara charged a sinister nexus has surfaced between the JVP-UNP alliance and the TNA in Parliament only for petty political gain and each party seems to be clinging on to each other for mere survival.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday Nanayakkara challenged all three parties to contest together and defeat the government if possible at a General Election.
He also said trade union members will hold mass protest calling for a General Election shortly.
He charged that the JVP, UNP and the TNA were trying to put off elections as they fear certain defeat.
These people have done nothing for the country. They cannot go before the people seeking a mandate. This is why this sinister nexus has surfaced, for petty political gain he added.
Nanayakkara went on to say that the new government has already initiated several relief measures targeting the working people.
He said the government will not allow sinister elements with ulterior motives to derail such measures.
Nanayakkara said holding a General Election and allowing the people to decide was the best way out of the current political impasse.

Venture Engines Impact Award opens many doors - IgniterSpace founder
Sri Lankas pioneering entrepreneurship program Venture Engine has, to date, assisted hundreds of Sri Lankan startups in fine-tuning and accelerating their entrepreneurial efforts. Submissions for the seventh consecutive Venture Engine are currently being accepted via www.ventureengine.lk until December 10, 2018.
Recently, one of these startups, IgniterSpace, a Top Fundable Company at Venture Engine 2017, and that years Impact Award winner, leveraged its success within this program into a movement that promotes STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education across Sri Lanka.
A creative education company with a mission to inspire creativity to empower new destinies among young people, it does this by developing their cognitive skills and empathy to bring about positive change. This unorthodox approach to education, where students learn through experiments instead of being taught, is a hallmark of the social innovation that Venture Engines Impact Award is promoting. The Impact Award recognizes early-stage, for-profit ventures that foster positive social or environmental change, either directly or indirectly as part of its business operations. The first Impact Award winner was Venture Engine 2016s top-ranked Hire 1.
IgniterSpaces Co-Founder and CEO Jehan Wijesinghe said, Venture Engines Impact Award opened many doors for us. Before the program, we were a startup executing outside the limelight. And although we were highly successful in the growth of the number of customers served, we did not have the attention of the Startup community including fellow Entrepreneurs, Mentors, Investors, etc. Throughout the workshops and other events conducted, we were able to network with many parties who have ever since brought many benefits to our growth as a startup. Further, all the mentoring sessions were very beneficial in shaping our company as a whole. Many mentors that we had in the program are still involved in our startup journey today in some ways.
Additionally, the winners and runners-up of Venture Engine 2017, comprising Roar, IgniterSpace and Pregbuddy, also benefited immensely from a sponsored excursion to the Sankalp Forum, Asias leading platform for impact investing and entrepreneurship, which allowed many opportunities to interact with global stakeholders in this space.
Being awarded once again at the 2018-2019 cycle of Venture Engine, the Impact Award is presented by Indian Venture Capital firm Aavishkaar, which is also the title sponsor for the seventh edition of Venture Engine. The latest edition of Venture Engine is Aavishkaars third consecutive association with the program. Further, Aavishkaar has also invested in the local market by providing funding for Sri Lankan companies like Dulith Heraths Grasshopper and popular spice brand MAs.
Aavishkaar is joined by local startup incubation and acceleration platform HATCH and Sri Lankas largest telecommunications services provider Dialog Axiata PLC as sponsors for the Venture Engine programs newest edition.
A 2014 honoree at the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Awards (AREA) in Macau, Venture Engine continues to look at ways to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. It is in line with this mission that we partnered with social impact investor Aavishkaar to introduce the Impact Award for entrepreneurs in 2016, which recognizes high-potential, for-profit ventures that promote social innovation, commented Mr. Prajeeth Balasubramaniam, a Founder of Venture Engine and the Lankan Angel Network, and General Partner at BOV Capital.
And IgniterSpace Its doing great. We have more than 10+ MakerSpaces around the country where kids get together to identify real world problems and develop innovations to solve them using technology. Technology exposure is a core part of the program, including Electronics, Computer Programming, Robotics, Mechanics, etc. While practically exploring the usage of these technologies, the kids also empathize with and identify real world problems. In addition to our own MakerSpaces, we have also implemented our Innovation and Engineering curriculum across a constantly expanding number of schools island-wide where it has been adopted it as a part of the curriculum. Major cities such as Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Kurunegala, Negombo, Gampaha and Wattala have already been covered, Wijesinghe said.

Virtuoso robot band
Practice might be the way for human musicians to get to Carnegie Hall, but if you're a robot, it's not so tough - as long as your programmers have given you the proper advantages.
Meet the Z-Machines, a band made entirely of robots. There's Mach, a 78-fingered guitarist; Ashura, a 22-armed drummer; and Cosmo, a robot that plays keyboards with lasers. On paper, they're impressive, with only one thing keeping them from a record deal: They can't write music.
For that, thankfully, they have Squarepusher. When a team of University of Tokyo roboticists created the Z-Machines last year, it asked several artists to develop music the robots could be programmed to play, and the U.K.-based electronic composer was among them. His submission was a song called "Sad Robot Goes Funny," but after it was finished Squarepusher (aka Tom Jenkinson) wasn't done with his droid friends. He ended up writing an entire EP of material for the 'bots called, appropriately, Music for Robots, which was released last week.
The idea, Jenkinson says, was to find out if robots can play music that is engaging emotionally, even as they pull off feats of instrumentation human hands never could. "The robot guitar player for example can play much faster than a human ever could, but there is no amplitude control," Jenkinson says. "In the same way that you do when you write music for a human performer, these attributes have to be borne in mind - and a particular range of musical possibilities corresponds to those attributes. Consequently, in this project familiar instruments are used in ways which till now have been impossible." The robotic collaboration leads to music that's as familiar as it is impressive. Melodic and sweet - though admittedly a bit sterile - the songs go from cool and soothing to so rapid-fire they sound unlike anything you've ever heard before (probably because no human has ever been able to produce them).

Why Americans have a few babies
At first, researchers thought the declining fertility rate was because of the recession, but it kept falling even as the economy recovered. Now it has reached a record low for the second consecutive year.
Because the fertility rate subtly shapes many major issues of the day  including immigration, education, housing, the labour supply, the social safety net and support for working families  theres a lot of concern about why todays young adults arent having as many children.
Wanting more leisure time and personal freedom; not having a partner yet; not being able to afford child-care costs  these were the top reasons young adults gave for not wanting or not being sure they wanted children, according to a new survey conducted by Morning Consult for The New York Times.
About a quarter of the respondents who had children or planned to said they had fewer or expected to have fewer than they wanted. The largest shares said they delayed or stopped having children because of concerns about having enough time or money.
The survey, one of the most comprehensive explorations of the reasons that adults are having fewer children, tells a story that is partly about greater gender equality. Women have more agency over their lives, and many feel that motherhood has become more of a choice.
But its also a story of economic insecurity. Young people have record student debt, many graduated in a recession and many cant afford homes  all as parenthood has become more expensive. Women in particular pay an earnings penalty for having children.
We want to invest more in each child to give them the best opportunities to compete in an increasingly unequal environment, said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who studies families and has written about fertility.
At the same time, he said, There is no getting around the fact that the relationship between gender equality and fertility is very strong: There are no high-fertility countries that are gender equal.
Low fertility rate
The vast majority of women in the United States still have children. But the most commonly used measure of fertility, the number of births for every 1,000 women of childbearing age, was 60.2 last year, a record low. The total fertility rate  which estimates how many children women will have based on current patterns  is down to 1.8, below the replacement level in developed countries of 2.1.
The United States seems to have almost caught up with most of the rest of the industrialized worlds low fertility rates. It used to have higher fertility for reasons like more teenage pregnancies, more unintended pregnancies and high fertility among Hispanic immigrants. But those trends have recently reversed, in part because of increased use of long-acting birth control methods like IUDs.
In the Morning Consult and Times survey, more than half of the 1,858 respondents  a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 20 to 45  said they planned to have fewer children than their parents. About half were already parents. Of those who werent, 42 percent said they wanted children, 24 percent said they did not and 34 percent said they werent sure.
One of the biggest factors was personal: having no desire for children and wanting more leisure time, a pattern that has also shown up in social science research. A quarter of poll respondents who didnt plan to have children said one reason was they didnt think theyd be good parents.
Jessica Boer, 26, has a long list of things shed rather spend time doing than raising children: being with her family and her fianc; travelling; focusing on her job as a nurse; getting a masters degree; playing with her cats.
My parents got married right out of high school and had me and they were miserable, said Ms. Boer, who lives in Portage, Mich. But now we know we have a choice.
She said she had such high expectations for parents that she wasnt sure she could meet them: I would have the responsibility to raise this person into a functional and productive citizen, and some days Im not even responsible.
This generation, unlike the ones that came before it, is as likely as not to earn less than their parents. Among people who did not plan to have children, 23 percent said it was because they were worried about the economy. A third said they couldnt afford child care, 24 percent said they couldnt afford a house and 13 percent cited student debt.
Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave. Women face another economic obstacle: Their careers can stall when they become mothers.
This spring, Brittany Butler, 22, became the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she will start graduate school in social work in the fall. She said it would probably be at least 10 years before she considered having children, until she could raise them in very different circumstances than in her poor hometown neighbourhood in Baton Rouge, La.
She admits being a little nervous that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighbourhood.
A lot of people, especially communities of colour, cant really afford that now, she said. Im just apprehensive about going back to poverty. I know how it goes, I know the effects of it, and Im thinking, Can I ever break this curse I would just like to change the narrative around.
Starting a family
Starting a family used to be what people did to embark on adulthood; now many say they want to wait. Last year, the only age group in which the fertility rate increased was women ages 40 to 44. Delaying marriage and birth is a big reason people say they had fewer children than their ideal number: Female fertility begins significantly decreasing at age 32.
David Carlson, 29, graduated from college in 2010, when the job market was still rough. He and his wife had $100,000 in undergraduate debt between them. They both work full time  he in corporate finance and she in counselling  but they dont yet feel they can take time away from their careers.
Wages are not growing in proportion to the cost of living, and with student loans on top of that, its just really hard to get your financial footing  even if youve gone to college, work in a corporate job and have dual incomes, said Mr. Carlson, who lives in Minneapolis and writes a personal finance blog for millennials.
He said theyd consider adoption if they decided to have children but had waited too long. Another option for having children later in life is egg freezing. Only 1 percent of female survey respondents said they had frozen their eggs  but almost half said they would if not for the cost. Researchers say the United States could adopt policies that make it easier for people to both raise children and build careers. Government spending on child care for young children has the strongest effect. Policies that encourage parents to share child care help, too. Germany and Japan have used such ideas to reverse declining fertility.
High employment among women and high fertility dont have to be in conflict, but they will be without such policies, said Olivier Thevenon, an economist studying child and family policies at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Whether the young generation will catch up later is not certain, he said, but will depend on their capacity to combine work and family.

Woman injured in drug raid crossfire
A woman received gun shot injuries when police opened fire on a car suspected to be carrying heroin smugglers in Bodagama in Thanamalwila yesterday.
The police raid was carried out on information given by a decoy of a large consignment of heroin being transported in a car.
The car had ignored orders to stop at a barrier and had fled the scene. A police jeep had given chase. The occupants had opened fire at the police jeep when police retaliated in self defence. A bullet had hit a woman in the crossfire. The victim was admitted to the Hambantota Hospital. Two special police teams were deployed to arrest the culprits.
