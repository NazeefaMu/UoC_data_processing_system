No end to human-elephant conflict
The loser is the country!
Following the stir caused by the killing of the Galgamuwa Tusker and the increased attention towards poaching as well as the human-elephant conflict, the Daily News sought the views of Professor Devaka Weerakoon, an esteemed Professor at the University of Colombo, well versed in the issues of human-elephant coexistence and wildlife conservationist. Professor Weerakoon opined that political involvement and interest in the matters of the human-elephant conflict is needed in great magnitude in order to come up with a long term solution to the issue.
Excerpts from the interview:
Q: What are your thoughts on the killing of the Galgamuwa crossed tusker
A: It should have been protected, however protecting each and every tusker is next to impossible. You would need a bodyguard for every tusker 24/7. The criticisms against the Department of Wildlife Conservation are unfair for in order to ensure the protection of tuskers, political support is necessary. The reason for the publicity around the death of the tusker is the charismatic nature of such creatures and that this was resultant from poaching.
The human-elephant conflict claims the lives of a multitude of elephants each year. Approximately 200  250 elephants are killed every year as a result of either poaching or the human-elephant conflict. This is of an elephant population of about 6,000 in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are the laws and policies in association with elephant conservation Do we have sufficient laws What amendments do you think are necessary to these laws
A: The existence of the 2006 Human Elephant Conflict Policy and the need for its update is clear. However draft policies that have been developed and proposed have not yet been implemented. It is important to note that a policy offers a direction and that actions need to be taken based on those directions. In many instances, instead of following through with the directions offered by proposed policies, policymakers look for actions already taken and use the results in the context of the policy thus persisting with incorrect strategies.
Political support is necessary and the long term impact of the deaths of elephants needs to be taken seriously. Immediate solutions are not possible, if not they would already have been implemented and utilized. Learning via a trial and error basis is the option available. For instance, on one occasion an elephant was translocated and returned 2-3 times resulting in many issues as the elephant became more restless. In other situations, an elephant that causes trouble being moved to another area is basically the translocation of a headache. The situation worsens. The use of an enclosed area has been suggested but these as well as other recommendations are abandoned the moment they are found to be ineffective. Rather than abandoning such efforts, learning from the errors and improving the strategies are necessary.
Q: What course of action do you believe should be taken by policymakers and what are your thoughts on the lack of an official policy for elephant conservation
A: At the end of the day, a policy wont reduce the number of deaths to zero, but it would make the threat of the human-elephant conflict more manageable by minimizing it. Approximately 80% of the elephants that are killed are male and this will have a long term impact on genetics. As one of the leading countries in research and empirical evidence on this issue, such information needs to be utilized.
Policymakers need to take this situation more seriously as it is becoming worse than armed conflict. An interest in elephant management needs to be taken. The lack of movement in a positive direction is resulting in the situation returning to the status quo. Policymakers should be taking more interest in the situation as they themselves would benefit from it. By providing those who live in the human-elephant conflict areas with solutions they have the opportunity to win favours with the masses and receive more votes and popularity. As representatives of the people they should be doing more in the interest of the people, raising a voice for them however there is a lack of sincerity on their part.
The resignation of Dr. S. Pilapitiya as Director General of Wildlife Conservation caused a stir. We (wildlife enthusiasts) have nothing to gain from conservation. Driven by the passion for wildlife and the enrichment of our environment we can only hope to preserve it for future generations. What is to be gained by government officials and wildlife conservationists destroying each other Unfortunately the end result is the grabbing of defeat out of the jaws of victory. The loser is the country.
Q: What can be done regarding increased population and the problems associated with elephant conservation What do you believe can be done to strengthen the protected areas in Sri Lanka
A: Land use planning needs to be improved. Development should not be stopped completely but encroachment into wildlife conservation areas should be minimized. There should be sensitivity to both sides  development vs. conservation and land conversion should take into account the long term impacts of such. The creation of conflict to generate money is a loss.
The perspective of the people should be taken into account. Villages that are subject to human-elephant conflict need to be considered. They fear for the lives of their children, whether they will return home every day. In addition their agricultural livelihood is threatened and they risk their lives to protect their crops. At night the danger of leaving their houses is prominent. The proposal of the use of village fencing would possibly provide a solution to this as fences around villages would enable villagers to move freely knowing that the elephants are beyond a certain boundary. This would also facilitate social interaction within the village. If the point of view of the villagers is not considered they are likely to take matters into their own hands and try to solve things their way. The end result is not desirable.
Q: Translocation increasingly fails in concern with habitat encroachment as mentioned in your work, what would you recommend as measures that can be taken pertaining to this
A: Translocation does seem to worsen the situation. Measures such as village fencing and land use planning are more likely to improve the situation. Elephant drives and use of thunder flashes increasingly worsen the situation as elephants are becoming habituated to it.
The elephant drive in Lunugamvehera is an example of how drives worsened the situation. The area was over its carrying capacity resulting in the elephants becoming emaciated and slowly deteriorating. It was the same result as shooting them in the head with a gun but merely a more inhuman form as they died slow and painful deaths. Measures need to be taken to avoid such situations and better strategies need to be formulated.
Q: Sri Lanka is a country where elephants and tuskers were historically venerated, however the human-elephant conflict is negatively impacting this as mentioned in your journal article. What are your thoughts on the involvement of religious leaders in conservation and what can you say about the desirability associated with tuskers and the establishment of tusks as icons of prestige
A: Elephants are used in these religious processions and this is not what is taught in the religions. Currently no positive steps are taken to protect the elephants. Love can spoil a child and keeping a ten tonne animal in captivity is not ideal. Immobilization can lead to problems in the feet and the changed conditions in environment can have a drastic effect on the animal. This is however not a blanket statement. Religious leaders can encourage compassion for the creatures and motivate preservation.
Even in the case of the African tusks that were confiscated from one of the temples, they were demanded and successfully reacquired. Nowhere in religion is blood ivory considered desirable. The basic premise of religion talks about simplistic lifestyle not acquisition. The temples itself are not supposed to hold anything of value. The death of an animal for the sake of acquiring ornaments whether elephant or turtle or any other species is not encouraged. Burning these tusks does not salvage the situation but it sends a statement that blood ivory or any other ornaments should not be considered valuable. In this animal rights age where it is clear that animals have the same right to live as humans, ornaments should not be deemed desirable at the expense of life. Temples especially, which teach simplistic ways of life should not be promoting the desirability of tusks or any other ornamental objects.
Q: Dont you think we need tougher punishment for poachers Should poachers face the death penalty
A: The death penalty is definitely not a solution. It doesnt stop people from killing other humans so why would it discourage poaching Implementation of the death penalty would insinuate that an elephant life is equivalent to that of a human life.
An appropriate legal system is definitely necessary as this is a legal issue however it must be taken into account that law doesnt necessarily dissuade action. Just because there are laws against manslaughter doesnt mean that people have stopped killing, so no, the death penalty should not be implemented for poaching in my opinion.
Q: Do you think our local media play a responsible role and could step up the fight against poaching
A: The local media definitely plays a role but wildlife needs more focus. Wildlife appreciation is common and various documentaries are aired however more interest need to be generated towards wildlife conservation and elephant conservation. Educational programmes on conservation and programmes that inculcate love towards elephants and other species could help discourage poaching.
Elephants are an important resource and if not conserved they will disappear.

1971  when Cambrian-Sebs big match was revived
Prince of Wales Colleges 1970/71 cricket season cannot be forgotten because in 1969 and 1970 the Big Match with St. Sebastians College was not played due to unknown reasons. After a lengthy discussion the authorities concerned decided to revive it in 1971 and it was played on a Pre-Poya and Poya Day at Cambrian grounds.
Priyantha Jayasekera (Captain)
The happy captain was Priyantha Jayasekera and his deputy was the gloveman of the side Sriyan Samararatne. There were two pairs of brothers in the team Sriyan and Savindra Samararatne and Chitral and Hemal Mendis.
The Principal was S C H de Silva and the Prefect of Games and Master in charge of Cricket were two famous Old Cambrians Dunstan Perera and Cecil Fernando respectively. The following were in the cricket pool. Priyantha Jayasekera (Captain), Sriyan Samararane (Vice Captain), Ajith Mendis, Hiran Jayatilleke, Savindra Samararatne, Lakdasa Cooray, Dushmantha Silva, Chitral Mendis, Manju de Silva, Bandula de Silva, Hemal Mendis, Sunil Peiris, Desmond Gunasekera, P D Kusumtilleke and S Perera.
In all there were fourteen matches on the card in clouding the Big Match with their arch rivals St. Sebastians College. Cambrians won against Zahira and Dharmasoka Colleges. They drew with Wesley, Royal, St Thomas, St Josephs, Richmond, Kingswood, Isipathana and Maliyadeva and lost to St. Benedicts and Thurstan Colleges and tied with St Peters which was a one day game.
Not a single century was recorded in thirteen matches instead five half centuries were recorded. Big Match too ended in a tame draw. But Priyantha Jayasekera scored an unbeaten 100 runs and he became the seventh centurion for Cambrians in the Big Match Series.
In the same year Priyantha Jayasekera and Ajith Mendis were selected for the Ceylon Combined Schools Cricket team that toured India.
The 21st Big Match was captained by Priyantha and the Sebs were led by Ralph Gunawardene and the match ended in a draw. After the revival of the Big Match in 1971 to date it is worked off uninterrupted.

AFRICA BEYOND AID
Africa Beyond Aid is rallying call of the current President of Ghana Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo which should resonate with us. He surprised French President Macron who was visiting Ghana recently by stating policies such as Health and Education of Ghana should be determined by the Ghanians and not on the basis of the generosity of the French tax payer or by the EU!
He went on explain why Africans were fleeing across the dessert to Europe and why it was important to make it possible for Africans to dream a future in Africa much in the same way the Irish and Italians have stopped migrating to the US and are staying back at home.
This piece lays out his robust vision which so heartening to see.
AFRICA MUST INDUSTRIALISE TO FUND SDGs  PRESIDENT AKUFO-ADDO
According to President Akufo-Addo, several countries on the continent, including Ghana, are taking steps towards converting the 17 SDGs into concrete outcomes for their peoples, with the conviction that they cannot expect others to do it for them.
With the implementation of the SDGs agenda set to cost between 3.5 trillion to 5.0 trillion dollars per year, and with the news that aid to Africa will be cut significantly by the current US administration, President Akufo-Addo stressed that Africa must be efficient and effective not only in mobilising resources, but also looking beyond the benevolence of others to finance implementation of the SDGs agenda.
He noted that We are a continent reliant on foreign aid, despite economic growth in parts of Africa significantly outpacing the global average. Truth be told, the full implementation of the SDGs in Africa cannot be done with a mindset of dependence.
President Akufo-Addo said this, recently, when he delivered the keynote address at the 5th International Conference on Sustainable Development, at a packed auditorium of the Earth Institute, Columbia University, New York.
The President stated that the first priority of African countries, to this end, must be to change the structures of the economies on the continent, which are dependent largely on the production and export of raw materials, adding that it is this reliance on raw material exports that feeds our dependence on foreign aid, and subjects us to the politics of the West.
Citing the example of Ghana and Cote dIvoire, which produce nearly 60% of the worlds cocoa and yet earned, in total, in 2015, only $5.75 billion out of the $100 billion chocolate market, the President stressed that such scenarios can no longer continue.
We certainly cannot finance the vision of building sustainable development on the continent with such scenarios.
There can be no future prosperity for our peoples, in the short, medium or long term, if we continue to maintain economic structures that are dependent on the production and export of raw materials, he said. The President continued, We must add value to our resources, and we must industrialise. Unless we do so, we cannot finance on our own the full implementation of the SDGs. The agenda surely has to be an Africa Beyond Aid.
It is for this reason that President Akufo-Addo told the gathering that his government has introduced measures to stimulate the private sector, through the introduction of a monetary policy that is stabilising the currency, reducing interest rates, and reducing significantly the cost of borrowing, in addition to a raft of tax cuts to bring relief to and encourage businesses.
It is the competitiveness of Ghanaian enterprises, particularly in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, he added, that will determine Ghanas capacity to create wealth for her youth and women, and wealth in our society, and the sustainable development of the country.
The competitiveness of Ghanas private sector is key to addressing issues of inclusion, economic development and growth of Ghana. That is the way to building a self-reliant Ghana, with a strong economy, capable of generating jobs and prosperity for the mass of her people, he added.
The success of the Continental Free Trade Area on the African continent, he was confident, will present immense opportunities to bring prosperity to the continent with hard work, enterprise and creativity, stressing that a working, common continental market has to be a very fundamental objective of all peoples and governments on the continent.
To guarantee an Africa Beyond Aid, President Akufo-Addo noted that Africa must breed a new generation of leaders who, amongst others, are looking past commodities to position their countries in the global marketplace; leaders who are determined to free their peoples from a mindset of dependence, aid, charity and hand-outs; leaders who are bent on mobilizing Africas own immeasurable resources to resolve Africas problems.
This new generation of African leaders, the President added, must help bring dignity and prosperity to our continent and its peoples.
Africans must move beyond aid and not be beggars of the world': Ghana's president
President of Ghana Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
Africa should move beyond aid handouts that have failed to bring growth and prosperity and move to an era of mutual respect with Western countries, Ghanas president said in London.
We do not want to remain the beggars of the world, we do not want to be dependent on charity, he said in a speech in London, setting out a vision for Africas future.
We can and we should be able to build a Ghana with use of her own resources and their proper management as a way to engineer social and economic growth in our country, he said.
Akufo-Addo, who took office in January, called for closer trade ties with neighboring Ivory Coast and across Africa, home to 1.2 billion people and a burgeoning middle class.
Ghana was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to win independence from colonial rule 60 years ago, a milestone that paved the way for independence for nations across the continent.
We are painfully aware we are nowhere near where we should be, he said in the speech to the Royal African Society. After 60 years it is obvious that the aid bus will not take Africa where it has to be. We do not want to be pitied, he said. We do not want to be pawns or victims.
President Akufo-Addo noted that we need to build an Africa that is able to look after her peoples through intelligent management of the resources with which she has been endowed, and embark on a new path. This path offers a new Africa.
It is an Africa that will be defined by integrity, sovereignty, common belief, discipline, and shared values. It is one where we aim to be masters of our own destiny, and establish an Africa Beyond Aid.

AmCham holds luncheon meeting featuring two Silicon Valley personalities
The American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka held a luncheon meeting last week with two speakers hailing from Silicon Valley, on emerging technologies and their impact on local businesses.
The event was titled, 'Evolution of Silicon Valley tech companies and how it impacts you'.
Mani Kulasooriya, founder of Sysco LABS (formerly CAKE) and Ron May, Vice President - e-Solutions, Sysco Corporation were the two speakers at the event. Both speakers have ample industry experience in the Valley and will be sharing their insights during this session.
Mani led Sysco LABS from a startup in Silicon Valley to eventually be acquired by Sysco Corporation, a top Fortune 100 company. Having worked for companies like Citigroup e-Citi, and Yahoo prior to this venture, he has deep connections in the Valley. An astute tech investor, he has investments in over 25 tech companies.
May is a professional services leader with proven expertise in digital customer experience, direct sales, contract negotiation, P&L management, large scale operations, strategic solution delivery and cultivation of executive level client relationships.
The event was held on December 12 at the Hilton Colombo. It covered some of the foundational technologies that will drive the next wave for disruption and how Silicon Valley companies are leveraging this technology for their own gain.
Silicon Valley technology companies are quickly evolving from being your enabler to becoming your competitor, and are no longer satisfied being the tech leaders of the world - instead, their aspirations now are inclined towards disrupting every industry globally.
The session looked at how one can mitigate this new competitive risk - through leadership, organizational structure, talent and brand with Ron May discussing the example of how Sysco Corporation is going through their own transition.
The main sponsor of the event was Brandix, while it was co-sponsored by Microsoft.

Francis Amerasinghe
Cordial personality
It has been fifty years since the demise of Francis Amerasinghe. His parents, late Mudaliyar Arthur Amerasinghe and late Harriet Sirimanne, hailed from Unawatuna, Galle.
Since his parents wished to give their son a good education, they moved to Colombo and lived in de Alwis Place, Dehiwala, and Francis was admitted to St. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia. Francis Amerasinghe completed his education, excelling in academic studies, as well as sports.
He was the Senior Head Prefect in 1933. At cricket, he had an unbeaten record for the 2nd wicket partnership with the late N. A. D. S. Wijesekera at a first eleven Royal-Thomian encounter and was considered a stylish batsman. He was the captain of cricket, football, and athletics and represented the college in every branch of sports. A keen tennis player, he continued playing tennis even when he was working at the Bank of Ceylon, and would travel to England to see tennis matches in Wimbledon.
He joined the Bank of Ceylon from its inception on August 1, 1939 and became the chief accountant in 1949. When the Galle Branch of the Bank of Ceylon was declared opened on December 14, 1942, he was appointed as the first manager of the branch. During that period, the general manager of the Bank of Ceylon was the late J. H. Mortlock. He was the first Manager of the Bank of Ceylon Trincomalee from its inception and later the Manager Bank of Ceylon Kandy. From the time the Bank of Ceylon Sports Club was formed, he was an active member where many tournaments were conducted.
He was instrumental in introducing the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme to the Bank of Ceylon, and his wife, Malini Amarasinghe, was its first member in the number one position.
His sports background and cordial personality helped him in his professional work and social service, when he was involved with community work in Dehiwala. The Dehiwala-Mt.Lavinia Cosmopolitan Sports Club was his brainchild. It was started in a cadjan shed, and he was the first president of the club from 1959 to 1967. During that period, the honourary committee members were late Sir John Kotalawala, then Police Inspector General late Aleric Abeygunawardena, then Deputy Mayor late G. D. Perera, to name a few. At present, the Dehiwala-Mt.Lavinia Sports Club has been taken over by the Municipality.
He passed away on October 15, 1967, after a brief illness, whilst in service as the Bank of Ceylon Head Office deputy general manager. May he attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

Joy Gnanadurai
Teacher par excellence
Joy Gnanadurai answered her call, when her roll was called up yonder on November 30, 2017. She was born on July 16, 1946, to James Ratnam Williams Jayaratnam and Joyce Jeyamani Chelliah.
Joy was a student of Chundikuli Girls College, Jaffna. Her passion for music started early during her school days. She was quick to get through all the music exams of Trinity College of Music, which was the only foreign exam for western music at that time in Jaffna.
Soon, she joined her school and church choirs. Due to her ability and experience in this field, she became the choir leader and started conducting choral festivals in Jaffna.
Her family were all musicians and it was a treat to watch them harmonize in singing during family functions.
Joy married Richard Gnanadurai on September 20, 1975. They were blessed with a son, Dhilan, who carried the batton from his mother and is now a musician in the UK, training opera singers, church choirs, and also conducting music classes.
After the war in 1990, their family moved to Colombo. Joy continued her career in music, teaching music, conducting choirs, as well as being a church organist for Holy Trinity Church, Wellawatte; St Pauls Church, Milagriya, and a few other churches in Colombo.
Whenever she was requested to play for special functions, she always readily obliged and said It was for the Glory of God. My children were sent to Joy for their music lessons.
I can proudly say that one of my children won the All-Island Prize at the Trinity College of Music examination, all due to Joys untiring efforts.
This proved beyond any doubt that she was a professional. She took pride in her profession and was a teacher par excellence.
I had no choice but to send my grandchild to Joy for piano lessons as well.
Some of her brothers have already gone beyond the veil, namely Dr. Joe, Fredrick, and Festus. She leaves behind her husband, Richie; son Dilan; daughter-in-law, Sabeenaand, and siblings Gerald, Anton, Dharman, Grace, Yoges, and Ruby.
Now, Joy must be singing It is well with my soul with the Lord. May she Rest in Peace and Rise in Glory.

M. A. Hemachandra
An exemplary character
The harsh sun rays were fading on the eve of November 1, 2017, at the Dadalla crematorium grounds. The cremation of M. A.Hemachandra took place there amidst a distinguished large gathering, in a melancholic atmosphere.
Born to a respectable family in the village of Mampitiya in the close vicinity of Galle town, he was born in 1945 as the eldest son of a family of the five brothers and one sister.
He studied at the Karandeniya central college and excelled in his studies, passing the Ordinary Level exam with distinctions.
Even though he was studious, circumstances prevented him from higher studies. He then decided to go for an employment of his own wish.
In the year 1963, Hemachandra joined the People's Bank, and within a short spell of time, rose to many higher positions.
He excelled in all the competitive examinations conducted by the bank and topped all exams. He had no intention of aspiring for higher positions in the bank due to personal reasons.
All his younger brothers are well-educated and holding responsible posts in the sphere of education and other essential services.
His paternal affection to all his siblings was regarded with high-esteem and appreciation by his family.
He was a devout Buddhist, exemplary character, honest and dedicated banker, and a sincere and true friend. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
May these few lines be a floral tribute to our long and sincere friendship.
Though you are no longer with us
We will always remember you forever
Sweet memories are treasured within our hearts
So precious and special to us, you are
We will remember you with love
Unforgettable and irreplaceable

Kalyani de Zoysa
A courageous woman
Kalyani de Zoysa, the second principal of Devi Balika Vidyalaya departed recently at the age of 93 years, leaving a vacuum in the hearts of all those associated with the school. She was one of the first five teachers at its inception.
The young students found in her not only a dedicated teacher, but also a friend who could give a solution to any of their problems.
When young mischief makers had their way once in a while, their teacher, Abeysiriwardhana, was moved to tears instead of resorting to punishment.
Perhaps she was not aware that her tears were far more effective than any imaginable punishment in disciplining girls.
Later, as a Principal, the trust and confidence she had placed in the teaching staff and the non-academic team, worked wonders. Teachers willingly undertook any additional work allocated, in order to relieve their warm-hearted principal of her burden.
From the start, in 1953, the school was on a forward march to reach its ideals, and Kalyani de Zoysa contributed her might in reaching it faster. When Devi became one of the most sought-after schools in the city, it gladdened everybody except the principal. She stood firm on the rules of admission, as instructed by the Education Ministry, in spite of the stress on her, when the then President himself requested her to overlook the rules with regard to a particular student.
In the face of questionings at a meeting with the President, she stood her ground, unmoved. Ultimately, the political powers had to give in.
On some occasions, the printed media, with all its high light tactics and humiliation, could not set sweep the principal off her feet.
Perhaps she dedicated her life for the welfare of thousands of young girls at Devi, more than for her own three children. Even after retirement, she was always present at school functions.
Past Devians and Devi teachers were always welcome at her residence.
She befriended and gave inspiration to all the subsequent Devi principals, who were also bent on reaching the top and maintaining it.
She was an exemplary character, simple in dress, kind in temperament, soft-spoken and ready to help everybody, in whatever way possible. She organised a scholarship programme for orphaned children of the Forces. She also lent a hand to assist the deserving Devians who went up for higher studies.
She displayed courage at the bereavement of her son because, as she explained to others, change is the unchangeable reality in life. You have to face it unmoved.
Devi Balika Vidyalaya is ever grateful to de Zoysa for her dedication in moulding the lives of thousands of young girls and proud to be associated with a woman of such calibre.

Gerard Gunasekera
He had a pure heart
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera was born on the December 13, 1961, being the eighth out of nine siblings. His father was a Major in the Sri Lanka Army whilst his mother was a housewife. Palitha was enrolled at St. Benedict's College, Kotahena, since the school was in close proximity to their home. His entire school career was spent at St. Benedict's, where he made numerous friends with a majority of them remaining as lifelong buddies.
By nature, Palitha was an easygoing, fun-loving individual with an infectious smile. But his greatest asset was the pure, genuine heart he possessed. Also, his leadership qualities, along with his honesty and integrity, were formidable strengths he possessed. He was always looking to lend a helping hand to othersincluding people who he met for the very first time.
Palitha owned a unique personality that attracted people whenever and wherever he met them. He also had the rare ability to win over even strangers of all ages and walks of life with his charming smile, as well as his pleasant and kind words. People who met this charismatic person for the first time became friends overnight with him.
While still at school, Palitha decided to join the Colombo YMCAone of the most important decisions he made in his life. His leadership qualities blossomed at the YMCA Youth Department. He persuaded some of his schoolmates to join as well, and along with their membership, Palitha started a host of new programmes and activities that attracted more youth to the YMCA. He rapidly climbed the ladder and was promoted as the youth work secretary. It was an early testament to his people-handling skills.
In the year 1986, Palitha formed Friendsan organisation to support the underprivileged youth in Sri Lanka, to overcome their many social barriers. It targeted the financially-insecure school-going children deprived of parental love and care, and living in centres run by the government and private sectors. Even today, more than 30 years after the inauguration, Friends continues to positively impact the lives of the disadvantaged youth of Sri Lanka, due largely to the vision of this remarkable individual called Palitha Gunasekera.
Palitha took another important decisionthis time to settle down in Australia. Based in Sydney, he initially worked in the banking sector and later ended up employed in the government Railway. Although he became an Australia citizen, Palitha was also the proud holder of dual citizenship of Sri Lanka. With the backing of his Sri Lankan colleagues, Palitha formed the first ever overseas branch of Friends in Sydney, in the year 2000.
From time to time, he used to visit his motherland and renew old friendships. But he never forgot Friends and its beneficiariesthe disadvantaged kids. With the loyal support of his most trusted friends and colleagues back in Sri Lanka, he revived Friends in the year 2008 by holding a three-day residential camp for over a 100 children. The success of this venture made him change his mind and return to Sri Lanka for longer stays thereafter.
In the ensuing years, many new members joined Friends, and in the year 2014, Palitha was instrumental in organising a memorable charity dinner dance in Sydney to raise funds. The record turnout and financial profits at this event made Palitha the happiest individual that night.
Palitha's love and affection for disadvantaged kids was limitless. He aspired to be a father figure and a friend to every child he came across, and his generous heart, smiling eyes, and encouraging words made them happy.
We can learn many things by looking at his life. One of them is punctuality, and the other is always to honour a promise. His commitment towards achieving a goal, loyalty to friends, and generosity and willingness to help the needy, were sterling qualities very rare in an individual.
Although Palitha was a devout Catholic, he enjoyed learning and respecting other religions and cultural traditions as well.
During the last few years of his life, he travelled to most parts of Sri Lanka and experienced conditions and situations as never before. He became an avid nature lover and enjoyed outdoor life and visits to wild life and nature parks. He gradually got accustomed to the ground realities and challenges of day-to-day living.
Palitha's love and affection for his mother was unlimited. During the final few years, it was the main, as well as the only reason he went back to Australia at least once a year. And during winter, a few years back, he took care of her for six months at his home in Sri Lanka. He had a lot of plans for her future well-being, but most unfortunately, they could not be fulfilled.
It is very rarely in one's life that they come across a human being of exceptional and rare qualities. Those who were fortunate enough to associate closely with Palitha can count themselves lucky. He was a man of vision and a provider to those in need. He was also a great planner and a perfectionist. The one thing he enjoyed most was making others happy. An utterly unselfish and a generous individual, Palitha loved good company, and his friends were always welcome at his home. He was blessed with a beautiful heart that attracted people of all ages and walks of life wherever he happened to be.
The greatest respect we can pay Palitha is continuing to engage in the good deeds he did. His legacy has to be carried forward. It is the least we, as a grateful public, including friends and colleagues, could do.
Gerard Palitha Gunasekera left this world for good on the September 4, 2016, in Sydney.
Friends will be dedicating the 13th Senehasa Youth Leadership Camp for disadvantaged youth from December 15 to 17, 2017 at Lama Sevana Childrens Home, Halpathota, Baddegama, to the late founder.

Point of view
Equities continued to lose steam this week, falling ~23 points W-o-W to hit an 8-month low of 6352.1 points as concerns over domestic political and policy uncertainty dominated sentiment and the US Fed raised interest rates for the 3rd time this year.
Since the first reading of Budget 2018 in early November, the broad-share price Index has fallen ~215 points (-3.3%) with consecutive losses in the six weeks since the Budget.
Average daily turnover levels also fell 24% W-o-W, as low market participation, particularly by Institutional and HNI investors dragged the average daily turnover for the week down to Rs.0.71Bb (cf. Rs.0.93Bn last week).
Crossings for the week accounted for just 36% of total market turnover, lower than last weeks crossings of 46% and reflecting the lower participation levels by HNI & Institutionals.
Crossings remained largely centered around mid-cap counters such as Teejay Lanka (28% of total crossings), Amana Bank (15% of total crossings) and LOLC (12% of crossings) while larger-cap blue chips such as JKH and COMB played a less dominant role as they cumulatively accounted for just 10% of total crossings.
Despite the lower daily average turnover levels, the YTD average remained at Rs. 0.94Bn, higher than the 2016 average of Rs.0.73Bn and reflecting relatively stronger equity market performance from earlier in the year.
Foreign investors however, retreated to a net selling position this week, recording net sales of Rs. 0.07Bn as the US Fed raised rates for the 3rd time this year in a widely anticipated move.
The move along with the expectation of 3 hikes in 2018 represents the continuation of the US Feds monetary policy normalization which could in turn impact the performance of Emerging and Frontier market equities. Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain dull ahead of the Christmas holidays.
Moodys affirms Sri Lankas credit profile at B1
Moodys Investor Services on Wednesday affirmed Sri Lankas credit rating at B1 while maintaining its negative outlook on the countrys credit profile.
The credit agency cited the balance between Sri Lanka's moderate institutional strength and strong (but volatile) growth against the countrys high debt burden, narrow revenue base, large government borrowing requirements and elevated external vulnerability risk as reasons for its rating outlook..
The credit agency also noted that Sri Lanka's 2016 nominal GDP was over 4x times the median for B1- and B2-rated sovereigns and that this comparatively large economy provides important diversification and shock absorption capacity, which supports Sri Lanka's credit profile at the B1 level1.
The Group noted that robust real GDP growth also drives its assessment of Sri Lanka's economic strength and that it expects real GDP growth to average about 4.9% per year in 2017-21. However, growth is expected to remain relatively volatile, particularly due to the economys vulnerability to droughts and flooding as the size and dispersion of seasonal monsoon rainfall influences agricultural sector growth and rural household consumption levels.
The Negative outlook meanwhile, represents its view that that persistently high government liquidity and external vulnerability risks continue to pressure Sri Lanka's credit profile, and that measures to build reserves and smooth the profile of external payments may be insufficient to contain imminent government liquidity and balance of payments pressures starting in 2019, when large international debt repayments come due and Sri Lanka's three-year IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program concludes.

Australia close to Ashes glory as England lose four wickets
PERTH SUNDAY: Australia had one hand on the Ashes at stumps on the fourth day of the third Test against England in Perth on Sunday.
Trailing by 259 runs in the first innings after Australia declared at 662 for nine, England were 132 for four when stumps was called early after a rain-interrupted final session, with Dawid Malan on 28 and Jonny Bairstow on 14, still behind by 127 runs.

The home side lead the five-Test series 2-0 and a win in the last-ever Ashes Test to be played at the WACA Ground would see them regain the urn.
Englands best hopes of staying alive would appear to rest with the weather, and there was a loud cheer from England fans when the forecast rain first arrived just minutes before tea.
More rain is forecast on the final day, although it is only predicted to be a problem before lunchtime.
The tourists second innings got off to a dismal start when opener Mark Stoneman was caught behind from the bowling of Josh Hazlewood for just three in the second over.
Alastair Cooks woes then continued when Hazlewood snared a brilliant one-handed return catch to remove him for 14, leaving the former skipper with just 83 runs at 13.83 for the series.
Captain Joe Root was the third man out, to spinner Nathan Lyons first ball of the innings, caught at first slip by his Australian counterpart Steve Smith for 14 off the glove of wicketkeeper Tim Paine.
James Vince looked impressive in making 55, but there was little he could do when a Mitchell Starc delivery hit a crack and deviated sharply to crash into his stumps as England slumped to 100 for four.
Earlier Australia scored their highest Ashes total at home and fifth-highest against England.
Although Smith added just 10 to his overnight total before being dismissed for 239, his innings was the cornerstone of the massive total.
Smith was adjudged leg before wicket on review after James Andersons confident shout was turned down by on-field umpire Chris Gaffaney.
The review ended a chanceless 399-ball epic innings which included 30 fours and one six.
The other overnight batsman, Mitchell Marsh, had departed a few minutes earlier --failing to add to his 181 when he was trapped leg before wicket by Anderson to end a 301-run partnership with Smith.
Australia then had Mitchell Starc run out for one as they lost three wickets for 12 runs.
They were also lucky not to lose Paine for 11 when he was given out looking plumb lbw to Anderson, only for a review to show the ball would have gone over the leg stump.
England have reportedly been unhappy with the decision review process in the match. According to one British newspaper they have lodged an official complaint after Mark Stoneman was given out contentiously by the third umpire, caught off his glove, in their first innings.
Anderson finished with four wickets, all claimed on day four, while Stuart Broad recorded career-worst figures of 0-142. AFP

Breitling in partnership with Colombo Jewellery Stores enters SL market
Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling enters the Sri Lankan market in partnership with Colombo Jewellery Stores. The latest selection of Breitling models will be housed at the flagship store at Alfred House Gardens.
Breitling has played a crucial role in the development of the wrist chronograph and is a leader in this complication. One of the world's major watch brands to equip all its models with chronometer-certified movements, the ultimate token of precision, Breitling is also one of the rare companies to produce its own mechanical chronograph movements, entirely developed and manufactured in its own workshops.
A chronograph specialist since its founding in 1884, Breitling played a crucial role in the development of this instrument. In 1915, the brand foreshadowed the emergence of the wrist chronograph by inventing the first independence pushpiece at 2 oclock. In 1923, it separated the start/stop functions from zero resetting, thereby making it possible to add successive times. In 1934, it set the final touch to the modern face of the chronograph by creating the second independent pushpiece. In 1969, it heralded a new era by presenting the first selfwinding chronograph movement. Today, Breitling is one of the rare watch companies to have its own mechanical chronograph movements, entirely developed and produced in its workshops.
Its onboard chronographs equipped World War II fighter planes and subsequently the commercial aircraft of the worlds major manufacturers and airline companies, earning the brand the status as official supplier to the world aviation. In 1952 it saw the birth of the famous Navitimer with its circular slide rule intended for airborne navigation. In 1962, this model became the first space-going wrist chronograph. In 1984 witnessed the launch of the Chronomat, the benchmark among aviation chronographs.
Breitling perpetuates these longstanding ties by associating with the biggest aeronautical events, by running several exceptional flight teams and by cooperating with the worlds elite pilots and aerobatics squadrons.
Trained in the tough school of aviation, a domain where safety is of vital importance, Breitling displays the same obsession with quality in all its instruments for professionals.
The brand submits all its movements to the tests of the Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC)  the highest token of precision and reliability. It also stands out in the realm and electronics by using exclusively Super Quartz movements that are ten times more accurate than standard quartz and by developing exclusive calibres including a connected chronograph. Be it sturdy cases, legible dials or robust bracelets, every detail of the watch exterior is designed to withstand intensive use under the most trying conditions.

Britains oldest Christmas fairy lights still going strong
Britains oldest Christmas fairy lights are still going strong after 48 years - without a single bulb needing replacement.
Vina Shaddick, 68, was a teenager when she bought the colourful string of lights from Woolworths in 1969, the year the Beatles performed their final show on the roof of the Abbey Road studios.
The durable lights cost just 3 and have lasted for nearly 50 years.
Now her son Ross Shaddick, 38, is looking forward to the lights illuminating his house for another year, in pride of place in the front window.
They are now back on display at the family home in Plymouth, Devon, where they remain wrapped around a plastic Christmas tree which is kept under plastic the rest of the year.
Ross said: I will be with Mum in her nursing home on Christmas Day and Boxing Day and the tree will be at home - Im not sure the care home would want the tree there, I very much doubt the lights will pass an electrical test.
The main thing is that these days they come with an AC adaptor which changes the current. Im looking forward to hopefully marking 50 years, the main thing is to look after them really well. I put them away with them still on the tree so we dont have to keep wrapping them and unwrapping them.
Two years ago Ross bought a set of 200 coloured LED lights, which are draped around trees in the front garden - framing the vintage set which his mother bought.
I will only have them on if Im in the room with them - to keep an eye on them. As the years go on I increase my checks, the music teacher said.
I dont know if there will come a time when they stop working or their not worth the danger. The worst issue is if the plastic around the wire begins to deteriorate. But they are the very stable component in my life. Its nice to keep the tradition going. The old lights are much better quality than what you get these days and they seem to be made of strong stuff. Ill carry on putting it up until the lights fizzle out. They are older than me and have been here all my life. Its been a constant and I hope they keep on working.
The lights came with a spare set of bulbs, but the originals have never needed replacing.
Ross said the lights were made of sterner stuff than the LED version he bought two years ago for 20, which are already on the blink.
Vina now lives in a nursing home due to her health, but her son is delighted to have the dainty lights adorning the tree, and will show her a picture of them when he visits on Christmas Day.
Her son, who will celebrate with his dog Klera, an eight-year-old Cairn terrier, added: The new ones do flash - thats the beauty of technology now.
You can do things that are so versatile. But not a single bulb has been changed on the old set.
Vina said: I can still remember buying them. It was the second year I was married and I went in my lunchtime.
Word had got round that Woolies had a special delivery of lights from Germany. They hold a lot of memories for me. They really dont make them like this anymore. I cant imagine a set bought today - which are much pricier - lasting as well as these. I guess you could say Ive had my moneys worth from them. Theyve never let me down and its looking as though they might outlast me now.

The council members of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Construction Industry (CCI) made an observational visit to the Port City Colombo construction site earlier this month. The technical presentation made was followed by a tour of the construction area. The executive council members of the CCI also had their monthly council meeting at the Port City Colombo site office.
The council members made positive remarks about the project and they found the tour informative as well as a new experience. Council members were seen questioning engineers in detail on the various aspects of the construction of Port City. They had urged management to afford them the opportunity of further visits to familiarize themselves with the workings of this new city by the sea.
President of the Chamber, Ranjith Gunatilleke had requested the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd employers representative, Wang Hao who was also a member of the council to extend visiting opportunities for aspiring architects and engineers in local universities. He was of the opinion that they could inspect the site and understand the future prospects this gigantic development project held for them.
The Chamber of Construction saw great opportunity for these students to be a part of the development of Port City Colombo, which is expected to reach completion by 2040.

Chile election: conservative Piera elected president
A conservative billionaire and former president, Sebastin Piera, has won Chile's presidential election run-off.
Left-winger Alejandro Guillier conceded and congratulated his opponent on his win and his return to the presidency after a four-year gap.
With nearly all votes counted, Piera has polled more than 54%.
It is a clear move to the right for the country, which is currently led by socialist President Michelle Bachelet. She had backed Guillier.
About 14 million were eligible to vote in the ballot, including Chileans living abroad for the first time.
However, voter turnout was low, at 48.5%. It had been thought that a high turnout would favour Guillier.
Piera called for unity after his victory:
"Chile needs agreements more than confrontations," he said. "The paths of the future unite us. Sometimes the stories of the past separate us."
Reaching out to his opponent, Piera added: "I want to talk to him about the points we agree about."
Billionaire businessman Piera won the first round of votes by a large margin, when the number of candidates reduced from eight to two for a final run-off.
He has already governed the country from 2010 to 2014, when he ended two decades of uninterrupted centre-left rule. But the former president and his Chile Vamos coalition had only a slim lead in the most recent opinion polls before Sunday's election vote.
He had the support of the business community, promising to lower taxes to get the economy growing again.
During his campaign, he promised to rein in the reforms brought in by President Bachelet, while his opponent Guillier, on the other hand, campaigned on the back of her legacy.
While President Bachelet's progressive agenda has won plaudits abroad, her popularity plummeted during her second term, due in part to a 2015 corruption scandal involving her daughter-in-law.
This year, however, the president overcame conservative opposition to successfully ease Chile's strict anti-abortion laws.
Conservative critics say Bachelet pushed her reforms too far. She was unable to seek re-election under the country's constitution.
Guillier represents six parties in a left-wing coalition. He beat former president Ricardo Lagos for the Socialist Party nomination in April 2017, promising to continue Bachulet's reforms.
A decade ago, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela were all governed by left-wing leaders.
But in recent years, conservatives have come to power in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, and Venezuela's "Bolivarian Revolution" has come under severe pressure with anti-government protesters taking to the streets for months. The win by Piera further consolidates that trend.

Chinese Ambassador bids farewell
I am going to complete my assignment and return to my motherland today. On February 24, 2015, I arrived in Colombo and started my assignment as the 20th Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka. During the past two years and nine months, I traveled to all nine provinces and 25 districts of Sri Lanka, made a lot of local friends and witnessed the China-Sri Lanka relations overcome obstacles, move forward, and usher in new development opportunities.
China and Sri Lanka have maintained close, high-level exchanges and deepened mutual trust. President Maithripala Sirisena paid a State visit to China at the beginning of his presidency and held fruitful meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, indicating the direction for the sustained and in-depth development of China-Sri Lanka relations. The two leaders have maintained close communication on international and regional occasions. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe successfully made an official visit and work visit to China and attended the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, further promoting the deepening of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chairman Yu Zhengsheng, exchanged visits. Bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been continuously expanded.
The mutually-beneficial cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has achieved new development and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. At present, China has become the largest trading partner and largest infrastructure construction partner of Sri Lanka and the largest source country of investment, donation, and assistance to Sri Lanka. The economic and trade cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has created more than 100,000 jobs, trained tens of thousands of technical and managerial talents, and played an irreplaceable role in the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. Under the guidance of the Belt and Road Initiative and the concept of engaging in extensive consultation, making joint contribution and sharing benefits, the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is striding forward.
The Port City and Hambantota Comprehensive development projects are taking off together, further facilitating the development of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation. China and Sri Lanka are friends in need. The Chinese people will not forget the precious support that the Sri Lankan government and people gave to the Chinese people when disasters like the Wenchuan Earthquake hit China. Likewise, whenever Sri Lanka is faced with natural disasters, the Chinese government and people empathise with Sri Lankan friends and always provide assistance to the government and people within our capacity. The Chinese people, with the peculiar characters of sincere, amity, pragmatism, and efficiency, will work together with the Sri Lankan people to build a more richly-endowed, prosperous, modern, and industrialized Sri Lanka.
The China-Sri Lanka millennium friendship is shining in a new era through cultural exchanges and mutual learning. Both China and Sri Lanka are ancient civilizations. Buddhism has been the shared culture of the two countries over 1,600 years. I am glad to see that the cultural exchanges in Buddhism, tourism, and education and so on are becoming increasingly popular. The Buddhist monks of the two countries maintain close exchanges and keep learning from each other.
China is one of the largest tourist source countries of Sri Lanka. The ubiquitous Chinese tourists have not only contributed to the economic development of Sri Lanka, but also enhanced the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese government provides Sri Lanka more than 100 government scholarships and 2,000 trainingships every year. Fifteen Sri Lankan universities have established the Chinese Ambassador Scholarship. The Chinese philharmonic orchestra, the Shaolin monks wushu troupe, and other Chinese cultural troupes with Chinese characteristics are warmly welcomed in Sri Lanka. More and more Sri Lankan friends are learning Chinese, and they will become new envoys for the China-Sri Lanka friendship in the future.
History is a mirror that reflects the boom and bust. The flourishing relations between China and Sri Lanka tells that the historical friendship between China and Sri Lanka is unstoppable. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka. We are proud of the achievements of our relations in the past 60 years. At present, China-Sri Lanka relations have entered a new fast track under the guidance of Belt and Road initiative. I am confident that the China-Sri Lanka longstanding friendship and mutually beneficial and inclusive cooperation will continue to create new wonders for the benefit of the two countries and the two peoples and make important contributions to peace and development in the Indian Ocean region.
Dear friends, Sri Lanka has become my second hometown. The honest and friendly Sri Lankan people, the mountains and rivers, the flowers and trees of the beautiful island nation, will become my sweet and permanent memories. The experience here will be the invaluable wealth of my life. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Speaker Jayasuriya, ministers, parliamentarians and the Sri Lankan people for your precious support for carrying out my competence. In the future, wherever I am, I will continue to pay attention to Sri Lanka and support the development of China-Sri Lanka relations.
Sincere and indeed friends wont become alienated because of distance. Goodbye and good luck, Sri Lanka!

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime, Witnesses Act No. 4
Critical analysis
The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015 has been enacted with the broader objective of protecting and promoting the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses, two vulnerable segments of society whom hitherto had negligible legal protection.
This Act was enacted in line with the commitment of the government to take meaningful and progressive steps towards transitional justice in a post-conflict Sri Lanka.
The provisions of the Act were implemented with effect from May 18, 2016, by the order of the Justice Minister, published in the Extra-Ordinary Gazette No. 1967/8 dated May 16, 2016.
Who are entitled to protection under this Act
According to the Preamble of the Act, the two main categories of persons concerned are,
I. Victims of crime
II. Witnesses
Section 46 of the Act defines a victim of crime as,
i. A person, who as a result of an act or omission which constitutes an offence under any law or infringement of a Fundamental Right under Article 13(1)or (2) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, has suffered any injury, harm, impairment or disability, whether physical, mental, emotional, economical or other loss.
ii. It includes a child victim and the parent or guardian of a child victim of crime, and
iii. A person who suffers harm as a result of intervening to assist such a person or to prevent the commission of an offence and any member of the family or next of kin of such person, dependents, and any other person of significant importance to that person.
A witness is defined as a person,
i. On whose information or complaint to a law enforcement officer in connection with a commission of an offence or the infringement of a fundamental right or the violation of a human right, an investigation inquiry could commence or has commenced or is likely to commence,
ii. Who has provided information or made a statement containing an account of matters in respect to which such person had been questioned in the course of such investigation or inquiry,
iii. Who has provided an affidavit or submitted a statement in support of a complaint made or any legal action instituted by a victim of crime,
iv. Who has provided information or any communication to a commission,
v. Who has reasonable grounds to believe that such person shall be summoned by a Court or Commission to make a statement or testify in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding against a person, based on information provided on a statement made to a law enforcement authority or a commission by such person,
vi. Who has received summons from a Court or a Commission to make a statement, testify or produce any document, report or object in any such judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding,
vii. Who being a public officer has investigated into the alleged commission of an offence or an infringement of a fundamental or human right, It further includes,
viii. A victim of crime,
ix. A child witness, or his parent or guardian,
x. A family member or dependent of such witness or any other person of significant importance to such person,
xi. An expert witness
xii. A person summoned to testify on behalf of a suspect or an accused.
In addition, Section 6 of the Act enables a person who has provided information, lodged a complaint, made a statement, or given testimony with regard to an offence or infringement of any fundamental or human right at such persons place of employment or in the employment environment, to claim protection.
Objects of the Act  Section 2
The main objects of the Act are fourfold and strives to;
1) Create a mechanism to promote, protect, enforce and exercise rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses by upholding and enforcing such rights and to assist them by adopting and implementing best practices of protection.
2) Enable victims of crime to obtain compensation from offenders and other redress including restitution, compensation, reparation, and rehabilitation.
3) Set out duties and responsibilities of the State, judicial, and public officers toward the promotion and protection of the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses.
4) stipulate offences that may be committed against victims of crime and witnesses and set out the penal sanctions imposed,
Sections 3 and 4 of the Act recognise the rights and entitlements of victims of crimes. It is the right of a victim of a crime to be treated with equality, fairness, and with respect to the dignity and privacy, to receive quick redress and to be protected from threats and intimidation, to receive medical treatment for any harm suffered, to be informed of the legal remedies available, to get legal representation by an Attorney-at-Law and to receive relevant information about on-going investigations or Court cases in relation to their offenders. A child victim has a right to be treated in a way that ensures his or her best interests.
A victim of crime is entitled to receive a sum of money for the expenses incurred by him for his participation in any judicial proceeding and to either obtain medical treatment or financial assistance required for medical treatment from the State (subject to the availability of resources with the State) for any physical or mental injury or harm suffered as a result of being a victim of crime.
Although the Act is silent about the rights of a witness, Section 5 spells out the entitlements of a witness.A witness is entitled to receive fair and respectful treatment with due regard to dignity and privacy. A witness should not be intimidated, coerced or harassed for giving information or a statement or testimony with regard to an offence or an infringement of a fundamental or human right and also should be entitled to be protected against any real or possible harm, threat, intimidation, reprisal or retaliation.
The Act provides for the recognition, upholding, and enforcement of the said statutorily recognised rights of victims of crimes and witnesses by adopting the following mechanisms.
1. Stipulating offences against victims of crimes and witnesses and the corresponding penal sanctions
2. Establishment of the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses
3. Setting up of a Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division
4. Providing compensation.
Stipulating offences against victims and witnesses
Section 8 (1) to (8) lays down the offences against the victims of crime and witnesses.
These offences include;
i. Threatening with injury to person, property or reputation of the victim or the witness or any associates,
ii. Voluntarily causing hurt or grievous hurt,
iii. Wrongful restraint,
iv. Compelling the victim or the witness to leave any place,
v. Causing damage, wrongful loss or destruction of property of such person,
vi. Harassment, intimidation and coercion or damage to reputation of another person,
vii. Change in the employment,
viii. Putting the life of a victim, witness or informant in danger by dissemination of information with a third party,
ix. Giving gratification to prevent, discourage and dissuade a person from instituting legal action,
x. Giving false information with the intention of obtaining assistance and protection, and
xi. Putting the life of a victim or witness in danger by a person in charge of victim protection.
Which Court has Jurisdiction to hear and try Offences under the Act
The High Court has the jurisdiction to try these offences and impose a punishment of a term of imprisonment varying from seven to 12 years and a fine. Every High Court should give priority to trials under this Act over other cases and such trails should be held on a day to day basis.
Section 9 of the Act makes all the offences under Section 8 cognizable and non-bailable and no person suspected, accused or convicted can be enlarged on bail, unless under exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal, when enlarging a person on bail can impose a conditional prohibition preventing communication and coming into close proximity with a person against whom the offence is committed.
National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses
Section 11 - 16 of the Act provides for the establishment of the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses.
This Authority has a Board of Management comprising of sevenex-offcio members and five members appointed by the President, should be academically and professionally qualified and selected from fields such as criminology, criminal justice, protection of human rights or medicine.
The Authority is given enforcement, regulatory, operational, and quasi-judicial functions.
The National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses is situated at 428/11 A, Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha, Battaramulla.
Victims and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division
Under section 19 of the Act, the Inspector General of Police, on the guidelines issued by the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses, has to establish and maintain a Division named Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division.
A senior Superintendent of Police who comes under the supervision of a nominee of the Inspector General of Police, will be in charge of this Division. The said Division was established on November 3, 2016 and is located at No. 9 Mihindu Mawatha, Colombo 12.
The Division is entrusted with the duties of carrying out investigations and providing effective and necessary protection to victims of crimes and witnesses and implementing a victims of crimes and witnesses assistance and protection plan.
Both the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses and Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division, have a role to play under the Act to create awareness among the public regarding the rights and entitlements of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses.
Providing Compensation
Section 28 of the Act empowers every High Court or Magistrates Court to order an offender to pay as compensation to the victim of crime or witness concerned, an amount not exceeding Rs. 1 million or a sum of money not exceeding 20 percent of the maximum fine payable for the particular offence or both, in addition to the penal sanctions.
 It is to be noted that any victim of crime or witness can seek protection from the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crimes, Witnesses and Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection division, a Court or officer-in-charge of any Police Station. (Section 21)
 On such request being made by a victim of crime or witness, the said authoritiesdepending on the availability of resourceswill provide security to the person and property, temporary accommodation or permanent re-location, temporary or permanent employment, re-identification or any other measure. (Section 22)
 The Act, under Section 29, also provides for the setting up of a Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Fund.
 Another noteworthy feature of the Act is that under the Section 31  34 it provides for the recording of evidence or statement of a victim of crime or witness through contemporaneous audio  visual linkage without his/her personal attendance before Court, if in the best interest of justice it is found necessary as a measure of protection or as a ground of expediency.
 The lack of awareness among the general public in relation to the scope of the Act and the protection available is a hindrance to the effective implementation of the Act. At the same time, the government should allocate proper funding to build up the infrastructure and to implement the mechanisms introduced under the Act. Another great concern is the practical working of the Act, especially the need for a strong, independent, and impartial Police service in view of the setting up of a Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division that directly operates under the supervision of the Police.
Victims of crime and witnesses, despite being a pivotal part of any civil or criminal proceeding, had no statutorily recognized rights or entitlements by virtue of their status. The Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015 acts as a light at the end of the tunnel for this so far helpless and hapless category of persons, by establishing a legal regime to protect them. Furthermore, it attempts to incorporate into the legal system of Sri Lanka, the appropriate international norms, best practices and standards in protecting and assisting victims of crimes and witnesses.

Dazzling Man City disappearing into the distance
LONDON, Saturday: Manchester City soared above the fog swirling round the Etihad Stadium to demolish Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 and leave the rest of the Premier League peering into the distance in search of Pep Guardiolas record-breaking team on Saturday.
Tottenham, who began the day fourth, were supposed to provide a proper test but, just like Citys previous 15 opponents, were outclassed as goals by Ilkay Gundogan before halftime and Kevin de Bruyne and two from Raheem Sterling after it put City 14 points clear.
SPONSORED
Citys 16th successive win took them to 52 points, one game short of the halfway point of the season.
Manchester United, who play at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, have 38 as do champions Chelsea who beat Southampton 1-0 on Saturday thanks to Marcos Alonsos free kick.
Arsenal sent Newcastle United into the drop zone with a 1-0 win that lifted the Gunners to fourth with 33 points while Burnley are fifth, a further point back, after a 0-0 draw at Brighton and Hove Albion for whom Glenn Murray missed a penalty.
Tottenham tumbled down to seventh behind Liverpool, who are at Bournemouth on Sunday, on goal difference.
There were two big movers at the bottom with Crystal Palace winning 3-0 at Leicester City and West Ham United doing the same at Stoke City to move out of the relegation zone into 14th and 15th places respectively. Stoke are 17th.
Even without the absent David Silva, City were too clinical for Mauricio Pochettinos Tottenham side and could even afford a second-half penalty miss from Gabriel Jesus.
It was solid, good, against one team demanding to be intense without the ball, Guardiola said.
Since August we are so happy and I admire the most the way we play without the ball -- thank you to the club to provide me with these amazing players.
Citys attacking football is a thing to behold but there was nothing fancy about their 14th minute opener as Gundogan was left unmarked to head in from a corner -- a goal Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino described as an early Christmas present.
To their credit Tottenham took the game to City in the second half but were cut open in the 70th minute as De Bruyne finished off a rapid counter-attack.
Sterlings double in the final 10 minutes took his tally for the season to 15 in all competitions before Christian Eriksen scored a late consolation for the visitors.
Today yes, they showed better quality than us. The better team won, Pochettino said.
Chelsea have won eight of their last 10 games, but like Arsenal who beat Newcastle with a Mesut Ozil goal, are realistically playing for a top-four position unless City suffer a new year collapse of dramatic proportions.
In the last 10 games we won eight games, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte said.
Some people are forgetting this run because there is a team that is winning every game.
At the bottom Christian Benteke went from zero to hero as he scored his first goal of the season, and Crystal Palaces first on the road, as they trounced Leicester with Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako also on target.
Belgian striker Benteke made amends after disobeying team orders to take, and miss, a crucial penalty last week in a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth.
The day after (the penalty miss) he came in and held his hand up, he spoke to the players and myself and made the point that he would make it up to team, and that is what he has done, Palace manager Roy Hodgson said.
Marko Arnautovic scored against his old club Stoke as West Ham made it seven points from three games without conceding.
Huddersfield Town ended a long scoring drought on the road as they thumped stumbling Watford 4-1. Huddersfields Jonathan Hogg was dismissed in the second half for a second booking while Troy Deeney saw red for Watford in the first half. - Agencies

DFCC Banks tree-planting effort  get special recognition
DFCC Bank embarked on far-reaching tree planting sustainability measures during the current year which have been commended by Reforest Sri Lanka, with whom the Bank collaborated to plant endemic and native species of trees.
A non-profit society committed to protect and extend the forest cover in Sri Lanka, Reforest Sri Lanka has specifically mentioned the extensive commitment of funds and volunteers that DFCC Bank has committed to this cause.
This project was conducted as part of the commemorative staff tree-planting campaign launched this year to reforest key areas across the island, whilst giving back to society at large. In this campaign, a tree is planted to celebrate each and every staff members birthday for which they receive a personalized invitation to attend the tree-planting campaign with their families.
An e-tree-dedication certificate providing the link to the exact location on Google maps where the tree was planted is sent to them. All staff members are also invited to attend these campaigns and are encouraged to participate with their families.
In 2017 eleven tree planting campaigns were held under this initiative in places such as Aranayake, Kaduwela, Jaffna, Duplication Road, Thalawila, Athurugiriya, Kahathuduwa, Beddagana, Bellanwila and Batticaloa. A total of 7,355 trees were planted during the year, out of which approximately 1,700 trees were planted to commemorate staff birthdays. Most of these campaigns were carried out with Reforest Sri Lanka.
Trees planted in these campaigns included, Mee, Kumbuk, Karanda, Gammalu, Kos/Jackfruit, Veera, Ehala, Rath Handun, Sudu Handun, Hora, Ranawara, Atamba, Wara, Olinda and many other endemic and native species. The trees will help to improve soil quality in the areas and minimize soil erosion, whilst returning much-needed oxygen to the environment.
DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva, commented, DFCC Bank has demonstrated its corporate stewardship through various sustainable actions and this tree planting initiative is yet another way for us to make a tangible difference to society and the environment. Planting over 7000 trees would not have been possible without the support of Reforest Sri Lanka and the management and staff of DFCC Bank, who participated wholeheartedly in this project.
By involving families of staff members in this initiative, we are shaping a strong consciousness of the need to green our nation, which I hope they will carry forward. We plan to expand this initiative by planting additional trees at locations where reforestation is a priority. We are also gratified by the fact that apart from our tree planting efforts, Reforest Sri Lanka has also acknowledged DFCCs support for major solar powered initiatives in the country. DFCC Bank has emerged as a pioneer financier in all renewable energy projects undertaken by the private sector in Sri Lanka.

Dhawan, spinners lead India to series win over Sri Lanka
Visakhapatnam: Opener Shikhar Dhawan's blazing century and a decisive spell by their wrist spinners powered India to a series-clinching eight-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the third one-day international on Sunday.
Chasing 216 for victory, India rode on a 135-run partnership between Dhawan (100 not out) and Shreyas Iyer (65) to romp home in 32.1 overs in Visakhapatnam.
Dhawan completed his 12th ODI hundred in 85 balls, his knock laced with 13 fours and two sixes, before taking India to their eighth consecutive ODI series victory since June 2016.
But it was Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal who set up the comprehensive victory after taking three wickets each to help restrict the visitors to 215 all out in 44.5 overs.
The hosts lost skipper Rohit Sharma early after he was bowled by off-spinner Akila Dananjaya for seven but it was only a minor blemish in an otherwise comfortable chase.
Iyer, who registered his second successive half-century in just his third ODI, combined with Dhawan to take the attack to the opposition bowlers. Starting with a fast-spin combination of Suranga Lakmal and Akila Dananjaya from either end, the visitors built up some early pressure only to lose steam against the in-form batsmen.
Iyer, who made 88 in the Mohali ODI, hit eight fours and a six during his 63-ball knock before falling to skipper Thisara Perera. The batsman mistimed a pull to be caught at mid-on. The left-handed Dhawan stayed firm with Dinesh Karthik, who made 26, for company as India bounced back with two straight wins after losing the opener in Dharamsala. Earlier Sri Lanka had got off to a strong start with opener Upul Tharanga making a 82-ball 95 after the visitors were invited to bat first.
Tharanga's 121-ball second-wicket partnership with Sadeera Samarawickrama, who made 42, was the highlight of the Sri Lankan innings that fell apart from a commanding 136-1.
Leg-spinner Chahal got Samarawickrama, who was included in the XI in place of Lahiru Thirimanne, caught at deep cover to end the stubborn stand.
The in-form Tharanga, who registered his 36th ODI fifty, kept up the pressure with an attacking innings as he passed 1,000 runs in 2017.
But Yadav checked Sri Lanka's surge in the 28th over with a twin strike, denying Tharanga a hundred and then sending Niroshan Dickwella (8) trudging back to the pavilion. Tharanga, who hit 12 fours and three sixes, was beaten by a tossed-up delivery from the left-arm wrist spinner and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni pulled off a sharp stumping.
Chahal soon joined in to take the key wickets of Angelo Mathews, for 17, and skipper Thisara Perera, for six, as Sri Lanka slipped to 197-6 and failed to survive their full quota of 50 overs. Meanwhile veteran fast bowler Lasith Malinga continued to be kept out of Sri Lanka's Twenty20 squad that will play three matches against India starting Wednesday in Cuttack. AFP

Coca-Cola and World Trade Centre Give Back Life to 23,000 PET bottles in recycled Christmas dcor
Environmentally conscious!
In keeping with its much-loved tradition to make the Christmas season a special one the world over, Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. and the World Trade Centre (WTC) dove into the festivities, but this year with the impactful message of being environmentally conscious and reducing waste. In a unique display of Christmas cheer, colourful, vibrant, upcycled Christmas trees and wreaths made from the recycling of Coca-Colas PET bottles adorn the World Trade Centre, Colombo. Coca-Cola provided 23,000 PET bottles towards the handmade Christmas dcor by MAIC, commissioned by the WTC. Visitors to the busy offices of WTC will be treated to this wondrous celebration of Christmas with an environmentally conscious core.
This collaboration between WTC, MAIC and Coca-Cola is yet another initiative through Coca-Colas Give Back Life (its campaign in PET collection, recycling and waste management). A creative reimagining of empty PET bottles, which otherwise would in day-to-day life end up in garbage dump sites. PET bottles are 100% recyclable (i.e. identified with the number 1 inside the recycling logo) and tend to be used for packaging of beverages, toiletries and cooking items in Sri Lanka. Coca-Colas Give Back Life drives awareness of individual responsibility of waste disposal and recycling, and champions the importance of community-led, sustainable initiatives in post-consumed PET recovery, recycling and waste management practices through its principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.
Coca-Cola has successfully led large-scale PET clean-up drives through community-led volunteerism during the Kataragama Festival and the Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week.

Evacuations for Californias third-largest wildfire in 85 years
US: Evacuation orders were issued Saturday for areas in Californias Santa Barbara County as the state battles its third-largest wildfire since 1932, with winds and dry conditions threatening to help the blaze grow.
Santa Barbaras Office of Emergency Management announced a series of mandatory evacuation orders as well as voluntary evacuation warnings for parts of the county on its Twitter account.
The OEM said that due to extreme traffic on the County Website it has shut down.
The so-called Thomas fire menacing Santa Barbara has already burned 259,000 acres (105,000 hectares) of land, destroyed over 1,000 structures and cost more than $100 million since it broke out on December 4, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.
Conditions including winds, dry fuel and low humidity will continue to support fire growth, Cal Fire said.
More than 8,000 people are involved in battling the blaze, which is now 40 percent contained.
Cal Fire also warned that conditions were ripe for new wildfires to emerge.
Over the weekend winds across northern California are expected to reach 30-40 MPH (48-64 kilometers per hour). Wildfires can strike anywhere at any time, it warned in a Facebook post. Only two fires have burned more acreage in California so far this century: the Cedar Fire of 2003, and the Rush Fire of 2012, which scorched 273,246 and 271,911, respectively.
Cal Fires list of the top 20 largest wildfires in the state dates back to 1932, as earlier records are less reliable, and this list is meant to give an overview of the large fires in more recent times, it says.
The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 reportedly burned 300,000 acres, which would make it the largest.
A series of fires broke out in California this month, most of which have since been contained. The Thomas fire is the only one to have resulted in deaths. San Diego-based Cal Fire engineer Cory Iverson died fighting the Thomas fire in Ventura County, while a 70-year-old woman was killed in an accident as she fled in her car. This year is the worst on record for wildfire devastation in California.
California Governor Jerry Brown has said that the wildfires ravaging his state should serve as a warning to parts of the world threatened by climate change.
The important fact is that these fires are going to become a very frequent occurrence. Thats what the science is telling us, Brown said.
Its a real indicator of bad things to come, and hopefully will serve to wake up people who right now are too complacent. - AFP

EXCON highlights Sri Lankan  construction industry
The significant development of the current Sri Lankan construction industry was focused on by the EXCON 2017 committee headed by Chairman Vipin Sondhi, at a special media session held at Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, Bengaluru, India.
South Asias largest construction equipment exhibition, EXCON 2017 concluded in Bangalore last Saturday with the participation of over 1,000 exhibitors. A record number of 275 foreign exhibitors from 20 world renowned companies from Germany, Italy, China, Finland, Sweden, Hong Kong,South Korea and other countries also represented the five-day exhibition.
Excon Chairman Vipin Sondhi
A large number of sophisticated equipment used by the construction sector including concreting machine plants, concrete pumps, concrete recycling plants, loaders, drilling machines, bacos, cranes and motor gradars were displayed at the exhibition. Thousands of manufacturers, service providers and related sector partners and officials from foreign countries including from Sri Lanka and the Builders Association of India (BAI) also attended the opening ceremony.
Highlighting the current development of the Sri Lankan construction industry, Sondhi said that Sri Lankan construction industrialists will get the opportunity to use the latest construction equipment to fulfill their requirement when constructing large-scale high rise building, apartments, hotels, residential complexs, etc.
He also highlighted that this exhibition can be regarded as one of the top construction equipment exhibitions in the world and said the national agenda of infrastructure development through innovation and smart technology is fueling the next generation to contribute significantly.
He said in future India will manufacture products not only for India but for the markets outside India especially for SAARC, African and Asian countries.
In an interview, Infrastructure Equipment Skill Council (IESC) Chairman Anand Sundaresan said his company has close rapport with Sri Lankan partners involved in constructing high rise buildings, dams, large-scale tourists hotels, residential complexs and many other similar construction work currently ongoing in Sri Lanka.
He said there is a high demand for concrete machine plants, concrete pumps, concrete recycling plants, loaders, drilling machines, cranes and motor gradars for ongoing construction work in Sri Lanka and this equipment could be exported easily from his manufacturing plant located in Chennai.
Sundaresan also focused attention towards establishing equipment manufacturing plants in Sri Lanka as well as in Bangladesh in future and said that at present their manufacturing plants in Chennai could export construction equipment to Sri Lanka easily at low cost as the transportation cost between Sri Lanka and Chennai is not so high.
He highlighted that their product marketing in Sri Lanka is growing fast as Sri Lankans highly respected Indian equipment.
Speaking on the free trade agreement, he said both India and Sri Lanka could engage in business activities in years to come since there is no import duty due to the free trade agreement.

Fake foreign employment agency raided
A foreign employment agency in Galewela which had sent women abroad as housemaids on tourist visas by preparing forged travel documents was raided by Galewela police after obtaining a search warrant from the Dambulla Magisrates Court recently.
Photographs of 50 women and forged passports and visa cards, forged franks of several state institutions and several national identify cards were found by police during the raid.
The raid was a sequel to the arrest of an alleged fraudster who had defrauded several women by demanding sexual favours promising to send them abroad and extorting money from others after threatening to expose video clips of various compromising positions taken with them and recordings of their discussions.
The suspect, a resident of Galewela, was produced before the Dambulla Magistrate and remanded.
The fake agency was at his residence at Puwakpitiya, Galewela.
Among the items seized from the agency were several photographs of the suspect wearing a police helmet and a forged identity card posing off as the Police Service Commission Chairman.
Galewela police said they would conduct further investigations after recording statements from the victimized people.
The Galewela police asked any victim of the agency to provide information against the suspect.

Festive bashes are best
Most of us love this time of year. Everyone relaxes and parties with lots of invitations to both big and little get-togethers. Christmas Day may be no longer than any other day, but for many people, the festive party season now lasts the whole of December. We all want to have fun and indulge every now and then, especially at Christmas time, but sometimes it is hard not to get carried away.
After all, it is meant to be the season to be jolly. But no one in their right senses would like to see anyone jolly-well smashed. I mean really sloshed, inebriated, stoned, plastered or drunk as a skunk as they say.
A good idea
Imbibed judiciously alcohol can be an effective social lubricant. But being under the influence is impolite in any social circle. Besides, becoming drunk and disorderly can become a nightmare for fellow guests and hosts. In any case, imbibing copiously and becoming cruel, mean or violent is inexcusable. Yes, we have all dealt with that one embarrassingly drunk person in otherwise polite company who is unable to hold his or her liquor and seems bent on ruining an otherwise convivial party.
In vino veritas is a Latin phrase that translates in wine there is the truth. This is linked to the important question of drunken comportment. The way we act when drunk is a litmus test of our general behaviour. Alcohol brings out underlying manners.
This is how certain men and women choose to behave when fuelled by the lack of restraint after drinks. Depending on their disposition, they might grow taciturn and weep into their cocktail. No one wants to see grown men crying when everyone else is in gales of laughter and having a great time.
There is the ideologue drunk who is always spouting his political, religious or philosophical views, which are usually very extreme, in purely social situations. The groper is usually a male guest who gets too friendly and cannot keep his hands to himself. He keeps touching and pawing much to the annoyance of a female guest or several of them. Let us be clear about this kind of party animal. This behaviour verges on sexual harassment and must not be tolerated.
It would be a good idea to eject him from the party soon after the infraction, provided he has not already been assaulted by the womans husband or boyfriend. The worst of these are the drunk and violent types. This person gets drunk then belligerent. And, nothing can ruin a party more quickly than a fight.
Learn to hold your liquor at whatever cost. Even if the drinks are flowing freely, avoid drinking too much. Few things are as disrespectful and uncomfortable at a party as a drunk, obnoxious guest, particularly at more elegant affairs.
Grim figures
To all these characters instead of having a good time the fashion is to be a nuisance. That is bad manners as well as being technically discourteous.
But rather than embracing festive merriment, many revellers simply resort to base behaviour  being abrasive and insulting, brawling, vomiting and urinating in public. Public intoxication charges, often called being drunk and disorderly, is a legal charge alleging that a person is visibly drunk or under the influence of drugs in public.
It is usually a misdemeanour crime under the law. Public intoxication laws exist to prevent people from disturbing others and misbehaving in public and to remove people who appear to be unable to stop themselves from hurting themselves or others.
Yet alcohol is a capricious character, flipping from faithful sidekick to spiteful psychopath in the space of a few small sips  and its unpredictability is particularly acute at Christmas.
With the holidays come family gatherings, office parties, socialising with friends and get-togethers. These are occasions we look forward to all year. But there can be a dark side to the holiday cheer: Drunk driving and the injuries and deaths that result.
Every December we see a spike in highway fatalities during the Christmas and New Year holiday periods. These appalling grim figures do not reflect the other horrific consequences of such accidents such as a childs loss of a parent, a wifes loss of her wage-earning husband, and the severe injuries and lost income innocent passengers may suffer.
Most of us enjoy hosting holiday parties for friends and family. However, with the decision to serve alcoholic beverages comes the responsibility to make certain our guests do not leave the party so impaired that they are unable to drive safely.
The flow of festivity
Keep an eye on your guests as you circulate during the party. If you observe someone take more than one or two alcoholic drinks or you see someone who shows signs of intoxication, be positive. Determine whether the person expects to drive himself home. If so, intervene and ensure that a sober driver takes him.
Many of us know family members or friends who drink too much at holiday parties. You recognise your husband, friend, brother or sister risk his or her life and the lives of others when he or she gets behind the wheel in an intoxicated state. Stick to the old safety adage: If you drink dont drive. If you drive dont drink!
Yes, it largely depends on you. For your own safety, think twice before you travel the roads and highways late at night during the holidays. There are more intoxicated drivers on the road in the late evening and early morning hours.
Contrary to what you might think you can party up a storm over the holidays and do it mindfully.
Yes and you will stand out from the rest as the responsible man who can hold and handle alcohol just as he can handle everything else in life with total class and respect.
Mindfulness means being truly present for the moments of our lives on every level body, mind and soul. So as you party and play, stay connected to yourself in the present moment - so that you feel and experience the true spirit of celebratory bonhomie and fellowship.
When your energy is high, go for it  play and dance and laugh and share and revel in the energy of celebration! Go with the flow of festivity and soak it all up. The great thing about mindful merrymaking is that you stay in touch with yourself. So you see, the silly season can be a celebratory, toppingly mindful time that can leave you feeling light, refreshed and happy.

Fiction concentration
Ernest Hemingway writes in the bedroom of his house in the Havana suburb of San Francisco de Paula. He has a special workroom prepared for him in a square tower at the southwest corner of the house, but prefers to work in his bedroom, climbing to the tower room only when characters drive him up there.
The bedroom is on the ground floor and connects with the main room of the house. The door between the two is kept ajar by a heavy volume listing and describing The Worlds Aircraft Engines. The bedroom is large, sunny, the windows facing east and south letting in the days light on white walls and a yellow-tinged tile floor.
The room is divided into two alcoves by a pair of chest-high bookcases that stand out into the room at right angles from opposite walls. A large and low double bed dominates one section, oversized slippers and loafers neatly arranged at the foot, the two bedside tables at the head piled seven-high with books. In the other alcove stands a massive flat-top desk with a chair at either side, its surface an ordered clutter of papers and mementos. Beyond it, at the far end of the room, is an armoire with a leopard skin draped across the top. The other walls are lined with white-painted bookcases from which books overflow to the floor, and are piled on top among old newspapers, bullfight journals, and stacks of letters bound together by rubber bands.
It is on the top of one of these cluttered bookcasesthe one against the wall by the east window and three feet or so from his bedthat Hemingway has his work deska square foot of cramped area hemmed in by books on one side and on the other by a newspaper-covered heap of papers, manuscripts, and pamphlets. There is just enough space left on top of the bookcase for a typewriter, surmounted by a wooden reading board, five or six pencils, and a chunk of copper ore to weight down papers when the wind blows in from the east window.
A working habit he has had from the beginning, Hemingway stands when he writes. He stands in a pair of his oversized loafers on the worn skin of a lesser kuduthe typewriter and the reading board chest-high opposite him.
When Hemingway starts on a project he always begins with a pencil, using the reading board to write on onionskin typewriter paper. He keeps a sheaf of the blank paper on a clipboard to the left of the typewriter, extracting the paper a sheet at a time from under a metal clip that reads These Must Be Paid. He places the paper slantwise on the reading board, leans against the board with his left arm, steadying the paper with his hand, and fills the paper with handwriting which through the years has become larger, more boyish, with a paucity of punctuation, very few capitals, and often the period marked with an X. The page completed, he clips it facedown on another clipboard that he places off to the right of the typewriter.
Hemingway shifts to the typewriter, lifting off the reading board, only when the writing is going fast and well, or when the writing is, for him at least, simple: dialogue, for instance.
He keeps track of his daily progressso as not to kid myselfon a large chart made out of the side of a cardboard packing case and set up against the wall under the nose of a mounted gazelle head. The numbers on the chart showing the daily output of words differ from 450, 575, 462, 1250, back to 512, the higher figures on days Hemingway puts in extra work so he wont feel guilty spending the following day fishing on the Gulf Stream.
A man of habit, Hemingway does not use the perfectly suitable desk in the other alcove. Though it allows more space for writing, it too has its miscellany: stacks of letters; a stuffed toy lion of the type sold in Broadway nighteries; a small burlap bag full of carnivore teeth; shotgun shells; a shoehorn; wood carvings of lion, rhino, two zebras, and a wart-hogthese last set in a neat row across the surface of the deskand, of course, books: piled on the desk, beside tables, jamming the shelves in indiscriminate ordernovels, histories, collections of poetry, drama, essays. A look at their titles shows their variety. On the shelf opposite Hemingways knee as he stands up to his work desk are Virginia Woolfs The Common Reader, Ben Ames Williamss House Divided, The Partisan Reader, Charles A. Beards The Republic, Tarles Napoleons Invasion of Russia, How Young You Look by Peggy Wood, Alden Brookss Shakespeare and the Dyers Hand, Baldwins African Hunting, T. S. Eliots Collected Poems, and two books on General Custers fall at the battle of the Little Big Horn.
The room, however, for all the disorder sensed at first sight, indicates on inspection an owner who is basically neat but cannot bear to throw anything awayespecially if sentimental value is attached. One bookcase top has an odd assortment of mementos: a giraffe made of wood beads; a little cast-iron turtle; tiny models of a locomotive; two jeeps and a Venetian gondola; a toy bear with a key in its back; a monkey carrying a pair of cymbals; a miniature guitar; and a little tin model of a U.S. Navy biplane (one wheel missing) resting awry on a circular straw place matthe quality of the collection that of the odds-and-ends which turn up in a shoebox at the back of a small boys closet. It is evident, though, that these tokens have their value, just as three buffalo horns Hemingway keeps in his bedroom have a value dependent not on size but because during the acquiring of them things went badly in the bush, yet ultimately turned out well. It cheers me up to look at them, he says.
Hemingway may admit superstitions of this sort, but he prefers not to talk about them, feeling that whatever value they may have can be talked away. He has much the same attitude about writing. Many times during the making of this interview he stressed that the craft of writing should not be tampered with by an excess of scrutinythat though there is one part of writing that is solid and you do it no harm by talking about it, the other is fragile, and if you talk about it, the structure cracks and you have nothing. - Paris Review

GOODBYE AND GOOD LUCK, SRI LANKA
I am going to complete my assignment and return to my motherland today. On February 24, 2015, I arrived in Colombo and started my assignment as the 20th Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka. During the past two years and nine months, I traveled to all 9 provinces and 25 districts of Sri Lanka, made a lot of local friends and witnessed the China-Sri Lanka relations overcome obstacles, move forward and usher in new development opportunities.
China and Sri Lanka have maintained close high-level exchanges and deepened mutual trust. President Maithripala Sirisena paid a state visit to China at the beginning of his presidency and held fruitful meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, indicating the direction for the sustained and in-depth development of China-Sri Lanka relations. The two leaders have maintained close communication on international and regional occasions.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe successfully made official visit and work visit to China and attended the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, further promoting the deepening of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Yu Zhengsheng, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, exchanged visits. Bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been continuously expanded.
The mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has achieved new development and brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. At present, China has become the largest trading partner, the largest infrastructure construction partner of Sri Lanka and the largest source country of investment, donation and assistance to Sri Lanka.
The economic and trade cooperation between China and Sri Lanka has created more than 100,000 jobs, trained tens of thousands of technical and managerial talents, and played an irreplaceable role in the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. Under the guidance of the Belt and Road Initiative and the concept of engaging in extensive consultation, making joint contribution and sharing benefits, the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is striding forward.
Development projects
The Port City and Hambantota Comprehensive development projects are taking off together, further facilitating the development of China-Sri Lanka pragmatic cooperation. China and Sri Lanka are friends in need. The Chinese people will not forget the precious support that the Sri Lankan government and people gave to the Chinese people when disasters like Wenchuan Earthquake hit China. Likewise, whenever Sri Lanka is faced with natural disasters, the Chinese government and people empathize with Sri Lankan friends and always provide assistance to the government and people within our capacity. The Chinese people with the peculiar characters of sincere, amity, pragmatism and efficiency, will work together with the Sri Lankan people to build a more richly endowed, more prosperous, more modern and more industrialized Sri Lanka.
China- Sri Lanka millennium friendship is shining in a new era through cultural exchanges and mutual learning. Both China and Sri Lanka are ancient civilizations. Buddhism has been the shared culture of the two countries over 1600 years. I am glad to see that the cultural exchanges in Buddhism, tourism and education and so on are becoming increasingly popular. The Buddhist monks of the two countries maintain close exchanges and keep learning from each other.
Friendship between China and Sri Lanka
China is one of the largest tourist source countries of Sri Lanka. The ubiquitous Chinese tourists have not only contributed to the economic development of Sri Lanka, but also enhanced the understanding and friendship between our two peoples. The Chinese government provides Sri Lanka more than 100 government scholarships and 2,000 traineeships every year. Fifteen Sri Lankan universities have established Chinese Ambassador Scholarship. The Chinese philharmonic orchestra, the Shaolin monks wushu troupe, and other Chinese cultural troupes with Chinese characteristics are warmly welcomed in Sri Lanka. More and more Sri Lankan friends are learning Chinese, they will become new envoys for China-Sri Lanka friendship in the future.
History is a mirror that reflects the boom and bust. The flourishing relations between China and Sri Lanka tell that the historical friendship between China and Sri Lanka is unstoppable. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka. We are proud of the achievements of our relations in the past 60 years.
At present, China-Sri Lanka relations have entered a new fast track under the guidance of Belt and Road initiative. I am confident that China-Sri Lanka longstanding friendship and mutually beneficial and inclusive cooperation will continue to create new wonders for the benefit of the two countries and the two peoples and make important contributions to peace and development in the Indian Ocean region.
Dear friends, Sri Lanka has become my second hometown. The honest and friendly Sri Lankan people, the mountains and rivers, the flowers and trees of the beautiful island nation, will become my sweet and permanent memories. The experience here will be the invaluable wealth of my life. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, ministers, parliamentarians and the Sri Lankan people for your precious support for carrying out my competence. In the future, wherever I am, I will continue to pay attention to Sri Lanka and support the development of China-Sri Lanka relations.
Sincere and indeed friends wont become alienated because of the distance. Goodbye and good luck, Sri Lanka!

Jadeja hits six sixes in an over ahead of South Africa tour
NEW DELHI, Saturday: Swashbuckling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja smashed six sixes in an over in a local cricket match, sending selectors a reminder of his short-form prowess after being omitted from Indias recent Twenty20 squads.
Jadeja scored 154 off just 69 deliveries in his explosive innings during a district-level T20 game on Friday in Indias western Gujarat state, including a total of 10 sixes.
The 29-year-old left-hander has been left out of Indias one-day and T20 squads of late, last playing the shortest version of the game at international level in July against the West Indies.
However, he has been a match winner for India in Tests -- a format in which he is currently ranked second in the world among all-rounders.
Only four batsmen have ever achieved the feat of hitting six sixes in one over in first-class or international matches.
Indias Yuvraj Singh and South Africas Herschelle Gibbs recorded the sixes in international cricket, while Gary Sobers and Ravi Shastri did so in first-class games.
However, Jadejas innings will not be added to that list as it only came at local level, between Jamnagar and Amreli districts.
A wily left-arm spinner, Jadeja is expected to play a key role when India tour South Africa in January for a three-Test series.
India will also play six one-day internationals and three T20 matches in the tour, for which squads have yet to be announced.
India are ranked number one in Tests with South Africa just behind on two. - AFP

Leaders must promote, protect collective identities: CBK
Leaders must recognise, promote, protect the specific collective identities of their nations, but they must open up to the globalised world, former Executive President of Sri Lanka Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said on Saturday.
Speaking at the ongoing India Ideas conclave, Kumartunga hailed the leadership qualities of Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Abraham Lincoln, and asserted, Many of the conflicts which we see around us, in our region, in the world, may not have existed or could be resolved if we have leaders with such an agenda.
When I say, specific identity of a nation, I do not mean only the identity of one group.
The dominant group in a nation. I mean the collective identity of a nation, which is formed on this collective identities of all the communities, living within that nation, said the Sri Lankan politician who served as the fifth President of Sri Lanka and survived many assassination attempts in ethnic-conflict-affected country.
Tracing the history of violence and conflicts, she said the demand for identity, the recognition for identity, right or wrong has led to much violence in our generation within the last, I would say 75 years.
The conflicts we see around us, almost all of them are also founded on the demand of identity. Identity of groups within nations, or specific identities of different communities.
Today this situation has been further exacerbated, she said, adding,  Even the major world powers, rather than opening out, are limiting themselves to promoting their specific interest of their nation.
The recent America First policy adopted by the present American government is an example of this.
Speaking of true inspirational leadership, she said leaders in general cannot follow people.
They must lead them. Indeed they must be sensitive to their peoples needs, their desires, their hopes, but they must lead them towards enlightenment, towards what is right for the nation, but also what is right for the world.
A world marked by diverse communities, diverse peoples, different nations intermingled within, said Kumaratunga, and added, With the recognition that each of the communities will have the right, the full right to equal status, to have the full right to their culture, their religions, their social traditions.
But they must all come together in one nation, recognising the national identity as one nation.
Kumaratunga invoked exceptional leaderships like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, who, she said have gone beyond that, risen above that to bring the nation together, around one vision, around one interest of a nation and yet through recognition of diversity, the respect of diversity of difference.
I would say this is essential in this moment, in our modern world, she said. - The Hindu

Think about the bigger picture
Life lessons from Meryl Streep and other successful women
Theyve won Oscars, Pulitzers and Nobel peace prizes: eight women at the top of their game tell us how they got there
Meryl Streep has been nominated for more Academy Awards than any other actor, and has won for Kramer vs Kramer, Sophies Choice and The Iron Lady. In 2015, she sent every member of Congress a letter supporting a proposed amendment to the US constitution to mandate equal rights for women; the amendment was not passed.
I didnt always want to be an actor. I thought I wanted to be a translator at the UN and help people understand each other. Some young people come into acting because they see it as glossy and heightened and more sort of divine than their existence; but what interests me is getting deep into someone elses life, to understand what compelled them to move in one direction or the other. That other stuff, Ive never liked. My mother used to say, People would give their right arm to walk down that red carpet. Enjoy it! You just cant change who you are.
The influencers in our industry are overwhelmingly men: the critics, the directors branch of the Academy. If they were overwhelmingly female, there would be a hue and cry about it. Women have 17% of the influence, more or less, in every part of the decision-making process in the industry and, inevitably, thats going to decide what kind of films are made. But the material that comes to me is still interesting. Im 67, so mostly I get things for people that age, and there are wonderful projects that would never have existed even 10 years ago. Twenty years ago, I would have been playing witches and crones.
Daughters of Eve, Co-founder, Nimco Ali
Going from job to job, never knowing where the next one would be, has allowed me to spend time with my four kids  more than if Id worked at a desk job. Thats a really tough gig, and I dont know if I could have had four kids and done that. Decisions I made in my career were not always based on aesthetic criteria: was it near, was it going to be shot in the vacation You make all sorts of compromises in order to have this other thing that you value. My girls and my son and my husband are all way too much in each others business, I would say, but were close and thats important. I always tried to stay challenged and work hard, but also keep my hand in and stir the pot at home.
I spent far too much time when I was younger thinking about how much I weighed. If I could go back, Id say, Think about the bigger picture. Of course, its a visual medium. We think about our looks. I dont bring a suitcase with my dossier in it to an audition, I bring my body, so you cant moan about the fact that youre judged on your looks: its showbusiness. But the other thing is that youre representing lives, and lives look all different ways and shapes. Thats one thing I do see changing, and its really good. It makes the cultural landscape richer.
Nimco Ali was born in Somalia. She is the co-founder, with Leyla Hussein, of Daughters of Eve, a non-profit organisation that supports young women from communities that practise female genital mutilation (FGM).
I had FGM as a seven-year-old, and later saw girls going through it, but I didnt join the conversation. Then I started to see my silence as complicity. Around 2010, I moved to London and came across people working around FGM, but I couldnt see what they were trying to achieve. I wanted to educate people, yes, but this isnt a question of ignorance; its organised crime. I got together with Leyla, and we started to do more with MPs.
I want to place the responsibility in the hands of the state. Ive seen community work being done for years, and it doesnt work. Its not up to communities to police themselves.
MP, Mhairi Black
People were saying, How can mothers allow this but I was saying, How can you, as a citizen of this country, know a five-year-old is about to be cut and stand by because youre afraid to offend her community Youre telling that child she doesnt matter.
It was early 2011 when I first said, Im Nimco and Im an FGM survivor. A lot of people were shocked. But I didnt want to be treated with sympathy: I wanted to talk about survivors, not victims, and I wanted to prevent it.
First came redefining FGM with the Home Office as an act of violence; then defining it as child abuse. It was a way of saying to these girls, Youre British and we care about you as much as anyone else. My vagina is British; it doesnt have a different passport.
The first time my picture appeared in a newspaper, I had death threats. I stayed in bed for two days, wondering, Is it worth it But then I felt guilty. If a girl goes through infibulation and then disappears, we never find out. If something happens to me, at least someone will know.
Having friends I can talk to has been an immense help. A girl came up to me on the tube and said, Are you Nimco, the girl who talks about FGM And I thought, This is where I get spat on. But she wanted to thank me. I dont think of myself as a leader, but as part of a chain. If it wasnt for all the amazing women who came before me, I wouldnt be able to do any of it.
Samantha Power moved to the US from Ireland when she was nine. Her first book,A Problem From Hell: America And The Age Of Genocide, won a Pulitzer prize. In 2013, she was made US ambassador to the United Nations.
I had recently graduated from university in 1992 when I saw images in the New York Times of bone-thin stick figures in camps in the former Yugoslavia  images I didnt think one could see in the 90s. I wanted to help, but didnt have any skills. I had been a sports reporter in college, so I decided to try my luck at being a war correspondent. It was a bit of a crazy idea, but a lot of young people were doing the same thing, because they felt horrified and powerless.
Im not great at languages, but Im great at talking, and my stubborn desire to communicate with people got me to the point where I could do interviews in the local language. I wrote about my experience, and looked at why the US did what it did when faced with genocide in the 20th century. One key conclusion was how hard it was to effect change. But it still felt as though no other organisation could make an impact like the US government. It seemed to me it would be more efficient to be inside the government than on the outside, throwing darts.
These werent steps on a conventional path, and my advice to young people would be not to decide on a job title and script a path toward it, but to develop your interests  go deep instead of wide.
Ive tried to inject individual stories into everything I do: real faces and real people. Empowering women to get involved in government and diplomacy brings a different set of perspectives, which benefits everyone. This isnt a theory, its a fact: according to the UN, womens participation increases the probability ofpeace deals lasting 15 years by 35%.
My son was born in 2009 and my daughter in 2012, and I hope, as a result of this job, theyll be more empathetic, more globally curious. My son is a big baseball fan, as am I, and when Im finished, were going to travel the US and see a game in each of the different ballparks. I hope to make up for some of the lost time.
United Nations,US Ambassador, Samantha Power
Mhairi Blackis the SNP MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South. In 2015, aged 20, she became the youngest British MP since 1667.Her maiden speech in the Commonshad 11m views online.
I was brought up in Paisley: it was Mum, Dad, my older brother and me. We used to go on caravan holidays to the north of Scotland. My mums mum had 13 children, so I had lots of cousins to play with.
Our family has always been politically aware: my grandparents were involved in trade unions and Mum and Dad were teachers. When I was eight, my parents, brother, aunties and I marched against the Iraq war in Glasgow. Tony Blair was in town for the Labour party conference, but apparently he got word of the march, so, by the time we were marching past the building hed disappeared in a helicopter. I remember finding that really unfair, even at eight.
Inequality of any kind is the thing that drives me. I always look at who is losing out, and why. Everything I am interested in boils down to the fact that theres an injustice happening somewhere.
When the independence referendum was announced, I was a yes voter, and I thought, if there was ever a time to join a political party, its now. After we lost the referendum, a couple of folk in the local SNP party were saying I should put my name forward to be a candidate, and I said, Dont be daft. Im 20. What do I know about life I was giving myself the sort of criticism that other people give me now. People in the constituency started challenging me, saying, Why is that a bad thing Surely parliament should represent everybody. And I thought, Thats a good point. OK, Ill go through the vetting process and see if I pass.
I had no idea what to do after university, but I think its good to try things and, if youre good at them, keep going and see how far you get. Mum and Dad taught my brother and me to have confidence in ourselves, but never arrogance  theres a fine line. Confidence comes from giving yourself credit when its due. My parents always said that as long as you know your stuff and you know what it is youre going for and why, and if youve practised hard and think youre good enough, then, by all means, stand up and make sure youre counted.
Ill be happy if, in five years time, I can say, The place I am representing has been better represented than it ever was before.
I think part of the problem with politics has been people viewing it as a career. You shouldnt be in it in order to become first minister. It has to be for a purpose, and it has to be in the present.
Leymah Gboweeis a Liberian peace activist. In 2002, angered by the civil war, the then 30-year-old social worker and mother of four (she now has seven children) organised a march on the capital, with a sit-in that lasted months, leading President Charles Taylor to agree to peace talks. The womens actions led to the removal of Taylor and the inauguration of Africas first female president,Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, with whom Gbowee shared the Nobel peace prize in 2011.
I was 17 when the civil war started. I had just finished high school and was planning to be a doctor, but the war upended everything. I did a three-month social work course, because that seemed the most immediate way to help. In time, I worked with former child soldiers. I was in one village when the government sent in a truck to abduct children and teach them how to use AK47s. I was with the mothers, watching their children being taken.
By 1998 I had met activists from Sierra Leone who claimed that women could change things, but it was only when I began to work with the wives of ex-combatants that I saw what they meant. The ex-soldiers were often very violent and angry, but their wives stood up to them.
There was a lot of work to do to create a movement that would have some impact: it took us two and a half years. The important thing was that we had no political agenda: we had a shared vision for peace. We were there because we cared about our families.
In 2002 we marched on the capital, Monrovia. There were thousands of us. When we started a sex strike, it became a huge story, and an opportunity for us to talk about peace.
Then, when it was clear that nothing was coming of the peace talks in Ghana, we went to the hotel where they were being held and said we would disrobe. This horrified people: to see a married or elderly woman deliberately bare herself is thought to bring down a terrible curse.
We were able to use things that were ours  our empathy, the ways we are perceived  to make the men listen. It is important we understand our strengths, because in war, the rape and abuse of women and children are seen as ways to demoralise the enemy, to show them they are unable to take care of their families.
It is no longer an option for women to say, Im not a politician. We need to up our game. The age-old excuse has been that we cant find the good women. It is time for the good women to step up.

Manufacturing sector PMI up 4 index points
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded 58.8 in November which is an increase of 4.0 index points compared to October 2017. This indicates that the Manufacturing activities expanded at a higher pace in November compared to October 2017.
This was mainly driven by the New Orders and Production sub-indices owing to the increase in manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco related activities in line with the seasonal demand.
Further, Employment and Stock of Purchases sub-indices also expanded at a higher pace during the month compared to October 2017. Meanwhile, the Suppliers Delivery Time sub-index lengthened, albeit at a slower rate, compared to the previous month. Overall, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold signalling an overall expansion in November 2017. Moreover, The Expectation for activities for next three months remained high with some moderation compared to the previous month.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 57.4 index points in November from 55.3 index points in October 2017. This indicates that the Services sector accelerated at a moderate pace in November 2017. This acceleration was supported by Business Activity, New Businesses and Employment sub-indices. Expectations for Activity for next three months decelerated while Backlogs of Work declined in November compared to October 2017.
The expansion in Business Activity was mainly observed in Financial Services and Telecommunication sectors, reasons being expansion of service delivery channels and technology based improvements. Employment reached a four-month high with companies gearing up with increased staff levels for the festival season and recruitment for previously opened positions. Prices Charged decelerated in November compared to October 2017 while Expected Labour Cost increased in November 2017 due to seasonal benefits such as bonuses, festival advances and encashment of unutilized leave for 2017.

Join Opposition (Jo) parliamentarians from the Pohottuwa party were leaving it in great numbers after realising that they have no future in the party, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was addressing the media after handing over the election deposits of UNP candidates for the Kandy MC and the Gangawata Korale Pradesheeya Sanbha at the Kandy Elections Office on December 16.
No other party can offer a strong challenge to the UNP today. The UNP defeated the SLFP and JO combine at the last general election, he said.
He said people in the Kandy district had ensured a convincing victory to the UNP at the last presidential and general elections and they were certain to ensure a UNP victory at the local elections as well.
Kirella said the Kandy City would undergo a wide-scale transformation in development under a Japanese aid scheme shortly.
This development project undertaken under the direction of the Prime Minister would usher further progress to the region, he said. Minister Kiriella, who predicted that the present government would remain in power till 2025, added that ensuring a UNP victory at the local councils would enable the government to implement Yahapalanaya policies at village level too.
He said the UNP nomination list for the Kandy Municipal Council included several former mayors as well. He said that under the new election laws, the member commanding the trust and confidence of the majority of the elected membership would be appointed as the mayor.

Minister optimistic in lifting temporary Russian tea ban
Discussions are in progress with Russia at diplomatic level to lift the temporary ban imposed on Sri Lanka tea exports to that country, Palantation Industries Ministry Navin Dissanayake said.
Minister Dissanayake was speaking to the media after participating in a ceremony held at the Nuwara Eliya Gamini Dissanayake Vidyalaya to mark the passing out of a group of students who had completed their education at the school.
He said Russia imposed the embargo on Sri Lanka tea exports after the detection of a betel in a container of tea exported there.
The Minister said he had already commenced discussions with Russia on the issue, and he would do his best to get Russia to lift the embargo.
Minister Dissanayake said the betel found in the container had been identified as a species common in food crops. But it was a little baffling to understand the causes which led to the episode.
The ship which transported the tea cargo had docked at several other ports along its journey. He said Russia was a principal buyer of Sri Lanka tea and he was hopeful of getting the embargo lifted soon.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was present.

Napoli back on top after Inter lose unbeaten record
MILAN, Saturday - Inter Milan suffered an unexpected first league defeat of the season on Saturday, going down 3-1 at home to midtable Udinese, and were knocked off the top of Serie A by Napoli after they won by the same score at Torino.
In the days other game, AS Roma missed a second-half penalty but still beat Cagliari 1-0 with a stoppage-time goal by Federico Fazio, awarded after a consultation with the video assistant referee (VAR).
VAR was also used at the San Siro to award a second-half penalty to Udinese which Rodrigo De Paul converted in what proved to be the turning point as Inter were finally beaten in their 17th game of the campaign.
The referee initially signalled a goal kick but changed his mind and gave handball against Davide Santon after consulting the VAR.
Inters defeat opened the door for Napoli to move back to the top of Serie A with 42 points from 17 games, two clear of Inter. Romas win took them level on 38 points with third-placed Juventus, who visit Bologna on Sunday.
Napoli captain Marek Hamsik equalled Diego Maradonas club record of 115 goals as his side raced to a 3-0 lead after half an hour, suggesting that their recent scoring troubles are behind them.
After failing to score in their last two league games, Napoli quickly refound their touch when Kalidou Koulibaly headed them in front after four minutes.
Jorginho sent Piotr Zielsinki clear of Torinos defence for the second after 25 minutes and Hamsik fired home from Dries Mertens pass to finish off a flowing move on the half hour. Andrea Belotti pulled one back for Torino just after the hour.
Udineses win over Inter was their third in four games under coach Massimo Oddo who replaced Luigi Delneri last month, lifting them clear of the danger zone and up to 11th.

New Bishop for Kurunegala
Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando has been selected for the episcopal ordination and enthronement as the sixth Bishop of Kurunegala on January 6, 2018.
Wannakuwatte Mitiwaduge Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando was born on May 5, 1961, to David Fernando and his wife, Neeta Perera, in Moratuwa.
His alma mater was Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. His school gave him a sound educational and spiritual background and nurtured him into a good Christian youth who proved his capacity through school and Sunday school activities, showing remarkable levels of positive attitude, knowledge, and skills.
The most important task for a Christian is to give up one's own will to fulfil the will of God. It was his decision to fall in line with God's will and bow down to his calling at a very young age.
As a result, he entered the Theological College of Lanka, Pilimatalawa, while he was reading for a Bachelor of Engineering in England in 1985.
Further, he went on to earn two MPhil qualifications in Sri Lanka and England, while doing his PhD. He was also involved in many youth programmes in Canterbury, England, and has conducted surveys on the migrant population activities in London and also authored many educational books.Young Keerthisiri Fernando was bestowed with the opportunity to serve the Lord on May 21, 1989, when he was ordained as a deacon at a Service of Ordination held at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour, Colombo.
He did not waste time in serving the Lord and worked tirelessly towards drawing the faithful closer into the presence of the Lord.
As a result of divine and human intervention, he was ordained into Priesthood on November 30, 1990, the following year. Thereafter, he served as a priest in the parishes of Badulla, Matara, Galle, and Moratuwa in the diocese of Colombo and Ratmeewala, Wattegama, Gampola, and Getambe parishes in the Diocese of Kurunegala.
He has also served in the parishes of the Peradeniya University and the Teachers Training College.
His Priesthood has not been confined to only the Parish Ministry as he has served for many years in the School of Special Needs, Ratmalana; St. Thomas College, Bandarawela; and as the principal of The Theological College of Lanka, Pilimathalawa. He has also been attached to the Christianity Department of the Education Ministry, and has been a member of the Advisory Board for compiling textbooks on Christianity. Further, he has served as a lecturer and chaplain at Hillwood College, Kandy; The Theological College of Lanka, and The Denipitiya Missionary Medical Institute. In addition, he has also held many responsible positions in Canterbury and the Diocese of Colombo. His expert knowledge and skills have been an example to not only to the believers of the Church, but also to the clergy, and due to his commitment to Ministry and the cultural and social needs of the people, he was ordained as the Arch-Deacon of Nuwra Eliya on May 1, 2016. Due to his sound international connections, activities, experience, and commitment to faith, the continuing genuine smile of Christian brotherhood, and his positive and challenging outlook, the Diocesan Council of the Church of Ceylon, Diocese of Kurunegala, elected Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando as the next Bishop of Kurunegala on October 21, 2017. The calling is precious, holy, and from God.
The Leader of a Christian church is equal to the position of a good shepherd. As such, the dawn of January 6, 2018, will be a special day for him as well as the Diocese of Kurunegala. Rev. Devapriya Keerthisiri Fernando will be enthroned as the 6th Bishop of Kurunegala amidst a large distinguished gathering of national and international Bishops, clergy, and laity.

Perilous plight of the part-time librarian
Shh. Quietly now, join me as I observe the Modern Part-Time Librarian, once known simply as The Librarian (Scientific Name: Full Timias Benefitus Pension) and seen commonly around public libraries at all hours. Now only observed evenings, weekends, and most holidays. Keep your eyes out for a classic harried facial expression, pilled cardigan (hurriedly mis-buttoned), and a name tag that reads STAFF.
In the first semester of my third year of college, with most of a creative writing degree under my belt, I began to wonder if my liberal arts degree would pay my bills after graduation. An advisor suggested I might find taking on the additional schooling required to become a librarian (a masters degree) worthwhile. Public librarianship seemed like a practical and dependable career, and the more thought I gave to it, the more exciting this profession started to look to me. It was everything I felt was important: being of service, engaging my community, and, lets not forget the consummate perk for a book-lover and writer: being surrounded on all sides by reading material.
Ten years after receiving my degree in Library and Information Science, Im still excited about being a public librarian. It remains everything Im good at and everything I want for the world wrapped up in one job. I love helping people. I love the resourcefulness and problem-solving skills I have to use daily, and the broad scope of knowledge I acquire as a result of finding the answers to everyone elses questions. I still get giddy when I walk through the stacks or when a patron thanks me for making their day easier. My only problem isthis steady gig I trained for It isnt so steady. And after years of seeking full-time employment, my pipe dream creative writing degree is subsidizing my work as a librarian, instead of the other way around.
Article continues after advertisement
A hardy group, this species of librarian survives mainly on cold coffee and stale break room cake. Modern Part-Time Librarians, or PTLs, are known, in general, for making do with less: money, guidance, opportunity, and the aforementioned fresh office snacks. Aside from books, they typically hunt promotions and someone to pick up one of their Saturdays, though in the latter they are usually unsuccessful.
I have worked at nine public libraries in as many years, often at two or three at a time, because I have either part-time or substitute positions. Between my own life transitionsmoving, starting a family, moving againand the challenges of public libraries in my areabudget cuts, layoffs, library boards that believe libraries are unnecessary because home computersmy foot has managed to slip out of every door it has wedged itself in.
My personal situation may be a result of bad timing (I graduated during the 2008 economic crash) and the choice to remain in my home state of Michigan. Even so, more and more I find that I am not alone in my predicament. The growth rate for our field volleys between average and lower than average. The mass retirement of librarians promised throughout library school hasnt been so massive. And when librarians do retire, their full-time positions may be replaced with part-time ones. This has been the case with three of the libraries I have worked at. In my experience, the reason behind this seems to be either shrinking city budgets or tight-fisted library boards. The understaffing of public libraries may look efficient on paper. But what it looks like to staff, and to patrons who observe a reduction of programs and community-building efforts, not to mention a revolving door of temporary workers, is anything but tidy efficiency. What it looks like and feels like on this side is enforced impotence. Can we continue to improve our libraries on a skeleton staff Can we even maintain our current levels of service
Now, I work mostly evenings and weekends at one public library, picking up substitute shifts at another. Most part-time librarians spend the majority of their shifts on desk, which means helping patrons who walk in or call with reference and computer issues, while juggling other duties like building the collection, creating, marketing, and implementing library programs, and devising new ways to make our libraries more user-friendly. Because part-time librarians usually work during off-hours, during evenings and weekends, other duties as assigned can also include situations that administration cant deal with from 9am to 5pm, making us quick decision-makers and pretty much unfazed with whatever shenanigans arise.
Some days, the difference between a day and evening shift in the public library can feel like the difference between an episode of Law & Order and Night Court. Being tasked with this responsibility is problematic, not because part-time librarians are any less capable than our full-time peers, but because of the vulnerable place it puts us (and our patrons) in. Do rules that make sense during the day, like a rule that states librarians must have permission from administration before kicking a patron out, work in the evening when no one else is around If the toilet overflows or a fight breaks out between patrons on the weekend, will we be left to improvise because weve been left out of discussions about how to handle such matters
Watch the Modern Part-Time Librarian in her natural habitat: chaos. She is an expert multi-tasker. She builds collections, plans programs, and plays catch-up on library goings-on, all while fielding questions about slow computers, representing yourself in court, and whether or not she can procure a more cheerful copy of Wuthering Heights. During the course of the next four hours, the Part-Time Librarian will keep pace with it all, despite interruptions, and, at times, despite forgetting which library shes working at.
Chris Burns discussed the trend of hiring many part-time staff to avoid the cost of fewer full-time employees in the 2016 Public Libraries Online article, Remember When This Was Full-Time Your Newest Coworkers Dont. Of his own workplace, Burns states: Supervisors will increase the responsibility of qualified part-time librarians, talk about the amazing jobs theyre doing, and tell them how great it is to have them around, but hiring them full-time wont be an option.
Burnss observation is worrying, because when your job is learning about and connecting to a community, your commitment to that community needs to be whole, even when the job isnt. In my own career, I worry that I need to go above and beyond to prove Im a full-time-worthy employee. But I also worry that if I prove it too well, my bosses or boards will see the bargain they are getting, not the asset they are underutilizing. - Lit Hub

President to debug temporary tea ban
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said, he would make an official request from Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw the temporary restrictions imposed on tea imports from Sri Lanka.
President Sirisena also said that a special delegation headed by Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen will be sent to Russia today to discuss the issue.
Speaking at a public event at Haputale town, President Sirisena said that he was confident that Russia, a long standing friend of Sri Lanka would respond positively to the request to lift the temporary ban on tea exports.
According to agency reports, the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance had said last Thursday that it had taken the decision to impose temporary restrictions after it found an insect, in the packaging of one consignment of tea from Sri Lanka.
The President went on to say that already an investigation has been initiated against the company which had exported the consignment of tea from Sri Lanka in which the insect had been detected.
President Sirisena said steps will be taken to revoke the export license of the said company if found guilty.
Meanwhile, referring to several newspaper reports about certain issues faced by pensioners, the President said that immediate steps will be taken to solve them if the reports were correct.
The President was speaking at the first United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) meeting to support party candidates contesting the upcoming local authority election from the Badulla district.
The meeting had been organized by the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) which is supporting the UPFA at the upcoming polls.

President dedicated lot for SLFPs unity- Amunugama
President Maithripala Sirisena has dedicated a lot for the unity of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Special Projects Minister Sarath Amuniugama said.
A few people in the Joint Opposition (JO) are however of the opinion that the party does not need this unity as they work to their personal agendas, the Minister said.
The Minister was speaking after making the election deposits for the Thumpane Pradeshiya Sabha in the Galagedara electorate recently.
People know was responsible for the creation of a new party while damaging the unity of the SLFP, he said.
Minister Amunugama further said the latest census has revealed that most party supporters who worked with the JO are now rallying round the SLFP.
The Central Committee of the SLFP had decided to offer positions to the JO members if they joined the party. But, it wasnt worked out since certain persons of the JO are against the partys unity.

Deed of gift subject to life interest
Question
My father gifted me a land and a house with his life interest. Now I am going to renovate the house and make changes to the garden. Do I need the consent from my father to proceed with this work
Pradeep  Nugegoda
Answer
Your father has gifted the property, keeping his life interest, so if your renovation activities interrupt the procession of the property, then you have to get his consent before you start it. If it is not interrupting your fathers possession, you can continue with your work without his consent, as you are the owner of the property.

Vehicle belonging to a deceased
Question
My father died from a heart attack 3 months ago. He leased a motorbike, and I paid monthly installments and used it. Now I want to sell this bike. Can I do it legally, because the owner is my father according to the documents Do I need the consent of my mother and sister Please advise.
Srimal - Welipillawa
Answer
If you want to do a transaction, then you need the consent of your mother and sister. You can get it by an affidavit, according to the Inheritance Law. As your father has died without a last will or transferring the said bike, then half of the ownership belongs to the mother and the other half to you and your sister (1/4 each). However, if you want to get their consent for the transaction, then they have to give it to you by a way of an affidavit. You need to produce the death certificate of your father when you submit the transfer papers to the motor vehicles registrar.
Property issue
Question
I advanced a substantial amount of money from 2004-2014 to a relative to purchase several properties and built a house, totalling Rs. 30 million from time to time on the understanding that they will return it on a future date. Now they say the properties and the house belong to them as all the deeds are in their names and I have no right to ask the money back. I have all the bank records to prove that I have advanced the money. Can I take legal action to recover my money If so, will I be able to succeed What is the present prescription period
Saman  Negombo
Answer
You could have given money based on a sale agreement. But if there is no such agreement, then you can complain to the Fraud Investigation Bureau regarding the fraud committed by your relatives. You can also file a civil action to recover your money, but you have to present suitable evidence to prove your case such as bank records.
Nonpayment of lifeinsurance premium
Question
I have taken a life insurance policy from a reputed Insurance Company. Due to my business failure, I couldnt pay the insurance premium continuously for 3 months. What will be the consequences Can I claim the money which I have paid for the insurance so far
Answer
If premiums are not paid, the life policy can be lapsed. You cannot then get your money back unless there is a maturity value or surrender value to the policy which is normally a minimum of three years. Also, remember during that time, your life was covered. Some people have asked me to direct the insurance company to refund the premiums paid. You cant ask the insurance company to refund the premiums you paid, unless there is a surrender valuebecause you were protected and covered during that time.
If your life policy lapses because you have not paid premiums on time, the insurer can ask you to fill up a new proposal form to continue the policy. By this time, your health conditions may have changed and deteriorated with age, and you may have developed medical ailments which you have now to disclose. If you had not allowed your earlier policy to lapse, you would not have had the need to fill up a new proposal form and the insurance company had accepted the risks of the ailments that you may have developed.
Complains to InsuranceOmbudsman
Question
I am a Law student. Please let me know what kind of complains considered by the Insurance Ombudsmans Scheme.
Answer
The following are matters on which a complaint can be made under the Ombudsman Scheme
a) Non-settlement or delay in the settlement of a claim
b) Inequitable or unjust interpretation or application of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy with regard to the following:
(i) Claims including maturities of long-term insurance policies

(iii) Other benefits payable in terms of the insurance policy
c) Any other relevant matters that may be specified or referred to the Ombudsman by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) or the Consumer Affairs Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL).
d) Complaints in respect of charges/fees levied.
e) Complaints by registered/licensed insurance brokers against insurance companies, and also complaints relating to insurance agents working for insurance institutions.

Relative merits
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha has spoken candidly in admitting that his party, the SLFP, had engaged in nepotism in the past. Introducing Deepa Edirisinghe, the daughter of late Soma Edirisinghe, as a candidate from the SLFP, to contest for the Colombo Municipal Council elections, Musthapha said that the SLFP had decided not to include two members from the same family on the party candidates lists for upcoming LG election and that this policy will put an end to nepotism in the SLFP; He said: Since Independence all political parties, the UNP and SLFP in particular, have given opportunities for political families to thrive. He further went onto state that it is difficult to win a seat in a LG body, a provincial council or parliament without powerful political connections. That is how political power was handed down from father to son, husband to wife from father-in-law to son-in-law and from brother to sister. This undemocratic practice must end, he said.
To be fair, although Navin Dissanayake is the son-in-law of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Dissanayake is a politician in his own right, being the son of the late Gamini Dissanayake, and, rose to his present position on his own volition. President Premdasa, it must be said, did not bring his relatives into politics, nor did he encourage his son to take to politics, although Sajith Premadasa had come of age to enter politics when Premadasa was President.
But, as Minister Musthapha said, the same cannot be said of all other leaders who ruled the country, since independence. The rot set in from the very outset when D.S. Senanayake conspired to have his son Dudley, his successor to the throne which led to much heartburn to those who expected the Premiership to be theirs by right, and ultimately led to the SWRD leaving the Grand Old party to form the SLFP.
However to the SLFP goes the dubious distinction of institutionalizing family politics in this country, which, as Musthapha rightly maintained, led to nepotism on an unprecedented scale. So much so that the UNP, during its election campaign in 1977, successfully exploited this state of affairs, putting out a leaflet containing an enormous family tree detailing the political office and positions held by the Ratwattes, Ellawelas and the Divithotawelas et al. which had a big impact with the voting public.
Mahinda Rajapaksa made family politics a fine art, not only having his own brother and son as members of parliament but also filling all the important positions in government with siblings, in-laws and other members of the extended family. Of course, here again it can be argued that the Rajapaksas had a birthright to enter politics, hailing as they do from the famous Rajapaksa political clan in the south, and, like Navin Dissanayake, the benefit of the doubt should be given to Chamal and Namal Rajapaksa.
There will also be those who will point to the political dynasties in our neighbouring countries and will cite the Ghandhis and the Bhuttos as standout examples in this connection and ask what the fuss was all about. It can equally be argued that hailing from a political family should not be held against a member of such a family entering politics. To be fair it can be said that late Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike who took over the mantle from her assassinated husband performed commendably well in that high office, particularly with regard to foreign policy and brought fame to the country by becoming the first woman PM. Equally so was Dudley who spearheaded the agricultural reforms and food drive and whose death drew the largest crowd yet, to a funeral of a political leader, of this country.
Hence, not all leaders of this country who hailed from political families were looked upon with scorn by the populace. On the contrary they won the love and affection of the masses by serving the nation with distinction albeit with those foibles that are common to all politicians.
What is resentful to the public is when the undeserving enter politics due to family connections and elbow out those with the necessary qualifications and aptitudes. This is seen in mostly in the second tier government such as provincial councils where the kith and kin of ministers and MPs have crowded out the genuine servants of the public. In fact today the provincial councils have taken the form of a finishing school, for the progeny of ministers and MPs to enter parliament and enjoy the perks and privileges together with their papas and mamas, like disposing off their duty free vehicles and collecting the combined loot.
Minister Musthapha who has spoken out candidly about nepotism in his party should strive to stop ministers and MPs from his party nominating their kith and kin to contest provincial council elections which will naturally give them an unfair advantage, and, in the process, deprive a deserving candidate an opportunity. Such a move, no doubt, would benefit the country, in the long run.

Residual love keeps filling our skies
Udena Wickramasooriya showed me a few lines he wrote. He had something to say about Clarence Wijewardena, whose 25th death anniversary fell on December 13.
In the silence since you leftI saw you at your best,This peace I leave undisturbed,To enjoy your song as you rest.As the sun setsOn another yearOf you going away,Its your own songThat I sing to you
This he posted on Facebook, adding some lines from one of Clarences popular songs, sandha gilunath, hiru gilunath, mata kamak ne (It matters not if the sun and moon go out), the key line being the last, oba ma langa sitinawanam, kamak ne, kamak ne, kamak ne (if you are with me, its alright, its alright, its alright).
Few spoke of Clarence while he was a alive, and one feels he is still quite under-appreciated. But, as Udena says, its alright.
Those who were and are touched by what he did, know and appreciate, and thats all that really matters.
When Udena came to me with this pithy and apt note, I was reminded of a song where Clarence pays tribute to Mahagama Sekera.
It is one of his lesser-known songs, but is probably the only song about the amazing literary personality. It was Harith Gunawardena who told me about it. When he sent me the YouTube link, Harith said that few talk of Clarence in iconic terms and few talk of Sekera. Clarence did, and thats something special.
The lines were penned by Chitranganie Rajapaksha, according to K.G. Jinasena, a meticulous collector of things written about Sekera. A response-song to the popular Ma mala pasu sohon kothe written by Sekera for Amaradeva, Chitranganie states that she has indeed done as suggested. She believes that the soft winds will sing the song and that Sekera will hear the words and the music:
Duk geeyak liveemata mama selena engili thudu atharinPalangeti gee thanuwa anuwa sihil pawana eya gayaviEthakota e gee rawaya oba hata eseviTranslatable asThus did I write with trembling fingers a songThe cool winds will sing the grasshopper compositionAnd then will it soar for you to hear.
Its a wish. it is also a tribute. It is an expression of grief.
And on this same day of the year, December 13, 25 years later, another poet bade goodbye. Indika Gunawardena spoke often of death in his poetry, indeed as something celebratory. He laughed off all warnings from well-meaning friends who were concerned about the kind of lifestyle he had adopted or had been forced on him by circumstances. When Pasan Kodikara, another less-sung literary figure passed away a couple of years ago, Ravisha Thilakawardana had told Indika that if he doesnt change his ways, he (Indika), would suffer the same fate. Indika had laughed and said sothats good, isnt it
He wrote once: ithin risi nam obata, mathakaye thabaganna mama, evasiman, amathaka karanna (So, if it pleases you, remember; or forget if thats your preference).
A death-wish, then. Expressed in many ways. It was coming, people say now. People includes myself. Not wished for, and not expected.
Indika was no Sekera, but theres something so great about him that has forced the Sinhala poetic community to suddenly confront an immense emptiness and silence. It is hard to figure out why. But heres a possible answer.
Thanks to the internet, there are dozens of poetry groups on Facebook. Many blogs devoted to poetry, and thousands of poets. And yet, we have but a handful of exceptional poets. Indika was one of them. A simple, unassuming and soft human being. Humble to the core. He made everyone laugh. He was not afraid to cry.
A few months ago, he visited me. We spoke of all kinds of things. As he was leaving, he spotted a Grade 11 text book. He smiled and said I drew that cover. Theres so much about him that I never knew and probably never will either. Whats known is enough. Actually, its too much.
He is gone now. Hes taken all his poetry and scattered words and lines to the winds. We cannot ever collect them all. We cannot put them all together in ways he would have, even if we did. What can be gathered will not be arranged as poem. It will not be him. We cannot piece him together. So, in this month where several deaths have converged, even as we remember Clarence and pay homage to Mahagama Sekera, it would not be wrong to let Indika Gunawardena get the last word in.
Obata heki nam ennaMage aadaahanaya da hawasataDevi aluwena sirurehiKisiwakma ithiri vi nethiwitaDakii oba ithiri wu premayaDum bataya dige yanu ahasataCome, if you canthat eve of my cremationalthough there wont be anythingleft in the corporeality turned to ashthis you you will see:from the chimney to the skythe residual love escaping

Russia tea ban temporary - SL Ambassador
The Sri Lanka Embassy in Russia said that they are working closely with both the Russian government and Sri Lankan tea sector stakeholders to find a way out of the temporary ban imposed by Russia on Sri Lanka tea imports.
In an interview from Russia, Ambassador Dr. Saman Weerasinghe stressed that the ban on Sri Lanka tea exports to Russia was temporary.
Dr. Saman Weerasinghe
Rosselkhoznadzor, Russian agricultural safety watchdog, introduced restrictions on the import of plant products (including tea) from Sri Lanka following the detection of a single agricultural pest (Trogoderma granarium) in the packaging material of a consignment of tea shipped from Sri Lanka.
Dr. Weerasinghe said that this pest had created havoc in Russia decades ago and the Minister of Agriculture has invested millions of roubles to get over it. So naturally they (Russia) are worried and this ban is a precautionary measure until such time Russia is satisfied that this would not be repeated again.
He said that the bug was detected in a bulk tea export container from Sri Lanka.
We have identified the company in which this bug was detected and have informed Sri Lankan authorities to take necessary action.
Russia has also said that they will accept all tea that is in mid sea and the deadline for the temporary halt is December 18. Tougher quarantine measures would be adopted to inspect this tea before being released to the market in Russia.
Dr. Weerasinghe stressed that this ban was not politically motivated by Russia and added that both countries enjoy close relations. This was why President Maithripala Sirisena too visited Russia this year.
Sri Lankan team headed by Minister of Plantation Industries, Navin Dissanayake too will visit Russia to talk about this issue. Arrangements and schedules for their meetings are currently being sorted out.
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake was in Russia to launch a major tea promotion campaign in the Soviet states and held discussions with Russias Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev earlier this year.
We have sought a meeting with the Russian authorities and the Minister has said he will travel on any date to swiftly address this issue, Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman, Rohan Pethiyagoda said on Friday.
Meanwhile a statement by the Plantations Industries Ministry said that the Ministry and the Sri Lanka Tea Board are working very closely with all the relevant agencies of government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Commerce, to restore normal trade between the two countries as soon as possible.
The statement added that the present case is an isolated incident and in any case, not a reflection on the quality of Ceylon tea.
Meanwhile, an official from Sri Lanka Tea Board said that the questionable bug would have remained in the container after reuse. This bug has never been associated with tea.
Tea Exporters Association said that the government must come forward to settle this issue soon as Russia purchases about 40 million kilos of tea per year from Sri Lanka which is almost 40% of total exports.
According to tea export statistics, from January to October this year, Russia has been Sri Lankas second largest importer of Ceylon tea after Turkey while Iraq and Iran secure the third and fourth positions.

Yan Oya Project
Sand excavation causes contamination
The sand deposit at the Yan Oya reservoir construction site resulted in contaminating a large area. The sand deposit is a by product of the construction of the project.
Former Anuradhapura Government Agent had proposed to dispose the sand deposit appropriately to enhance the reservoir capacity and help ease the construction works in the other areas.
Accordingly, the government entrusted the sand excavation to the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau.
The excavation, however, went beyond the approved limits to a such an extent that affected even the main dam and the saddle dams of the reservoir.
The Yan Oya Sand Deposit Excavation Project Review Committee headed by the Anuradhapura Government Agent reported that the excavation has gone its limit and it may affect the dams, their surrounding and the Wahalkada tank bund.
About 700 tipper lorries transport sand daily along Kahatagollewa-Kebithigollewa and Wagollakada-Horowpothana main roads and subways. The operations damages the road networks of the area immensely. The Forest Conservation Department, Provincial Road Development Authority and Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau and others impose taxes on the transportation. But they do not take steps to refill or renovate roads, residents complain.
The Review Committee has recommended to relevant authorities that the excavation of the sand deposit be stopped after December 31 and not to renew licences.
The Reservoir Project costs the government Rs. 35,000 million. The main dam construction and the three saddle dams were completed and the final phase including the filling the reservoir is delayed due to the slow resettling of the displaced people in the area.

Seeing double
Guests were left scratching their heads wondering if they had one too many glasses of champagne in this amazing double wedding in China.
Thats because they really were seeing double when identical 26-year-old twins Zheng Dashuang and Zheng Xiaoshuang walked their identical brides - 23-year-old twins Liang Jing and Liang Qing - down the aisle together.
Making matters more confusing, the couples even decided to wear matching outfits too.
The men opted for swish black suits, with white shirts, red bow ties and black baseball caps, while the brides chose identical white off the shoulder lace gowns.
They even made sure their hair was styled the same and wore red lipstick to match the grooms ties.
The families met around 10 years ago. And, after becoming friends it is believed their mothers started plotting to arrange this double event.
The wedding in Daqing, Heilongjiang province, took place on December 3. And although extremely rare, marriages like this - called quaternary marriages - do happen.
It means while each couples children would technically be considered first cousins, their DNA would be so similar as if they were genetic siblings. It would make it nearly impossible to tell who their biological parents are based on their DNA alone.
Lets just hope the newlyweds did not get mixed up on their honeymoon! Mirror

Silenced voices
Most of the women who have ever lived left no trace of their existence on the record of history. In sixteenth-century Europe, it is likely that no more than 5 per cent of women  at most  were literate; ordinary women left no letters, diaries, or notebooks in which they expressed what they felt or thought. For us, their voices are silent.
From the mid-1530s, and especially from the 1550s, ordinary women and men in France started converting, in ever increasing numbers, to Calvinism. The Calvinists rejected the authority of the Pope, abhorred the Catholic Mass, and deplored what they saw as the corruption, hypocrisy, and idolatry of the Roman Church. Their Catholic enemies mocked them with the name Huguenots.
Civil matters
Protestantism spread fast in the south of France, especially in the Languedoc. In Nmes, 8,000 people  roughly two-thirds of the population  gathered in 1561 to hear the famous Protestant cleric, Pierre Viret, preach. By the end of that year, some 50 per cent of Nmess population had converted to Calvinism. These recruits included the local elite. By early 1562, 60 per cent of the twenty-six judges of the citys prsidial court (which had jurisdiction over minor criminal and civil matters) were Protestant, and, by 1563, Huguenots dominated the town council.
Such Calvinist popularity was not unique in the Midi. In Toulouse, it is estimated that one-seventh of the 35,000-strong population were Huguenot by 1562  but that number would soon decline rapidly. The reason for this reversal was that, after Catherine deMedicis granting of legal toleration to Protestantism in January 1562, a confrontation between the Catholic nobleman Franois, duc de Guise, and a group of Protestant worshippers inside the walls of the small town of Vassy on March 1, 1562 ended in the death of fifty people.
The massacre marked the first turn of the cycle of the deadly religious wars that would recur repeatedly across France over the next four decades. The worst incident of the wars was the St Bartholomews Day Massacre of August 24, 1572, in which Catholics killed 3,000 Protestants in Paris, and another 7,000 across France, in episodes of brutal, sickening violence, over the space of four days. Understandably, many former Protestants apostatized.
Seized control
But in the south, certain cities retained their Calvinism, among them Nmes and Montauban. In Nmes, when a massacre occurred in 1567, it was of Catholics by Protestants. On September 30, the Nmois Protestants seized control of the city gates, shouting Kill! Kill the papists! New world!; imprisoned all the leading Catholics; and slaughtered at least a hundred of them, leaving their bloody corpses to rot in the well at the bishops palace. Given the relative populations of the cities of Nmes and Paris, this was proportionately nearly as bloody as the events of 1572. Full control of the city  town council, consuls and court  moved firmly into Protestant hands.
Surrounded by, and regularly under attack from, Catholic forces, the rebel Protestant cities tried to survive with their religion intact in a hostile world.
The chief way that inhabitants sought to distinguish themselves from their Catholic enemies and protect themselves from the wrath of God was to adhere to a strict moral code. In areas where Protestant power was at its strongest, therefore, the Calvinists established a mechanism for the imposition of morality, and for disciplinary action in the case of failure: the consistory, a form of church court. Although the consistories also functioned as the governing bodies and welfare centres for the local churches, the vast majority of their time was absorbed in moral supervision, interrogation and reprimand.
Each consistory consisted of around ten to eighteen men  ministers, elders, deacons and a scribe  who met frequently: in Nmes, they gathered fifty-six times a year. The consistorys elders were charged with policing a handful of local streets and reporting any wrongdoing to the panel. Routine gossip was carefully investigated. Every indiscretion was recorded. Anyone guilty of the slightest impropriety could expect to be summoned before these self-appointed arbiters of morality.
Public reparation
The immoral were punished through a graduated series of shaming penalties, from private admonition, public reparation before the congregation, temporary suspension from the Eucharist, and, for the obstinately recalcitrant, permanent excommunication. These may seem light by comparison to contemporary criminal sentences, which were generally corporal or capital  but evidence tells against this understanding.
Repentance entailed a display of humility that compromised personal honour and was consequently dreaded. When a butcher, Jehan Mingaud, confessed his adultery with Suzanne Bertrande to the consistory in Nmes in 1589 and was ordered to repent before the whole church the following Sunday, he protested that the consistory was being too severe against him and that he would prefer to suffer death immediately than make the said public reparation.
This form of punishment actually aped sentences dealt out by the criminal courts. In Montauban, the register of criminal sentences pronounced by the consuls of the town indicates that secular justice also punished fornicators by the amande honorable la torche au poing a genoulx  that is, a public apology traditionally made in a church by an offender on his or her knees, holding a torch in one hand, in a state of undress, and with a rope around his or her neck. In addition, the church and civic authorities clearly worked together. A surviving register of criminal sentences for Montauban shows cases of paillardise (fornication; from the French paille for hay, as in rolling in the hay) appearing in both that register and the consistorial records: some offenders were being punished twice.
The upshot of this rigour is a series of consistorial records full of interrogations of the guilty, the innocent and the witnesses, which have survived to this day. I have studied thirty-five volumes of consistorial deliberations  some 8,728 pages  from ten cities and towns in the Languedoc between 1560 and 1615.
Consistorial registers
The major series are the consistorial records of Nmes, which are not only some of the best surviving collection of consistorial registers in existence, but among the best records of the way common people lived their lives in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe. These registers rival better-known surviving court and inquisitorial records  such as those from the medieval French village of Montaillou, about which Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie wrote  in richness and insight. Yet, as a body of evidence, historians have neglected them: I am the third historian to read these manuscripts, the second to do so at any length, and the first to use them to explore the lives of ordinary people, and, above all, women.
Women were thought to be primarily responsible for sexual and other sins, so controlling morals meant controlling women. This means that the registers include over a thousand testimonies by and about women, most of whom could not write and left no other record to posterity. In responding to charges of sin or in testifying against others, women offered descriptions of their daily lives, and justifications for their behaviour.

Simple lifestyle changes to prevent cancer
Nearly 40 per cent of cancer deaths could be prevented with eight simple lifestyle changes, new research has concluded. Quitting smoking, eating healthier and boozing less would help stop the disease, which claims 8.2 million lives worldwide each year.
Scientists suggest those three habits can be blamed for 30.4 per cent of all cancer deaths, around 2.5 million - with tobacco proving the biggest burden. Five other habits, including excessive UV radiation, obesity and not exercising enough can be blamed for a further 14.4 per cent of deaths - 1.2 million lives.
Researchers at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, said the total amount is greater than 38 per cent because many deaths involved two factors. Even 'small improvements' would help reduce the risk of dying prematurely from cancer, the Australian researchers claimed.
Their findings, which also highlighted irresponsible sun tanning as a cause, were derived from an analysis of the country's cancer deaths. Figures showed 44,000 Australians died from the umbrella of diseases in 2013 - of which 38 per cent were deemed preventable.
Obesity and infections were responsible for five per cent of the deaths while not exercising enough was blamed for 0.8 per cent. Dr David Whiteman, lead researcher of the study published in the International Journal of Cancer, found that the bad habits fueled 41 per cent of cancer deaths in men and 34 per cent in women.
This is because men smoke and drink more, spend more time in the sun and don't eat as well. There is a lot people can do to reduce their risk of developing and dying from cancer. Even small improvements in these areas would substantially reduce the number of people who die prematurely from cancer each year, he said.
The new findings back up research earlier this year which revealed the remaining two thirds of cancer cases can be blamed on DNA errors. The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center study contradicted widespread belief that the disease is usually inherited or triggered by an unhealthy lifestyle. Cancers triggered by copying errors could occur 'no matter how perfect the environment', the researchers warned in March. The findings explained why cancer can often strike people who follow all of the rules of healthy living and have no family history of the disease. Tobacco and alcohol have long been at the centre of strict regulation due to their substantial links to cancer and heart disease.

The singing Christmas tree comes alive once again at MLH
The Singing Christmas Tree at Mount Lavinia Hotel (MLH) will come alive this year from December 15 to 22, adding to the line-up of events at the colonial heritage hotel.
Featuring a host of angelic voices of choirs from several leading schools in Colombo, the Singing Christmas Tree has become an iconic event at MLH, looked forward to by many.
Emerging from the tradition of singing around the Christmas tree, the first Singing Christmas Tree also known as the Living Christmas Tree was created in 1933 in Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi.
The tree which was initially outdoors was subsequently incorporated indoors as part of Nativity plays. It has evolved into a platform where such choirs as the Jesus College Choir from Cambridge, UK have performed in the past.
We at Mount Lavinia Hotel take pride in initiating unique and exciting ideas in all events we host. The idea of the Singing Christmas Tree was novel to us when we introduced it several years ago, and every year Team MLH is equally excited to host this event. This is our way of welcoming the season of peace and joy, said Remauld Mack, Director Sales & Marketing of Mount Lavinia Hotel.

Part - 2
Q - How much sleep is required for patients who need palliative care 
A - The reason for sleeping several additional hours and feeling lazy to wake up is the decreasing body fitness. A quiet and calm environment should be created for them to sleep. Their hands should be held and rubbed. Speak bit louder enabling them to hear and understand what you tell. Sometime such patients hear you and understand you but are unable to reply because of their weakness. Therefore we have to be kind to them.
Q - How should we monitor their breathing 
A - Sometimes the patient who needs palliative care breath deeper than ordinary persons and sometimes their breathing is not monotonous. Sometimes they do not breath at all for about 30 seconds. The reason for this is weakened blood circulation. Sometimes the patients who are about to die breath from their (opened) mouth.
The head of the patient should be positioned at a height. It is better to keep the patient under a fan or closer to a fan but not too close. All doors and windows should be kept open in order to provide a better ventilation for such patients.
Q - What can be done to ease the discomfort of the patients who need palliative care 
A - Such patients can feel discomfort due to the chemical changes that takes place in their bodies and infection conditions of the brain. Therefore these patients do not know where they are and have no idea about what they see. The patients fold and unfold their fingers all the time due to less blood circulation. Let such patients know that you are with them all the time by holding hands. Let them listen to music. If required, give them drugs according to medical advice. Do not stop their activities and body movements but be careful about the patient's safety.
Sometimes the patient may make an unusual rough sound when breathing. It is due to the collection of fluid inside their air passage. It is not due to any pain or discomfort. Therefore turn them to a side and let the fluid come out from the mouth and wipe out or place a piece of cloth under the chin. If required give relevant drugs to dry out fluids.
Q - What should be done when the hands and legs become cold and blue 
A - Due to poor blood supply the hands and legs can become cold and sometimes blue. When the body try to maintain a good blood supply to the main organs, the other parts of the body such as hands and legs do not get adequate blood supply. Use socks, gloves, blankets to warm-up the body. Do not use electric blankets.
Q - How to manage the caretakers' stress during the process 
A - It is very important to maintain the health of the caretaker. The caretaker should be always healthy and fit. Allocate a certain time for the process.
Share the patient's feelings, happiness and sorrow, give the patient good food, drinks and especially exercises daily. Keep the patient free and happy with his/her family members. Help the patient to achieve spiritual development according to his/her religion.
If the patient is a Buddhist let the patient to listen to Pirith chanting.
Providing palliative care for a loved one / relation / friend is a priceless deed which offers countless merits and self satisfaction. Palliative care does not extend or shortened the life of the patient. It only upgrade the quality of life without bed sores, pains and discomforts.
Q - From where can the public obtain more details and training on Palliative Care 
A - Maharagama Cancer Hospital (Apeksha Hospital-0112850252), National Cancer Control Programme (0112368627), Palliative Care Unit and Maxillo-facial Surgical unit of Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital (0372283435, 0372283436), Palliative Care Unit of Vavuniya General Hospital (0242225482, 0242222761).

SriLankan Chairman replies airlines unions
SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias has replied the airlines unions which wrote to management last week. Following is the text of Dias reply.
We refer to the recent Press and social media reports in respect of a communique forwarded by Alliance of Unions  SriLankan Airlines.
As most of you would know, representatives of the Unions were invited to an awareness meeting on the way forward for the airline on December 6, 2017, where it was explained in detail the position in respect of the proposed restructuring program for SriLankan Airlines.
At the meeting, your confirmation and assurance to make it a success was very encouraging and we kept all staff informed in this respect. However your subsequent letter to us and copied to the Press is contradictory and not at all consistent with the assurances or the spirit of co-operation given at the Meeting.
The current Board of Directors took office in 2015 of a Company with considerable losses, aircraft leases at unworkable rates and unjustifiable and unproductive Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBAs).
In the last financial year, the SriLankan Airlines Group recorded a healthy operating profit and it is due to the provision of finance charges on the previous debts brought forward and the one-off costs paid for the cancellation of unnecessary A350 aircraft ordered by the previous Government and the cancellation of 600 flights due to the closure of the runway at BIA, that caused the final loss to the Group.
Owing to the Government of Sri Lankas financial and other constrains, the Board did not receive approval for implementation of the several restructuring plans put forward with the advice sought from the three foreign consultancy firms, who worked with the management and the Board on these initiatives.
With the pressures of international lending agencies towards re-organizing and restructuring several State Owned Enterprises, the Government of Sri Lanka has appointed an Officials Committee reporting to the Ministerial Committee under the leadership of the Hon. Prime Minister, to come up with the necessary plans to make the Company a viable Entity and thereafter, to find a suitable Partner to drive the airline to the next level.
We are working closely with the Officials Committee to see, how best the debt could be taken off from the Balance Sheet, receive jet fuel at international market prices and right-sizing the Company. The success in these areas will ensure a viable airline.
We have also clearly indicated, the Consultants and the Management will engage with the Unions in the implementation of the Plan on the Restructure of the Company.
We are very mindful of the fact that due to the downturn of the global Airline Industry, there is little demand now especially in the Middle East for our trained and competent staff and as such the closure of the Airline is a concern to all and not in anybodys interest.
Information requested by one of the Unions under the RIT Act cannot be disclosed due to its personal nature and as stipulated so in the Right to Information Act. It is to be noted that the total remuneration of the Senior Management team of SriLankan Airlines amounts to less than 1% of the total wage cost of the Company. SriLankan Airlines is a USD 950 MN (LKR 140 BN) Company in terms of revenue and needs highly skilled and experienced management, employed at market rates in keeping with specialized companies both here and abroad. The Chairman and the Directors are not paid a salary nor any allowances.
A corporate restructure presents the company and employees with formidable challenges. It will be a difficult period but has to be done in the interest of the Airline and its employees. Irrespective of what is reported in the Press and Social media, we are confident that with the buy-in of a majority of our associates we can turn this Company around to a positive situation.

Swift measures to reduce COL burden  PM
Eight essential food items including rice, dhal, sprats, potatoes and onions will be provided to the people under a relief package to relieve the cost of living burden, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The relief package will be provided through out this period until the forthcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year season, the Prime Minister said.
This decision was taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on the Cost of Living chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena, the Prime Minister said.
The Sathosa shops and private traders will be entrusted with the task of issuing these items under the relief package, in addition to the major Food Cities and marketing firms in the cities.
The Prime Minister said The governments objective is to create a society where everyone will be able to lead a happy and contented life. This will be done by ensuring equal educational, health and housing facilities for all.
We have also started a programme to supply essential food items at an affordable price for all. Although it is a difficult endeavour the government has realised it as its bounden duty towards the people, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister expressed these views at a meeting which followed the opening of a new bus stand and market complex at Nivitigala town on December 16.
The Prime Minister said the benefits of the governments programme to supply essential food items as a relief package would accrue to the people in the outstations such as Nivitigala too.
Another problem faced by the government was the scarcity of coconuts. It would take time until 2019 or 2020 for the local coconut production to reach the normal levels. The government was now having discussions on the suitable steps that should be taken to avert any future coconut scarcity, the Prime Minister said.
It also hoped to introduce a better mechanism to provide all essential items to the people at a reasonable price, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said food distribution in the outstations was handled mainly through Sathosa shops. Since there were only 3000 Sathosa shops and outlets in the country, it has been decided to link the private sector too with the project to offer a relief pack of essential food items. As such, Private Sector firms such as Cargills, Keells, Laugfs and Richard Pieris and Company had joined the program.
Since these food outlets served only one third of the countrys population, they had arranged to include dedicated economic centres and private shops too in the programme.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the inclement weather and climatic conditions encountered in the recent past had contributed to the escalation of price of goods.
The Prime Minister said his friend late Minister Gamini Athukorale had a great ambition to develop the Nivitigala area.
This was a very backward area in development when they first visited it in 1977. Kahawatte and the surrounding areas were developed during his stewardship as MP for the area. Although late Mr Athukorale promised to launch development projects in Nivitigala in the 2000-2001 period, he died before those projects came to fruition. The Nivitigala Town Development Plan would be launched under the leadership of Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Mrs Thalatha Athukorale shortly, the Prime Minister said.
The government also had a plan to develop areas coming under the Sinharaja Forest Conservation Programme. As much as they had to protect the Sinharaja forest which is a World Heritage Site they had a responsibility to develop its adjoining villages as weel, the Premeir added.
Since the new Sathipola market complex was utilised only for one day per week, the Nivitigala Traders Association should devise some measure to use it profitably throughout the week. They could devise this plan in consultation with Minister Mrs Thalatha Athukorale, the Prime Minister said.

Togetherness brings about empathy - Gloria Steinem
Were doing it. Pressing send does not allow us to empathize with other people. If you hold a baby youre flooded with empathy. If you see somebody in an accident you want to help them. I love books, but empathy doesnt happen from a book. It doesnt happen from a screen. It only happens when were together.
Gloria Steinem, an American feminist, journalist, and social political activist, had also been a traveller for more than thirty years, speaking, advising, fund-raising, organizing, educating, campaigning, and, in the process, introducing millions of girls and women to the feminist cause.
Co-founding Ms .
Steinem was a columnist for New York magazine, and in 1972, co-foundedthe feminist-themed magazineMs.with American feminist Dorothy Pitman Hughes.
As reported in msmagazine.com, the magazine was sold to the Feminist Majority Foundation, a nonprofit organization in the US, in 2001 and Steinem remains on the masthead as one of six founding editors and serves on the advisory board. She once stated: I think the fact that Ive become a symbol for the womens movement is somewhat accidental. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because Ms. is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, Im more likely to be identified with the movement. Theres no other slot to put me in.
Activism
Among numerous endeavors, in 2005, Steinem co-founded the Womens Media Center, a nonprofit womens organization in the U.S. which works to make women visible and powerful in the media.
Steinem helped to found the Womens Action Alliance, a pioneering national information center that specialized in nonsexist, multiracial childrens education in the United States, and the National Womens Political Caucus, a group that continues to work to advance the numbers of pro-equality women in elected and appointed office at a national and state level in the US.
In 1992, Steinem co-founded Choice USA, a non-profit organization that mobilizes and provides ongoing support to a younger generation that lobbies for reproductive choice.
As reported in web.archive.org, in 1993, Steinems concern with child abuse led her to co-produce and narrate an Emmy Award winning TV documentary for HBO, Multiple Personalities: The Search for Deadly Memories. With American film producer Rosilyn Heller, she also co-produced an original 1993 TV movie for Lifetime, Better Off Dead, which examined the parallel forces that both oppose abortion and support the death penalty.
In 2015, she joined the thirty leading international women peacemakers and became an honorary co-chairwoman of 2015 Womens Walk For Peace In Korea with Irish peace activist Mairead Maguire.
Publications, awards and honors
Her books include the bestsellers My Life on the Road, Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem,Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions,Moving Beyond Words, and Marilyn: Norma Jean, on the life of Marilyn Monroe.
She wrote for Indian publications, and was influenced by Gandhian activism.
She also received the first Doctorate of Human Justice awarded by Simmons College, the Bill of Rights Award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, the National Gay Rights Advocates Award, the Liberty award of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Ceres Medal from the United Nations, and a number of honorary degrees.
Early life
Steinem was born on March 25, 1934, in Toledo, Ohio, United States as the daughter of Ruth (ne Nuneviller) and Leo Steinem. Before Steinem was born, her mother Ruth, then aged 34, had a nervous breakdown which left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent.Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally ill. Steinem was ten years old when her parents finally separated in 1944.Her father went to California to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo.
Steinem once described her mothers experiences  her inability to hold a job and encounters with apathetic doctors  as having been pivotal to her understanding of social injustices. These perspectives convinced Steinem that women lacked social and political equality.
Steinem attended Waite High School in Toledo and Western High School in Washington, D.C.She then graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College in 1956 (The Phi Beta Kappa Society is the oldest honour society for the liberal arts and sciences in the United States).
Feminist positions
Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a radical feminist and has rejected categorization within feminism as nonconstructive to specific problems.Ive turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness, she once said in an interview with motherjones.com. Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked several firm positions.
Nobody cares about feminist academic writing.
Thats careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted but I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulnessand what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability, she told motherjones, voicing her disapproval of obscurantism some claim to be prevalent in feminism.
Steinem has criticized pornography. Writing for Ms.,she explained,Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.
Steinem expressed support for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, stating in 2004 in an interview with Time magazine that The idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction, oppresses womenwhose health depends on separating sexuality from reproductionas well as gay men and lesbians. Steinem is also a signatory of the 2008 manifesto, Beyond Same-Sex Marriage: A New Strategic Vision for All Our Families and Relationships, which advocates extending legal rights and privileges to a wide range of relationships, households, and families.
Women are not going to be equal outside the home until men are equal in it, Steinem once said, converging a vast ideology into a single sentence. At 83, she is still an active fighter for equality.
Her task is an ongoing process that would not rest until accomplished. And the race is not about passing the torch, for, the torch that lights the path to quality belongs to everyone.

Tsunami victims to receive housing scheme
About 500 houses were built with the assistance of the Saudi Arabian government for Tsunami victims at Noracholai in the Akkaraipattu DS Division in year 2009, under the Tsunami Re-Building Development Project.
In order to allocate these houses to Tsunami-affected people, about 500 Interviews were held for the selection of allottees by Ampara District Additional Government Agent K. Vimalanathan at the Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretariat, recently. This housing scheme, which was built after spending a large sum of money, was so far not allocated for the use of the public.
Therefore, these houses were not maintained by anyone.
Before, when the houses were about to be handed over, a case was filed in the High Courts against handing over the houses to a particular community.
The High Court later decided that the houses should be distributed among the three races, in keeping with the ratio of the three communities.
Eight years had gone by and the houses were still locked up.
The delay in handing over the houses had caused damages to them, and valuable parts of the houses have been plundered.

Visakhians flying high
What better way to end the Visakha Vidyalaya centenary year than to take to the skies Visakhians have created history, not only for the school but for SriLankan Airlines by flying an all-Visakhian crew to Japan.
The national carrier  SriLankan Airlines, on December 2, added a new chapter to their history at 40,000ft to commemorate the glorious 100 years of excellence of Visakha Vidyalaya with a flight of Visakhians in the technical crew, cabin crew and an interpreter.
The pilot in command, Captain Chamika Rupasinghe and her crew headed by Senior Cabin Manager Ajantha Karunatilleke, in the SriLankan Airlines UL454 from Colombo (CMB) to Nartia (NRT) was a flight to remember.
We planned this for the schools centenary celebrations. This was possible because out of the two women pilots at SriLankan Airlines, I am the only Visakhian. And there is a lot of Visakhians in the crew. So we had a unique opportunity to have an all Visakhian crew, said Captain Chamika Rupasinghe speaking to the Daily News.
Captain Rupasinghe had been serving at SriLankan Airlines for 12 years as a crew member and 6 years as a pilot. She says this experience to celebrate her schools centenary in the sky was truly memorable.
It was a great experience to see the entire crew from my school. The faces are familiar from school days. Some are senior to me and some junior. And sharing this experience with them was truly amazing, she said.
Captain Rupasinghe added that another similar flight is planned for January as well.
The alma mater camaraderie in the air included the Captain, Cabin Supervisor/Japanese Interpreter Deepthi Peiris, Cabin Supervisor Rashini Rajawasam, Cabin Supervisor Ayomi Indiketiyahewage, Flight Attendants Duresha Kariyawasam, Serangi Jayaratne, Charitha Paranamanne, Umangi Singhabahu, Chithmi Ranawaka, Nishani Dassanayake and Denushka Weeraperuma.
We are proud to be Visakhians. We are also proud to be a part of the nation's flag Carrier and finally we take pride in being Sri Lankan women, the crew stated.
Indeed, the flight was a fitting tribute to their alma mater for producing such high flying women to mother Lanka.

Weathering the clutches of calamity
Each year brings more hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters to the world. Although some parts of the world are impacted more often by these natural disasters than others, the majority of people around the world have come to face more frequent extreme weather events. Therefore, it is vital to better identify, prepare for and find ways to recover from natural and man-made disasters.
Experts from Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bangladesh joined Sri Lankan experts from different fields to share their experiences in and views on natural and man-made disasters at an international symposium organized by the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management (A-PAD SL), recently at Hilton, Colombo.
The focus of the symposium was on Urban Resilience: Building competitive cities amidst disasters. The experts emphasized the need for increased cooperation, regular dialogue and strong involvement among the government bodies, civil society, the private sector, Information Technology and disaster management experts, the Tri-Forces, and the media.
They stressed on the need for proper preparedness, mitigation, and management of disasters.
It was highlighted that as droughts and heavy rains have become a norm in Sri Lanka, in order to minimise the damage arising out of these disasters, there was a need to formulate a national policy on disaster reduction with effective and coordinated efforts of all agencies, as well as the central and local government authorities.
Government's approach to mitigate natural disaster
Sri Lanka lacks a proper mechanism when it comes to mitigating disasters, and if no effective mechanism is formulated as a matter of urgency, the cycles of floods and drought would recur annually, resulting in environmental disasters which lead to loss of lives, property, and infrastructure.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva delivering the keynote address at the international symposium, said the present government had formulated policies and advocated good governance approaches to prevent and mitigate disasters in Sri Lanka.
The Minister also noted that corruption among local politicians who approved illegal and unauthorised constructions needed to be eliminated.
If you take the homes that went under water in the recent floods in Colombo and its suburbs, those houses had been built in unsuitable areas. The authorities found that houses had been built on river banks and canal reservations, he said.
Minister de Silva alleged that local government politicians helped the settlers get approval to build houses on unauthorized lands so that they garner more votes, and added that the issue needed to be addressed from a good governance perspective. Overcoming issues pertaining to corruption, he said, would help overcome issues leading to man-made calamities in future.
In the short term, Colombo was looking at investing in flood control with dams and other structures to help avoid mass flooding, and in the longer term, the city would create large multiple reservoirs on the Kelani River to contain water before it reaches the downstream under a comprehensive programme on flood control, explained the Minister.
He was of the view that usually, our focus was on post-disaster activities, but we also equally need to prevent the probability of people being subjected to disaster.
Measures to combat issues related to climate change is one of the primary objectives of the government, and to include it in the national policies, he said.
The National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister further observed the need to invest in flood control mechanisms to reduce the probability of floods in the country.
He assured that the good governance government and the recent blue green economy concept presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, aims to address many issues pertaining to climate change and natural disaster.
Smart cities and urban resilience
Despite unauthorized settlements leading to a greater impact on people during disasters, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry's Western Region Megapolis Master Plan Project's Project Director Lakshman Jayasekara explained that relocation was a sensitive issue and it needed to be dealt properly sans political and other aspirations, taking an upper hand in the project formulation and implementation process.
A project formulated to relocate people and industries prone to flood, was called off due to want of funds with international agencies failing to commit funds as they were now sensitive to issues related to relocation, he said.
According to the experts present, studies showed that more than half of the worlds human population (approximately 3.5 billion people) live in cities. By 2030, almost 60 percent of the worlds population would live in urban areas, and it was expected to rise to 80 percent in 2050. Moreover, nearly 828 million people live in slums today and the number is expected to rise further.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa informed the symposium that Sri Lanka too was urbanising rapidly, and urban resilience in times of disasters was a major challenge.
He added that failure to invest in city resilience would threaten the progress being made with economic growth.
The panel noted that in the construction of buildings, industries or houses, it was vital that every aspect of life be aligned according to disaster risk reduction and management in order to develop Sri Lanka and other countries in the region to be inclusive and competitive cities amidst disasters.
According to Jayasekara, Sri Lanka was prone to many disasters and it is expected to worsen in future. This however, did not stop houses being built in inappropriate locations.
Houses have been built on wetlands, and now people complain about floods, said Jayasekara.
He mentioned that 20 percent of the western region comprised of environmentally-sensitive areas, but many people had chosen to live on these floodplains.
Sri Lanka has a poor history of implementing housing plans. The plans have been made, but they have simply remained as plans due to political interventions, said Jayasekara.
He noted that there were many shortcomings in the implementation process that took place in the past and as a result, today, they were having difficulties in finding out solutions to many of the issues that have cropped up.
Jayasekara noted that the pressure of finding a solution was going to be high, as the population in urban areas was increasing rapidly.
Role of innovation in building resilient cities
Consecutive governments have raised concerns over the increasing importance of urban resilience, which enables cities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural and man-made crises with minimum damage to the public and economy. But no adequate measures have been been taken as yet to combat the rising problems caused by urbanization.
The delegates at the symposium spoke of various sub themes varying from the role of private sector in the development of urban resilience, climate resilient urban planning, and business continuity.
The United Nations report on sustainable urbanization strategy states that cities vulnerability went beyond exposure to climate change impacts and extreme events. It further explained that millennials in their 20s and 30s were moving into cities at an astounding rate, attracted by the concentration and density of people that they can connect with.
At the same time, companies including startups were increasing and moving into dense, dynamic, and energetic urban centres where talented entrepreneurs, infrastructure, knowledge, and capital were clustered. These two mutually reinforcing dynamics were shifting and shaping the way cities are developed, spurring innovation and revitalization, creating new relationships between local residents, companies, and local governments, as well as exposing underlying challenges in cities.
The city is the hotbed of innovation, said Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry's Trade, Competitiveness and Innovation Programme Director Anushka Wijesingha, as he added that it needed to be made more resilient.
According to Wijesigha, we need to establish an innovative system of knowledge. This mainly translated for the requirement of better data for effective decision-making.
We should expand the number of people who use data and there is a lot to gain in doing that. Open up spaces and data to find common solutions. Collaborative innovation needs to be encouraged whilst improving institution capacity and resilient system, he said.
Wijesingha highlighted the importance of an open innovation challenge to enhance urban resilience.
Some natural disasters are unpredictable and the more prepared the government is, the better we mitigate disasters. This also have to be followed with a constant search for innovative solutions to prevent, mitigate, and manage disasters.

Willful mutilation, alteration and defacement of  Sri Lanka currency notes
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has drawn attention of the general public for implementation of its Clean Note Policy and regulation on the willfully mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes.
The Clean Note Policy has been introduced by CBSL aiming at maintaining the quality standards of the currency notes and thereby helping to distinguish between genuine notes and counterfeits. It is also expected through this policy to enhance image of the country and promote the efficiency of processing currency notes.
Willful mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes is an offence under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 and is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both.
Under Regulation E of the Monetary Law Act, no claim in respect of the willfully mutilated or altered notes shall be entertained and such notes shall be retained by CBSL. The holder of these currency notes will have to suffer the loss of face value of such notes.
Moreover, CBSL has to increase its note printing to replace such willfully mutilated, altered or defaced currency notes requiring it to incur large amount of public funds which otherwise could have been spent for more meaningful purposes. CBSL, therefore, has no obligation to entertain claims in respect of deliberately mutilated, altered or defaced currency notes.
Accordingly, CBSL advised and requested the general public to refrain from practice of mutilation, alteration or defacement of Sri Lanka currency notes and to exchange such currency notes available on their hand with the nearest branch of Licensed Commercial Banks on or before December 31.
However, CBSL wishes to inform the general public that currency notes that are not willfully mutilated, altered or defaced but damaged due to normal wear and tear during circulation can continue to be exchanged at CBSL and Licensed Commercial Banks as is the current practice.
The CBSL also wishes to invite the general public to assist to preserve the value and integrity of the countrys legal tender by adhering to the Clean Note Policy.

Wine and beer glasses made of cheese
Its a product that could steal the heart of any cheesehead: wine and beer glasses made out of cheese.
But the price Not so gouda: $5,000 for a set.
The bank-busting drinking receptacles are being offered as a promotion by Finlandia Cheese in honor of Finlands 100th anniversary as an independent nation on Dec. 6.
The beer mug is made from Gruyre cheese and holds 16 ounces of beverage. The company recommends stout, bock or wheat beer, none of which you may be able to afford after dropping 5Gs on something you can really only use once.
The wine glass is an 8-ounce stemless sculpted from Gouda cheese. It goes best with red wines like merlot.
The glasses were designed by married food sculptors Jim Victor and Marie Pelton, who said the cheeses used for each glass presented their own set of problems.
Gruyre is harder, so its easier to carve than Gouda, but it also has more of a grain so it can have faults in it - like the Earth, Victor told HuffPost.
Gouda is softer, but it doesnt have the grain.
The cheesy drink set will be available only on Dec. 6 and can be ordered at the Finlandia Cheese Facebook page. Each set will be made to order. Those who do order should be prepared to wait.
I can probably make three in a day, Victor said.
The glasses are smaller than their usual sculptures, Pelton said, but theres still a lot of cheese left over that may be used for other projects - or other meals.
We dont waste food on purpose, but we do get to enjoy what we dont use, she said.
