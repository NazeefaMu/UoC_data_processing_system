Alternative water supply plans for Anuradhapura
Alternative water supply plans are under consideration if the drought continues further in the Anuradhapura District.
Water Supply and Drainage Board (WSDB) sources said that it has been decided to purify Malwathuoya water to meet the drinking water needs of the city population.
The WSDB Anuradhapura Manager said the water level of the Nuwarawewa tank which is the main source to provide drinking water to the Anuradhapura city and the suburbs is remaining at 8 feet whereas the normal depth of the water level is 23 feet.
If the present level has come down by about 1 foot, there would be difficulties in the purification process as the sediment and the other waste deposits in the tank mix with the water. He said in the past, when difficult situations arose, arrangements had been made to get water from Malwathu Oya via the Anuradhapura city, the Manager said.
Arrangements are being made to get water from the Malwathuoya anicut close to the town up to the Nuwarawewa tank water purification plant through a pipe line to the length of about 3 kms. The project will cost around Rs. 10 million
Civil organisations and senior citizens in Anuradhapura said water stored in the Malwathuoya anicut is unclean. It is not advisable to use such water even after purification. They said as the upcountry is receiving rains, the authorities will take action to get Mahaweli water via Kalawewa to Nachchaduwa tank.
A spokesman for the WSDB said officials had submitted facts at the Mahaweli water control committee meeting to get at least 8,000 acre feet of Mahaweli water to Anuradhapura to increase the water levels of Nuwarawewa, Thuruvila and Tissawewa tanks which are the major water sources providing pipe borne drinking water to 300,000 people in the Anuradhapura city and the adjoining areas.

Apple's iOS 11 kills old 32-bit iPhone and iPad apps
The move will generally affect apps that have not been updated in the past two years. Although many will have been abandoned by their developers, owners will still use some of them frequently.
It is a consequence of iOS 11 being restricted to running apps written in what is known as 64-bit code.
The number signifies how much data a processor can handle at once - the larger the figure, the faster a computer can potentially operate.
Dropping support for 32-bit software lets Apple streamline its operating system and helps it run more quickly since it no longer needs to load software libraries to make sense of the older programs.
Apple has explained in the past that it is relatively easy for app-makers to reversion their products, and its App Store has rejected updates that lack 64-bit support since June 2015.
Even so, the move bucks a general trend for operating systems to support legacy software for longer periods of time.
"Two years is a very short period for something to become obsolete, even in the technology world where things move very fast," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey's computing department. "What most vendors have done so far - and Microsoft is the biggest example of this - is to keep as many things as compatible as possible for as long as possible. (BBC)

Attempted murder of Sumanthiran: Suspects granted bail
The five former militants who were arrested and remanded on the charge for attempted murder of TNA Parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran were released on bail by High Court Judge Ilancheliyan.
Karalasingam Kulendran, Gnnasekaralingam Rajmathan, Murugaiah Thaventhran, Velayuthapillai Wijeyakumar and Louis Marianayagam of the Kilinochchi District were arrested by the TID last January for allegedly plotting the murder of TNA MP Sumanthiran.
A bail application was filed by Attorney At Law Thilainathan Archchuna on behalf of the suspects in the High Court. While submitting the bail application the Attorney At Law Thilainathan said the suspects were integrated into society after rehabilitation.
They had been detained for 9 months and were made suspects just because they were former militants, he submitted. Their families and their livelihoods were badly affected badly,the Counsel submitted.
However the State Counsel submitted that information had been received that the suspects are planning to escape to India by sea, and that he objects to the granting of bail. He also said that no evidence had been recovered from the suspects.
After hearing the submission,the Judge Ilancheliyan granted conditional bail stating that just because the suspects were former militants, they cannot be detained for ever.

Bangladesh Army takes bigger role in Rohingya aid operation
BANGLADESH: Bangladeshs Army was on Wednesday ordered to take a bigger role in helping hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled ethnic violence in Myanmar, by distributing relief aid and building shelters.
Troops would be deployed immediately in Coxs Bazar near the border where more than 420,000 Rohingya have arrived since August 25, said road transport minister Obaidul Quader, who is also deputy head of the ruling Awami League party.
Soldiers would mainly distribute relief and carry out rehabilitation, as well as ensuring order, Quader told AFP.
The army presence is especially needed on the spot to construct their shelters, which is a very tough task, and ensure sanitation, he said.
The latest order came from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Quader said.
Previously troops had been tasked with transporting foreign relief supplies from Chittagong airport to Coxs Bazar.
The minister said heavy rain for the past 24 hours was intensifying the misery of the Rohingya, tens of thousands of whom have set up shelters on hills around Coxs Bazar despite the risk of landslides.
Authorities have so far set up 12 relief centres and eight emergency kitchens for the Rohingya refugees. - AFP

Bell tolling for JO
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, on Tuesday, in parliament, hinted at the fate that awaits the Joint Opposition parliamentarians, come January, were they to support any other party, other than the SLFP at the Local Government elections, slated for January. Making a special statement in the House, on the subject of the LG poll, the Premier said there will not be a single JO member in parliament after January next year, in the event they supported a political party other than the UPFA, read SLFP. "How could the Joint Opposition members support some other party at an election Thereafter, their party membership would be cancelled, the Premier said, adding that he would request the JO members to support the UPFA and we can function after January peacefully.
The Premier may have made this comment in jest, as is his wont, often, in parliament, but it also portends events to unfold. SLFP General Secretary, Minister Duminda Dissanayake has already read the riot act on erring JO MPs and has up the ante in recent times. In all probability we are soon going to witness another Lalith-Gamini episode, where the UNP stalwarts were expelled from parliament for spearheading a rebellion against President Premadasa. Along with them, out went G.M. Premachandra, Samaraweera Weerawanni, Premaratne Gunasekera and Laskhman Seneviratne. The Supreme Court held that they violated party discipline and acted against the party constitution.
Of course, there is the instance when the SC gave a contrary ruling in the Sarath Amunugama and Co expulsion, after they switched sides on the eve of the 1999 Presidential Election. But that was a ruling that was tainted to the core, as with a majority of the cases presided over by a Sarath Silva led Bench. That ruling, in effect, held that the rebels were entitled to sit with the government and vote with the government, while still being members of the UNP, short of losing their parliamentary seats. That is because, the court held, they (rebels) were not given a hearing by the party and that their expulsion was arbitrary. This, of course was the time when CBK was President, and, almost all the Supreme Court rulings were in the government's favour, in a scandalous state of affairs that called into question the integrity of the country's highest court.
Presently though, those risking their parliamentary seats are not from the ruling party and the changed circumstances, no doubt, will place the Joint Opposition MPs on a sticky wicket. The heat is already being turned with President Sirisena, as the leader of the SLFP, replacing a host of electoral organisers, with is loyalists. The dice, no doubt, is stacked against the JO. This is because they will be giving all the ammunition to the SLFP to mount a successful case against them to secure their expulsion from parliament.
To begin with, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, no doubt, will lead the JO campaign at the LG poll, will necessarily have to attack the SLFP and the party's leadership, for it (JO) to have any chance doing well at the poll, in addition to the fusillades directed at the UNP. By doing so, Rajapaksa and co, who were elected on the SLFP ticket, at the last general election, will only be playing into the hands of the blues. The SLFP Central Committee would not even need to summon the rebels for a disciplinary inquiry.
The last occasion when parliament witnessed a mass exodus of government MPs to the Opposition was in 1964, when C.P. de Silva crossed the divide, taking with him some 40 government MPs to the Opposition. There is a very real possibility of the country witnessing another mass exodus of MPs, only this time it will be some 50 odd members of the Opposition, not crossing the floor to join the government, but exiting parliament, altogether, if the hint dropped by the Prime Minister is anything to go by.
Lest we forget
Fire crackers were lit by in several towns by former members of the now defunct local councils, allied to Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO, following the announcement by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of the Supreme Court determination that required a referendum to accompany a two thirds majority in parliament to pass the 20th Amendment into law. The 20A, had as its objective, the holding of Provincial Council elections on a single day and for the deferment in the holding of the NCP, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Council Elections, until such time the new arrangement is put in place. Those rejoicing at this news acted as if the elections, themselves, were already won (by the JO). Such were the high octane celebrations.
In the melee, though, a salient factor had been overlooked, namely the Court's independence to act freely and without bias, ruling against a government sponsored Bill. In this context, it is not out of place to recall the fate that befell the country's first lady Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, who was thrown out on her ear, for daring into countermand a piece of legislation, sponsored by a Government minister cum Rajapaksa sibling.

A brush with colours
Her ability to unleash her creative streak by putting her brush to paper has won her recognition and international accolades. Budding young artist, Ishani Vidurangana has made a significant impact in the art field through her innate talent.
Though she can paint with many types of media, Ishani says that she uses fabric paint for her paintings. She stresses that this is purely because fabric painting gives her art a good finish which is especially important when sending one of her works abroad to be judged at a competition.
For example if you choose to do your art using pastels the colours usually rub off on any surface that the painting touches. This also gives it a messy kind of look which will not go down well with the judges, she explained.
A student of Lindsay Balika Vidyalaya, Bambalapitiya, Ishani has shown a flair for art from a young age. It was her parents, especially her mother, who had noticed the talent of the young girl and had encouraged her to pursue her passion. She introduced Ishani to art guru S Bogahawattes Sampath Rekha International Art Academy when she was in grade five.
My mother, W G Wasantha Chandrakanthi, has done art as a subject in her school days. She noticed that I was able to look at a drawing and copy it in the exact manner. My elder sister used to show such drawings to my mother and she was amazed with my talent. She even placed one of my drawings on top of the original once to see if I had traced the drawing. Then she realized that it was not done in that manner but that I had drawn it simply by looking at it, Ishani said.
Bogahawatte observed that the young lass excelled in painting nature and design related topics. He had guided her towards that route. He advised that she should try her hand at painting whatever comes into her mind rather than copying other drawings. The academy even encouraged her to aim high and take part in international art competitions.
Ishani says that she has topped most of the art competitions held by her school. However the first art competition she has taken part in was an international art contest held by Japan. Since there was no topic given for the event Ishani had drawn a picture of a child bathing in the rain near a water pipe.
They were thrilled with the drawing and gave it a title as well. I won a Platinum Award for that drawing, she recalled.
Her most significant achievement is probably winning the Golden Brush award at the Childrens Art Studio St Cyril and Methodius art competition held by Macedonia in 2014. She has also clinched accolades at The Seventh International Childrens Painting Exhibition held by the Keisho Art Association in 2013, drawing under the topic Looking Out at the Future. Ishani has taken part several times in the Look and Learn art competition held online by England. The monthly event is open to all young artists across the world. It gives a topic for the artists to paint on at each competition. Ishani won second place several times and got a credit award at the event.
The 17 year old has taken part in several national art competitions too. She has won a merit award at the State Childrens Art Competition (primary section) in 2012. She has clinched a Bronze Award at the Dream Car Art Competition organized by Toyota Lanka Pvt Ltd in 2013. She has won a certificate of recognition at the UN Volunteers art competition drawing under the topic Volunteering for Water in 2012.
An artist needs a lot of patience to get each stroke right. He or she needs to be creative as well because many of the international art competitions provide topics for artists to draw on. Therefore, the artist needs to put his or her thinking cap on and come up with a unique drawing which will catch the eyes of the judges not only for the beauty of the drawing but for its innovative outlook too, Ishani said adding that if a drawing is almost a duplicate of anothers drawing, then that will act as a minus point.
I love drawing lotus flowers. Drawings related to religion and scenic backgrounds too are some of my favourite topics. Since I love capturing nature in my drawings, I spend time studying nature whenever I get the opportunity. For example I might perceive birds and then if I come across a particularly striking pose, I capture that in one of my drawings later, she noted adding that this is her formula of success.
Queried on what she would draw if she is given a topic on the spot Ishani notes that she will draw a pond full of lotus flowers.
Each and every flower and leaf will have its own unique structure. You need not come up with complicated topics if you are asked to present a drawing for a competition. Mother Nature has given each and every aspect its own novel touch. Therefore, there is simplicity, exclusiveness and beauty in everything. You just need to capture this with your brush and bring it onto canvas, she opined adding that a drawing related to lotus flowers is usually a hit at international art competitions because the judges consider lotus flowers as a species with a special connection to Sri Lanka.
Ishani comes from a family of five. Her father, Eranda Tilak Dissanayake, is working in the army. Her mother, W G Wasantha Chandrakanthi, is a house wife. Ishanis sister, Ruksani Viduranga, has just completed her studies. Her brother, Dhanushka Madhuranga, is employed.
Besides painting Ishani is also a talented actress. She has acted in several school plays and also portrayed roles in several films like Sinhaya, Vijaya Kuveni and Punchi Apith Dan Baya Naa.
Parents need to identify their childrens talents at a young age and encourage them to brush up their skills. This will be a bonus point for them and benefit them in their studies. I wish to become a professional artist some day. My aim is t get into the graphic sector and make a living using my talents and passion, Ishani concluded with a smile.

The Burgher account
Burgher people, also known simply as Burghers, are a Eurasian ethnic group in Sri Lanka descended from Portuguese, Dutch, British and other Europeans who settled in the island. However, Portuguese and Dutch had held the maritime provinces of the island for centuries before the advent of the British Empire. With the establishment of Ceylon as a crown colony those who retained close ties with the Netherlands departed. However, a significant community of Burghers remained and largely adopted the English language. During the nineteenth century they occupied a highly important place in Sri Lankan social and economic life.
Portuguese settlers on Ceylon were essentially traders, but wished to form colonies, and Lisbon did nothing to discourage European settlementeven to the extent of advocating intermarriage with the Sinhalese. It was not the policy of the Dutch East India Company to endorse similar unions, although a number of unofficial liaisons between its employees and local females occurred in the late eighteenth century. Most Burgher people have preserved Western customs; especially among those of Portuguese ancestry their European religion, language, and surnames are retained with pride. Burghers were defined as those whose father was born in Sri Lanka, with at least one European ancestor on ones direct paternal side, regardless of the ethnic origin of ones mother, or what other ethnic groups may be found on the fathers side. Because of this definition, Burghers almost always have European surnames (mostly of Portuguese, Dutch and British origin, but sometimes German, French or Russian) The term Burgher comes from the Dutch word burger, meaning citizen or town dweller, and is cognate with the French and English word bourgeois. At this time in Europe, there had emerged a middle class, consisting of people who were neither aristocrats nor serfs. These were the traders and businessmen, who lived in towns and were considered free citizens.
Until the early 20th century, many Burghers spoke English and a form of Portuguese Creole, even those of Dutch descent. Portuguese Creole had been the language of trade and communication with indigenous peoples. It is now only spoken in parts of the coastal towns of Trincomalee and Batticaloa. While much vocabulary is from Portuguese, its grammar is based on that of Tamil and Sinhalese.
Burgher culture is a rich mixture of East and West, reflecting their ancestry. They are the most Westernised of the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. Most of them wear Western clothing, although it is not uncommon for a man to be seen wearing a sarong, or for a woman to wear a sari. - srilanka-cocohut.com

Doublespeak dip and roll
Reply to Dr Senarath Tennakoon :
I refer to the article by Dr Senarath Tennakoon titled Heathcare Doublespeak in the Opinion page of September 19. In particular I refer to the paragraph which states thus A democratic government is determined to uphold safeguard and develop free public education at all levels including university education to ensure that national education would not be left to the mercy of market forces and the privileged class.
I am afraid he betrays a gross ignorance of the free market. It is the outcome of the free decisions of the individuals. Of course, the decisions to be effective in the market must be backed by the financial power for it is only through spending decisions that the resources provided by the suppliers are allocated. The usual criticism of the free market is that those who are wealthy exercise more market power.
True but there is another factor in the issue. The rich do not exercise such market power on the same essential goods but go for less essential or luxury goods. They do not spend money on a particular good but spread their spending on a multitude of goods and so they exercise a limit to their spending on the essential goods since spending on such goods is based on the need and once the needs are satisfied they do not accumulate more of such goods for consumption. Once they buy the required quantity of essential goods they do not accumulate such goods but go for less essential or luxury goods.
University education
The free market economy is the only resource allocation system that is impersonal and does not require a government controlling body to allocate resources. The communists thought economic planning and allocation of resources through central planning could be more rational and desirable to fulfil the needs of the less well off.
But they found that there is no substitute for a market price system and Lenin restored the free market using the war as an excuse for the failure of central planning through directives of the government.
It is true that there is inequality so that the outcome of the market may be distorted by the power of the better off who have more market power. But there is a limit to their spending on essential goods.
In any case there is no better alternative to the free market as a mechanism for the allocation of scarce goods and scarce resources.
As for free education it is free only in the sense that the receiver of the education is not called upon to pay for it. It does not mean there is no cost and the cost is borne by the society at large and in the case of university education the large mass of people are not gifted enough to take advantage of it.
Higher paying jobs
It is a small minority of persons who are sufficiently gifted with the brains to benefit from higher education. Once they finish such higher education they get jobs which pay far higher remuneration than those without such university education. It is true however that only a very small percentage of the students who are capable and fit for university education are admitted because of the limitation in the number of places in the universities.
But this is part of the problem of scarcity of resources in an economy to fulfil all the aspirations of people which among other things manifest as the demand for university placements.
Free education does not mean there is no cost to education. It only means such cost is borne by the people at large and not be beneficiaries.
Since all the people are not capable of receiving such education because of their limitations of intellect, the numbers entering the universities and passing out are limited.
But if and when even such numbers exceed the available vacancies for the higher paying jobs then there will be some unemployment even among the. Supply and Demand are the catchwords which explain the situation.

Drastic drop in Dengue patients
Patients receiving treatment for Dengue have gone down considerably. However Health officials warn of a spike with the rains.
A total of 937 dengue patients are receiving in-house medical treatment at hospitals at the moment and the number of dengue patients have been gone down by around 90 percent, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters to 700 new dengue control field assistants and 250 junior health work assistants, Minister Senaratne said 500 field assistants were recruited in the past and Cabinet approval was been received to recruit another 1000. Dengue can reach epidemic levels again with on going rain,he said.
Minister Senaratne said the Opposition Leader is supporting all the good work of the Government and is now providing the leadership of the dengue control activities in the North. The prices of 298 brands of medicine have gone down due to the price reduction of 48 commonly used drugs. There are protests against setting up private medical collages but there are private medical collages in countries like China, Vietnam and Cambodia. One doctors trade union blames me because they had been paid for that, but other trade unions work with me to solve professional issues, he said.

Executive Presidency should be abolished: JVP

The Executive Presidency should be abolished by the new Constitution in order to guarantee the existence of a vibrant democracy in the country, said Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake today.
He made this observation after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the Interim Report of the Steering Committee before the Constitutional Assembly, which was held in the Main Chamber of the House of Parliament.
Commencing his speech MP Dissanayake stated that the JVP had a different view over the Constitution.
He said that their party decided to support the process of formulating a new Constitution as they are maintaining that the constitution should be changed.
He added that the electoral system should be changed as well.
"It should be done by the way of a new Constitution and not by any other means," MP Dissanayake said.
"The other matter is that the Executive Presidency should also be changed."
He stated that the 1978 constitution was designed to polarize power around Executive Presidency.
"However 19 amendments have been made to the Constitution since then," MP Dissanayake said.
"The existing government has made Amendments on 17 occasions in order to secure their power."
He said further that the sovereignty of the people, national defence and the peoples rights should be secured by the Constitution.

First Emmy for Kidman
Oscar winner Nicole Kidman won her first ever Emmy Award as Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series, for her role in Big Little Lies. She called domestic abuse a complicated, insidious disease. Kidman played Celeste, a wife and mother who becomes the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband Perry, essayed by Alexander Skarsgard, who also won an Emmy on September 17.
Looking resplendent and radiant in a red gown, Kidman thanked her husband Keith Urban and her daughters for supporting her career, and said she hoped the Emmy win can be a lesson for others in a way. Sometimes, when youre acting you get a chance to bring a bigger message. We shone a light on domestic abuse, she said.
It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy. And by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more, she said in gratitude to the Television Academy. Big Little Lies was nominated for a total of 16 Emmys this year, and won eight, including Outstanding Limited Series.
Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, who served as executive producers on the series, were pitted against each other in the Outstanding Actress in a Limited Series. Reese, I share this with you, Kidman said, adding, Without you, I would not be standing up here.
Later, when the team took the stage to accept the Outstanding Limited Series honour, Witherspoon said that it has been an incredible year for women, to bring women to the front of the stories. Laura Dern, who won the Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series for her role in Big Little Lies, also gave a speech empowering women. Ive been acting since I was 11-years-old and I think Ive worked with maybe 12 women, Dern said. The actress also thanked Kidman, Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley, by saying, I share this with my tribe of four ladies. I feel very proud to be a part of reflecting fierce women and mothers.

Large scale clearing of jungle in the elephant habitat in Hambantota has led a herd of wild elephants to invade surrounding villages and terrorise villagers.
A herd of three wild elephants have been roaming in the Ridiyagama, Ambalantota, Godewaya, Beligalgoda, Welipatanwila, Puhujulgoda, Usangoda, Lunama and Kalametiya villages at various intervals making villagers panicky.
Wildlife Range Officer J. A. P.

Game of Thrones' Ellie Kendrick wants to open up 'closed shop' film industry

After starring in Game of Thrones and a string of indie films, Ellie Kendrick is one of British acting's rising stars. She's also doing her bit to give underrepresented young talent a leg up.
It's not what you know, it's who you know - and that's particularly true in the film and TV industries, according to Kendrick.
When it comes to going to drama school or funding your first short film, it's also about how much money you've got.
"I've worked in the film industry on and off for about half my life and I've noticed that the worlds that are represented on our screens by no means mirror the worlds that we see around us in our everyday lives," the 27-year-old says.
"Part of that is because it's such a difficult industry to break into and often it requires huge financial support from parents or jobs. Or it requires contacts you've made in film school - which again costs a lot of money.
"So it's a bit of a closed shop.
Kendrick is known for fighting White Walkers and protecting Bran Stark as Meera Reed in Game of Thrones. She is speaking in her capacity as ambassador forCreative England's Shortflix scheme, which is looking for budding young film-makers who aren't in education, employment or training.
Five successful applicants will get funding to make a short film, as well as gaining priceless contacts and kudos.
The scheme has been set up to give opportunities to those from under-represented groups who have the talent and the ambition but not the foot in the door.
"It's a gateway to people who might not have the financial means or the industry contacts to break in to that industry," Kendrick says.
Shortflix launched in May and the first five finalists made short films about subjects including black gay dancehall culture in London, homophobia in an Afro-Caribbean hair salon in Sheffield and a suicidal young man in Bath.
It will open for applications again this autumn. Kendrick thinks opening up chances like this is "really going to improve our industry" in the long run.
"It's just going to make better drama and better films because we're going to have more stories and a broader range of voices, and that's always going to make much more interesting work," she says.
And British film could do with a bit of a shake-up, Kendrick believes.
"Sometimes people are put off by seeing only white middle-class period dramas," she says. "Not that there's not a place for those.
"But when those are the only things that are exported to a global market, we start to think that's the only thing British film can do. And there's so much more to it than that."
As well as Game of Thrones, Kendrick has had roles in films like An Education with Carey Mulligan, last year's Whisky Galore! remake, and The Levelling, the bleak farming drama that came out earlier this year.
On TV, she has been in Being Human and Upstairs, Downstairs - all after her first starring role, in the title role in the BBC's dramatisation of The Diary of Anne Frank in 2009.
"So much of this industry is about knowing where opportunities are," she says. "I was only able to become an actor because I happened to know someone who told me about an open audition that a kids' agency was having.
"If I hadn't had that one person tipping me off, then I wouldn't have been able to get into this industry.
"Loads of it is about contacts, and it's awful that that's the case."
As well as supporting Shortflix, Kendrick has been mentoring a younger actress as part of a scheme run by charity Arts Emergency.
She set up meetings for her mentee with drama schools, took her behind the scenes at the National Theatre and arranged for audition coaching with an actor friend.
She wanted to make her protege feel like she had "an entitlement to the industry - that sense of entitlement that so many people who might have had a lot of privilege in their lives take for granted", she says.
Kendrick herself knows Game of Thrones is her biggest calling card, and made her "eligible", as she puts it, for leading roles like the one in The Levelling.
After Game of Thrones' penultimate seventh season, she speaks proudly about how the dogged Meera has survived - with her dignity and integrity intact.
"I really like that she's a character who defies convention in terms of traditional representations of femininity," she says.
"We're quite fixated at the moment with what we call strong female characters, but what I'd like to push for are complex female characters rather than ones who are just strong, and that's their sole defining characteristic.
"Not only is she strong - she's also kind of vulnerable but she hides that vulnerability with the strength that she has to summon to survive.
"She's undergone an incredibly traumatic series of events but she still manages to maintain a calmness and a kindness and a tenderness, which I think is really laudable.
"But also, you know, I get to wield an axe occasionally and kill some zombies.
"So, all in all, she's a pretty well-rounded character."

Govt officers shouldnt fear to perform duties: State Minister Range Bandara
Government officers should not fear to perform their duties, according to rules and regulations, Irrigation and Water Management State Minister Palitha Ranga Bandara said.
He said so while opening development work in the Vanathavillu Pookulam Village recently. The State Minister said former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weerathunga was imprisoned and the incident was turned in to a political matter, he said.
Many efforts are being taken to horrify government officers. This is due to the imprisonment of Lalith Weerathunga has put the Opposition party in surprise, State Minister Bandara said.
The imprisonment of Lalith Weerathunga is not a big issue. If the then President had ordered something, Lalith should have formed a structure to perform his duty. Though he was considered as a good government officer, he didnt perform his duties correctly.
He only knows whether he expected political advantage through Sil clothes distribution, the State Minister said.
If he wanted to distribute Sil clothe, is it correct to get Rs. 600 million from the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission This proves that he has engaged in the act of bribery, he said.
The officers shouldnt fear to perform their duties. More than 99 percent officers are genuine in their works. Only a few officers are engaged in bribery and corruption. The country and the government have maintained self respect. The governments first consideration is to build up that respect. That is what our country needs, he said.
If we dont have a good picture, there will be no progress for us towards a better future. Theres no need to fear to serve the nation.
There will be no problem, if the duties of the politicians are performed within the policy framework of the country, the State Minister said.

Increase price to minimize dumping: Dutch expert tells Sri Lanka

A Dutch expert in Waste Collection and Treatment has suggested that the government increase the price of dumping and incineration of waste if people are to pay attention to recycling.
The Dutch expert, Ko Poppe, who addressed a workshop on Trends and innovations in recycling: opportunities for Sri Lankan Green entrepreneurs organized by Lanka Social Ventures this week said opportunities in the recycling business would open up if recycling waste was made more expensive.
Netherlands, which has a land area twice as small as Sri Lanka, has a population of almost 17 million and thus has had no choice but to recycle its waste. By 2013, it had managed to recycle 51 percent of its household waste with over 700 companies being involved in the process.
Forays into the recycling business has also been motivated by the Dutch government making it compulsory for all producers to pay for waste that cannot be recycled, said Poppe.
He stressed that if recyclers pursued efforts to segregate and create high quality recycled material, they could easily fetch a high price for their goods.
Sri Lanka recently issued a ban on the four types of plastics; lunch sheets, shopping bags, polystyrene boxes and polythene used for decorative purposes and according to the Central Environment Authority (CEA), Project Director Bandula Sarath, this was a measure to add value to recyclable items such as plastics.
In November, the government also decreed all household waste needed to be segregated prior to collection.
Though we have issued the ban, we have given companies a grace period until January 2018. Thereafter we will take legal action against those who use the banned plastics, said Sarath.
He added that the CEA was not attacking the plastics industry and that it had only targeted these four plastics, which at present had no value attached to recycling.
Since the ban, supermarkets have started to issue low density polyethylene (LDP) bags instead of the high density polyethylene (HDP) bags, and Sarath sees this as satisfactory though not ideal, LDP is more expensive so the incentive for recycling is there compared to HDP, so it is a step forward, he said.
Whilst the polythene ban has helped to stir some interest in the recycling industry, incentives to invest in recycling businesses are slow to come.
The CEA has stated that the government spent Rs. 15 million on washing plants in Colombo and Gampaha for recyclers and has formed a network of over 140 recyclers around the country but recyclers complain that there was no proper distribution network for their goods and an established collection mechanism.
Paper recyclers at the event complained that most of the paper was imported to India rather than recycled locally. Furthermore there no finance for companies in the recycling field.
Poppe estimated that at least 1 million Euros would be needed to establish a recycling plant and he added that the money would come if demand for such services is dire.
At present however, it is still cheaper to send waste to landfills than recycle it.

Kiriella denies corruption allegations
CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY TENDERS ABOVE BOARD:
There has been no irregularity in the tender awards for the construction of the third phase of the Central Expressway, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Kiriella denied all corruption allegations made against the Highways Ministry over the tender award for the construction of the third phase of the Central Highway by involving two Japanese companies.
The Minister said the Ministry has maintained high transparency and has awarded the project at a rate considerably lower than the initial bid and saved money.
If we really want to get advantages by offering these contracts, we can do it without any issue like the previous government did.
Everybody knows that the previous regime awarded construction projects without calling for tenders. But we do not have such intentions, Minister Kiriella said.

Kumar Sangakkara scores eighth century in nine County Championship matches

In his final match at the Kia Oval, Kumar Sangakkara drew on that innate sense of timing that the great batsmen possess to make his eighth hundred in nine County Championship matches this season.
In doing so, he not only became the first player to make that many centuries in a campaign since Marcus Trescothick also hit eight for Somerset in 2009, but more importantly he piloted Surrey, who started this round of matches in third, towards a potentially match-winning lead that should guarantee their Division One status.
Somerset was very much in the game when Ben Foakes was fourth out at 169, caught behind off the impressive Peter Trego.
Sangakkara, however, never looked in any difficulty on a pitch that had flattened out from the first day, and eased to a 93-ball fifty. Constantly encouraging Ollie Pope, he received good support from the 19-year-old, who contributed 50 out of a vital fifth-wicket stand of 109 in 29 overs.
Pope fell in the sixth over of the second new ball. Sangakkara played and missed at it a couple of times against Craig Overton, but these were rare blemishes before he reached his 64th career hundred from 164 balls with his 14th four, a cut off Overton. He also hit a straight six off Dom Bess during his innings of 119 not out, which leaves him on 1, 369 championship runs from only 13 innings.

Let your inner goddess shine
From taking care of ones skin to achieve a radiant glowing complexion to eliminating stress and maintaining a healthy diet, there are many natural beauty tips and tricks which allow your inner goddess to shine through. These methods are not only age-defying healthy mechanisms for the skin and body, but also increases confidence in feeling good about ones appearance. Enhancing your natural beauty should never be invasive or expensive. These natural beauty tips are just for you.
Use a daily gentle cleanser
Daily use of a non-irritating gentle facial cleaner can help promote a glowing complexion and prevent breakouts or blemishes. It is especially important that these cleansers are gentle enough to not strip away the skins natural moisture, while still having enough strength to thoroughly clean the pores.
Special care for eye area
The skin under and around your eyes is especially delicate and vulnerable, and it is important to pay special attention to these spots. Under stress and dehydration, this skin is prone to puffiness and discolouration that can take away the beauty of your eyes.
Treatyour back
Although the skin on your back is probably not the first thing you see when you look in the mirror, it is important to remember these hard to reach spots still require routine skincare. Therefore, all-natural procedures such as back facials or body polishes can help prevent unsightly blemishes, helping to promote the skins natural beauty.
Use sunscreen
This is a point that skin experts cannot stress enough. The suns rays can be extremely harsh and damaging, especially to the bodys delicate facial skin. Therefore, using a facial mineral protectant with an SPF level of at least 40 is essential to preserve the skin from sun spots and wrinkles.
Use bath bombs
Adding bath bombs in your baths allows you to soak in all the essential oils and natural vitamins. The best part about bath bombs is how easy you can make them yourselves. You can really customize the ingredients to fit your needs. Learning how to make bath bombs will only make your bath time that much more enjoyable!

Mahendrans cross examination on Friday
Attorney Generals panel seeks postponement :
The cross examination of former Governor Arjun Mahendran will resume from September 22, 2017 following a request made by the Attorney Generals panel assisting the Treasury Bond Commission for an adjournment, yesterday (20).
While the private counsel panels cross examined the former Governor Arjun Mahendran, the Attorney Generals panel requested time to properly prepare for the cross examination based on its importance and the volume of evidence to be led through Mahendran.
Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, forwarding a motion, stated that they need time to prepare for the cross examination so that they are seeking an adjournment until the said date.
ASG Livera pointed out that the AGs panel has volumes of evidence and material to focus on when cross examining Arjun Mahendran.
We do not want to let go of any important matter. His evidence is critical for the investigation. I am sure a proper examination should be done.We have received volumes of evidence and proceedings. Mahendrans evidence is purely on oral testimony. So, to perform our task, this adjournment is very important. he said.
Former Governor Arjun Mahendrans legal representative Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva expressed certain concerns over the motion of adjournment. He pointed out that they as representatives of Mahendran did not have a clue that they (AGs panel) are making such a motion. The Commission in fact yesterday told the cross examination will begin today but at that stage the AGs officers did not make such a motion, De Silva PC pointed out. He also said that he believes AGs panel, which consist of three Presidents Counsels are very much capable of cross examination. De Silva PC said.
Still they say they are not ready to cross examining! For some strange reason they are not ready to cross examine because he (Mahendran) is telling the truth! De Silva pointed out.
However, De Silva PC did not object to the motion. He informed the Commission that he is not available next week since he has a five Judge bench in the Supreme Court.
Accordingly, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue will sit on September 22, 2017 and then will resume on October 2, 2017.
In answer to De Silva PC, ASG Livera pointed out that the AGs panel assisting the Commission did not only focus on Arjun Mahendran. We had hundred and one witnesses. Mahendrans evidence is not the only evidence we are looking at. De Livera PC said. De Silva PC retorted that the tribunal with all its experience will know that People just dont get up and say we cant cross examine.
Chairman of the Commission, Supreme Court Judge, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said that the tribunal is ready to examine Mahendran if necessary.
Meanwhile, Romesh de Silva PC yesterday completed leading evidence through former Governor Arjun Mahendran. De Silva PC will re examine Mahendran following the cross examination.
While giving evidence before the Commission yesterday, Mahendran said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave directives to look into the best possible and profitable methods of raising funds for the government between Private Placement and Auction method. He then said that the Monetary Board was informed of the suggestions by February 23, 2015. He also said that there was a meeting on February 24, 2015 regarding the same.
Mahendran explaining his discussion at the Monetary Board regarding a productive auction method, said that he informed the MB that Private Placement method has been falling short on its objective. So I said from a practical point of view Private Placement method is not doing its job. he explained.
Romesh De Silva PC: So on March 6,2015, you conveyed to the Monetary Board that Treasury bonds should be sold through auction method
Arjun Mahendran: Yes.
RSPC: Was the transferring of any Central Bank officers done by you was in the view of helping Perpetual Treasuries Limited
AM: No.
RSPC: Did you transfer any Central Bank officer in view of helping you in any ways
AM: No.
RSPC: Did you transfer any Central Bank officer in view of helping Arjun Aloysius in any ways
AM: No.
RSPC: Have you gained in any ways from issuing Treasury Bonds
AM: Not at all.
Meanwhile, Harsha Fernando, the legal representative of retired Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri cross examined Arjun Mahendran yesterday. Retired DG Samarasiri was the ex-officio Tender Board Chairman when the February 27, 2015 auction took place.
In his cross examination, Fernando pointed out that DG Samarasiri was one of the two Tender Board members who were not aware of the two significant events which took place on the February 27, 2015 morning, prior to the Tender Board meeting held on the said date.
The events were the removal of 5% penal rate and the acceptance of 10.5 billion bids at the auction. The 5% penal rate removal came in as a decision from Market Operation Committee while the recommendation on 10.5 billion came from the Public Debt Department. Fernando observed that Mahendran suggested both these decisions to the MOC and PDD respectively.
Fernando said of the eight members of the Tender Board, three were in the MOC and another three in PDD which makes only Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake and Tender Board Chairman P. Samarasiri were unaware of these events until the commencement of the Tender Board meeting on 27 February 2015. Mahendran answered in affirmative to the questions.
Fernando then questioned Mahendran if it is correct to suggest that a Central Bank Governor, with his wide executive powers, makes a suggestion, and if the reasons given by him seem acceptable, the subordinate officers are to agree with the suggestion. Mahedran said it is not exactly the case, and went on to say that his were only suggestions which could have been questioned if necessary. Mahendran, on the February 27, 2015 Tender Board decision to accept 10.5 billion, said he was in fully agreement with.
Meanwhile, the Commission yesterday (19) issued an order seeking explanations from Mahendran on the data of two mobile phones in a particular time period, which cannot be located by the investigators. The order seeks explanation for questions including, the mobile phone connection numbers which was/were used by Mahendran during 01.01.2015 to 01.04.2015, in particular what phone was used between 23.02.2015 to 01.03.2015, what are the mobile phone devices and the corresponding IMEI numbers of such devices used by Mahendran during the aforesaid period and have Mahendran provided the aforesaid mobile phones to the Commission.
It also asks Mahendran if he has any explanation to provide for information being absent pertaining to the use of the mobile phones submitted by him to the Commission, pertaining to a considerable time period.

Methodist College Principal commends HASL awareness programmes on elders
Methodist College, Colombo, Principal Hiranya Fernando admired the series of educational seminars conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) to create the awareness for schoolchildren on elders and the importance of caring for them without sending them to elders' homes during the latter stages of their lives.
Principal Fernando made these remarks to over 1,000 students who were present at the Methodist College auditorium after their morning religious observances.
'Caring for elders and to create an environment for them to live with dignity' was the theme of the seminar.
Principal Fernando also urged young students not to isolate their parents and grandparents and to keep them within their family circle, considering the invaluable services rendered by them in the past.
HASL Youth Education Programme Director Geethal Mendis highlighted the value of caring for elders and reminded several stories related to elders and children. He said these awareness programmes could motivate the minds of children on the value of elders.
Although there are many elders' homes in the country, according to statistics, it is happy to say that 98 percent of elders are still living with their families and not in Homes, Mendis said
He also quoted few eminent personalities and said how they treated their parents without considering it as a burden during their twilight days.
Commenting on the programme, HASL Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said HelpAge always promotes the close rapport between children, parents and grandparents and do not promote the concept of building elders' homes.
He said it is the paramount duty of children to look after elders with love, protection and care .

Mexico earthquake: Race to find survivors under collapsed school

Rescuers are racing against the clock to reach survivors trapped under the rubble of a school in Mexico City which collapsed during Tuesday's earthquake.
One of them, a 13-year-old girl, is believed to be sheltering under a table, officials told the BBC.
At least 21 children and five adults died when the primary school collapsed and many others are missing.
The school was one of dozens of buildings toppled by the quake. So far 230 people are known to have died.
President Enrique Pea Nieto has declared three days of mourning for the victims.
As rescue operations continued for a second night, attention was focused on the Enrique Rbsamen primary school, in Mexico City's southern Coapa district.
With anxious parents gathered outside awaiting news of missing children, civil protection volunteer Enrique Gardia announced that a thermal scanner had detected survivors trapped between slabs of concrete.
"They are alive! Alive!" he shouted.
"Someone hit a wall several times in one place, and in another there was a response to light signals with a lamp," he added.
One mother, standing nearby waiting for news of her seven-year-old daughter, told reporters: "No-one can possibly imagine the pain I'm in right now."
Enrique Rbsamen school was brimming with hundreds of first responders, soldiers, doctors and even teachers racing against the clock to rescue people believed to still be alive beneath the collapsed classrooms.
From the roof of a school building opposite the classrooms, Mexico's secretary of public education and a senior military officer were commanding the rescue operation, shouting orders over a tannoy.
At one point, a rescuer emerged from the rubble with a frantic query - there was a girl trapped, but alive, on what was a lower floor. Should rescuers focus efforts on her or continue searching other parts of the collapsed structure
As anxious families looked on, the military officer shouted that rescuers should only focus on the trapped girl, and other areas within the structure would have to wait. Scores of workers sprang into action, labouring for hours to try to free the girl.
As night fell over Mexico City a steady rain began to fall. Search operations were slowed as workers spread tarpaulins over the rescue site. With the possibility that lives can still be saved, rescuers were battling to save any souls left beneath the rubble.
Waiting crowds were frequently hushed as workers listened for sounds of life under the rubble.
More than 500 members of the army and navy together with 200 police officers and volunteers have been working at the site.
Mexico City authorities kept hopes alive on Wednesday, saying 52 people had been rescued so far from collapsed buildings.
Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said 39 buildings in the capital had crumbled and search teams were scouring nearly all of them for survivors.
President Pea Nieto, visiting the damaged city of Jojutla in Morelos state, appealed for citizens to help rescue operations.
"It is important for people to be part of this group effort," he said.
Most of the victims of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake died in the capital, according to government figures:
Mexico City: 100 dead
Morelos state: 69 dead
Puebla state: 43 dead
Mexico state: 13 dead
Guerrero: Four dead
Oaxaca: One dead
Meanwhile, police have stepped up patrols in areas hit by the quake to prevent vandalism and looting.
Schools in the affected states have suspended classes until Monday and all professional football fixtures have been cancelled for the weekend.
Offers of help have come from around the world.
El Salvador and Chile pledged aid while Israel said it would sending a team of rescue specialists.
The White House said President Donald Trump had called Mr Pea Nieto and offered search and rescue teams.
Mexico is no stranger to earthquakes and earlier this month an 8.1 magnitude tremor in the south left at least 90 people dead.
Tuesday's tremor struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill on the 32nd anniversary of a major quake that killed thousands in the capital.

Miles before the next accident
Some tips for the new generation of female drivers:
Let any of us stand near the main junction in a major city of our country today, and observe the vehicles - especially cars, jeeps and wagons - moving around. We may observe that at least two out five vehicles passing by are being driven by females of different ages. So do the experts say.
Corresponding to the increase in the volume of vehicles on the road, the number of female drivers has also increased. Even though in the insurance industry, women drivers are supposed to be safer, and less likely to be involved in a road accident. With apologies to them, it has to be stated, however, that the general impression among the male drivers and the road-users by walk is that they themselves are not safe enough with most female drivers at their wheels. One of the main reasons attributed is that most female drivers do not follow even the basic road rules.
Another is that they tend to assume, rather than making judgments and decisions while driving. No doubt, all motorists need to be alert and cautious on the roads, but often female drivers need to be more attentive due to such dilemmas.
Need to be vigilant
A study by the California Department of Motor Vehicles revealed sometime back, that the safest American driver is the married woman over 25 years. Some of the primary reasons given were that her driving is short-haul, low-speed, even if she meets with an accident, it is of a side-scrape or fender-bender kind not serious enough even to report. The report also stated that women tend to think of the automobile they use as just another household appliance. It is a deadly device the report states, if not properly handled, can kill anyone on the road and disable many more. While all drivers need to be vigilant, they cannot relax on the wheel, but drive all the time in anticipation of an impending risk, and this is a golden rule especially for female drivers.
Good drivers are both common and uncommon. It is possible one might encounter rash teenagers to truck drivers to overly-cautious senior citizens: yet all contribute to how we can learn to be better drivers.
More often, it is not that a driver is not aware of the road rules or best practices in driving, but the unfortunate thing is that he or she ignores or deliberately violates them.
They forget that something as quick and simple as putting on the seat belt or getting the windshield cleaned can mean the difference between life and death. Being aware of the specialties of a female driver among other drivers, and practicing good road etiquette is equally important. Below are some tips to keep a female driver mindful and safe. Although they are in good stead for any driver, they are sure to help the new generation of female drivers around.
Hands-free kit
Put your cell-phone into your handbag so that it is out of sight and you are not getting distracted by messages. If you have to use your mobile to make or accept a call, rather install a hands-free kit. Never text and drive, as this could slow down your brake-reaction speed by 18% meaning that by the time you have realised you need to break  it is likely too late. Also, try to keep the volume of your radio sound system at a reasonable level, so that you are aware of your surroundings.
l Dont drive as if you own the road. Drive like you own the car. Dont make assumptions about what other drivers are going to do. The only thing you can assume about another driver, with a turn signal on, is that they are going to turn. They might not be turning at all, and just forgot to turn it off. But you have to be careful and make your judgment for your own safety.
l Watch out for aggressive drivers, and try to stay out of their way. They are the cause of a lot of accidents. Never pull out in front of anyone or swerve into someone elses lane. If you wish to change lane, always indicate it with signals of the car, much ahead of you change lane.
l When approaching any colour light signal, be it red, green or amber, do not rush but anticipate that the colour might change any moment, even though the counters linked to the signal lights give you the time indication. Now on most main roads, almost all colour lights are linked to the yellow/white strip pedestrian crossing; so be sharp there. When the light turns green, make sure intersection clears before you go.
 Obey the speed limits. Going too fast gives you less time to stop or react. Excess speed is one of the main causes of accidents. Even if the road is clear of traffic and you are permitted to drive at high speed, drive only at the speed you can control your vehicle. If not, you and your car will be the first victims.
l When stopped in traffic, leave enough space to pull out from behind the car you are following. Habitually, the driver in the vehicle behind you will come so close, even to a kissing distance, to your car, because he/she does not care to leave enough space between the two vehicles, which means they are inviting trouble.
l Make sure your car always has gas in it  dont ride around with the gauge on empty. Do you know why certain cars have the petrol/diesel meter on the left side of the steering wheel and certain others have it on the right side A car with a meter on the left has the petrol intake on the left side of the car, while the one with meter on the right has the intake on the right side of the car.
l Experts now recommend that you hold the steering wheel at either 3 and 9 oclock on the wheel, or even lower at 4 and 8 oclock. If you are in an accident and the airbags go off, youll be safer with your hands not flying into your face from the impact of the airbags.
l If you are taking a child to school or collecting a child from school, try to get to school five to ten minutes early, and leave five minutes late to avoid the mad dash into and out of the parking lot. Always watch for kids getting on and off school vans and buses. Give priority to those vehicles. Children are in a hurry to get to their classes or to go home, when the school is over, for which they are either getting on or off their transport or maybe even crossing the road. Their safety depends on how much you follow this best practice.

Monsoon moods
The rainy season is here. Its time to get your raincoats, gumboots and waterproof make up out again. But dont let the rains dampen your style. Natural and minimalist make up is the mantra if you want to look stunning even in the downpour. For those of us who feel undressed without make up, here is a lowdown on tips to beat the grey skies.
Changes in your daily skin care
Skin care routines dont normally change too much during monsoon seasons. It is mostly fluctuations in temperature that generally need either a heavier or lighter routine change.
Make up for the rainy season
If you know that you are going to get caught in the rain, you should wear less makeup. Light weight foundations and moisturizers need to be used. Eye makeup or anything that can smudge is a big no no. Go for eye make up only if you have got water proof liners and mascaras. During these times you can play up your lip and cheek make up so that the attention is drawn to those features.
Hair care rules forthe rainy season
Blowdrys and fancy dos dont make sense during the rainy weather. Instead, try a chic chignon with a middle part or a braided hairstyle. Go for something that keeps your hair tightly in place and wont change if you get caught to the winds or drizzle or if the humidity levels change.
Everyday make up essentialsfor the rainy season
Keep some blotting paper handy. Also have whatever makeup you are wearing that day in your handbag to use in case you need to touch up.
Diet for the rainy season
There is no food that is categorized as better or worse for you when it rains. However a nice hot bowl of soup is always a good idea for cold evenings.
Monsoon makeover tips
Avoid see through fabrics. Carry a scarf with you to protect your hair and always wear practical shoes. You never know when you will step in a puddle!
Any kind of jewellery can be worn as the rains should not affect jewellery.
Dos and donts
Stay away from runny makeup and heavy fabrics that could sag with water weight in case you get drenched in the rain. See through fabrics and pretty shoes covered in satin are also not the best rainy day choices.

They sit when it rains, and they sit when the hot wind off the A-9 highway blows sand into their makeshift tent. Theyve been sitting for over 200 days now in Kilinochchi, protesting the loss of their family members.
They are mostly women, and they say they have one thing in common: they all lost their loved ones in the final days of the war, in 2009.
Some of their sons and husbands were fighters for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, they said, who surrendered after the Armys final offensive. Some were just civilians, picked up in camps for internally-displaced persons or loaded onto buses and never seen again.
The mothers have been searching for answers ever since, but a half-dozen government commissions set up over the years to address their questions have given them nothing, they said.
For eight years we believed the NGOs and INGOs and government commissions, but now we are not trusting them, said President of the Association for the Relatives of the Enforced Disappeared Kanagaranginy Yogaraja, So in February, we decided to protest here, because we can only trust ourselves.
They say their demand is basic: they want to know if their sons, daughters, parents, husbands and in-laws are dead, or if theyre alive somewhere, in a prison or detention camp.
We dont deny that there should be truth investigations, said KathasamyPonnamma, a mother whose son-in-law disappeared in Vavuniya. Even if they supported the LTTE in some way, we are ready for judicial processes, we are not saying just release them.
Even if you've killed my son, you can give me the body, she continued, with tears in her eyes. I need to do the final rituals. You can at least give the body to us.
Stuck in limbo
Not knowing whether their family members are dead or alive plagues the mothers. Many believe that their loved ones are still alive somewhere, and if they were released, they could come home and help take care of their shattered families.
Thats the cruelty of disappearance, said Alan Keenan, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. In many ways its worse than murder, because of that uncertainty.
In the absence of truth, all they have left are their final memories of their loved ones.
On a recent afternoon, surrounded by about 25 other mothers, Thangavelu Sathiyathevy recalled the last time she saw her family.
She said she remembers the day exactly. This was May 18, 2009. We were in Vadduvakallu, and there were buses taking people away, she said.
Thousands of displaced people had gathered on the beaches there, seeking safety from the fighting.Vaddavakallu was technically in a no-fire zone.
My daughter, son-in-law, and their three children were taken into the bus. He was an LTTE member, she said, and we also asked to join with them. But they said no, you can go separately.
Sathiyathevy said she was taken to Manik Farm, an IDP camp near Vavuniya. But she has never seen or even heard from her family again.
The children were 2, 9, and 10 years old.
Sivayogam Ratnaraja said she and her family was also taken to an IDP camp in Vavuniya after the war. In June, her son Ratnam Ratnaraja came to visit them from the University of Moratuwa, where he was studying engineering.
But after he left the camp, he was arrested by local police.
Ratnaraja said she was never given a reason for his arrest. But she has a suspicion.
Her elder son, Ratnams older brother, was an LTTE cadre and died during the fighting. The Police or an informant might have known this.
But my younger son was a student, he didnt have any connection with the LTTE, she said. It cannot be justified in any way.
She said shortly after the arrest, the police called some of his friends and asked about her sons behavior at the university.
They said hes a very good student and he does not engage in any sort of activities like that, she said, They told the police to release him.
Six months later, Ratnaraja said one of her neighbors, A. Rajaratnam, met with and spoke with her son at Anuradhapura prison.
But she has not heard from him again in eight years.
I lost my husband to illness, she said, I begged other people for money and with that money, I encouraged my other children to study.
If my son is alive he will take care of my family, and his other siblings, she added.
Without answers, the mothers say all they have left is hope. Since they began their protest in February, five of their members have died of heart attacks and other health complications.
We have to get the answers, said Leelathevy, one of the associations senior coordinators. Whether they protest for 300 days or 500 days, it doesnt matter, she said.
Government pressure
On their 100th day of protest, the mothers called a massive demonstration and hundreds of people took to the streets and blocked the A-9 in Kilinochchi. After that, members of the association met with President Maithripala Sirisena in person. He promised to release a list of all those who surrendered to the armed forces in the final days of the war.
In the time since, President Sirisena has also operationalized the Office of Missing Persons, an official body that would help families trace the fate of their loved ones.
In an interview Tuesday, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said that the countrys Constitutional Council is in the process of nominating seven councilors to head the office.
After that, it will finally be appointed by the President, he said.
Sivagnanasothy also said his ministry is working to compile the list of people who surrendered at the end of the war.
It will be a very important milestone, I would say, in the whole of reconciliation, he said.
200 days and counting
But for now, the mothers in Kilinochchi say are still waiting to see that list, to go before the fully-formed Office of Missing Persons and to get the answers theyve fought so hard for.
Yogaraja, the groups president, said that politicians, even elected Tamil politicians, have lost sight of their pain.
The LTTE leaders, they are now becoming very good friends and partners to the government, she said. But the normal soldiers, who joined the fight for two days, or three days, they were disappeared.
They hope that their struggle, sitting every day and sleeping every night in the harsh elements of the hot northern province, will wake up those in power.
They are enjoying their life and we are crying here in this place, she said.

The Teaching Hospital will continue to bear Dr. Neville Fernando s name only as an appreciation for his donation and not to indicate its ownership, he said.
The main objective of releasing this statement is preventing the people from getting a wrong idea about the account after hearing certain statements made by some politicians, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
The only difference between this hospital and the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital is that Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital does not charge money from any patient for any treatment.
All services will be conducted free of charge, he said in his statement.

New laws to improve SLs ranking in Ease of Doing Business Index - PM
The government is on keen to improve on the Ease of Doing Business index for Sri Lanka and will even go to the extent of introducing new legislation in this regard, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He was speaking at the IOSCO Growth and Embarking Markets Committee conference at Cinnamon Grand Colombo, yesterday. The Premier also said that even the Thai government has introduced new laws in this regard.
The Prime Minister said that the macroeconomic stabilization program which was also approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was put into place and today the country has the revenue for debt servicing.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that since 2006, successive governments have been investing heavily on infrastructure but today these investments are not bringing in expected returns.
This is why we decided to sign a joint venture agreement with China Merchants Port Holdings to lease out the Hambantota Port. This will bring in US$ 1.1 billion as a fee and also US$ 600 million as infrastructure. We are also looking at a similar lease deal for the Mattala Airport to have it off the government liability records by next year. The Colombo Port City too would bring in huge capital to the country, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lankas debt servicing would be at its peak in 2018 and 2019 and the government would be able to completely settle national debt before 2020. I will leave a debt free nation by 2020 as I dont want to pass it on to the next generation, he said.
He said that Sri Lanka was always looking at the problem of climate change in the country as the nation was dependent on agriculture and hydroelectric power generation. But now we are looking at a climate change economy to move the country forward where services and manufacturing and tourism sectors would play bigger roles. Too much of emphasis has been given to non-tradable sectors previously and this too should change direction.
The Prime Minister said that the growth of the capital markets is welcomed and in the future it may even improve to the point where stock exchanges would completely disappear and people would be using hand-held devices to access markets.
Meanwhile Malaysian Securities Commission Chairman Ranjit Ajit Singh said that capital markets have played key roles in the development of the Malaysian economy. Over 70% of capital for infrastructure projects was raised from them, he said.
IOSCO Asia Pacific Regional Committee Chairman Jun Mizuguchi said that with the growth of mobile and ICT usage in stock exchanges all over the world, cyber security threats should be looked at more seriously.
The event will also have close door sessions to formulate steps that should be taken to curb cyber security threats to the markets today.

Parliament
JO politically bankrupt: PM
Joint Opposition members are bankrupt politically even without the support of the First SLFP woman President and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He made this observation when sittings of Parliament resumed for a second time after the agitation created by the Joint Opposition members demanding a vote on the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Bill.
The Premier stated that he met with representatives of the SLMC and the Upcountry Peoples Front and listened to their grievances. The government was ready to accommodate the grievances of minority and minor parties, he said. If any faction of a minority or the majority is affected by this Bill to be passed, the government is ready to make amendments to it.
He added that the government would guarantee the representation of the women too.
The Joint Opposition members are in trouble now, the Premier said. The first and only woman President elected from the SLFP is with us now. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa is not in the House.
He stated that it was the UNP who contested with the Bandaranaikes and not those of the Joint Opposition.
Statement calling for exercise of universal jurisdiction on SL:
FM says will make statement within three weeks
Foreign Affairs Minister Thilak Marapana stated that he would make a statement in Parliament on the statement made by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Al Hussien in which he called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction on Sri Lanka, in three weeks time.
He made this observation in response to special statement made by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23(2) charging that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Al Hussien had made an effort to interfere in Sri Lankas internal affairs through his recent statement where he called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction on Sri Lanka.
Minister Marapana said that there was not much to worry about as charged by the Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena on the statement made by Prince Hussein. The Minister also said that he was fully aware of the incident and would make a statement in Parliament after a study. Dinesh Gunawardene inquired as to what action the government intends to take against the UN Commissioner of Human Rights
Minister of Foreign Affairs Tilak Marapana responding, said he would make a statement in three weeks time.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya then advised the minister to answer the question without taking too much time.
Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that that the statement was not so serious and it was only an incident that had taken place four years ago. He added that nothing much had happened during the good governance period.
Increasing of women representation:
Salient feature in Bill pledged by President in election manifesto: Mustapha
Increasing womens representation has been a salient feature in this Bill as pledged by President Maithripala Sirisena in his election manifesto, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha in Parliament yesterday.
As regards to womens representation in this country, there has been continuous agitation that unless you come from a political background you dont have the opportunity to get into Parliament.
Therefore, the President thought it just to introduce a system whereby women could enter all organs of government, said Minister Mustapha.
With regard to Local Government elections, we brought in a mechanism where 25% of the members would be women with regard to the Provincial Council elections. We have a 52% women population in this country, but there are less that 5% of women in elected bodies.
This major paradigm shift would be an opportunity for women to participate. In this country, money has played a pivotal role in politics. Hence, we could not get community leaders coming into Provincial Councils and local bodies.
Therefore, he said Dinesh Gunawardena should be the happiest because the government is now doing exactly what his report demanded.
There has been continuous agitation by the masses that we should change the electoral system. Therefore, he said he does not see why the Opposition is now agitating.
This Bill deals with the Provincial Council legal elections system, thereby I am entitled in terms of Standing Orders to bring whatever committee statement amendment, he said, urging all to support him in doing away with the preferential system which is detrimental to the voters where priority is given to a person and not to money.
JO stands only against delaying of elections, not about increasing women representation: Dinesh
The Joint Opposition stands only against the delaying of elections and not for the increasing of the women representation, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Second Reading debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
He also said that there are female members in Local Government Institutions even now. But they are deprived of their rights by now due to the government activities, said MP Gunawardena. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution was introduced to delay the elections.
He also said that the Joint Opposition went before Court against the 20th Amendment only. We only demand to know when the Local Government and Provincial Council elections are to be held queried MP Gunawardena.
Provincial Council Bill has incorporated suggestions, ideas of all parties: Alagiyawanna
The Provincial Council Bill is one that had incorporated the suggestions and ideas of all parties. People had resentment over the preferential system and wanted it changed, said Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
The Deputy Minister made this comment joining the Provincial Council Amendment bill debate in parliament yesterday.
Even members of the same party fought and sometimes killed each other. We must all accept that we need to do away with the preferential system and bring in a system of appointing a peoples representative who would be responsible for his ward. That is the system we intend to bring in through the Provincial Council Bill. Accordingly, in future all Provincial Council elections will be held according to the new mixed electoral system for the local bodies based on a ward system, he said.
He added that according to the preferential system, one could not get elected without money. Due to this situation, there are various misconceptions among the people. The SLFP vowed to assist in doing away with the preferential system. Hence, we are pleased at being able to bring in this new system. Some misinterpret our efforts and say we are afraid of holding elections. However, they must all accept that these changes are necessary for this country. These amendments are brought in according to the provisions of the law.
Cleaner politics had taken precedence over dirty politics today: Amaraweera
Cleaner politics had taken precedence over dirty politics today. What we need today is to build a new political culture in this country, while the President is determined to establish a clean governance, said Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
He made this comment during the Provincial Council Amendment Bill debate.
We entered politics through the preferential electoral system but if anyone wishes to abolish this system, then we would raise both our hands in support. This preferential system has created animosity within the parties and this was the main reason for the killing of Bharatha Lakshman, he pointed out.
Amaraweera said many lives have been been lost because of this preferential system. During the previous regime, there was a committee appointed to change the electoral system. We too gave our suggestions to the committee. Even if you ask the people, they will definitely vote for the abolition of the preferential system. One can come up with all sorts of excuses to avoid abolishing this preferential voting system, but it would be a decision that we would have to regret if we choose not to abolish it. The national government was established in order to make a change in the voting system. We are not obliged to anyone as our politics is based on proper policies, added Amaraweera.
Govt should remove all existing barriers within October to hold elections: Anura
The previous government held elections one after the other when the forces captured Kilinochchi, Thoppigala etc., and that distorted the electoral system which should be changed, said Leader of the Opposition Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Second Reading Debate on Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
MP Dissanayake said that to change that system, the Provincial Council elections should be held within two stages next year. To hold the Provincial Council elections we have to pass another several Bills. The government could remove all these barriers within October to hold those elections, said MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The government has to assure that these barriers would be removed in order to get our support to pass this Bill.
At this stage, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the government would give that assurance.
However MP Dissanayake too said that eight elections were held in the country within five years. It is not healthy for the economy of the country, MP Dissanayake said yesterday. So we have to think as to how this number of elections could be reduced.
MP Dissanayake also said that it was very easy for the government to win an election when it was held in several stages, whereas same was difficult for other parties. So there was a dialogue to hold elections on one day, said MP Dissanayake. But the attempt has failed due to a Supreme Court order.
Increasing of women representation most commendable: Jayasena
Increasing of womens representation is most commendable. Some of us female ministers got together and formed a womens forum to lobby for greater womens representation. This is a result of our efforts, said Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Sumedha G. Jayasena in Parliament yesterday.
Holding elections on a ward system was initiated by the UPFA, but as they failed to complete it, the current government is completing it effectively. We commend and approve this move.
Throughout the world women enter politics through a quota system, she added.
Tense situation as JO storms Well of House: Sumanthiran
A tense situation took place in Parliament yesterday, when Joint Opposition members stormed the Well of the House in protest against the moving of the Second Reading of the debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to suspend sittings temporarily almost for two hours to reach a decision on the continuation of the debate on the Bill.
The Speaker suspended the sittings around 11.20 am. Following a meeting participated by the Speaker, Party Leaders, the Premier and Attorney General, the sittings resumed at 1.30 pm. The Speaker announced that there was no legal objections to continue the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill and the debate continued.
However, while the Joint Opposition members rushed and stood shouting in the Well before the sittings suspended, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa commenced the debate and continued with the speech and was followed by Opposition Member M. A. Sumanthiran.
However, the sittings was suspended temporarily by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya around 11.20 am until a decision was reached whether to continue the debate or not, following Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes submission. The Premier who attended while MP M A Sumanthiran was on his feet, stated that the Speaker could decide to suspend the sittings or allow the Member speaking to continue until he winds up and then suspend sittings. However, the Attorney General would come to Parliament after 12 noon, Premier said.
The Speaker decided to suspend the sittings after MP Sumanthiran wound up his speech.
However, when the Notice of the Motions and Orders of the Day commenced, Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill was related to the Provincial Councils, yet it had not been directed to the Provincial Councils. He added that the Speaker should deliver a ruling on it. MP Wimal Weerawansa also raising a point of order, maintained the same view.
The Speaker responded that there was no need to direct the same to the Provincial Councils and it was the ruling.
Joint Opposition Member Namal Rajapaksa said that it was not fair to move the Bill in the morning and taking the vote in the evening, as the same was a Bill relating to matters of the Provincial Councils. He requested the Speaker to discuss the matter with the Party leaders and the Prime Minister and deliver a ruling.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that a meeting would be held at 12 noon with Party leaders and the Prime Minister and the Attorney General and suggested to continue the debate until then.
At this point, Joint Opposition MP Gamini Lokuge said that he was the Chairman of the Parliamentary Oversight Committee appointed in relation to this Bill. He added that these amendments were not directed to the Committee at any moment.
Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella demanded to submit the views of the Attorney General before Parliament and Speaker Jayasuriya said that he would do so at the proper time.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa said that as the Minister, he could bring amendments to the Act at any moment.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma stated that when it was queried on Tuesday if the government informed the Provincial Councils on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill, the Leader of the House did not answer.
At this stage, the Leader of the House and Minister Kiriella stated that the same matter was in the reserved list and it was not necessary to direct it before the Provincial Councils. The 18th Amendment to the Constitution was moved in the morning and was passed in the evening, Minister Kiriella said. Was it fair Can you remember how it was passed.
The Speaker observed that it was not necessary to send the amendments to the Oversight Committee. So the debate could commence.
When Minister Faizer Musthapa commenced the debate, the Joint Opposition members stormed the Well in protest. MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Dullas Alahapperuma, Keheliya Rambukkwella, Wimal Weerawansa, Tharaka Balasooriya, Udaya Gammanpila, Kumara Welgama, Lohan Ratwatte, Wimalaweera Dissanayake, Arundika Fernando, Namal Rajapaksa, Shehan Semasinghe, etc rushed into the well and stood before the Speakers Bench in protest and started shouting, while Minister Musthapa continued with his speech.
Thereafter Opposition member MA Sumanthiran joined the debate while Joint Opposition members remained at the Well shouting. However, during his speech Sumanthiran was seen interacting with the members at the Well. Some of the member were seen responding to MP Sumanthiran, while the latter recalled the stance of MP Gammanpila in the Supreme Court on Provincial Councils. MP Gammanpilas Counsels maintained in Supreme Court that the Provincial Councils were sovereign, MP Sumanthiran said.
However, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva raising a point of order, said that the Provincial Councils were not sovereign.
While MP Sumanthiran was in his feet, the Premier attended and submitted his views and later the sittings was suspended around 11.20 after the member wound up his speech.
The sittings resumed at 1.30 pm and the Speaker observed that Party leaders, the Premier and the Attorney General met in the Parliamentary Complex. He also observed that according to the views of the Attorney General, there was no need to inquire into the views of the Provincial Councils on the matter. On the other matter, amendments to a Bill so far has not been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committees. So it was not necessary to submit the amendments before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee. He added that the Bill had been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on September this year.
At this stage, MP Weerawansa said that the amendments are three fold bigger than the Bill itself and MP Lokuge said that the one we passed here is not the one we discussed at the Parliamentary Oversight Committee.
At this stage, Leader of the House Kiriella said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena agreed there at the meeting to continue.
The Bill to be passed is not what was discussed at the Oversight Committee, said MP Namal Rajapaksa.
There is a representative of the Attorney General here at the Parlimentary Complex to get his views, said Minister Kiriella.
The debate was recommenced by Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera.

The Pathfinder Foundation (PF) has taken a pioneering initiative by entering into a collaboration agreement with the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC) having its seat in Moscow, the Russian Federation.
The agreement, signed by Andrey Kortunov, Director General of RIAC and Bernard Goonetilleke, Chairman, PF, seeks to exchange analytical papers between the two institutions, implement joint projects to strengthen the stance of the two countries in the international arena, including conducting roundtable discussions and workshops; develop interaction between Russian and Sri Lankan institutions in international research activities; and engage in mutual informational support through the respective web-resources and social media channels.
RIAC, a non-profit academic and diplomatic think tank that was established in 2010 pursuant to a presidential decree is aimed at strengthening peace, friendship and solidarity between peoples, preventing international conflicts and promoting conflict resolution and crisis settlement.
RIAC is recognized as one of Moscows best-known and authoritative think-tanks. With the former Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov functioning as President and the current Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as Chairman of Board of Trustees, RIAC has over the past seven years established itself well, within and outside Russia by hosting international conferences, publishing reports on international issues and holding events for young experts, scholars, diplomats and journalists. RIA operates as a link between the state, scholarly community, business and civil society in an effort to find foreign policy solutions to complex conflict issues.
Milinda Moragoda, former Member of Parliament, who held several Cabinet portfolios including the Ministry of Justice, launched Pathfinder Foundation in 2006. PF is an independent, nonprofit, non-partisan and advocacy think tank, which has played a catalytic role in promoting economic policy reforms in Sri Lanka. Among the areas focused by PF are promoting market oriented economic reforms, public-private partnerships, promotion of bilateral relations with major foreign countries and people-to-people relations as well as strategic issues.
Under its wings, PF has two centres, viz., China-Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre (CSLCSC) and Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives (CILI) for undertaking research work and promoting multifaceted bilateral relations.
Bernard Goonetilleke, a former diplomat, is the Chairperson and Luxman Siriwardane, an economist, serves as Executive Director of the Pathfinder Foundation and Director, CSLCSC, while Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage functions as Director of CILI. Pathfinder Foundation has linked up with an array of think tanks in China, India, and the US and conducts regular programmes, assisted by a distinguished group of experts and academics.

People should play an active role in protecting themselves: Wildlife Minister
The elephant problem is something that affects the people and as such, people should take an active role in protecting themselves, said Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife.
In response to questions raised by MP Douglas Devananda in Parliament yesterday, he said, Elephant Pass is an area where elephants made it their home. Now they bring their young ones to show them how two legged elephants known as humans have invaded their habitats.
In order to protect the villagers in the North from elephant attacks, we have set up a wild life offices and increased the cadre of wildlife officers in those areas. In 2013 in Vavuniya and Kilinochchi, two new wildlife zonal offices were established and the required infrastructure facilities and staff had been provided. In addition, erecting of electrical fences had also been initiated.
However, our policy was not to give these contracts to contractors, politicians or officers. People must participate. Our policy now is that people should put up the electrical fences.
The Minister said there are remedial measures such as growing plants such as lime along their properties will deter elephants from entering their premises.
The 75% of the work on the Sudiyanagar electric fence had been completed. Aiyankulama 20 km and 50% of the work had been completed. I ask that the people play a key role and get involved. They should take on the responsibility for their safety.
In Vavuniya district, the Ilavaranthakulam, Paranthan electric fences, 50% has been completed. This is not a problem concerning politicians, but the people and I want the people to play an active role in protecting themselves. More than 28,300 fire crackers used to chase off elephants have already been distributed among the affected villages.
We have proposed for the supplying of fences and post to the farmers to protect their lands but the farmers themselves should construct the fences, he said.
As far as compensation is concerned, prior to 2015, only 100,000 was paid as compensation he said. Now we pay one million for the loss of life, Rs. 500,000 for disability due to animal attacks, Rs, 75,000 for injuries caused by wild elephant attacks. The GA is responsible for the submission of reports through the Grama Sevaka. For loss of property, we pay Rs. 100,000, he said.

Pethiyagoda to deliver keynote address at Planters Assn. AGM on Friday
163rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Planters Association of Ceylon, one of the plantation sectors most important gatherings, is scheduled to take place at the Grand Ballroom of the Galadari Hotel on September 22.
Drawing together some of the most respected names in the plantation industry, this years AGM follows celebrations of 150th anniversary of the establishment of tea in Sri Lanka. The keynote address at the AGM will be delivered by Chief Guest and Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board, Rohan Pethiyagoda.
A respected taxonomist and winner of the Rolex Award for Enterprise, Pethiyagoda is the founder of the Wildlife Heritage Trust (WHT), a foundation he established in 1990 to further biodiversity exploration in Sri Lanka, with the business-model of publishing natural history books and channeling the proceeds into further exploration and research.
Pethiyagoda has previously served as Chairman of Sri Lankas Water Resources Board, as an Advisor on Environment and Natural resources to the Government of Sri Lanka, was previously elected Deputy Chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. Pethiyagoda had his secondary education at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia and holds a B.Sc. (Eng.) Hons. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kings College, University of London and an M. Phil. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Sussex, and is a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences.
Founded in 1854, a full 13 years before the establishment of the first commercial tea plantations in Sri Lanka, the Planters Association has been a vital contributor to the development of Sri Lankas plantation sector and the wider national economy for well over one and a half centuries.
Comprising a membership of more than 180, including 23 regional plantation companies (RPCs), the Planters Associations membership manages approximately 40% of the countrys tea, rubber, palm oil and coconut lands in addition to the management of 332 factories. The sector directly employs nearly 200,000 individuals and when combined with indirect employment, is estimated to provide a livelihood for over one million Sri Lankans across the island.
Among its affiliate bodies, The District Planters Associations too have played an important role in supporting the development of plantation executives by conducting regular meetings with eminent guest speakers, particularly in terms of events focused on personal development.
From its inception, the Planters Association has been at the forefront of numerous vital initiatives relating to the development of the countrys plantation industry. These include contributing approximately one-fourth of the cost of constructing Sri Lankas hill country railway systems in 1857, the imposition of a voluntary CESS and similar measures that led to the countrys first tea promotion campaign in 1894 and playing a leading role in the establishment of the Tea Research Institute of Ceylon in 1925.

PM stresses on new Monetary Policy Law
New laws to regulate financial markets:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday spoke of introducing new laws to regulate financial markets as Sri Lanka navigates through a period of transformation amid global turbulences.
One of the key features in this transformation would be a new Monetary Policy Law which would have the Central Bank focus on essential items and not peripheral issues, a new Liability Management Law and the creation of a National Debt Office in the Ministry of Finance, a new Security Exchange Act, the new Foreign Exchange Act and the new Inland Revenue Act.
Delivering the keynote address at the IOSCO Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) Committee Conference held at Cinnamon Grand, Colombo, the Prime Minister highlighted the positive steps taken by the government to steer the countrys economy in the right direction.
He noted that his government took over an economy burdened with high debt taken since 2006 and thus the years 2018 and 2019 were going to be crucial for the countrys economy as many of the debt servicing payments are due during this period.
The Prime Minister assured investors that all debt would be repaid in this generation.
To investors from security and exchange markets around the world who converged in Colombo to discuss Enhancing sustainable and innovative market-based financing, the Prime Minister assured them that the government had put into play several measures to regulate and stabilize the economy.
Today government revenue exceeds the sum needed for debt servicing, he added and said the government was moving away from the dependence of high fuel prices for revenue.
Improvements and technological innovations in the Inland Revenue Department, Excise Department and Customs have resulted in revenue collection going up, said the Prime Minister.
In addition the government will be looking at investments in the building of a dockyard, oil refinery, steel plant and three LNG plants with Japanese and Indian partnerships.
These investments, he said will stabilize the countrys foreign exchange in time to come and have a massive transformation in the economy.
The Prime Minister also stressed on the need to look at the climate change economy which has had devastating impacts of the countrys agriculture.We can no longer depend on good weather to keep our economy going, so we need to focus more on the non-agricultural sector, he said.
But by 2018, the legal framework for the financial sector in Sri Lanka will change and Sri Lanka which is at the centre of a rapidly developing region, the PM expected a much broader capital market function.
He thus stated that the GEM Committee deliberations were the ideal place to decide what these new changes to the Securities and Exchange Market especially with the advent of technology would be.

Premier submits Constitutional Assembly interim report to Parliament - UPDATED

Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe said today the country would be transformed through the new constitution while it signifies a new era of prosperity and development.
After we came into power, we reinstated democracy ensuring equal rights to all Sri Lankans. The new Constitution is one that ensures a strong economy based on a progressive framework, where its benefits will be divided among all citizens, the Prime Minister said, submitting the interim report of the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee to Parliament today.
The national government has taken another step in fulfilling the pledge made on January 8, 2015 to bring in a new Constitution. We intend to prepare a constitution that will benefit all Sri Lankans irrespective of their cast, creed or social standing. It is a constitution that will bring about a strong economy, which will benefit all. We must take this opportunity to expand our democracy and build stable peace. These are areas that were deprived to us over the past three decades. It is essential to build a strong democracy which will ensure prosperity to all, he said.
In order to bring in investment to generate employment that will enhance the prosperity of all Sri Lankans, a strong economy and development is essential.
We have now been given an opportunity to build a bridge of peace expelling division and distance between the various races, which for so long had threatened economic development being held hostage by violence and volatility for so long, he added.
Tabling the interim report of the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee in Parliament, the Prime Minister said it was a foundation for discussion - all parties were given the opportunity to include their ideas and suggestions: We formulated this collectively and everyones ideas and suggestions have been included in this report. We have suggested that Sri Lanka should be a unitary state, the Prime Minister said.
According to Wickremesinghe, there are suggestions for power devolution included in the report and the countrys future would be determined by the agreement reached. He said all members are prepared to accept a united Sri Lanka, which cannot be divided. The country is currently experiencing a huge transformation in the political landscape of this country and we are travelling in a new direction, he said adding that the government supports such a change.
We were battered by unimaginable hardships during the past three decades but now for the first time we have been given the opportunity to stand on the same platform. This dedication and commitment we make to bring about peace and stability will make a huge difference to our future generations. We cannot allow this opportunity to escape us. There is no room for revenge within our democracy. The prominence given to Buddhism within our society will be safeguarded while the foundation of our new Constitution are the principles of Buddhism. We place our trust in the Buddhist teachings that it will guide our nation, said the Prime Minister.
He said the government would not allow anyone to inculcate fear in the minds of the people and destroy the countrys economy creating instability and division. We have come before you with a solution. From the North to the South we have extended support in dividing power to the provinces. The Provincial Councils are known as the third level of state governance. It is a blessing that these proposals have received the approval and support of the government and the opposition. We need to discuss the presidency and executive further and a broad discussion is needed. This interim report is a joint effort, which received the support of President Maithripala Sirisena. A Constitutional Council was established to oversee the process of a new Constitution. Hence, we hope that this will create a positive dialog throughout the country. This is a historical juncture that will ensure our future generations a prosperous and peaceful nation. I expect this topic to not only be discussed within the Constitutional Council but discussed broadly among the general public throughout the country, he said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that in the end it should be a constitution that will benefit the whole country. Hence he invited all to take part in this historical and most significant process. He said since coming into power the national government has established democracy and ensured peace and equal opportunities for all: We ensured the rights of all where the people can now express their views without fear of persecution. The media too has been given the freedom to criticise even the government. Today the international community too has confidence that we will establish a democratic and economically strong country. This government will ensure that through the devolution of power we empower all communities creating a close bond between the government and the people. We will not allow a handful to steal our childrens future from them. This is the principle that the new constitution will be based upon, added the Prime Minister.

President seeks UN support to achieve goals
At a moment when Sri Lanka is committed to a course of good governance by strengthening democracy, human rights, and fundamental rights while winning the goodwill of the international community, I look forward to the kind support of the United Nations, stated President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the 72nd Session of UNGA.
In our countrys journey where we protect our independence and sovereignty, we respectfully request the support of the international community for us to go on a moderate but steady path to achieve our targets in order to find sustainable solutions to the allegations leveled against us, the President stated.
Following is the full text of the speech:
It is my greatest pleasure to address this annual assembly for the third time as the President of Sri Lanka. The theme of this 72nd Assembly is Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet. Given the challenges of that the world is facing today, I consider theme highly relevant.
There are a few promises that I made to the people of Sri Lanka when I contested the Presidential election in January 2015. One of the key promises among them was that, because Sri Lanka's Executive President had been vested with more powers than any other leader in the world, I would curtail those excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and would transfer those powers to the Parliament. I have set an example to my country as well as the entire world by duly curtailing those powers and transferring them to the Parliament.
In countries that protect and nurture democracy, it is important that leaders who come to power in them, use their power in a good manner and protect democracy, while building a fair society. Yet, when we look at the last two decades and the world history, we see that, because of their unwillingness leave it to successors, some leaders let their countries lose peace, sometimes even leading to international divisions and disharmony. We have a good understanding of such phenomena at national and international levels. Against a backdrop such as this, I must state to this esteemed audience, that we have been able to complete two and half successful years in protecting and promoting democracy, since ending the rule of a group of people who has kept power to themselves by restricting freedom of the citizens.
In the development vision of our country, we declared year 2017 as the year for freeing the nation from poverty. At present, the whole world is engaged in an attempt to free itself from poverty. In line with declaration of the Year 2017 as the year of poverty alleviation, many development projects have been launched to strengthen the domestic economy.
As you all know, the armed conflict that dragged on for nearly 30 years in my country, weakened our economy. We were able to defeat the armed separatist movement that attempted to divide our country by resorting to terrorism. We could restore peace and democracy and march forward as a free and peaceful country. With the lessons learnt from the bad experiences of the conflict, we could turn a new page in our path to sustainable economic development by focusing on domestic agriculture and local industrialization. Specially, my government emphasized the protection of our environment in our drive to achieve sustainability of our development.
I must mention that, today, the whole world is facing challenges posed by severe changes in climate. I would like to propose that the community of nations must focus on implementing the Paris Accord that the world reached in 2015, by further improving the unity that we reached by signing that accord. We must remember that the Paris Accord is critically important to future of the entire biosphere and humanity.
In order to incrementally free our nation from poverty, my government has launched the 'Gramashakthi' national programme. We have also declared a clear economic plan until 2025. I believe that the proposed economic plan for 2025 will revitalize our economy and help reduce poverty by further strengthening local agriculture and industries.
Mr President, children all over the world, including in my country, are facing many challenges. We launched a National Programme for protecting the nation's children. They need to be saved from intoxicants, and from abuse. I would like to highlight the need to implement targeted programmes at national and international levels to ensure the safety of our children.
The world has recognized the need to ensure the rights of women. However, there are still countries and societies, where women are not treated equally. In my country, more that 52% of the population are women. New changes in our Constitution protect the rights of women. New measures include the legislation that makes it mandatory that a minimum of 25% candidates at elections should be women.
While it is important to work for the progress of women and children, it is also necessary to fight the menace of drugs and other intoxicants. Sri Lanka has launched a nation-wide campaign to fight drugs and other intoxicants. However, while noting that they pose a threat to the humanity, I underscore the need to implement a broader international response to the threat posed by drugs, and other intoxicants. As I see it, drug prevention and mitigation oriented programmes with a broad acceptance and consensus are the need of the day.
When I came into power having gone through nearly three decades of war, we were facing two main challenges. The first of them was the huge debt burden on the economy. We had to pay insupportable amounts for servicing our debt, emptying our coffers. The other was facing the allegations of war time human rights violations by United Nations and the UN Human Rights Council. However, in our new programme to revitalize the domestic economy, we have been able to identify a plan to reduce and incrementally free ourselves from our foreign debt while encouraging foreign investments.
At the same time, as a government, we are paying serious attention to the aforementioned allegations and to find solutions to them as a matter of priority. Mainly, my government has performed well in terms of strengthening democracy and protecting human rights. I must mention here that the government will continue to ensure their progress in the future.
My government is committed to work tirelessly to achieving reconciliation by fostering understanding among all ethnic and linguistic groups, while eliminating mutual suspicion and hatred in order to create a society where all can live freely and harmoniously. Further, we are dedicated to ensure that the country will accomplish economic prosperity while promoting a moral and disciplined society. Specially, my government is committed to the creating a fair and just society by strengthening rule of law.
Mr President, I must mention here that, at a moment when Sri Lanka is committed to a course of good governance by strengthening democracy, human rights, and fundamental rights while winning the goodwill of the international community, I look forward to the kind support of the United Nations. We have been a member of United Nations for 62 years. Sri Lanka has always been a country that has respected its treaties and conventions, agreements and rules and regulations while acting to improve such relations further. As such, in our countrys journey where we protect our independence and sovereignty, we respectfully request the support of the international community for us to go on a moderate but steady path achieve our targets in order to find sustainable solutions to the allegations leveled against us.
Some extremist groups are expecting a high speed. Some extremist groups want radical solutions. However, as a country that has faced a three decade long war, where deep divisions have been existed, I request the support of all of you to promote peace and fraternity, so that my beloved country and its people can rise from the current situation. That is why I emphasize that it is for a slow and a successful journey that we need the support.
We all have heard that speedy journey is a dangerous journey. Therefore, I believe that you will understand the complex nature of issues that hinder the instant and radical solutions that some impatient groups are asking for. As such, I reiterate with respect the need of support from the United Nations and its member states for my country to ensure the non-recurrence of war by fostering peace and harmony among all communities in Sri Lanka. I wish to conclude my speech wishing good luck to the President and the membership and by requesting the blessings for Sri Lanka to emerge as an economically prosperous illustrious country in the world where democracy is strong and the gruesome past never repeats.

Addressing the world leaders in Sinhala, the President said that during the last two and a half years, the government has taken several important steps that are necessary for consolidating democracy, freedom, good governance, and the rule of law.
Through such transformative steps, we have laid the foundation necessary to forge national reconciliation, and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country, he said.
As a country that has suffered violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and we are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict. We have given priority in this context to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country, and through a strong foundation of national reconciliation forged through unity and friendship among communities, the President said.

President Sirisena called on the world leaders to take a collective action for eradication of narcotic drugs. He said he wanted to draw the attention of the respected General Assembly of the United Nations to the problem of drugs that poses a serious threat to human society itself, preying on young children and causing much destruction to communities.Such a programme must include plans and efforts to combat this menace at national level in all countries, and at international level, he said. The President explained the successful efforts made by the government to lessen the foreign debt burden and usher in economic revival and sought the support of the world community to the efforts made by Sri Lanka for economic development.
Pointing out that Sri Lanka as a member of the UN for the last 62 years adhered to the UN conventions, policies and principles, he said that the nation requires the patient, understanding and support for its slow, but steady march to create a peaceful and prosperous country for its people.

Previous regime avoided drinking water provision to people: Minister Premadasa
The previous regime avoided the provision of drinking water to the people, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said at Hathporuwa in Suriyawewa recently.
The minister donated funds for the provision of water to the Randiyadahara community centre for distribution among people.
Minister Premadasa said the water supply scheme will benefit 400 families in the village. He said villagers have undergone hardships in obtaining water for drinking.
It is our bounden duty to provide water to the people, he said.
The minister said the duration of the previous regime was known as a period of miracles, but people did not get even drinking water for reasons not known.
If the rulers provided drinking water to villagers, there would not be kidney patients in those areas, he said.
The minister said the estimated cost for the construction of the Suriyawewa international play ground was Rs.1,200,000,000. He said a huge amount of money has gone to the pockets of the then rulers and their henchmen.
Minister Premadasa said the distribution of Sil redi is not bad, but they distributed not a sil redi, but a Manapa reddak during the presidential election.

Renews hopes for a just political solution: Sumanthiran
Tabling of interim report at Constitutional Assembly in Parliament :
The hope for a just political solution has been renewed with the tabling of the long awaited interim report of the Steering Committee and six Sub Committees on the new Constitution, at the Constitutional Assembly in Parliament today (21),said TNA MP and member of Steering Committee M.A.Sumanthiran.
Speaking to journalists on Tuesday night, he said they had reached consensus on the reports and members who had reservations were allowed to note down their observations in its annex.
He added that even the Joint Opposition which has been highly critical of the process, finally agreed to the report having noted their observations.
The MP believed that if the proposals are approved, they could all work out a power devolution mechanism which went beyond the 13th Amendment.
The Constitution making process has received wide criticism as well as praise and as the government balances the precarious job of catering to the aspirations of the people both in the North and South but the Leader of the Opposition is acutely aware that his time is running short,
Whether we will be able to carry the Tamil people with us or not will depend on the political solution we get. If we get a good political solution the people will be with us. If not, we will not ask the people to be with us, we will tell them dont accept it, R.Sampanthan said.
He added that we could not afford to lose this opportunity to make things right, We will do our best to make use of this opportunity to the maximum. We have to come to a fair and just solution and now it is also the responsibility of the government to deliver.
The former TNA leader asked that the President and Prime Minister too do their part and guide their own parties to achieve a positive result. He feared that attempts made by the Joint Opposition and the former President to arouse suspicion among the Sinhalese could derail the process and thus asked that the leaders take on a more active role in guiding the people in the right direction.
If we do not act in fear of extremists, we will not get anywhere, Sumanthiran said.
Having fought for a just solution for over three decades, it has been imperative that Sampanthan gets this right this time around,
In the end we cannot agree to everything. We cannot sell our people and the President and Prime Minister know this, said Sampanthan but he was hopeful that, there is a chance that a fair solution can come of this.

Severe drought hits Anuradhapura
A severe drought is affecting the Anuradhapura district, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Palugaswewa told the Daily News.
He said there are 73 major reservoirs and 303 medium scale tanks under Irrigation Department. About 103 tanks in the dry zone have around 13 percent of water.
We experienced drought conditions in the past. The water levels of the major reservoirs had never come down to the present levels, the director said.
In the Anuradhapura District, only Wahalkada, Tisawewa and Thuruwila tanks keep the water levels at 25 percent.
The water levels of the Parackrama Samudraya and Minneriya tank and all other major tanks in the Polonnaruwa district range from 12 percent to 20 percent.
Palugaswewa said reduced water levels will badly affect the 2017/2018 maha season paddy cultivation.
According to Palugaswewa, meteorology observations and reports predicted that the forthcoming maha seasonal rains would not be as much as in the past years.
He said if the water capacities of the major tanks in the dry zones range from 50 percent to 70 percent by the end of next October, water could be provided to about 85 percent of the total acreage of paddy cultivation under the major and medium scale tanks.

Singer Sri Lanka rating unaffected by shareholder change - Fitch
Fitch Ratings says Hayleys PLCs acquisition of a controlling stake in Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC (Singer, A-(lka)/Stable) is neutral for Singers rating.
This is because Hayleys balance sheet will be stretched significantly following the completion of the Singer acquisition despite Hayleys stronger business risk profile as the purchase is likely to be largely funded by debt and existing cash.
In Fitchs view, this is likely to limit Hayleys ability to provide extraordinary support to Singer if required, especially given the size of Singers own balance sheet and its significant debt.
On September 15, Hayleys purchased a 61.73% stake in Singer from its main shareholder Retail Holdings (Sri Lanka) BV for Rs 10.9 billion.
Retail Holdings will retain a stake of 9.47% for the time being while Hayleys will make a mandatory offer as required by local regulations to purchase the remaining 28.8% of Singer.
Fitch estimates that following Hayleys acquisition of the 61.73% of Singer, Hayleys consolidated lease-adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR of 3.9x as at end-March 2017 (FY17) will increase to 5.8x, all else remaining equal.
Hayleys leverage could increase further depending on the use of more debt to fund the remaining stake in Singer following the completion of the mandatory offer. Fitch estimates that Hayleys financial flexibility will be stretched even further at the stand-alone company level through which a bulk of the investment in Singer will be made.
With the acquisition, Singer, the biggest consumer-durable retailer in the country, will become Hayleys largest subsidiary, contributing an estimated 23% of the Hayleys groups post-acquisition pro-forma consolidated EBITDA.
Hayleys other significant operating segments include transportation and logistics, purification and agriculture, whose contribution to Hayleys post-acquisition pro-forma consolidated EBITDA will drop to approximately 13%, 11% and 10%, respectively, according to Fitchs estimates, with all else being equal.

Spieth eyes FedEx jackpot at Tour Championship
Atlanta: World number two Jordan Spieth says he will be targeting victory at the season-ending Tour Championship this week as he bids to pocket another multi-million-dollar jackpot.
Spieth heads into Thursdays first round at East Lake Golf Club in pole position to claim the $10 million bonus on offer to the winner of the FedEx Cup series, leading second placed Justin Thomas by 340 points.
That healthy points cushion means Spieth could afford to finish second in Atlanta this week and still win the title, provided none of the other players in the top five win this weeks event.
Mathematically, Spieth could even take the FedEx Cup title with as low as a 29th-place finish, depending on the performances of his rivals.
The 24-year-old Texan however insists he will not be tempted into trying to play for position when the action begins on East Lakes 7,385-yard par-70 layout.
If you start playing for position thats when you take your foot off the gas pedal a little bit, and thats not how we normally play, Spieth said.
Im comfortable at East Lake, and Im in a great position.
Spieth, who won the FedEx Cup two years ago, has not yet registered a victory in the playoffs this year.
He would be the first player to win the title without winning a tournament if he takes the FedEx Cup this week, and only the second player after Tiger Woods to win the title twice.
Spieth finished 10 shots behind BMW Championship winner Marc Leishman on Sunday, but a final round 65 has left the three-time major winner confident heading into the season finale.
I was pumped to have the round I did on Sunday, to gain some momentum, to maintain the number one spot, Spieth said. I was a little bit off at the start of the week in my striking. But I feel pretty close right now to where I was in the first two playoff events. Things feel good. If this were a major championship Id be pretty pleased with how things are feeling on the Tuesday.
Spieth said the key to a successful final event of the year has been learning to conserve energy.
In 2014 and 2016 I remember being completely worn out by the time I got to the Tour Championship, Spieth said Tuesday.
Theres a lot on the line. Its essentially a major after coming off a pretty hectic schedule in the last six or seven weeks.
Spieth will partner close friend Thomas in the first round. The latter is aiming to crown a successful season with victory in Atlanta after recording five wins this year including a maiden major title at the PGA Championship.
Like Spieth, Thomas could win the FedEx Cup title with a top-three finish this week, depending on how his rivals fare.
World number one Dustin Johnson meanwhile will aim to make up for his near-miss last season, when he was pipped to the title by Rory McIlroy.
Johnson won the opening leg of the FedEx Cup when he beat Spieth in a playoff at the Northern Trust in New York last month. Since then though Johnson has failed to challenge, tying for 18th at the Dell Technologies before settling for a share of 33rd at the BMW Championship last weekend. - AFP

## Title: Sri Lanka to act over adoption racket claims

Sri Lanka to act over adoption racket claims

Sri Lanka is to launch an investigation into adoption fraud following claims that thousands of babies were sold to foreign nationals in the 1980s.
Rajitha Senaratne, Sri Lankas health minister, said the government would set up a DNA databank to enable children adopted abroad to search for their biological parents and other relatives, and vice versa.
In an interview for a television documentary, to be aired in the Netherlands on Wednesday, Senaratne acknowledged the existence of illegal baby farms in Sri Lanka in the 1980s. Children were either bought or stolen before being sold to westerners for adoption, the programme makers allege.
There were a lot of baby farms back then, Senaratne said. They collected the babies there and sold them to foreigners for adoption.
Senaratne said it was the existence of such facilities that prompted the Sri Lankan government to suspend inter-country adoption. The rules were altered after a high-profile case involving the discovery of 20 newborn babies and 22 women held in prison like conditions following a police raid in 1987. The number of adoptions by foreign nationals subsequently plummeted.
The makers of Zembla, a Dutch current affairs programme, claim that the records of Sri Lankan children adopted in the Netherlands during the 1980s were widely falsified.
A series of interviews with doctors, brokers and those involved in adoption schemes in Sri Lanka paints a grim picture of a racket involving the abduction of newborns from hospitals. The abducted babies were allegedly handed over to acting mothers, who pretended to be the biological mothers, before the children were sold on for adoption.
More than 11,000 babies were adopted by western countries from Sri Lanka in the 1980s, the programme makers said. While 4,000 ended up in the Netherlands, others went to the UK, Sweden and Germany, claims the documentary.
One woman told the programme that she was informed her baby had died shortly after birth at a hospital in Matugama, but that a family member saw a doctor carry the infant out of the hospital alive.
Another claimed that someone connected to the hospital had paid her to pretend she was the childs biological mother. She said: They asked me to act as a mother. Then they gave me 2,000 rupees.
The documentary makers allege that doctors and nurses acted as intermediaries for western adoption agencies. One broker told the programme women were impregnated to meet the demand for adoptive children.
When told about allegations of false adoption papers, acting mothers and babies stolen from hospitals, Senaratne said: The government should take this very seriously. We will have to set up a special agency where parents and children can have their DNA tested. This provides an easy method of finding out if it is the real mother or not. I will take the initiative for this.
He added: It happened in an illegal manner, its very wrong. It violates the human rights of these families. This needs to be looked into.

Sri Lankan fugitive faces Sh2 billion theft charge
Moshin Ranatunga, who entered Kenya on a 90-day visa, was charged last year with stealing Sh2 billion from his employer, Ranfer Teas Kenya, between July 2012 and September 2015.
Assistant Deputy Public Prosecutor Alexander Muteti applied to have Ranatungas Sh1 million bond cancelled, arguing that he was a flight risk. Muteti told the court that Mr Ranatunga had run away from the country in 2016 after a warrant of arrest was issued against him in connection with the lost money.
He told Senior Resident Magistrate Henry Nyakweba that the accused was living illegally in Kenya and should not be released until his passport is regularised. NO STATUS He is a man of no status at this point and cannot be released without assurance that he will come back.
Until further sureties, he has to be in custody, said Muteti. He said Ranatunga was also on the run from the Sri Lankan government. The Sir-Lankan authorities were shocked that he was actually in Kenya. His house of cards crumbled with the letter from the Sri Lanka government seeking information about him, said Muteti. It is not clear what offences Ranatungae is facing back home as there are pending proceedings. Nyakweba said he would make a ruling on Ranatungas release on bond once he determines the authenticity of his passport.- Standard Media

In fact, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene, who functioned as Chairman of the Finance Sub Committee to hear recommendations too, had forwarded a report in this connection and Keheliya Rambukwella could easily ask Gunawardene as to whether it included recommendations made by the US.

Strengthening entrepreneurs at grass-roots level vital: PM
The government intends to boost the rural economy while strengthening entrepreneurs at grass-roots level, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
If the economy is to grow,it is pivotal that businesses at grass-roots be strengthened while developing public and private sector business ventures, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier was addressing the gathering at the at the Asian Credit Union Forum 2017 hosted by The SANASA Federation of Sri Lanka at the Galadari Hotel,Colombo on the theme Building Together to Create Value for People and Communities.
He said that public and private banks as well as lending institutions like Sanasa must come forward to provide micro finance by providing an uplift to businessman at grass-roots level.But,unfortunately,the funds received by business ventures at grass-roots level are much less when compared to funds received by major business ventures.Therefore,the next budget will have a proposal to channel more funds to business ventures at grass-roots level, the Prime Minister said. Credit facilities providing at grass-roots level by private banks are insufficient when considering service provided by state banks and several microfinance providers such as Sanasa, the Prime Minister said.
We must also create a very strong fiscal foundation to strengthen the existing business ventures while facilitating the commencement for the new businesses,the Prime Minister added.
The Premier further said there had been growing demand for assistance from emerging entrepreneurs at village level and the recently launched Swashakthi loan scheme will support their new business ideas.

Sumanthiran congratulates Govt. for introducing bill
The Bill before Parliament is a very important bill that introduces the proportion of 30% of women candidates who have to be nominated in the nomination paper submitted by any political party or an independent group when they contest a Provincial Council Election. said TNA  MP M. A. Sumanthiran in Parliament yesterday.
This is a very important issue that we have been talking about and when a Bill is debated in the House, any member, under Standing Orders could move committee stage amendments provided notice is given before 12 noon, he added.
In response to the objections of the Joint Opposition, he said it is not necessary for the government to do it. Any member including himself, could move amendments at committee stage.
Hence that is not a matter that could be reasonably taken up before an oversight committee. Nevertheless, we are now discussing an important principle of womens representation and this Bill is very progressive in that, it suggests not less than 30% for women in the nomination papers. Although you nominate 30%, on a nomination paper, their representation is not ensured because it is a way people vote. So 30% on the nomination paper could never ensure even 10% of representation by women.
Therefore he express pleasure that there is before the House, notice by the government committee stage amendment, which would ensure that at least 25% of women who would actually sit in the provincial council when the provincial council is constituted. We passed into law an amendment to the Local Authorities Act just two weeks ago in which there was a scheme that was brought in whereby 10% of womens names are nominated on the lists for votes and not less than 50% of names of women are nominated on the proportional representation list which would then ensure that at least 25% of women could actually sit in the council that is constituted, he added.
He congratulated the government for introducing this Bill which goes beyond and ensures the objective of this Act which would ensure womens representation. He said the MPs of the Opposition who were obstructing his speech were obviously against womens representation. He said it was against more than 50% of the population of this country. More than 51% of the voter population of this country are women and all must laud the government for ensuring that at least 25% of women are being represented.
The committee stage proposal that has been placed before us confirms the number that has already been determined as a number of members for each provincial council that determination was made as soon as the provincial councils were established by a Provincial Councils Election Act and the President at that time made the order with regard to the number of members of each provincial council.
This amendment seeks to take that number and find the 60% and for 60% of that number the number of electorates are carved out so that an election promise that was made by President Maithripala Sirisena who won the election and all of those who lost the election are standing at the well of the House are trying to prevent the mandate of the people being reached, he said.

Theresa May urges UN reform and threatens funding cut

Theresa May has called on the United Nations to reform as she singled out North Korea, Russia, Syria and Myanmar for criticism in a wide-ranging speech. British Prime Minister May told the UN General Assembly in New York the organisation must change in order to "meet the challenges of the 21st century". 
She warned Britain will make up to 30% of its 90m annual core funding for the UN's agencies conditional on their ability to show they are efficient and transparent, as the Prime Minister appeared to echo US President Donald Trump's own call for "truly bold reforms". 
May said: "Those of us who hold true to our shared values, who hold true to that desire to defend the rules and high standards that have shaped and protected the world we live in, need to strive harder than ever to show that institutions like this United Nations can work for the countries that formed them, and for the people who we represent.
" The Prime Minister sent strongly-worded messages to various states she accused of breaching UN rules. Ahead of a bilateral meeting with Trump, she chided the US for its stance on the Paris climate change agreement and offered a defence of free trade over protectionism. Watched on by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Development Secretary Priti Patel, May garnered a round of applause from the assembly as she vowed Britain "will never let anyone destroy our way of life" following recent terror attacks. 
She urged UN members to "strike the generational blow against this vile evil in our world". May also paid tribute to Pakistan's former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated 10 years ago this December and who introduced the PM to her husband Philip at Oxford University. 
Having attacked states who are "deliberately flouting for their own gain the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security", May condemned Russia for vetoing UN action against the Syrian regime's "unforgivable" use of chemical weapons on its own people. 
The Prime Minister told the UN Security Council it must be "prepared to take all necessary measures" to put pressure on North Korea ruler Kim Jong Un over his "outrageous" development of nuclear weapons. 
And May also castigated Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the Rohingya Muslim refugee crisis in the southeast Asian country, which the UN has described as ethnic cleansing. Immediately after her speech, May met with Trump as the pair prepared to discuss trade, foreign policy and security. 
Amid the possibility of a post-Brexit trade deal between their two countries, the President told May: "We will be doing a lot of trading with the UK and we look forward to it." In the wake of the botched London Underground bombing at Parsons Green, the Prime Minister had criticised the President's "unhelpful" speculation over the attempted attack. But, striking a more conciliatory tone on Wednesday, May hailed the UK-US relationship on security and defence as "the closest we have".
After the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson revealed May had "reaffirmed the UK's strong commitment" to the Iranian nuclear deal as "vitally important for regional security". Trump has cast doubt on continuing the agreement, describing it as an "embarrassment" in his own speech to the UN on Tuesday. 
The Prime Minister also lobbied the President over a US trade dispute that threatens jobs at Bombardier in Northern Ireland, the spokesperson added.

Third Space Global employs online tutors
Third Space Global builds the worlds first global teaching network of highly trained online tutors supported by cutting edge technology. Third Space Learning offers the largest network of one-on-one Math tuition in the UK. In the last four years, the company has worked with 16,000 children across 600 schools by recruiting young and intelligent Sri Lankans. The tutors undergo an intensive training programme on the newest teaching techniques and how to use Third Space technology to deliver results for children we work with.
Third Space Global, a UK owned BOI approved company, opened its new regional headquarters at Orion City, Colombo 9 recently. The company has grown to over 200 staff since it began operations in September 2015.
CEO, Third Space Global, British-born Sri Lankan Roshan Nilaweera plans to create 1000s of jobs for young Sri Lankans to engage in the global digital economy.
Whilst Third Space is a purely export company, it is also keen to support education in Sri Lanka through its innovative CSR programmes. For the past six weeks Third Space has been running a free eLearing Hub programme from their office and has welcomed 800 visits by 8-16 year olds. Unlike a school or a tuition centre, young learners receive a quick orientation and then set about managing their own learning schedules as they work with free online eLearning programmes.
TSG staff is on hand to provide a helping hand but always ensure that learners develop autonomy and independent thinking and problem solving skills, Nilaweera said.
Nilaweera who was a Math and ICT teacher who studied a MEng in Computer Science in the UK points out that creating employment and training opportunities for young Sri Lankans through this initiative will contribute to Sri Lankas economic development.
Third Space Global plans to provide a free toolkit so this eLearning Programme model can be replicated by other companies opening their offices to learners nationwide.
The company also plans to launch free teaching and learning workshops next summer to support teacher training across the nation. They are already in discussion with potential partners but welcome others interested in partnering with them on this venture. Nilaweera was joined by, the Founder and CEO of Third Space Learning the London based parent company, Tom Hooper for the opening.

Those Tamarind times
This is an interesting read. It is, to some degree, a saga of colonial Ceylons minuscule ethnic group, descendants of English fathers [whose name they proudly carried] and native mothers,and preferred to call themselves Eurasians to distinguish themselves from the Burghers  the other English speaking group of centuries old European origin.
The novelists chronology is unusual and interesting. The first section, located in 1967, describes the trials and minor triumphs of the Eurasian Gilmour family settling down in their oft-dreamt English-speaking land, in Canadas Toronto. The second, chronologically earlier section, describes the life the Gilmours led in Ceylon from the halcyon times of 1947 to the violence and turmoil of the 1980s.
Wallowed in nostalgia
The Toronto period is an intresting pastiche of the senior, former tea-planter ,Gilmours family and their [ inevitably] multi-coloured children. Interestingly, their mixed-up lives are narrated by the white Welsh wife of Aidan, the dark coloured son. This gives an air of sympathetic objectivity to the narrative.
While senior Gilmour wallows in nostalgia for his periya dorai days as a planter, BBC newscasts and tattered Union Jack , the younger generation has plunged into an ethnic pool, not available back in Ceylon. Fiona has married a pukkah Prussian in lederhosen , whom she divorces to the agony of her Catholic parents,while Lally has married another German of a lesser breed. Scottie, the whitest and, as such, most favoured son, is happily slipping into WASP society. Their Sinhalese mother runs their parental home redolent of hot and spicy curries. It is quite clear that this mix and match group , and their , inevitably,multi coloured offspring will not hang together much longer.
The story now slides into a rather, labored, narrative seeking to illustrate the multi-etnicity of Canadas immigrant-rich society. We are introduced to coloured Jamaican schoolkids, Chinese neighbours, Pakistan shopkeepers and Ceylon Tamil refugees . All this confuses old Gilmour yet stuck in the mindset of a colonial pukka sahib  a long lost breed.
The second section, beginning in Ceylon in 1947, a year before Independence, describes the charmed life that the Gilmours and fellow planters  largely British, Eurasian and Burgher- led on their isolated estates. This life that he once led is the albatross that Gilmour carried into mulii-ethnic Canada devoid (almost) of class distinction. Tamil coolies, Muslim shopkeepers and Sinhala peasants play only a marginal role in this life.
Rising chauvinism
All this changed with Independence when politicians assumed the topmost position in administration and society. The author goes on to give a Gilmour-tinted version of Ceylons politics, rising chauvinism, riots and civil war  which led the family to flee the land of their birth, to which they never felt really emotionally attached and seek their fortune in an English speaking land of whites
An unusual and readable book of nostalgia, triumph and confusion.The book is published by Vijitha Yapa and is priced at Rs 1000.

Toys R Us files for bankruptcy protection in US
Toys R Us has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada as it attempts to restructure its debts.
The firm was once a dominant player in the US toy market, but has struggled against larger rivals such as Amazon.
The move casts a shadow over the future of the companys nearly 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees.However, a US bankruptcy judge approved a loan of more than $2bn to help stabilise the toy chain.
The aim is to give Toys R Us money and time to prepare for the upcoming Christmas shopping season.The firms European operations are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings and Toys R Us says it does not expect any immediate impact on its UK stores.
Toys R Uss operations in Australia, about 255 licensed stores and a joint venture partnership in Asia are also not included in the bankruptcy move.The bankruptcy filing is more evidence that traditional retailers are struggling in the US, as online retailers continue to capture market share.
Toys R Us said the majority of its stores around the world remained profitable, and would continue to operate as normal through the holiday period, which is when they do most of their business.
But the company is also looking to online sales to secure its future, with recently launched web stores for its products.
GlobalData Retail estimates that in 2016 about 13.7% of all toy sales were made online, up from 6.5% five years ago.
The past decade has seen a dramatic change in the domestic toy market with new channels, increased competition, and new technology all having a deleterious impact on the sector and traditional toy stores. Unfortunately, Toys R Us has not responded effectively to these challenges, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. (BBC)

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, (PUCSL) the electricity sector regulator their recent report  SRI LANKAS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY 2020 AND BEYOND says that the proposed plant both thermal and renewable additions in Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) 2018-37 should be conducted according to the CEB implementation plans presented at the Sub-Committee on Power and Renewable Energy meeting held on August 10, 2017.
Transmission system should be timely expanded according to the new plant additions expected the report says.
Continuous fuel supply to all thermal plants should be ensured throughout the period.
Even with recommended capacity additions, timely measures should be taken to avoid energy deficits that are likely to occur in the first half of 2018 and also in March and August in 2019 and March 2020, under dry conditions.
The report also says that the base demand forecast for 2016 has steadily decreased since 2006. The actual demand of 2016 had been 14,301 GWh, while the forecast demand for 2016 in 2006 is 19,067 GWh.
Percentage wise the figure indicates a 33% of over-forecast in 2006, 13% over-forecast in 2011, and 6% under-forecast in 2015, for the actual demand of 2016.
Actual contribution from oil based generation in 2016 is 4,529 GWh, which is 6 times the contribution from oil based generation for 2016 envisaged in 2006.

Travel with a cause
The Pimp My Tuk-Tuk Charity (PMTT) ride began on Friday September 15, at 10 am starting from Colombo and will travel across Sri Lanka before returning to Colombo on September 22. The PMTT charity ride which combines tourism with charity is the adventure of a lifetime and also makes a difference in the world. Fifty four riders in 27 tuk tuks committed themselves to eight days of fun and travelling across beautiful Sri Lanka.
The official tour started off in Colombo and will travel across Sigiriya and Mihintale to Trincomalee before travelling down to the East Coast and proceeding via Unawatuna to Colombo (with a special stop at the Foundation of Goodness (FoG) MCC Centre of Excellence in Seenigama, Galle.
Along the way the riders will stop at five destinations to work with the local communities, conducting humanitarian and community development activities including visiting the three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Plants (RO Plants) built by the group in 2015, 2016 and 2017. They will also be stopping at the Methsawa Special Needs Home in Moneragala, The Foundation of Goodness (FoG) Village Empowerment Centre in Batticoloa and the FoG MCC Centre of Excellence and Sports Academy in Seenigama.
Organized by the Pimp my Tuk Tuk Team, Singapore in partnership with the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, funds raised by this endeavour will be donated to selected charitable and development projects. Falling in love with the country along the way, the group is also to return to Sri Lanka this year with a bigger group.
What started off as Nick Sutcliff pondering what I want to do for my 50th birthday back in 2013 ended up as a giant project that could become one of the most iconic events in the world. In 2015 earlier there were 40 riders, but this year there are 54 riders. The principal sponsor this year is Accelerasia.
The project is initiated by three people, namely, Candiah Giritharan, Alex Longman and Michael Phelps, who had a vision to start one of the most enterprising projects to help rural folk. The idea was to travel around different countries in tuk tuks. In 2015 they built a water purification plant and through 2016-2017 they have built two more water purification plants and a solar energy project to serve 70 homes. The solar energy project will be provided to a village that has no proper road access. Bicycles have also been provided to students in North and East- for the students to travel to schools, and the villagers to solve their transport problem.
With the FoG we found that every dollar goes to what we have given it for. You will observe this if you visit the FoG Centre, and you will see for yourselves the immense service that is provided, said Alex.
Kushil Gunasekera, Founder of the organization, (Foundation of Goodness), which began in 1999 to bridge the gap between the rural and urban populations speaking at the function, said that this project has gone from strength to strength. Gratitude is the best attitude and kindness multiplies, he said. The project of Pimp-my Tuk Tuk is one of the best projects that we take on annually or biannually and this was started by the original three, Alex, Giri and Michael.
This is one of the projects that really touch the heart, said Media Coordinator for FOG, Swanthri Jayawardene.
There is a village where there is no electricity on a mountain, where the inhabitants live a very hard life. I think that it is an amazing task and you will find that this is something remarkable. The Pimp my Tuk Tuk Team travels across the country in their tuk-tuks and raise money for worthy causes. We have provided electricity to a remote village that doesnt have electricity and the bikes for those who do not have any transport and water purification plants to give clean drinking water. I hope that you will come back in 2019 and this could not have been accomplished with out help of so many we are thankful to like Accelerasia our principal sponsor. Every one of you has done so muck for this walk, Jayawardene said.

Voters at sixes and sevens
Finally, it is official: it was announced on Tuesday that the Supreme Court had determined that some clauses of the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution were deemed inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore required approval by a two thirds majority in Parliament as well as a referendum.
The extremely politically significant announcement, already much speculated upon by the media, was made by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on Tuesday in Parliament. It was significant because the proposed amendment included provisions to hold elections for all provincial councils on the same day- and thereby would have provided an opportunity for the government to defer polls that are due shortly.
Had the proposed 20th Amendment been approved by the Supreme Court, it would have included a transient provision that empowered Parliament to dissolve all provincial councils on a specified date. Such a date was not to be later than the expiration of the term of the provincial council that was the last to be elected. Therefore, it would have been possible to defer provincial polls for quite some time.
Now, however, that is not possible. This is because even if the government was able to muster a two thirds majority in Parliament, it would not pursue a referendum on the matter.
As a result, elections to at least three provincial councils are imminent. The Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North Central Provincial Councils fall vacant on September 26, September 30 and October 1 respectively.
Local Government elections
It must be noted that Local Government elections are already overdue. However, they will not be held this year, former Elections Commissioner and now Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya has announced.
The elections cannot be held in December this year because of the Ordinary Level examination. The Commissioner of Examinations has requested not to hold elections on the available date of December 9, 2017. It is not possible to hold elections at the end of the year because state institutions carry out their audits at that time.
The only other available date would be mid-January but polls cannot be held then because of Thai Pongal. Therefore the next available date would be January 20 next year, Deshapriya explained.
Deshapriya also said that the Elections Commission would issue notice declaring elections to the Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North Central Provincial Councils on October 2, 2017 if the proposed 20th Amendment is not passed by Parliament.
However, he could only speculate on the date of elections for these councils. If the election is declared in October it has to be held in December 6 this year. However the views of the Commissioner of Examinations will have to be sought as the Ordinary Level exam will also be held around that time, he said.
Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe declared that all polls would be best held next year, because of the Ordinary Level examination and the upcoming Budget. Former President and now Kurunegala District parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa in a rare interjection then asked the Prime Minister when provincial polls would be held.
Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Ordinary Level examination would create problems for any election in December and stated that this could be decided in consultations between political parties and the Elections Commission.
Rajapaksa loyalists
There is so much interest in provincial polls because all provincial councils with the exception of the Northern Provincial Council are presently controlled by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
That is because, during the Rajapaksa years, Provincial Council elections were staggered and held, a few councils at a time, so the incumbent government could gain maximum political advantage. It also meant that the vast majority of sitting UPFA members in these councils were ardent Rajapaksa loyalists.
The political landscape has seen a sea change since then. The United National Party (UNP) partly holds the reins of government. The leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), the dominant partner in the UPFA is now with President Maithripala Sirisena and Rajapaksa now sits in the Opposition.
There is much interest in the fact that provincial elections would pit the two major partners of the National Unity Government, the UNP and the SLFP, against each other- and whether they would survive such a contest. However, it must be noted that have already had such a duel in a far more contentious poll- the August 2015 general election- and emerged relatively unscathed.
What would be more interesting is the contest within the SLFP. At the August 2015 general election, although there was an obvious tug-of-war between the mainstream SLFP led by President Sirisena and the dissident faction loyal to Mahinda Rajapaksa, the party still contested as one entity.
Instrumental in that exercise were general secretaries of the UPFA and SLFP, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
It was an unenviable task for Premajayantha and Yapa, who were appointed to their posts by Rajapaksa. It was well known that President Sirisena was unhappy with the fact that the UPFA nomination lists accommodated many Rajapaksa loyalists. That is why, after the election, he purged the SLFP National List of Rajapaksa loyalists and appointed his nominees to Parliament. Soon after the election, Premajayantha and Yapa were also replaced by Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake.
There were indeed attempts being made by several individuals in the SLFP to try and again forge a common front for the Provincial and Local Government elections. These moves appear to have yielded no results and the sacking of Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando is evidence of that.
Fernando had been publicly critical of the government and stated that he would vote against the government on the proposed 20th Amendment. It was also known that he was in discussions with the Joint Opposition (JO) group; hence his sacking by President Sirisena.
Fernandos cross-over
In Parliament on Tuesday, Fernando crossed over to the Opposition benches after making a special statement. In his speech, Fernando expressed his disillusionment with the government which he claimed was not keeping its promises and declared that he would fight until he brought the government down.
Previously, there had been speculation that there were many more parliamentarians who were planning to cross over from the mainstream SLFP to the opposition, but if that was the case they appear to have got cold feet. If anything, Fernandos cross-over suggests that the positions of the two factions have now hardened and any rapprochement is unlikely in the near future.
As such, this paves the way for a three way tussle- between the UNP, the mainstream SLFP and the JO faction- or a four way contest, if the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is factored in. This will matter little in the Eastern Province where the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) have considerable clout.
Nevertheless, it will be an acid test for all parties in the Sabaragamuwa and North Central provinces. The Sabaragamuwa province is considered a stronghold of the JO where stalwarts such as Pavithra Wanniarachchi have their vote base. However, if the grassroots SLFP vote is split between the mainstream party and the JO, it is the UNP which will stand to gain.
The North Central Province will also be watched closely because the Polonnaruwa district is the home base of President Sirisena while the SLFPs General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake sees the Anuradhapura district as his stronghold- and they wouldnt want to come off second best on their home turf.
What is noteworthy is also that the government is working on legislation to change the system of elections, changing it from one with total Proportional Representation (PR) to a hybrid between the PR and first-past-the-post systems on a 40: 60 ratio.
Obviously, the party which emerges as the party with the most votes will benefit more from this arrangement, but it will still ensure adequate representation for all parties.
Thus, while the 20th Amendment has now become a virtual non-starter, at least in the form it was originally envisaged, this will lead the country into a season of elections, a few provincial councils at a time, which will energise the opposition but also provide the government with a timely wake-up call.

When public sector officials are hardly recognized for their contribution to national development, particularly management of public organizations and meeting set goals, Zonta has recognized Indira Malwatte, Chairperson and Chief Executive of the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), for the Woman of Achievement award in Management for her outstanding contribution in reorganizing the EDB to meet new challenges and adopting a model of private-public sector partnership in developing and promoting exports and her 40 years' commitment in the export sector. The Zonta awards on recognizing 'Woman of Achievement' reinforces their commitment to acknowledging womens contribution to the national economy.
The Zonta Club of Colombo has actively recognized and celebrated women who have achieved outstanding success in Sri Lanka in their respective fields of work.
Incidentally Malwatte is the first woman Chairperson and Chief Executive in the 38-year history of the EDB, which is indicative of the importance the Government gives to gender equity.

The man who loves ducks: the refugee saving animals on Manus
Mansour Shoushtari is an Iranian refugee held in Australias detention system who lives by a simple philosophy that animals have the right to live life well
The man who loves ducks. This phrase describes Mansour Shoushtari with poetic resonance, this is the epithet by which he is known in Manus prison. Shoushtari is a 43-year-old man from Iran who has become a well-known personality in Manus prison. He comes across as someone full of joy and with a sensibility particular to the way children engage with the world.
He is someone whose presence in Manus prison is a paradox; that is, his very being conflicts with the prison in fundamental ways. Shoushtaris personality projects beauty, he projects tenderness, he projects kindness; his existence is in opposition to the violence of Manus prison, in opposition to the power of the prison, in opposition to the barbarity of the prison.
Four years ago Shoushtari managed to reach Christmas Island but the Australian government exiled him to Manus Island straight after, where he has been detained ever since. He has now been granted refugee status and has been waiting to be resettled in a safe country for years.
Shoushtari is an animal rights activist; a strange role to take for an imprisoned individual. He continues to support animals in the same way he once did back in Iran.
At sunset he puts the leftover food from the dining area onto a plastic dish and gives it to the crabs that live underneath the containers and tents. When I asked him why he feels obliged to feed the crabs he gave me a look that made me feel embarrassed for questioning him. He said: The crabs have been living here on this island for ages  they were here before the prison was built. However, by constructing this prison we humans have violated their territory. They have every right to eat our food.
He not only fed the crabs; for years he has also been a kind companion to the stray dogs that prowl around the outside of the prison. He has been trying his best to provide food for these abandoned and hungry dogs from behind the fences.
As a result of his actions some of the refugees and guards would complain; his activism resulted in the hungry dogs of the island gathering all around there. They claimed that Shoushtari was causing difficulties and making problems for them. But he continued to treat the dogs with affection, living by his simple philosophy that dogs also have the right to eat well.
After the supreme court of Papua New Guinea declared that Manus prison was illegal, he had the opportunity to bring one of the dogs into the prison.
He brought in the most emaciated dog and took on the duty of taking care of it in the prison. Its name is Leopard and when I asked why he named it such he answered: This dog was extremely depressed and malnourished. It was frightened of humans and when I offered food it become shy like a leopard and would take the food I gave it out of sight and eat behind the tents. From the day I witnessed that I named it Leopard, I named it that because it was so thin and frail.
And now its grown so fat, its become so cheerful, now its as healthy as can be. Its become just like an actual leopard, just like a powerful leopard.
Shoushtari smiled as he conveyed this account. I asked him about his journey across the ocean and his thoughtful response again referenced animals; in particular, he referred to his pet duck, the one he left with a friend back in Iran. I had a five-year-old duck. I had left it with a friend back in Iran to look after. Our boat had gone missing out in the ocean for five days. Just when everyone else thought we would die very soon, a feeling came over me that signalled to me that I wouldnt die. I had that feeling whenever I thought about my duck  I felt that my love and kindness toward it would help me, my feelings toward my duck would stop the boat from going under, I felt my emotional connection to it would end up saving my life.
I asked Shoushtari why he loved animals. He answered: Its love. In my opinion one does not need to give reasons for love. Love is a personal matter, love is an existential state. But in my view if a human being does not love animals they are incapable of loving human beings.
I asked him: Do you love animals more than humans He smiled once again. He responded in a humorous way: Youre asking some really tough questions today! The question you ask is similar to asking the question: do you love your father more than your mother Its an extremely tough question to answer. I love human beings and I also love animals. But I have a special affection for birds.
Shoushtari is not only popular and well-known among the refugees in the prison, the guards even acknowledge his personality. Everyone shows him respect and admires his character and dignity.
According to Shoushtari there are some guards who even call him Duck Man. Acquiring this moniker has been a cause of happiness for him because he believes it is an honourable title; especially in circumstances where those same guards call the other refugees by number.
Shoushtari has a remarkably affecting personality, he has an extremely poetic nature. So much so that I dare to ask him the following question: You love animals and you also love human beings. But do you also love [Australian immigration minister] Peter Dutton
This time he lets out a boisterous laugh and replied: My God, now this is really a tough question.
Today is a good day, so why are you asking these extremely difficult questions I know, it would be hard to believe if I admitted that I love Peter Dutton, as well. He laughed once again.
Shoushtari has plans for his future and he is determined to put those plans into practice once he is freed from Manus prison. He has a desire to work as a mechanic like he did back in Iran, and he also has hopes to read English literature. Another one of his dreams is to establish a centre for homeless animals one day; you see, he has a simple philosophy: Animals also have the right to live life well.
Getting to know Shoushtari has been a blessing and inspiration. For the short time I was in his presence I forgot about all the violence and hardship associated with this prison; my love for life increased after I spent time with him. I was reassured by the fact that there were warm people like Shoushtari in our close company. I think Ill keep these memories of him with me for years to come, memories of the man who loves ducks.

New Inland Revenue Act will address tax issues of masses
The new Inland Revenue Act hopes to address some of the many tax issues faced by the general public, private and corporate companies in Sri Lanka said, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne.
Speaking at the seminar on the new Inland Revenue Act, organized by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka yesterday, he said that the government provides tax concessions of 1.6% of GDP to investors looking to start businesses in Sri Lanka.
The State Minister also pointed out that the Northern parts of Sri Lanka are avoided by investors because of high risk complications. He advised investors to take the risk and invest in the Northern parts of the country.
Wickramaratne said that the government aims to lower the budget deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2018. He also said that the new Inland Revenue Act will bring stability to the economic sphere of Sri Lanka, while avoiding sovereign risk and improving national security.
The Minister said that Sri Lankas tax revenue had drastically dropped recently to 12% of GDP from the per capita income level of 18% of GDP.
Minister Wickramaratne said that the government is working on making an online feature where investors and members of the corporate sector can find out about the three relevant governmental departments that collect the revenue of the government.
This Inland Revenue Act will also move away from the idea and concept of tax exemptions, but it will award tax exemptions to those who actively contribute to the national economy, said the Minister. This will not only help to provide a simplified process, but would also stop revenue leakages in revenue collection.
He said government revenue has to increase because it is pivotal to maintain the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, maintenance of armed forces, to maintain law and order and to answer the basic needs of the public, such as health and education.
The Minister said the objectives of the new Inland Revenue Act is to create a simpler tax structure and to reduce the discretion that was there in the political authority.
