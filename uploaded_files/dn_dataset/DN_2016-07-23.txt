Law catches up with BCCI
Reform has been forced down the throat of the Indian cricket board (BCCI) officials. The highest court of the land did it. A former Chief Justice of India (CJI) recommended the structural and operational changes in BCCI; the current CJI was on the two-member Supreme Court bench that accepted most of those recommendations. In effect, this change comes from the highest legal authority in the country. BCCI must see the writing on the wall and accept change with grace.
Despite some very sharp and sarcastic comments by the Supreme Court judges during the course of the arguments, BCCI shut its eyes and ears and hammered one point again and again  that the court cannot encroach upon its autonomy. BCCI and its affiliated units shouted themselves hoarse, insisting that Justice Lodha Committee's recommendations to reform BCCI must not be accepted. All of them built their case on one point  that even the highest court of the country cannot touch BCCI because it is an autonomous body.
But the Supreme Court bench of TS Thakur and Justice FMI Kalifulla disdainfully disregarded this argument. They held that BCCI must be open to legal scrutiny because it discharges state functions of selecting the team that represents the country.
The judgement notes that: Neither BCCI nor anyone else has assailed the findings recorded by the Committee insofar as the deep-rooted malaise that pervades in the working of the BCCI is concerned. In plain words, the two judges pointed out that neither BCCI or the state associations protested that the findings of the Justice Lodha Committee were incorrect or unfair.
BCCI did not complain that the dubious practices and management issues raised by the Justice Lodha Committee were not factually unsupportable. Their sole defence was rather audacious, even arrogant  that the country's highest court, and the country's top judges, did not have the legal power to do something about the serious issues the Justice Lodha Committee raised. It's extraordinary that this was the best defence the best, most-expensive lawyers in the country could come with for BCCI. At one point, they argued that conflict of interest is a fact of life and must be lived with!
Defending the indefensible
But the fact is that these lawyers were having to defend the indefensible. The origin of the case lies in the 2013 spot-fixing and betting scandal in the IPL, which showed how conflict of interest situations lead to dubious and corrupt decision-making. Remember N Srinivasan, the sticky and tenacious man who just could not be embarrassed by the worst scandals around him He was the BCCI president and owner of IPL team Chennai Super Kings. Remember his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, who was arrested for his involvement in that IPL scandal in 2013 The BCCI's response to the scandal was shocking and quite indefensible. Within BCCI, there was practically no response, actually: No official raised a voice against Srinivasan. The officials included politicians such as Farooq Abdullah, Narendra Modi, Arun Jaitley, Rajeev Shukla, Anurag Thakur, to name just a few.
BCCI set up a committee of two retired judges who, after a brief investigation, found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Gurunath Meiyappan and Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra in the betting and spot-fixing scandal. Later, during the course of the hearing, the honourable Supreme Court judges wondered whether BCCI had used its influence to get a favourable verdict.
Eventually, the Supreme Court blew away BCCI's contention that it is a private society not open to judicial scrutiny. It ruled that because it discharges public functions, BCCI is open to scrutiny by the Courts in exercise of their powers under Article 226 of the Constitution. This was a watershed moment for Indian cricket and, indeed, Indian sport.
Lure of power
Change is very difficult to accept if it involves being yourself rendered superfluous. It is difficult to accept if your powers are taken away from you and handed over to a fresher set of people. It would be particularly difficult to individuals who're used to absolute, unquestioned and unquestionable powers. The officials of Indian cricket are little tyrants. In their home state association, they runs their fiefdom  cricket stadium, club-house, recreational facilities, sports infrastructure, et al  as per their whims. Who can become a member, and who can become a voter, is decided by them. Often, their friends, relatives, business associates and even personal staff become members and voters. They hand out largesse to their favourites. This includes important positions, and could include lucrative contracts for construction at the stadium. They are also in a position to offer employment to the children of friends, relatives and acquaintances in their association. They become masters of the stick-and-carrot policyit becomes virtually impossible to defeat them in the election. Thus we have Niranjan Shah of Saurashtara, who's been in control of his association right from 1972. Bansi Lal's family has controlled the Haryana association for three generations. Anurag Thakur has led the Himachal Pradesh association non-stop since 2000. Farooq Abdullah controlled the Jammu and Kashmir association for 35 years.
Reports from Uttar Pradesh say that all the directors of their association are above 70 years. They are Shuaib Ahmed (78), Prem Dhar Pathak (83), Madan Mohan Mishra (83), Satish Kumar Agarwal (79), and Jyoti Bajpai (80). Treasurer KN Tandon is 80. This is the reason they won't like the age cap of 70 years enforced by the Supreme Court.
Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, who has crusaded for a clean-up of the sport for a very long time, says that most of the officials can be removed only by death. That, indeed, was the case with Jagmohan Dalmiya, who held on to his position despite declining health and died as BCCI president last year. The Supreme Court has created a blueprint for good governance for BCCI. Indeed, this blueprint must be followed by every sports association in India. Ironically, change and reform has descended on BCCI only because their officials dug their heels in and simply refused to change.  THE TRIBUNE

Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic marry
After a disappointing sporting month in which one had a hand in Germany's exit from the Euros and the other crashed out in the first round of Wimbledon, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic finally experienced a perfect match.
The pair married in Venice, Italy, in a lavish ceremony spread out over two days.
On Tuesday, the footballer tied the knot with the tennis star in a legal ceremony in Venice's City Hall -- so adding to the list of sporting power couples.
A day later, the duo held a religious service at the centuries-old Misericordia Church in one of the world's most beautiful cities.
Nicknamed Schweini, the 31-year-old Schweinsteiger is captain of world champions Germany, although his handball in the semifinals of the 2016 European Championship was crucial in France's 2-0 win.
The World Cup aside, his trophy cabinet includes eight German league titles, one Champions League and, among others, a Club World Cup.
He currently plays for Manchester United.
Ivanovic, 28, is a former world No. 1 in tennis, who won the French Open in 2008.
That was her biggest achievement in a career where she has earned over $15 million.
She is currently ranked 25 and blamed a wrist injury for her first round exit at Wimbledon last month.
Ivanovic previously dated several sporting stars -- Australian golfer Adam Scott, Serbian basketballer Ivan Paunic and fellow tennis pro Fernando Verdasco of Spain -- before getting together with Schweinsteiger in 2014.
At a time when many golfers have pulled out of the Olympic Games in Brazil because of fears about the Zika virus, the newly-married Ivanovic has no such qualms, describing going to Rio 2016 as her big dream.
Sport's most famous power couple is arguably former tennis players Andre Agassi, of the United States, and Germany's Steffi Graf.
They share 30 grand slam titles, 22 of which were won by Graf. \

Can Pocket Rocket beat Bolt to Olympic history
If she beats Usain Bolt to sprinting history, she will do it with her own porridge.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is in a Jamaican supermarket when CNN reaches her. Shes stocking up for her pre-Games camp in Italy. A full third of her baggage on the flight will be food from home.
I have to make sure Im not having too much pizza, the 29-year-old winner of two straight Olympic womens 100 meters titles says. I carry stuff from here with me -- my granola bars, my porridge, my milk, my sausages, my crackers, my chips, everything.
That way, I know what Im eating.
Maybe its the suspicious mind of a woman caught out once before, in 2010, when a banned (but not performance-enhancing) painkiller turned up in her urine sample and earned her a six-month suspension. But then, maybe she just really likes the food she makes in Jamaica.
The porridge sachets are coming to Rio, too -- where they could form the ultimate breakfast of champions, if Fraser-Pryce wins a third consecutive 100m gold.
She would be the first Olympian to do so, with her final the night before compatriot Usain Bolt hopes to complete the same feat. Make the final, cross that line in first place, and she will beat her illustrious Jamaica teammate to at least one spot in the history books.
At least Id have something over him! she giggles.
At precisely five-foot tall, Fraser-Pryce is so firmly, literally, installed within the shadow of six-foot five-inch Bolt that journalists cannot get away from the comparison.
The winner of the past two mens 100m Olympic gold medals is a superstar, one of the worlds most recognizable athletes. He makes a handful of appearances each year and retains the aura of the untouchable, even when the data suggests he is by no means certain to win again in Rio. Fraser-Pryce, who also triumphed in Beijing 2008 and London 2012, matches Bolt medal for medal over 100m at the Olympics and world championships. Somehow, that isnt common knowledge.
Im over it, she sighs. Usain is a tremendous athlete. Hes the greatest athlete the world has seen -- he has that, nobody can take that away from him. But female athletes have also done great things.
Fraser-Pryce wants more recognition for her genders sporting achievements, not just hers.
In the meantime, beating Bolt to a sprint treble will do. Weve never spoken about it, but of course Id like to to have that, she chuckles. So I can tell him I have something he wants.
Scoring that little victory over Jamaicas sprinting giant will require conquering a troublesome toe injury.
Fraser-Pryce is not used to dealing with this. In a decade of elite running, she has barely been injured: A small knee problem in 2014 and now this, more serious issue with a toe on her left foot.
On a pain scale of one to 10, about an eight, she frankly admits. For anyone prepared to dismiss a toe injury as minor, eight out of 10 is a pretty high score coming from an Olympian.
Theres restriction in the movement of my toe, its inflamed, and it causes a lot of pain. Right now I have a toe straightener on, and I also cushion my toe whenever Im training, she says.
The pain is there, but to be honest Im working through it. I guess thats what success is, when you want something more than anything else. Again, she deflects the issue with a joke: As long as I know its not going to break, Im fine.
But the toe is already causing considerable disruption to a season Fraser-Pryce has described as trying. At Jamaicas Olympic trials, she dropped out of contention in the 200m and will now contest only the 100m in Rio. Mentally, I was nervous, you know I was worried, she admits of this months trials, where she was runner-up in the 100m. The only way I get to Rio to defend my title is coming through the national championships, and our national championship is tough. I just tried to make sure I did enough in each round. I knew, because of how bad the toe was, that the 200m was a big risk, but I havent been racing much and I needed that race. I needed to know where and what I could do. So I ran the first round more as an assessment than anything else, to see how the pain felt coming around the corner.
And the pain was bad. So I decided, you know what Im just doing the 100m.
Im disappointed. Last year, my coach decided to have me not do the 200m so I could focus on the 100m. This year I was going to go back to focusing on both, and then this happened. But at the same time, Im so grateful to be able to do something rather than nothing.
Fraser-Pryce is always doing something. She already has a cafe at her home track, alongside a local hair salon -- and hair is a fixation of hers.
At last years world championship final in Beijing, Fraser-Pryce wore a vibrant ensemble of yellow flowers and green braids as she beat Dutch rival Dafne Schippers by 0.05 seconds.
For Rio, she is undecided -- but blue is a candidate. CNN

Rio police tell tourists they wont be able to protect them
RIO DE JANEIRO - The Olympic Games are less than a fortnight away -- and Rio de Janeiro is in crisis.
Violence is on the rise, and police officers are at loggerheads with the Rio state government after claiming theyve not been paid for months.
The message from police to tourists is clear: We wont be able to protect you.
The states police officers vented their anger Monday with a sign saying, Welcome to Hell, outside Rios main airport. Police and firefighters dont get paid, whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe, the sign said.
And its not just those coming from abroad who may be in danger -- locals are losing patience, too.
Thats the harsh reality in the favelas around Rio, according to one resident, as the city gears up to host the 2016 Olympics amid increasing concerns over police brutality and the officers ability, and desire, to keep people safe.
It seems like there is an order (from authorities) to put fear in people so they stay calm, so they dont cause trouble in the city because the foreigners cant see that the city is chaotic, Higor da Silva, a resident of the Mare favela, told CNN.
They (state police) dont care if there is a child in the middle -- they shoot their target.
State security officials told CNN they have taken measures over the years to expel officers who use excessive force and say they have decreased the use of heavy weapons.
Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes told CNN the state was doing a terrible job in regard to security in the lead-up to the games, set to kick off August 5.
Its completely failing at its work of policing and taking care of people, Paes said. But on Tuesday, Brazilian officials put on a united front to assure the world that Rio was up to the task of hosting sports greatest showpiece.
We are ready to start the games, Carlos Arthur Nuzman, president of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee, said at a press conference in the city, adding that the event could start today.
They will be a maximum success in this beautiful city of ours, he said.
Speaking alongside him, Paes reiterated the announcement but cautioned that visitors should not expect to find a city that operates like Chicago, New York or London.
Our development stage is different, he said. The government later tweeted that every venue for the quadrennial event is ready, and the primary press center was open.
It said there will be 85,000 security personnel at Olympic sites and important places like the citys airports.
Bailout
Rio de Janeiro state, which controls the regions military police force, issued an executive order requesting emergency funds from the federal government to pay officers their bonuses and overtime.
The 2.9 billion-real bailout (roughly $850 million) was made available last week after acting Gov.Francisco Dornelles said the games should be a big failure without the funds. Its believed that the back pay will be distributed this week.
We are numbers, nothing more, one officer, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.
You encounter a drug trafficker armed with lots of ammunition and you only have only 20 bullets. It is absurd.
Two officers, interviewed by CNN on condition of anonymity, said the citys scant resources are used to patrol tourist hotspots such as Copacabana instead of favelas where criminal gangs run the streets.
They have risked speaking out because they say theyve watched fellow officers die to preserve Rios image -- not to protect its people. We have a very common saying here in Brazil -- for the English to see, one of the officers said. I believe that the politicians here are doing everything for the English to see.
Death rate rising
According to figures from Brazils Public Security Institute published last week and distributed by Amnesty International on-duty officers killed 40 people in May alone -- police killed 17 people during the same period last year. Last year, police killed at least 307 people in Rio -- a figure that accounts for one in every five homicides there, according to Amnesty.
According to the figures, police killed 645 people in the state in 2015, and many of the victims were young, black men from favelas and poor communities. Brazil has one of the highest levels of homicides in the world, with around 42,000 people killed with guns every year, Atila Roque, Amnesty Internationals Brazil executive director, said in a statement.
Those living in the most marginalized areas of the city are disproportionally affected by this crisis.
When Brazil hosted the World Cup in 2014, police in Rio de Janeiro state killed 580 people, a 40% increase from the previous year, the rights group said.
Problems mounting
Brazil has been plagued by problems leading up to the Olympics.
In May, the Brazilian Senate voted to begin impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff is accused of breaking budget laws, but she maintains she did the same things previous Brazilian leaders have done.

Malaysias Lee on quest for badminton redemption
KUALA LUMPUR, THURSDAY: Malaysian badminton superstar Lee Chong Wei takes a final shot at Olympic gold in Rio, desperate to erase past disappointments and a doping episode that blotted one of the great sporting names.
Malaysia has never won Olympic gold in any sport, and the mild-mannered Lee has struggled with the pressure of his nations hopes, suffering crushing final defeats to Chinas Lin Dan in Beijing and London.
But Rio finds the 33-year-old back in a familiar position -- world number one, looking strong, and an Olympic favourite -- and he has made clear his obsession to bring home gold this time.
This is not only my dream but also the dream of all Malaysians, Lee, 33, said this month.
I have to make the best preparation since this is my last Olympic Games.
Lees trophy case is packed with virtually every piece of badminton silverware available, but no Olympic or world championship, failures that haunt him.
In particular, those heart-breaking losses to long-time nemesis -- and close friend -- Lin of China in the thrilling 2008 and 2012 Olympic singles finals clearly wounded Lee, and after London many began writing his career epitaph.
Things would get worse.
Gritty comeback
Lee, then world number one, tested positive for a forbidden anti-inflammatory drug at the 2014 world championships.
Facing a two-year ban, he fretted bleakly that his Olympic dream was dead.
But badminton authorities eventually accepted his explanation that he took the drug inadvertently amid stem-cell treatment for a thigh injury.
The episode sidelined him for eight months, however, and he slid down the world rankings.
But Lee launched a gritty comeback after returning to the court a year ago, recapturing his dominant form -- and last month the worlds top rank.
Rio now raises the tantalising prospect of another titanic clash with Lin, regarded by some as badmintons greatest-ever player.
The rivalry is accentuated by their opposite personas: Lee, methodical and unassuming; Lin, fiery and charismatic.
Their epic Olympic final battles have been credited with fuelling wider interest in the sport.
Also in the Rio mix is formidable Chinese world number two Chen Long -- whom Lee recently overtook on the world rankings. Rizal Hashim, a sports commentator with leading Malaysian television network Astro, said Rio will either confirm Lees legacy as an Olympic also-ran -- or as a badminton giant.

Nalaka Weerakkody to introduce rugby kicking drills
Former Kingswood College, Kandy Youth SC, CR and FC, Kandy S.C. and Sri Lanka ruggerite, who was excellent in kicking goals and to touch Nalaka Weerakkody is to help ruggerites in developing their kicking drills and to improve their accuracy, technique, tactical awareness and skills so that they will know the right kick to execute it correctly.
I am sure through these kicking drills players will develop the ability and technique to complete the drop (kicking out of hand), box, kick-off, chip, and grubber, long, high, short, and low kicks. Each kick has a purpose, said Weerakkody.
He will use these drills to coach young players on how to start play, gain ground - so that they (chaser) can get past the defensive line without being tackled - and to convert a try or penalty.
Good sportsmanship is the key to any side succeeding, both on and off the pitch. Nalaka was the St. Anthonys College kicking coach this season and helped their fly half to score over 100 points in goal kicking - 13 conversions, 23 penalties and 3 drop goals.
Antonian 2005/6 cricketers to introduce new tournament
The 2005-06 Past Cricketers Association of St. Anthonys College Kandy will inaugurate Antonian Premier League 2016, a soft ball six-a-side tournament with teams representing their respective batches. They have planned to have this event on 14 August at St Anthonys College grounds. The event would mark the beginning of an annual event which they hope to incorporate into the rich Antonian culture. The event would also form a platform for young and old boys to reunite for a day of reminisce. To encourage participants they have also ensured that the event be family friendly with activities for kids and family. The organisers will be inviting their old boys to join and support the maroon, light and dark blue for a day to be remembered. There will be the Champions Trophy, Runners-up Trophy, MVP Trophy, Best Batsman Trophy, Best Bowler Trophy and Best Fielder Trophy. More details can be obtained from Shameer Munas (0773754595), Harshana Medagoda (0773085631), Salinda Samarakoon (0769802953), and Bilal Mansoor 0775955366).
Gateway students improve in sports
The Kandy Branch of Gateway International School has once again proved their dominance over other international schools in sports. They have shown their improvement in sports by winning the international inter-schools under 19 Girls Tennis Championship. Taking part for the first time they gave a superb display in tennis to overcome schools like International School 2-1, Gateway College Colombo 3-0 and Asian International School 3-0. The champion tennis team was led by Anuki Palendagam, a stylish player with a good knowledge of the game. Other members were Oshini Herath, Tharusdhani Padalgama and Sethmi Sunaweera. All their sporting activities are under Major Buwaneka Kohana. Gateway are under the watchful eyes of famous Antonian sportsman Asoka Herath who has years of experience and recognizes students for their achievements in the sporting field as the school moves forward towards sports and academic excellence. For all this they have got an excellent principal in Gladwin Canagasabey, a knowledgeable person in the sporting field.
Edmund Mahendra new SSP Kandy
Former Richmond College and Police footballer, cricketer and athlete U.A. Edmund Mahendra took over the SSP division from Gamini Ellepola who was promoted as DIG. Mahendra, a keen follower of sports helped (when he was HQI) to develop the Police ground. At present sporting policemen of the caliber of Senior DIG S.A.D.S Gunawardene, now SSP Division, Mahendra, Nalanda College sportsman Nipuna Dehigama who is HQI together with the rest are giving the best possible support to sports.
Football is poor in Kandy
Football is known to be the poor mans game, but today the game has become poor in Kandy. Literally it means that the standards have dropped to such low levels that even club games are not conducted and played the way it should be. Referees are being attacked by players. Gone are the days when the FFSL supported the players, they even gave them a proper diet so that they can sustain their nutrition. Even with those poor facilities the standard of football in the early days was high. In the good old days FFSL maintained an unblemished record and saw that all football bodies carried out their responsibilities in a clean, just and enthusiastic manner. The Sports Minister should appoint an Interim Committee to the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) to clear up this mess.
Lawn Tennis
Lawn tennis, one-time was a very popular sport in Kandy, played exclusively by the executive class of people. But very sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity without any back up, nor any attempt to revive it. Tennis should be granted the status of cricket and rugby, where the common folks, whose love sports can contribute its resources to make tennis a popular game in Kandy. The controlling body SLTA does it, but the district association is not interested. They only help the sport only if their siblings are involved. Today tennis is played only for money, only classes no tournaments. It is the Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club and University of Peradeniya, who gave the best support to the sport. Trinity and Hillwood were also involved in big way. Former Municipal Commissioner and All Ceylon cricketer, the late D.S. de Silva gave his utmost support for the sport. Now the Lawn Club is no more while the Garden Club only conducts classes. During the time of DIG Bodi Liyanage, he introduced tennis to the police and came out with a super court at Asgiriya. Today it is neglected.
3 Trinitians, 1 Antonian in U18 rugby team
Three Trinitians Anuka Boyagoda, Dilukshan Dange and Avishka Shiek and one Antonian Dinuk Amerasinghe are in the 12 member squad of the Sri Lanka under 18 rugby team. The team is in Hong Kong to take part in the 2nd Asian Sevens championship.
Former Test cricketers invited for first Test
Kandy District Cricket Association headed by Janaka Pathirana who are in charge of the first Test between Sri Lanka and Australia on behalf of Sri Lanka Cricket have invited all past Test cricketers produced by Kandy to bring in their family for all five days. They have also issued 500 tickets for young up and coming schoolboy cricketers to witness the match. This was a trend of the KDCA in the good old days,
Kandy Police celebrates 150 years in sports
To mark the 150th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Police force in the Central Province a series of sports events were held with great success with foreigners too in attendance. The sports loving Police officers of the division gave a big hand to make it a memorable event. In the cricket final played at the Police Asgiriya grounds Nuwara Eliya emerged champions by beating Gampola. In the volleyball womens event Hatton division became champions with Gampola taking second spot. In mens volleyball Kandy won the championship and Nuwara Eliya took second place. In football Nuwara Eliya edged out Kandy by 2 goals to 1. The days programme ended with a grand awards ceremony in which the DIG S.A.D.S Gunawardene and the rest of the senior Police officers were involved in the presentation.

Kohli puts India in charge with 12th Test century
ANTIGUA ET BERMUDE, THURSDAY: Virat Kohli stroked a commanding 12th Test century to put India in control at 302 for four when stumps were drawn on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies on Thursday.
Having chosen to bat first on winning the toss, the Indian captain led the way with a thoroughly authoritative innings of 143 not out, decorated with 16 fours that has so far occupied just over four hours off 197 deliveries.
He put on 105 for the third wicket with Shikhar Dhawan, the opening batsman missing out on a three-figure innings of his own when he fell lbw for 84 sweeping at Devendra Bishoo on the stroke of the tea interval.
Bishoo's mixture of leg-breaks and googlies were the greatest threat to the Indians throughout a long, tiring day for the home side at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium although his three wickets were more the result of poor shot-selection by Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane.
He ended the day with figures of three for 108 off 27 overs. Surprisingly he was not called upon by his captain, Jason Holder, in the first period of play, when even debutant batsman and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase delivered eight overs.
However his dismissal of Pujara via a horribly miscued pull in the first over after lunch ushered in Kohli who proceeded to transform the rest of the day into a testament to his ever-increasing stature as a batsman of the highest class.
In stark contrast, the usually destructive Dhawan was content to play the supporting role.
Famed for his adventurous attacking instincts in all forms of the game, the left-handed opening batsman displayed admirable restraint in the early exchanges against bowling that lacked any real pace and potency, with the notable exception of Shannon Gabriel, who caused alarms for the Indian opening pair with his raw pace.
I enjoyed my knock. I just had to take the punches (early on) and I was happy I had the persistence to keep going, said Dhawan. It's not every time I'll keep getting boundaries from the start. I had to grind it out.
Gabriel removed Murali Vijay for just seven after half-an-hours play when the right-hander fended at a lifting delivery for Kraigg Brathwaite to take the catch at the second attempt at second slip.
Pujara looked untroubled on joining Dhawan at the crease with the pair putting on 60 before the middle-order players error of judgement at the start of the afternoon session.
Having opted to go into the match without uncapped fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins, the only other pace threat available in the West Indies pre-match squad of 13, it was left to Holder, fellow medium-pacer Carlos Brathwaite and Chase to do the bulk of the early work in support of Gabriel before Bishoo got into his work after lunch.
Nevertheless, those bowling resources were made to appear decidedly inadequate on a placid pitch and against batsmen prepared to keep the scoreboard ticking over.
Early in his innings, Kohli passed 3,000 career Test runs and later on reached 1,000 as Test captain. But the most important figures were the partnerships built around his excellent innings.
His century stand with Dhawan was followed by a further 60 put together with Rahane followed by a fifth-wicket stand so far worth 66 with Ravichandran Ashwin.
With two Test centuries against the West Indies on the Indian sub-continent, the lower-order player will resume on the second morning unbeaten on 22 alongside Kohli.
While the West Indies have packed their side with batting, India opted for a bowling attack comprising three pacers and two spinners, omitting Ravindra Jadeja in preference for Amit Mishra to work in tandem with Ashwin as specialist slow bowlers.
West Indies have not defeated India in Test cricket for 14 years since the end of the 2002 series in the Caribbean and are the decided underdogs for the first meeting with these opponents on home soil for five years.

Johnson tied for early lead at Canadian Open
MONTREAL, FRIDAY: Reigning US Open champion Dustin Johnson fired a six-under par 66 Thursday to seize a share of the lead at the PGA Tour's Canadian Open at Glen Abbey Golf Club.
The 11-time PGA winner made seven birdies, an eagle, a bogey and a double bogey to move into a tie atop the leaderboard with Luke List at the Toronto-area course.
It's firm and fast, said world number two Johnson. It's definitely tough to get the ball close to the hole. You've really got to land the ball on your numbers. With it being as windy as it was today, it was tough to do that.
Defending champion and world number one Jason Day opened with a three-under 69 and is three shots back of the leaders. He is seeking to become the first repeat winner of the Canadian Open since Jim Furyk in 2006 and 2007.
Johnson, who won the US Open last month at Oakmont, is making his fourth start in the Canadian Open. He has had mixed results in the event, withdrawing in 2008, missing the cut in 2014 and finishing tied for second in 2013.
Johnson is Canada's adopted son as he is engaged to the daughter of Canada's greatest sports hero, NHL legend Wayne Gretzky. Johnson and Paulina Gretzky have an 18-month-old son together.
List carded birdies on five of his first nine holes. He added another at the second hole en route to a bogey-free 66, matching his career-low round on the US PGA Tour.
I was very fortunate that the first five holes there wasn't much wind at all and then it kind of picked up, said List, who is coming off missed cuts in five of his past seven starts.
Canada's Jared du Toit, Chesson Hadley, Kelly Kraft and Jon Rahm are tied for third at five-under 67. Du Toit, an amateur, eagled the par-four 17th hole, then made a birdie on 18. Hadley made six birdies and one bogey. Kraft played the six-hole stretch beginning at the 13th in six-under par.
Rahm is hoping to become the first to win the Canadian Open in his debut since Chez Reavie in 2008.

IOC reveals 45 new doping failures from Beijing, London Games
The International Olympic Committee reported 45 new doping failures on Friday from the 2008 Games in Beijing and London 2012, bringing the total number of positive drug test to 98 since a retesting programme was launched..
The IOC, facing one of its worst ever doping crises that could see sporting
powerhouse Russia banned from the Rio Games, has reanalysed more than 1,200 samples, with the emphasis on past medal winners.
Reporting results from its second wave of retests, the IOC said there were 30 Provisional Adverse Analytical Findings from competitors in Beijing 2008 and 15 Adverse Analytical Findings among London 2012 Olympians. Within the Beijing group, 23 were medallists. The 30 positive results came from eight countries and four sports.
The second wave of retests from London included 138 samples. The 15 positive tests were from nine countries and two sports.
The IOC noted however that a provisional finding can be reversed on closer examination. Two provisional positives from the first wave of Beijing tests announced in May were ultimately not deemed conclusive.
The new reanalysis once again shows the commitment of the IOC in the fight against doping, Olympics president Thomas Bach said in a statement..
The IOC has said the retesting programme followed intelligence-gathering that began last year.
The IOC was not able to identify the athletes concerned, citing legal reasons.
The individuals, national Olympic committees and sports federations have been privately informed, however, the IOC added.
All athletes found to have infringed the anti-doping rules will be banned from competing (in Rio), the statement continued.
The third and fourth rounds of re-analysis will be carried out during after the Games in Brazil, which start in two weeks.
Following the first wave of retests, Russia admitted that eight of its athletes from London 2012 were implicated. AFP
