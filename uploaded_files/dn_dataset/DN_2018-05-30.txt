Access to UNHRC sessions
A status for human rights commission of Sri Lanka
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has been re-accredited with A status by Global Alliance for National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) in recognition of its efforts to promote and protect human rights, Commission Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama said.
GANHRI promotes and strengthens National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights.
GANHRIs Sub-Committee on Accreditation which met from May 14-18 in Geneva, Switzerland re-accredited A status to HRCSL after a rigorous process of review. A status means that the institution is in full compliance with the Paris Principles adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993. The review takes place every five years.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, Dr. Udagama said HRCSL had only received B status in the previous reviews in 2000, 2007 and 2009.
She pointed out that the HRCSL has been working tirelessly over the past several years to win public confidence as an independent body.
We voiced our concerns even when the matter was politically sensitive. At times, we were criticised due to this reason. We came forward for the rights of socially discriminated groups, prisoners and women. We strongly recommended the Government to establish the Office of Missing Persons (OMP). We have taken a keen interest on economic and social rights of the people, she said highlighting the performance of the Commission over the past years.
The Paris Principles set out six main criteria for NHRIs and they include having a broad mandate, based on universal human rights norms and standards, autonomy from Government, independence guaranteed by statute or Constitution, pluralism, adequate resources and adequate powers of investigation.
The institutions that receive the A status can participate fully in the international and regional work and have voting power. They are also able to participate in sessions of the UN Human Rights Council and take the floor under any agenda item, submit documentation and take up separate seating.
HRCSL Commissioner Ambika Satkunanathan in a Tweet in her account said, Grateful our hard work has been recognized and rewarded.
UNICEF SriLanka Child Protection Manager Ramiz Behbudov reacting to the Tweet said, Great news for SriLanka. This will allow UNICEF to further enhance our partnership with the HRC SL to advance child rights monitoring in the country. We thank HRCSL Commissioners for their unyielding determination, principled position and positive optimism for getting the HRC to this point.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne congratulating the HRCSL said, So proud of the Commissions remarkable work. Wish the Commission more strength, power and wisdom to keep on working for the rights of all Sri Lankans.

Chief Minister to bring offenders to book
A number of permanent graduate teaching positions vacant in the North Western Province (NWP), had been given to certain graduates who are permanent residents of the Northern Province and the Mannar district, while many graduates in the NWP still remain unemployed.
The said appointments had been made using falsified certificates issued by certain Grama Niladharies. These GNs have misled the government and certain politicians were reported to have been involved in this racket as well, NWP Provincial Council Chief Whip Amal Chintaka Mayadunne said, while addressing the recently-held monthly meeting of the PC held in Kurunegala, last week. Accordingly, Mayadunne requested NWP Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake to look into the matter immediately.
The graduates who had thus received teaching posts had arrived in the NWP as refugees, Mayadunne added.
Chief Minister Dassanayake had promised to appoint a committee to look into the matter, notifying that he had received the names of the 11 such individuals who were given the said posts.

Coal cost is Rs. 14, not Rs. 7 - PUCSL
The electricity sector regulator, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) says that the average cost of a coal unit - Rs. 14.41 - based on the official data submitted by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the approved plan of the PUCSL, reflects the current price trend in the world market.
The PUCSL recently wrote to the CEB asking the Board to forward a new power generation plan which aligns with the newest government policy on power generation mix, which the CEB management had rejected, asking that the old electricity generation plan submitted earlier be approved.
The CEB submitted the generation plan 2018-37 in May 2017 and the PUCSL amended and approved the plan in July 2017 after hosting two public consultations.
It is not ethical to approve the CEBs generation plan submitted earlier, neglecting public comments and price trends of the world market. Also, the plan has to have 50 percent of renewable energy, according to the government policy direction on energy mix, PUCSL Director  Tariff and Economic Affairs Kanchana Siriwardane said.
The CEB Engineers Union is on a work-to-rule trade union action against the PUCSL asking the regulator to approve their plan without any amendments. The Union says coal power is the cheapest energy source, quoting a unit price of Rs. 7.9. However, the PUCSL says otherwise.
Well, it is not correct. The CEB officially submits two types of data to the PUCSL. One is forecasted data and the other is actual data. The CEB has officially submitted the actual cost of generation for the last quarter of 2017. So, according to their data, the unit cost for October 2017 was Rs. 12.04 per kilo watt hour, Rs. 16.45 in November and Rs. 14.75 in December, Siriwardane said.
When calculated, the average cost is Rs. 14.41 per kilo watt hour. But that number does not reflect the loan that Sri Lanka has taken for the Norochcholai power plant and the interest.
Speaking about the approved generation plan, the PUCSL said it has not yet been technically challenged by the CEB.
The approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan 2018-37 describes a plant mix of 241 MW of hydro, 4,800 MW of liquid natural gas, 425 MW of oil-based power, and 2,897 MW of renewable energy.
The cost of the CEBs plan stood at Rs. 2,411 billion and the cost of the approved plan was Rs. 2,053 billion, making a difference of Rs. 358 billion to Sri Lankas economy.

GMOA calls for more vaccines as flu death toll rises
Although a batch of flu vaccines is on the way, the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle is still under-equipped and underfunded to deal with the current flu epidemic, GMOA Co-Secretary Kanchika Samararatne said on Tuesday.
We need the vaccine immediately, because it can take about a week to (work), he said in an interview with the Daily News.
(Its) useless to get it after the influenza epidemic, he said.
Speaking from Colombo, Deputy Director General of Health Services Dr. Sarath Amunugama said the Ministry had appointed a Special Committee to explore buying more flu vaccines from abroad.
A decision would be made depending on their reports, Dr. Amunugama said.
Dr. Samararatne said over 20 people have died in the southern region from influenza and its resulting complications. The flu virus attacks the respiratory system, leaving it more vulnerable to secondary and more deadly infections like pneumonia.
Several doctors and medical staff have contracted the flu while treating patients, Dr. Samararatne said, complicating their ability to provide treatment.
Dr. Samararatne said he received permission for a local purchase, so at least my hospital staff can get the vaccine. He estimated it would arrive within the week. The Karapitiya Teaching Hospital has the only Paediatric Intensive Care Unit in the area. Dr. Samararatne said that hospital administrators have tried to get approval for an expansion of the ICU for about an year and a half.
But so far, the approvals have not come through. I dont know why it was delayed, he said. He argued that the limited facilities and equipment was adding to the seriousness of the influenza outbreak. In a weekend press conference in Galle, GMOA leaders called on the government to take immediate steps in order to initiate a swift programme to administer medical staff of hospitals who treat patients, with flu vaccinations. It is the only precautionary measure that can be taken to protect the staff from contracting the virus, they added.

One out of six prison escapees arrested
One out of the six prisoners who were absconding after escaping from the custody of prison officers at the Galle Baddegama Magistrates Court on Monday was re-captured at Ellakanda in Baddegama, Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The escaped prisoner was re-captured by the Police Special Task Force (STF) at around 11 am yesterday.
The 21-year old escapee is a prison inmate indicted for sexual abuse, the Police Media Spokesperson further said.
A combined search operation was launched by the Police Special Task Force (STF) and Prison officers to arrest the six remand inmates who escaped from the custody of prison officers on Monday, while they were detained in the Prisoners cell at the Baddegama Magistrate Court in Galle.
Search operations are being carried out for the remaining prisoners who are still at large. On the day of the incident, Galle Prisons officials had transported 29 prisoners to the Baddegama Magistrates Court to be produced before the Magistrate in connection with various cases against them.
Among the absconders is a suspect who was arrested by the Wanduramba Police for a drug related offence while the four others had been arrested by Baddegama Police and indicted for rape and looting.
The other prisoner had been arrested for a drug related offence and was detailed to be referred to the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Center, Baddegama Police said. Further to the search operations, the Police have initiated a hi-tech investigation with regard to the telephone conversations they had with their family members and associates, the Acting OIC further said. Galle Prions Superintendent Jagath Chandana Weerasignhe said the high drama at the Magistrates Court on Monday took place when 29 prison inmates who were to be produced before the Baddegama Magistrate were being transported in the prison bus under the custody of six prison jailers, including a female guard.
All Prison officers detailed for duty at the Baddegama Magistrates Court on that day are well trained and experienced officers with a high sense of professionalism. However, some convicts made use of the humane and caring attitude and approach of the officers towards prisoners to make their escape, the Prison Superintendent said. At the end of the days court proceedings, one prisoner had complained of a chest pain. Out of empathy towards the detainee, our officers had swiftly called the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service and arranged to transport the sick prisoner together with two officials to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Weerasinghe said. Meanwhile, the other officers had made arrangements to obtain the finger prints of some prisoners. As the officers opened the cell to take the respective inmates, a prisoner who is an Army deserter and charged for a drug related offence had assaulted the officers and tried to escape. Nevertheless, our officers overpowered the detainee and put him back into the cell. Making use of the tensed situation, six remand prisoners had broken out from the cell and escaped, Weerasinghe said.
We sent 50 prison officers to assist the STF in their search operation, he further said. A joint Police STF and Prison Officers operation is continuing. The Prisons Department has initiated an official investigation into the incident.

The disaster situation is gradually decreasing and post-disaster management is underway. People are starting to move out of the safe zones and relief and medical officers, along with staff of the Disaster Management Centre, are helping to clean houses that were affected, stated Disaster Management Centre Deputy Director Pradeep Kodipilli.
However, he cautioned victims about going to the affected areas which are still not certified as safe. The landslide warning still exists. The soil is still unstable in some areas which received a high rainfall. But almost all the rivers are returning to their normal levels, Kodipilli said.
Officials are working hard to evaluate damage to houses so that the owners could obtain insurance from government funds and grants. Relief services are also underway to the victims in the safe zones and also to the victims who are not in the safe zones. There were 75,000 affected in the safe zones on Sunday. However, now there are only 70,000. The people are moving back to their houses, he said.
Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department warns the public of strong winds over both land and sea areas. Strong gusty winds up to 50-60 kmph can be expected over the western slope of the Central hills and fairly strong gusty winds up to 50 kmph can be expected in Western, Southern, North-Western and North-Central Provinces.
Several spells of light showers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and North-Western Provinces and in the Galle and Matara districts. The sea areas extending from Mannar to Batticaloa via Puttalam, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota can be rough or very rough at times, as the wind speed can increase up to 60-70 kmph. Wind speeds up to 50-60 kmph can be expected in the sea area from Mannar to Trincomalee via Kankasanturai. The naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant about the winds.

Railway workers have damaged train engines: Railway Department alleges

The Railway Department lodgeda complaint at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), alleging railway workers who were on strike to have had caused damages totrain engines and compartments, Additional General Manager (Operations) Vijaya Samarasinghe said today.
The railway technical service launched a 48-hour token strike from 4.00 pm on Tuesday demanding for a pay hike and several other demands.
Chairman of the committee P. Sampath Rajitha said, The wages of five grades had been increased by 12% and this has caused a salary anomaly within the entire railway employees. This discrepancy should be resolved and all railways workers should be given this 12% pay hike. This is our main demand and we have still not received a favorable response, he said warning the administrators not to lay their hands on their salary increments, which could lead to a further extension of the strike.
However, although the Railway technical services committee claimed that the strike action was successful, according to several other unions, the strike action was a flop and train services had operated without any glitch. They said that all 27 train services on the main line from various parts of the country to the Colombo Fort railway station had operated on schedule todayexcept for slight delays.

Priority given to safeguard environment, reservoir project...
Sand mining in Yan Oya reconsidered
Mining sand at the Yan Oya sand deposit in the Anuradhapura Wahalkada Division will be recommenced only after getting the assurance that sand excavating will not pollute environment, damage the Yan Oya Reservoir and its main dam, the Wahalkada tank, its irrigation structures and the regional roads system, experts say.
They said they have submitted their proposals in this regard to the President.
A Senior Engineer at the Yan Oya Reservoir Project said the sand mining at the Yan Oya was suspended on the instructions of the President since the mining was carried out recklessly. Sand mining authorities carried out the mining following the instructions given by the sand mining contractors, he said.
Many miners did not adhere to three metre depth excavation limit and had not refilled and levelled the pits they made in the process. Several progress review forums had pointed out the destructive sand mining methods that these miners employed which would jeopardize the Yan Oya Reservoir and its structures.
The official said the rules and regulations in the Environmental Impacts Assessment Studies report No. 08/EIA/Water/01/2001 had been breached damaging the forest cover around 4,000 hectare.
Wahalkada and Omarakada residents pointed out that the project should be finished before recommencing the sand mining.
The Yan Oya Reservoir Project is yet to be completed. Compensation for the lands acquired for the project has not been settled yet and alternative muddy lands have not been demarcated for the residents for them to recommence their livelihoods.
