No ban on pandals, dansal for Vesak, Poson poya
The government has not taken any decision to ban dansals and pandals on Vesak and Poson celebrations, the Government Information Department said yesterday.
The government had not taken any decision to ban pandals and dansals during the Vesak and Poson full moon Poya days.Media reports quoting the Buddha Sasana minister as saying that dansals and pandals have been banned on these poya days are false.There is no impediment for the public to organise Pandals or Dansals, the statement said.
However, Buddha Sasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera had requested the public to avoid pandals and dansals during the Vesak and Poson full moon poya days to emphasis on Prathipaththi pooja than the Amisa Pooja. This request has been made with the full concurrence and agreement of the Buddha Sasana Advisory Council and it is not meant to ban pandals or dansals. All decisions with regard to the Buddhism are taken by this Council that consists of eminent Buddhist monks.

Peradeniya doctors deliver teratoma baby in historic operation
Peradeniya Teaching hospital doctors were able to deliver a baby suffering from a teratoma tumour after a successful operation.
Doctors say that this is the first time that a successful operation of this nature had been carried out in Sri Lanka.The doctors were successful in removing a part of the tumour enabling the baby to breath.
The teratoma tumour is located on the neck of the baby which blocks the respiratory tract from the lungs making the baby unable to breath.This tumour does not affect the baby in the mothers womb, since the baby breaths from the umbilical cord of the mother, Peradeniya teaching hospital Deputy Director Imesh Prathapasinghe said.
The operation had to be done while the baby is connected to the umbilical cord since the baby couldnt breathe.Therefore, a caesarean was performed to get the head and neck of the baby out while the umbilical cord was connected to the baby. Prof. Mathula Hettiarachchi, Consultant Anaesthetist Dr.Wasanti Pinto, Paediatrician Dr. Pathum Dissanayake, Anaesthetist Dr. Sameera Wasala, ENT Specialist Dr. S.G Athulgama, Radiation Specialist Dr. Jeevani Udupihilla, Specialist Doctors Tharaka Chandrasekara and Kapila Hettiarachchi participated in the operation with the assistance of Sirimavo Bandaranaike children's hospital officials.
Doctors further stated that both the mother and the baby are safe.

Construction industry excavation activities
President calls for license-issuing system
President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed relevant authorities to prepare a system to issue licenses for the excavation of sand and gems required by the construction industry.
The President had given these instructions while participating in a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday (29), regarding the challenges faced by the industry.
President Sirisena, expressing his views regarding the ongoing rumours saying that the government had terminated the issuance of licenses to excavate sand and gems, said that it was false.
He added that during the past, the government took several steps to prevent irregularities caused to the industry by the illicit excavation activities of sand and gem smugglers and errant entrepreneurs and further said that there was no restriction imposed to carry out such activities.
He further said that said system would be implemented to issue licenses directly to the relevant institutions to excavate without the intervention of a third party. It was also discussed in detail, the steps that should be taken to encourage and promote the local construction industry.
During the meeting, attention was drawn to issues relating to the delayed payments of contractors and the uplifting of small-scale contractors through the establishment of a fund according to the provisions of the Construction Industry Development Act, by conducting research, introducing environmental friendly, cost-effective and efficient construction technology methods and introducing social welfare security systems such as pension schemes and long-term insurances.
The establishment of a special task force for human resources development, was also focussed on. The President instructed the relevant sections to continue the existing programmes to reduce the shortage of skilled workers.
Special attention was paid to environmental damage that had occurred as a result of excavation activities and to promote the use of sea sand for construction activities, in order to minimise the dredging of rivers. Methods to encourage private investors to use sea sand were also discussed.
Providing opportunities for local construction industrialists in foreign investment projects and minimising the participation of foreign construction companies in local construction projects, were also topics that attention was brought to.
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, Housing and Construction Secretary Bernard Wasantha Silva, Construction Industry Development Authority Chairman Eng. M. R. Jeyachandran, state officials and representatives from private construction companies participated in the meeting.

Prime Minister urged to promote UNPs second tier leaders
Third tier UNPers, certain of party reforms in the near future, have asked UNP leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to promote second tier leaders to take forward the party.
Today we only see Ranil Wickremesinghe as a leader in our party. Though people ask for leadership change, we do not have anyone else suitable to take on the mantle, UNP Colombo District MP Hirunika Premachandra said.
During the Prime Ministers time, there were five or six other leaders, people looked up to as well for the future of the party. Today our leader has to show who is next in line after him to the people, she said.
Addressing a media briefing at the party headquarters, she together with UNP Gampaha District MP and Chairman of the National Youth Fron, Kavinda Jayawardana stressed that it was necessary for second and third tier leadership to be restructured and promoted for the future of the party.
The UNP, which is the single largest party in the country, only managed to secure 29 percent of the vote base at the recently held local government elections.
Three committees have been appointed to look into the restructuring process, MP Jayawardana said. One headed by Minister Sajith Premadasa will look at reform within the Yahapalana government (also taking into account proposals put forward by Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka), second headed by State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena to look into restructuring of the party (this nine-page report has been submitted to the PM) and the third committee headed by Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala will look into suggestions put forward by UNP MPs and organisers.
MP Jayawardana said all these reports would be studied from April 5 and a party convention would be called to finalise the reform process.
Just because a leader changes, things wont change in the party. We need to build the party with leaders and members who listen to the people. We hope that this recent election will provide the impetus to bring about the necessary changes, MP Premachandra said.
Premachandra together with other UNP organisers have requested that the Prime Minister amend the new electoral system when applying it to the Provincial Council elections,
It was a mess this time. Perhaps because it was so new and many did not understand how it worked. The PM agreed to our request. It is good that we have a member for each electorate, but now we have more pressure when it comes to deciding whom to nominate to each electorate, she said.

Reflections on righteous rule
People of past generations believed in gazing the new moon which appears 14 days before this day as a good omen. On a Bak Full Moon day, in the fifth year of his enlightenment, the Buddha perceived a dispute brewing between the two Naga Communities in Northern Lanka led by two Kings Chulodara and Mahodara. Buddhism with a message of Peace for all humankindthe Buddha, preached his doctrine to the warring parties at Nagadeepa on his second visit to this land. Buddha quoted from several Jatakas to illustrate the evils of conflict and the value and benefits that one can accumulate from unity and peace.
Hovering in mid-air, above the battlefield and creating darkness and then illuminating the whole area infrequent intervals the Blessed One aborted a war between the uncle and nephew over a magnificent gem-studded throne.
We exist in an age of change. Impermanence is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism. In this state of transiency, we must strive to transform for the better and not for the worse. The Maha Sangha is established by the Master for the continuance of the Sasana. He has proclaimed 311Pratimoksha for nuns and 215 rules for monks in the Vinaya Pitaka, for virtuous living. Buddha permitted the Sangha, at a future time, to change certain rules in keeping with the ideals of his Dhamma-Vinaya, according to the Maha Parinirvana Sutra. Changes adopted not according to the whims and fancies of individuals, but brought forward by way of a proposal by the Sangha Nayake of the country at a Sangha Council, debated, adopted to be binding on all.
History records three Sangha-Councils held at Polonnaruwa, Dambadeniya and Kandy under the patronage of Kings Parakramabahu I, Parakramabahu II and Kirti Sri Rajasingha respectively. The Kings were the protectors of the religion and administrators of the decisions of the Sangha Council.
Buddha never taught any 'ism', or a sectarian doctrine. He educated people of every background, every religion, race creed and caste. He taught the way one can live a life full of benefits. He didn't give empty sermons saying, "You must live like this, or you must live like that". The Buddha taught practical doctrine, the real way to live a good life. Hatred can be compared to an enemy, an internal enemy; this inner enemy has only one function; that is causing us harmour true enemy, our ultimate adversary. It has no other purpose than simply wipe out us, both in the instantaneous term and in the long term. Dhamma is so simple, so the true-a law of nature, so scientific, applicable to everyone everywhere. Whether one is Christian; Buddhist, Hindu, or Muslim, whether one is American, Burmese, Indian, Russian or Italian: it makes no distinction; a human being is just a human being. Dhamma is a science of mind, matter, and the relations and interaction between the two. It should not be allowed to become a sectarian or theoretical belief.
The great scientist worked to find the reality of the connection between mind and matter. In discovering this truth, Buddha found a technique to go beyond mind-matter. Not for the sake of exploring reality or satisfying his curiosity, but to find a way out of suffering. So much unhappiness and despair in every society, in every family, in every country, in the entire universe. The Buddha found a way to come out of this desolation.
So many academics and scholars repeatedly cite the close similarity linking of Buddhist thought and the conclusions of modern science. There is no reservation that Dhamma, in proclaiming the self, the human species, is in parallel with scientific biological theory; but blinding with such comparisons would do more harm than good. Our only aim is to bring these discussions to the knowledge of the people and to encourage a free exchange of observations on a question of primary importance.
The evils of race and racism, spring from assumptions, consciously or unconsciously made, which result in mankind as being separated on biological, or even sociological basis into a hierarchy of combinations, among whom the supposedly superior groups do no immoral acts in discriminating against the allegedly inferior groups, thus impeding or preventing an amusing association between human beings as a whole.
The Dhamma is often twisted, misinterpreted, turned to suit commercial tendencies. Laymen, quacks and authors or a going bureaucrat enlighten the Dhamma and Ethics. Early morning TV and radio channels broadcast Dhamma and high principles, for which cheques are drawn from public money. Even sermons by monks have reached the level of stylish habit. Interdependence, respect for life, non-separation, and practice of sympathy, empathy and mindfulness are the basic principles of Dhamma. We are living in highly racialized times; conducting the separation that has traditionally existed within our extremely diverse societies. Indeed, our own observation of Buddhism as nonviolent and liberal may itself contribute to a worldwide discourse has represented Muslims as less than first-class citizens.
The Buddhas political thinking does not by any means encourage dictatorship or autocracy. It does not approve individual's rule. Even in a monarchical rule, Dhamma stresses the importance of conference with others. The king has to be firm, determined and well dedicated, he also has to be kindhearted and compassionate. Thus, the basic principle in Buddhist political attitude is that the state represents and defends the common will of the citizens. Put into practice measures to maintain the will of the citizens the state was expected to stick to certain specific norms, and these are well specified in the concept of the Universal Monarch.
This view is based mainly on the above seven conditions. The Vajjins followed the Satta-Aparihaniya-Dhamma which the Buddha promoted for the monks to follow. However, this is not sufficient evidence to come to a conclusion, for these conditions of development were taught to the Vajjins who already ran a republican government. Buddha told Venerable Ananda Thera that the Vajjins would remain invincible, as long as they pursue the Satta-Aparihaniya-Dhamma.
During a time when kingdoms of huge territorial coverage were coming into being, the Buddha was more concerned about the way of government than about the system adopted; we can conclude. The Buddha taught that the system of government should be chosen according to the prevailing conditions.

Relief from sufferings
Sakyamuni Siddhartha Gauthama Buddha the all-wise all compassionate teacher, born with love for humanity spread light to the entire universe with his vision insight philosophy and innermost feelings. He acted as a profound guide to millions of people. He could divert his divine eye, a countless number of times on the lives of human beings and their journey in the Sansara, to come to their aid and relieve them of their sufferings. In the fifth year of his supreme enlightenment while he was at Jetawanarama Sri Lanka had caught his divine eye. He foresaw a great disaster in Northern Sri Lanka Nagadeepa. Sakyamuni with his overwhelming compassion arrived in Nagadeepa to settle a dispute, an event of great historical importance.
Divine Vision
His divine vision attracted his attention to avoid the human destruction resulting from a war between Mahodara and Chulodara, uncle and nephew who were at loggerheads over the ownership of gem studded throne. Mahodara was on the verge of declaring war when Sakyamuni appeared immediately for their good fortune, which happened to be the month of Bak. Here the inhabitants belonged to various tribes such as yakka and naga. Naga being superior supported the Naga king who with their poor intellect and pure ignorance opposed the Buddha at the beginning. They soon realised they were wrong as they just could not give into their wishes. Finally they were blessed with the message of Dhamma, which was later welcomed by them.
Merit bestowing Umbrella
A deity named Samiddhi Sumana who had made a banyan tree referred to as Rajayathana Kiripalu Rukha his abode in Jethavana accompanied the Buddha holding the uprooted tree as an umbrella to him. Knowing that if was a merit gaining act to the deity. On arrival Naga kings involved in fighting the Buddha being the topmost with wisdom and insight with his psychic powers appeared above in the sky performing miracles which made the Naga astonished and happy. Finally having listened to the sermons displaying the path to peace and tranquillity they worshipped the Buddha and within minutes the throne was offered to him becoming pious devotees.
Nagadeepa Seya
The Naga king Maniakkitha, the ruler of Kelaniya who had become a devotee of the Buddha during his first visit to Mahiyangana while on his way to help Chulodara Mahodara in the battleground thanked him profusely for settling the dispute. He further requested for a souvenir and the Buddha offered him the Kiripalu tree and the throne. History reveals that where the Kiripalu Rukha was planted a chetiya named Nagadeepaseya, was built enshrining the Minipalanga that of Chulodara and Mahodara. This is supposed to be one of the 16 most sacred places to be worshipped in Sri Lanka History records that it was re-constructed and developed in to the present position by pious kings like Devanampiyatissa and Dutugemunu. According to the Golden Sannasa Wallipuram written during the reign of king Vasabha, it is the present Jaffna Peninsula that was identified as Nagadeepa.
Invitation to Thathagatha
When king of Kelaniya Maniakkitha met Thathagatha on his second visit to Lanka at Nagadeepa he was very keen that the Buddha visits his kingdom too. With his love and compassion he arrived at Kelaniya later in the eighth year of his enlightenment. This honoured invitation had been made on a Bak Full Moon day paving the way for the third visit of the Buddha to this Darmadweepa.
The surrounding areas which highlight the importance of the Buddhas visit to Nagadeepa during the month of Bak bear testimony to the extreme devotion and reverence to the Buddha. Some of them are villages known as Mallakam and Chunnakam, where flowers and incense were supplied for the worship of the Buddha. Further the Buddhist chronicles make mention of Puwangu DivayinaKa-ara Divayina, Manda Divayina as popular Buddhist villages in the area. One can well and truly say that the most sacred spot visited and blessed by the Buddha occupies a unique place in the history of the island as a blissful place showered with peace and harmony among the people.

Siriwardene leads rout of Pakistan in record SL win
Sri Lanka posted their first home win in a T20I against Pakistan, as spinners Shashikala Siriwardene (4 for 9) and Sugandika Kumari (2 for 15) bowled the visitors out for 72 sat the NCC grounds yesterday.
The victory was Sri Lanka's largest in terms of balls remaining, with 34 of them left unused when Siriwardene hit the winning runs.
Pakistan were 37 for 1 in the eighth over after opting to bat when Siriwardene orchestrated the collapse, which saw them lose four wickets for 10 runs in the next two overs.
The middle order batters Nida Dar and Kainat Imtiaz lost their wickets to run-outs as Pakistan were left reeling at 54 for 6. Sana Mir chipped in with 13 but after her dismissal in the 18th over soon led to the end of the innings.
Spinners Ghulam Fatima and Mir kept Sri Lanka's scoring tight as the hosts lost their openers within six overs, but a 29-ball 19 from Rebeca Vandort helped them regain stability and eventually level the three-match series.
Scores:
Pakistan Women 72 in 18.4 overs (Bismah Mahroof 20, Shashikala Siriwardene 4/9, Sugandika Kumari 2/15)
Sri Lanka Women 73/3 in 14.2 overs (Anushka Sanjeewani 20, Rebeca Vandort 19 n.o.)

SLFPs Final decision on NCM after April 2 - Minister Susil
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said the final decision pertaining to the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be taken collectively as a party on April 2 after having a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena.
Addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday, Minister Premajayantha assured that in keeping with the Constitution, neither the President nor Parliament can be impeached or dissolved if the motion is defeated.
The President and the Government will remain the same. We do not care if another UNPer becomes the Prime Minister but the majority feel that the present Prime Minister should leave, he said.
He further said that according to the Constitution, when a No- Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was passed in Parliament, the President would appoint a Prime Minister who receives the support of the majority in Parliament.
Minister Premajayantha said it was difficult for them to vote against the motion.
He said that among the 17 points mentioned in the No Confidence Motion, 13 were suggested by the SLFP with regard to Bond issue and added that the party agrees with the content.
Minister Premajayantha explained that it was also the SLFP after a special Central Committee meeting that appointed a committee to study the issue and it was recommended that the President should appoint a Presidential Commission to investigate into the bond issue.
MP Dilan Perera said that SLFP would take decisions collectively as a party.
He said that they have succeeded in taking legal and political action regarding the Bond issue.
Perera said that the government came into power stating that the Executive Presidency should be abolished.
MP Perera further said that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will lose its support in Parliament in future if they do not support the No Confidence Motion.
I doubt whether MP Sumanthiran is TNA Sumanthiran or UNP Sumanthiran. He is anyway going to get into Parliament nextime through UNP National List.The TNA will become traitors among the Tamils if they do not support the No Confidence Motion, he said.

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would inform the nation regarding its final decision on the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by April 4, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He was addressing a swearing-in ceremony for new SLFP local government (LG) members of the North Central Province who were elected at the LG polls held in February. The ceremony was held at the Anuradhapura Provincial Council Auditorium, recently.
Minister Dissanayake said no SLFPer had directly declared the stand of the party in relation to the No-Confidence Motion. Few stalwarts including Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S. B. Dissanayake, had spoken their personal opinions regarding the matter to the media.
It shall be our political motive and strategy, to form an SLFP government with President Maithripala Sirisena, if he is re-elected as president at the 2020 elections. We will focus our attention to provide practical solutions to problems faced by the citizens of the country, while curbing the attempts of any one person or party that attempts to mislead the public, he added. The minister said that the results of the recent local government elections had revealed that the current regime had failed to present itself as a strong and stable government to the people of the country.
However, if anyone were to interpret those results as a loss of power of the government, that would only be an illusion, he added.
Members of local government bodies are to comply with the decisions of their respective parties. Therefore, any member who would act against such party decisions, would be dealt with accordingly, under the new Act, Minister Dissanayake said.

The United States GSP trade incentive programme for Sri Lanka will become active again on April 22, the US Embassy said Friday.
This will open our market up even more to Sri Lankan goods and create jobs, said James Russo, a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Colombo.
The programme had lapsed on December 31, 2017, after Congress failed to re-authorize the law. The GSP scheme for developing countries, which gives preferential duties to certain products, was reinstated in a budget bill on March 23.
Russo said US importers who brought in Sri Lankan exports in the time in between could claim customs duties retroactively.
One hundred and twenty countries, including Sri Lanka and the Maldives, regained GSP support with the March spending bill.
The US is the largest market for Sri Lankan exports, taking in about $3 billion worth of goods last year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. About 75 percent of those exports are clothing items. The re-authorised GSP scheme runs through December 31, 2020.

Vipassana: Practical path to unity in diversity
In multi-religious and multi-cultural societies such as in India, Vipassana is a wonderful, practical path to unity in diversity. Vipassana, an ancient, timeless heritage of India, is the quintessence of all religions: how to live a moral life, to be a master of ones own mind, to purify the mind. No religion objects to these ideals. No right-thinking person objects to these ideals. Vipassana is the effective, universal method to achieve these ideals.
In past millennia, and in the present day, we are seeing how Vipassana enables one to live a happy, harmonious life. When more individuals achieve inner peace, peace is achieved in homes, in the neighbourhood, in villages, towns, cities and countries.
Universal Non-sectarian Path
This unifying process of peace and harmony is visible in Vipassana courses worldwide. During a Vipassana course, people from all religions, castes, nationalities, races and social strata sit together to practice this ancient path. Thousands of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Jews have taken Vipassana courses. They follow the same code of discipline and gain benefit from the Vipassana course.
Vipassana courses have been taken not only by the followers of all religions but also by their leaders. Many religious leaders have later told me, Goenkaji, in the name of Vipassana, you are teaching our religion! Vipassana courses have been held in temples, mosques, churches, and monasteries.
True Dhamma
In the ancient Pali language, Vipassana means to see things as they are, not as they seem to be. Gotama the Buddha re-discovered this ancient scientific path to real happiness. This is the true Saddhamma, the truth of the laws of nature applicable to all beings in the universe.
The Buddha did not claim any monopoly on this path; neither did he intend to start any sect, cult or ritualistic religion. He told people who came to debate and sometimes to quarrel with him: Let us keep aside our differences. Let us talk about what we agree upon. I am teaching sila (morality) samadhi (mastery of the mind) and paa (purification of the mind).
The Science of Mind and Matter
The Buddha was a super-scientist who rediscovered certain universal truths using his own body and mind as the laboratory instruments. He discovered that, at the actual level, there is no solidity in the entire universe, that all material phenomena are made up of tiny kalapas (sub-atomic particles) that arise and pass away with such great rapidity that they give the appearance of solidity. These kalapas, the basic building blocks of the material universe are nothing but mere vibrations. The Buddha said:
The entire world is in flames,
The entire world is going up in smoke;
The entire world is burning,
The entire world is vibrating.
The Role of Bodily Sensations
The Buddha discovered that the key to liberation experiencing the different physical sensations in the body and their nature of arising and passing away (anicca). He also realized that misery arises because of the blind reaction of craving and aversion to these sensations.
One comes out of the habit pattern of misery when one learns to remain equanimous with every sensation, pleasant or unpleasant, with the experiential realization that they are all impermanent, changing every moment. This ability to remain equanimous eradicates old impurities and helps one to change the behaviour pattern of the mind.
The Importance of Morality (Sila)
At the start of the Vipassana course, the student undertakes to observe a moral code of conduct. The student experiences how morality is the essential foundation to inner peace and happiness, not merely an empty, unrealistic ideal. One cannot do any harm to others without first harming oneself:
The student in a Vipassana course starts meditation practice with Anapana  observation of the natural incoming and outgoing breath, as it is, without regulating the natural reality of the breath. The student is instructed not to add any shape, colour, form, philosophy or image to the breath. As the natural breath is linked directly to the mind, one observes the mind by observing the breath. For instance, when one is angry, the breath becomes hard and irregular; when one is calm and peaceful, the breath becomes soft and subtle.
The truth of the natural breath can be experienced by anyone; this is not the monopoly of any religion or country. Then the student observes the touch of the breath at the point below the nostrils, above the upper lip where the breath touches.
When the student starts observing the point of contact of the breath with the body, he or she begins to experience the truth of sensations on the body: any physical feeling like heat, cold, vibration, tingling, itching, pain, etc.
During the practice of Vipassana, the student is instructed to observe the truth of sensations throughout the body. It is a choiceless observation. The student is instructed not to give any importance to any particular sensation or to have any bias or preference for any sensation.
The student proceeds from the gross truths to the subtler truths to ultimately reach the subtlest truth. He observes the mind-matter phenomenon, the truth of the so-called I, the truth about the causes and effect of suffering and the way out of suffering. He makes this observation within the framework of the body, without any illusion, delusion, imagination or visualization.
The Vipassana student observes the truth of the moment, as it is. So he experiences the truth of the changing reality, from moment to moment, within the framework of the body. Nature is playing its role, one just observes. One realizes how difficult this is! One also realizes how necessary and beneficial this is!

Wisdom comes from within
Once the Bodhisatta was born as a dog. He lived in a great cemetery outside the city of Varanasi, surrounded by dogs of all kindshundreds and hundreds of dogs. They were not purebred hounds: They were mongrels and mutts, and they survived by their wits.
It happened that one day the king, feeling too restless to attend to his duties, summoned his chariot and set off for the royal pleasure gardens. His two-wheeled chariot was drawn by a pair of white horses, their gorgeous trappings of braided leather gleaming in the sunlight. When they reached the pleasure gardens, the king spent the greater part of the day enjoying himself. At sunset he re-entered the city and returned to the palace. There he dismounted and retired to his quarters. The horses were tended to, but no one remembered to unfasten the chariot's fine leather harness and it was left dragging on the ground.
That night it rained and the harness was soaked. The kings hounds came leaping down from the terrace and began to chew and gnaw on the leather straps of the harness.
The next day, the kings servants gave their report to the king: "Your Majesty, after the rain last night, stray dogs came into the courtyard through the drain. They have chewed and destroyed your chariots fine leather harness."
The king was furious. At once, he gave his orders: "Kill these dogs, wherever they are seen."
From that moment a great misery befell the wandering strays of Varanasi. Many fled the city. They came to the cemetery where the Bodhisatta lived. When he saw the dogs approaching, the Bodhisatta questioned them: "What brings you in such numbers" They told him all: "Dogs have gnawed and destroyed the leather harness on the kings chariot. In his anger, the king has given orders to kill all the strays in the city. Many are being done away with and we live in fear."
The Bodhisatta, King of the Dogs, put his head down between his paws and reflected: "The palace grounds are wellguarded. There is no secret entrance or opening for so many dogs to come in. The chariot harness must have been destroyed by dogs inside the kings palace. It must be the kings hunting hounds that did it. And at this moment, the true perpetrators have received no punishment of any kind, while those who are not responsible are under a sentence of death. I shall go to the palace, show the king the real culprits and save my kin." Then the Bodhisatta sat up and spoke calming words to his relatives: "Do not be afraid any longer. As soon as I see the king, I will show him who destroyed his leather harness."
Then he summoned the perfections and chose loving-kindness to be his guide. He entered the city all alone and unseen, saying, "Let none throw a clod of earth or a club at me." And it was so. Not a single person, seeing him, raised a hand against him.
The King had given his orders for the slaughter of the dogs, and now he was sitting in the Hall of Justice. While he sat there, the Bodhisatta slipped into the hall, sprang forward, and hid himself under the kings seat. There he crouched, panting. Straight away, the king's men approached, intent on getting him out. But the king stopped them. The Bodhisatta, somewhat restored, came out from under the throne and bowed before the king.
Speaking in a human voice, he said, "Is it you who gave orders for the dogs to be killed"
"Yes," answered the king. "It is I."
"What is their offence, King of Men"
"They have gnawed and destroyed the leather work covering my chariot."
"Do you know without a doubt which dogs destroyed it"
"No," the king admitted, "we do not know."
"Your Majesty, this is not just. You do not know for certain which are the leather-chewing culprits, yet you have given order to kill dogs wherever they are seen."
"This is true. I gave orders to kill all of the dogs, all these chewers of chariot leather, wherever they are seen."
"But are your men killing all the dogs, or are there some who are not under sentence of death"
"Yes, there are some. The dogs in our household are not under sentence of death."
"Great King, a moment ago you said, 'I gave orders to kill all of the dogs, all these chewers of chariot leather, wherever they are seen', but now you say, 'The dogs in our household are not under sentence of death' Are you not showing favor to one group This is partiality, one of the four wrong courses of action. It is not fitting, nor is it kingly justice. Justice ought to be measured and balanced, as if one were using a weighing pole. It ought to come from careful searching for a cause. At this time, the dogs in your household are not under sentence of death, while the stray dogs of the city are. This is not slaughter of all the dogs, it is murder of the weak and unprotected." '
The king listened and then addressed the King of the Dogs:
"Wise one, do you know who is responsible for destroying the leather harness"
"Yes, I do know," answered the Bodhisatta. "It was the purebred dogs in your own home."
The king frowned. "How do you know it was them"
"I will show you."
"Yes, said the king. "Show me."
The Bodhisatta asked that the kings hounds be gathered in the courtyard. He requested a supply of buttermilk and some kusa grass.
Then the Bodhisatta said: "Crush the kusa grass and mix it in with the buttermilk. Give the mixture to the dogs to drink." The king nodded and clapped his hands. Servants brought a mortar and crushed the kusa grass with a stone pestle. Into the mortar they poured a measure of sweet-smelling buttermilk, mixed the two ingredients together, and poured the lumpy mixture into the dogs drinking trough. The kings dogs came, with their tails wagging, and lapped it up. But no sooner was the mixture all gone than the dogs could be seen heaving and vomiting all over the palace courtyard. Along with the buttermilk and kusa grass, up came bits of chariot leather, plainly visible on the palace grounds.
The king was satisfied. "You have shown me the real culprits," he said to the Bodhisatta-King of the Dogs. "I bow to you." Then he reached for the white parasol of kingship and offered it to the Bodhisatta.
The Bodhisatta allowed the parasol to be held above him. "Great King, you must do what is right," he said. Then he taught the Dhamma to the king with verses of ethical instruction. He finished by saying, "Great King, from this moment on, be mindful. Be diligent." He established the king in the five precepts and returned the parasol of kingship.
The king offered freedom and safety to all beings. He established a continuous food supply, much like what he ate himself, for all the dogs. He kept the precepts and made merit by practicing generosity. At the end of his life he was reborn in the heaven realms. The dogs teaching endured for ten thousand years. And as for the Bodhisatta, he also lived out his life and fared according to his actions.

Worthy visit
The significance of Bak poya is historical, since it marks the Buddhas second visit to Sri Lanka. This is noteworthy, as Bak is a month of national importance as well.
According to Mahavamsa, the Buddha could foresee an imminent war between two Naga Kings Culodara and Mahodara, uncle and nephew, over a jewel-studded throne that made him think of visiting Lanka for the second time. Professor Wilhelm Geiger explains the conflict in the translation of Mahavamsa:
That same Naga Mahodara was then a King, gifted with miraculous power in a Naga Kingdom in the ocean, that covered half a thousand Yojanas. His younger sister had been given (in marriage) to the Naga-King on the Kannavaddhamana mountain; her son was Culodara. His mothers father had given to his mother a splendid throne of jewels, then the Naga had died and therefore this war of nephew with uncle was threatening and also the Nagas of the mountains were armed with miraculous power.
Mahavamsa also records that the Buddha was accompanied by a deity to Sri Lanka.
The deva named Samiddhisumana took a rajayatana-tree standing in Jetavana, his own fair habitation and holding it like a parasol over the conqueror, he with the Teachers leave, attended him to that spot where he had formerly dwelt. That very deva had been, in his latest birth, a man in Nagadipa. On the spot where thereafter the rajayatana-tree stood, he saw paccekabuddhas taking their meal. And at the sight his heart was glad and he offered branches to cleanse the alms-bowl.
Therefore he was reborn in that tree in the pleasant Jetavans garden, and it (the tree) stood afterwards outside at the side of the gate-rampart. The God of all gods saw (in this) an advantage for that deva and for the sake of the good which should spring (therefrom) for our land, he brought him hither (to Lanka) together with his tree.
Mahavamsa then relates how the Buddha settled the dispute and the next development of events.
Hovering there in mid-air above battlefield the Master, who drives away (spiritual) darkness, called forth dread darkness over the Nagas. Then comforting those who were distressed by terror he once again spread light abroad.
When they saw the Blessed One they joyfully did reverence to the Masters feet.
Then preached the Vanquisher to them the doctrine that begets concord and both (Nagas) gladly gave up the throne to the Sage.
When the Master, having alighted on the earth, had taken his place on a seat there and had been refreshed with celestial food and drink by the Naga-Kings, he the Lord, established in the (three) refuges and in the moral precepts eighty kotis of snake-spirits, dwellers in the ocean and on the mainland.
The Naga-King Maniakkhika of Kalyani mothers brother to the Naga Mahodara, who had come thither to take part in the battle and who, aforetime, at the Buddhas first coming, having heard the true doctrine preached, had become established in the refuges and the moral duties, prayed now to the Tathagata: Great is the compassion that thou hast shown us here, O Master!
Hadst thou not appeared we had all been consumed to ashes. May thy compassion yet light also especially on me, O thou who art rich in loving-kindness, in that thou shalt come again hither to my dwelling country, O thou peerless one.
When the Buddha had consented by his silence to come thither, he planted the rajayatana-tree on that very spot as a sacred memorial and the Lord of the Worlds gave over the rajayatana-tree and the precious throne-seat to the Naga-Kings to do homage thereto. In remembrance that I have used these do homage to them, ye Naga-Kings!
The Buddhas calling forth dread darkness over the Nagas should not be misunderstood. The Buddha holds fame for being the Greatest Compassionate on earth.
The concept bears a symbolic meaning; Buddha preached the dark side of the world, and the Naga tribes were scared just to hear and visualise them. That paved the way for them to a comfort later on.
The Buddhas visits to Sri Lanka are believed to be false and legendary in certain sects. One reason is that it is not contained in Thripitaka, the official document of Buddhas life. Thripitaka contains more of philosophically important factors, rather than history. Buddha had been to Sri Lanka thrice: first visit to Mahiyangana, second to Jaffna, then called as Nagadipa, and third to Kelaniya.
The common question is that if the Buddha had already been to Sri Lanka, not only once, but thrice, why did Arahant Mahinda visit Sri Lanka once again. Arahant Mahinda, of course, had a mission to fulfil: to establish the Upasampada Bhikku order.
The suitable time was not ripe for Buddha to consider establishing the serious Bhikku order. However Buddhism was not alien when Arahant Mahinda set foot in Sri Lanka.

Heath Streak and coaching staff told to resign
Zimbabwe Cricket removes Cremer as captain
Zimbabwe Cricket have reacted to the team's failure to qualify for the World Cup with a widespread purge, removing captain Graeme Cremer and giving Heath Streak and his coaching staff a deadline by which they must resign.
While Cremer was informed of the board's decision on Thursday (March 29), Streak and his backroom team have been given an ultimatum. In a brief email sent to Streak by Faisal Hasnain on Thursday evening, ZC's managing director wrote: Further to our discussions, please give your technical staff (and yourself included) until 3 pm tomorrow to formally resign. After which time the technical team can consider themselves dismissed and relieved of their duties with immediate effect.
While Streak's contract is only due to come to an end in October, the majority of his support staff have contracts expiring at the end of May. It is understood that the group, which includes batting coach Lance Klusener, bowling coach Douglas Hondo, fielding coach Walter Chawaguta, team analyst Stanley Chiwoza and strength and conditioning coach Sean Bell, have taken legal council in order to determine a response to ZC.
Should Streak be removed, he will be the fourth coach to be pushed out of ZC's revolving door since Alan Butcher left the post of his own accord in March 2013.
ZC's purge is set to be extended to other teams within its structures, with Under-19 coach Stephen Mangongo and A team coach Wayne James also expected to be removed from their roles. Zimbabwe's Under-19 side fell at the first hurdle during the World Cup in January, while the A team was thrashed 5-0 on a tour of the United Arab Emirates last year.
The wholesale clearout brings into question who ZC will find to fill the positions, given the general lack of qualified coaches in Zimbabwe. Streak, Klusener, Chawaguta, Bell and James all possess a level three certificate or better, but there are thought to be no more than three other coaches in the country holding an equal qualification. The prospect of luring a foreign coach of good standing will also be more challenging after Zimbabwe failed to qualify for next year's World Cup.

UNP confident President will stand by PM, Govt.
The UNP believes that President Maithripala Sirisena will stand by them and support Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Government, UNP Gampaha District MP and UNP National Youth Front Chairman Kavinda Jayawardana said yesterday.
The President is one of us and even if the SLFP abandons him, the UNPers will stand by him, he added. MP Jayawardana was addressing a media briefing together with UNP Colombo District MP Hirunika Premachandra at Sirikotha.
MP Jayawardana further stated that MPs and Ministers in Government who support the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister should rightfully leave coalition after April 4.
Those who want to protect the government,the President and believe in the concept of Yahapalanaya and want to protect it, stand with us
This is just not against the PM but against the whole government,he reiterated.
The NCM brought forward by the Joint Opposition sets down 17 points on which they believe that the Prime Minister has failed.This also includes allegations against him in the Bond issue.
Several senior SLFPers have stated that they cannot object to these points and that they would have to support the NCM.
MP Jayawardana however stressed that the SLFP has not officially made its stance known and that the President on Thursday night assured the Prime Minister that he had his full backing.
MP Hirunika Premachandra, in the meantime noted that the stance of the SLFP has been worrying in recent times,
We got into a lot of trouble when establishing the Dehiwela- Mt Lavinia Municipal Council. We just managed to scrape through. The SLFP until the last minute promised to vote with us and then they voted against us and supported the SLPP, she said.
When I asked why the members did that, they said the General Secretary said one thing, the President another and UPFA secretary something else, MP Premachandra said. But we have always listened to the Prime Minister no matter our own opinions, she said. MP Jayawardana however pointed out that the President would not destroy what he created.

Australia bowler Starc to miss Indian Premier League
JOHANNESBURG, Friday - Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc has been ruled out of the fourth Test against South Africa as well as the Indian Premier League because of a stress fracture in his lower right leg.
Captain Tim Paine said at the toss on Friday that Starc had been battling some injuries throughout the tour and had been rested from the final Test.
But Cricket Australias website later stated that his injury was a stress fracture and that he would fly home after the Test for further assessment.
Starc had been signed by Kolkata Knight Riders for the IPL, which starts on April 7.
He is the third high-profile Australian to be ruled out of the lucrative tournament following the cancellation of the contracts of Steve Smith and David Warner, both banned by Cricket Australia for their part in the ball tampering controversy during the South African Test series.
Starc was man of the match in the first Test in Durban but only took three wickets for 304 runs in the next two Tests.  AFP

Bairstow salvages England after Southee, Boult strike
CHRISTCHURCH March30, 2018: Jonny Bairstow was in sight of his fifth Test century after a late run spree with Mark Wood lifted England to 290 for eight at stumps on day one of the second Test in Christchurch on Friday.
England hadbeen in trouble at 164 for seven before Bairstow (not out 97) and Wood (52) put on 95 for the eighth wicket, Tim Southee and Trent Boult did all the damage for New Zealand with Southee taking five for 60, his seventh five-wicket bag while Trent Boult had three for 79 after New Zealand won the toss and elected to bowl first.
England were in danger of not reaching 200 until Wood joined Bairstow and the pair put on 95 for the eighth wicket before Wood fell to Southee for 52, his maiden Test half century.
After being comprehensively beaten in the first Test, England strengthened their batting line up for Christchurch with the addition of James Vince while Wood and Jack Leach came in for bowlers Chris Woakes, Craig Overton and Moeen Ali.
But apart from Wood and Bairstow there was little to enthuse about with the England batting as Boult and Southee swung and seamed the ball with precision. Bairstow's 97 off 154 balls included partnerships of 56 with Ben Stokes, 13 with Stuart Broad, the sparkling 95 with Wood and 41 with Jack Leach who was not out 10 at the end of the day.
On 58, Bairstow suffered a fearful blow to the side of the head from Colin de Grandhomme which knocked his helmet from his head but did nothing to slow his run flow.
Boult and Southee took their wickets in clumps starting with Alastair Cook (two) and James Vince (18) to have England at two for 38. When play resumed after lunch they accounted for Joe Root (37), Dawid Malan (duck) and Mark Stoneman (35) in a nine-ball burst. Following the tea break, Stokes went for 25 and Broad for five before the Bairstow and Wood partnership.

## Title: A boost for the North
## Supertitle:

A boost for the North
One of the most horrendous consequences of the conflict in the North and the East, apart from the loss of precious lives, was the denial of one of the most basic rights of children  education. The LTTE conscripted children as young as eight for their fighting ranks which kept them away from the formal education system. Schools and other educational facilities especially in the North were severely affected as a result of the 30-year war, which further restricted educational opportunities for Northern children.
Sri Lanka has a free education system that is envied by the rest of the world, even the developed countries and some of our education indices are on par with those of the developed world. But some of these developments did not reach the North as it was hit by the conflict. Now the challenge is to bring the North in line with the rest of Sri Lanka as far as education is concerned.
Since the conflict ended in 2009, there has been a tremendous improvement infrastructure-wise in the region. Unlike the previous Government which believed only in that particular objective, this Government has released a vast acreage of land back to civilians, started livelihood programmes for the affected families, speeded up de-mining and rehabilitation of ex-LTTE cadres and started a process for achieving reconciliation and lasting peace.
The Government has now turned its attention to education in the Northern Province, with a 10-year-plan to improve the quality of education there. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has already instructed Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to take necessary measures to implement the 10-year-plan with the assistance of Northern Province Education. It has already been mentioned that the assistance of retired principals and teachers would be sought to create an ideal education system for the North.
Before the conflict started, the standard of education in Jaffna was very high with a large percentage of students from the District qualifying for university entrance. In fact, the Northern Province has produced a large number of renowned intellectuals, artistes, educationists, scientists and yes, politicians. As a result of the strife, the education sector in the North was paralyzed due to the lack of physical resources and valuable human resources.
During the past few years, a number of measures had been taken to solve major issues such as the teacher shortage and the lack of physical resources in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Indeed, the Government has pushed back the tabs for schools programme to allocate more funds for basic infrastructure facilities from classrooms to toilets in schools islandwide.
Thousands of young LTTE cadres have been rehabilitated and released back to society since 2010, but they do not account for all the children denied the right to education. It is thus necessary to conduct a census to determine how many children in the North had their formative education abruptly cut off either through conscription, disability or any other means. Once that is known, the authorities can formulate a programme, depending on their ages, to resume education or to direct them towards job-oriented vocational training.
It is imperative to teach them all three languages  many Northern children lack literacy in Tamil as a result of the disruption caused to education, even though they can speak the language. Teaching Sinhalese to Tamil-speaking students and vice versa is very important in the context of reconciliation. More Northern children must be taken on tours of Southern schools to build bridges of friendship with the South. If all children islandwide can speak and understand the three languages, they will not naturally feel any ill-will towards one another. This would be the best answer to those who try to fan the flames of ethnic hatred, which we witnessed recently in Ginthota, Ampara and Digana.
Indeed, it is entirely possible that in 20-25 years, everyone will call himself or herself a Sri Lankan, instead of ethnic labeling. Moreover, many have expressed the sentiment that in the future, new schools based on ethnic and religious lines should not be allowed. This will also go a long way towards banishing ethnic tensions.
Education recognizes no boundaries and all children have the right to education regardless of gender and poverty levels. The UN has included the goal of universal education in its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This timeline fits in perfectly with the Governments proposed 10-year-plan for uplifting education in the Northern Province. This will no doubt be fairly comprehensive, covering all aspects of education from pre-schools to university. Attention will also be paid to developing a number of schools and educational institutions in the neighbouring Eastern Province, which received a lesser blow from the conflict.
In line with the SDGs, the Government has already made education compulsory up to Year 13 and grants free school uniforms, textbooks and a host of other facilities to the 4.3 million students in 10,000 schools islandwide. It has increased spending on education. In outlining plans to include the North in the Governments future education plans, it has reaffirmed its commitment to education for all children.

## Title: Call for political unity
## Supertitle:

Call for political unity
The heavy blast of politics just now reminds one of the bombing blasts in April 78 years ago, it was April 5, 1942 when the Japanese began their bombing of Colombo and its suburbs. The time is very similar to that of the current political blasting. That was on Easter Sunday, and many were in church when the bombs began to fall. The big day just now is April 4, a few days after Easter Sunday, and April 5 this year would certainly show the results of a well-planned political bombing campaign that will take place the previous day  the exercise in bombing within Parliament on the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
What will be seen on April 4 is the biggest crisis the current Unity Government faces. It raises major questions about the unity and cooperation within the government, as well as major questions on the very leadership structure of the government. While the Joint Opposition (JO) is seeking to get the maximum benefit from its major electoral victory in the recent local government polls, the NCM shows a shaky SLFP  that was in the distant third position in that poll  trying its best to work out new understandings with the Mahinda Rajapaksa led SLPP, looking more at the coming Provincial Council polls and the next Presidential and General Elections, than the issues of governance today.
It is necessary to understand the political strategies behind the NCM on the Prime Minister. There is no question that he, and the UNP led by him, certainly brought the majority of votes that saw the election of the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena  defeating the then President and SLFP leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had planned a lifetime presidency, just as Chinas President Xi Jinping has done recently.
He also gave the lead to the UNP to obtain the largest number of seats in Parliament  106  although not a majority, at the General Election in August 2105, when the UPFA /SLFP led by President Sirisena, his coalition partner, could obtain only 95 seats. Ranil Wickremesinghe was chosen Prime Minister as the leader of the largest party in parliament, and saw the Cabinet include many UPFA/SLFP members who had campaigned against Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Poll in January 2015 and against both the President and Prime Minister and the General Election that followed.
What will emerge in the NCM this Wednesday is firstly the effort of the JO to show it strength against the Government, by seeking to eliminate from office the Prime Minister who leads the largest party in parliament, and move towards a political understanding with those of the SLFP who remain in the government, which includes President Sirisena. Whether the JO will succeed in this move is still uncertain.
The arithmetic of parliamentary seating gives a clear lead to the UNP and its allies  from the minority parties. But, there is so much noise being made by the JO and its SLFP supporters (especially Ministers in the Unity Governments Cabinet), that there are doubts thrown about the outcome of the NCM, and much noise about the possible defeat of Ranil Wickremesinghe. Added to this is some noise from the UNP too about a call for a change in party leadership.
The clutter of corruption
There is much noise made about the NCM being largely associated with the frauds involved in the Central Bank Bond issue, where there were many serious questions raised about the appointment of Arjuna Mahendran as Central Bank Governor, who was promoted by Ranil Wickremesinghe. But the NCM has totally ignored all the corruption involving the previous government, especially the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, which was the stuff of the campaign that saw the election of Maithripala Sirisena as the Common Candidate, and also saw the defeat of the UPFA/SLFP in the General Election of August 2015.
It is understood that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his supporters in the SLPP would not want to bring into focus any of the frauds and corruption they were allegedly involved in, for ten or even more years. But, it is certainly more than strange to see Cabinet Ministers of a government that was elected to bring to book those involved in the huge corruption of the previous government, being so silent on the matter, which was also the electoral and recent propaganda slogan of President Sirisena himself.
To hide all that corruption of nearly a decade, under a NCM that targets only the second runner in the recent local government polls, and completely ignores the much bigger losers of the SLFP, shows a crooked run of politics, that is not in keeping with the larger interest of the public in the fight against corruption.
There is no doubt that the very unity government itself has much to share the blame for the delays in taking action against the corruption of the former regime.
The culprits are both under the Blue and Green flags of coalition governance. The delays in justice, the manipulatory actions that gave help to accused  for example in elephant theft cases, the moves to prevent persons in military uniform being summoned to court, and the seeking of support from those long held in remand for alleged corruption, is part of the overall corruption that has swept a coalition of corrupt unity, and it is a mockery for sections of that government to single out its prime minister, leader of the largest party in the alliance, and the party that largely saw the victory of yahapalanaya; to be herded as the biggest or the only culprit in a situation of wider corrupt politics.
The power play
Whatever the outcome of the NCM, with all the strategies of the JO and its SLFP allies within government, as well as the strong vote base that Ranil Wickremesinghe has in parliament, there is no doubt the country is rapidly moving towards a major crisis in governance. If, as the figures show today, the NCM is defeated, can this government remain in its clearly revealed form of non-unity
Will the country be moved into a UNP only government (possibly with some SLFP ministers who would switch to the UNP) and headed by the President who is also the Head of the SLFP Or, in the situation of the success of the NCM, would President Sirisena head a minority SLFP/UPFA government, in which Mahinda Rajapaksa and his JO supporters are also members Will such a government have anything to do with the verdict the people gave to the policy of good governance in both January and August 2105
We are now in the midst of power play at its highest intensity. The powers of the Executive Presidency are now being revealed, post 19th Amendment. The subjects of the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been removed from the Prime Minister, and given top the Finance Minister. Similarly, the Cabinet Committee of Economic Management (CCEM) which was under the Prime Minister, has been disbanded and its work moved to the National Economic Council (NEC) with wider powers and activities, headed by the President. Which gives a message that future economic policies will largely be guided by the thinking of the President and his economic advisors.
The blast of power politics will certainly be seen in the days and weeks ahead, whatever the result of the NCM. The signs are that it will be a resonance of the thinking of the SLPP that would play a bigger role in government policy in the coming months, unless there is a strong resistance from the forces of civil society and other social and political organisations that see the dangers that lie with the resurgence of the Mahinda Rajapaksa and Pohottuwa thinking and political strategies.
The emerging strategies will certainly pay more attention to the coming Provincial Council polls, but the wider political strategies will be about the next Presidential Election in early 2020. With Mahinda Rajapaksa unable to seek re-election due to the 19th Amendment, what will be the likely strategies, and who will be the likely candidates
What influence can the UNP, even with inner party reforms, have on this election Will there be a fraternal Rajapaksa relationship in the Presidency and Prime Ministers office Or, will there be strong moves to abolish the Executive Presidency, which could shatter the political dreams of some craving for power they once swore never to seek again
The morning of April 5th will show us a much bombarded political terrain that will be difficult to rebuild with ease, due to a lingering loss of political unity.

Destroyer of Peterite batting of 1972
Chances of getting wickets today is greater than before  Rajive Benedict
Remember Rajive Benedict, he was the epitome of left-arm swing bowling in the seventies and eighties before the arrival of the great Chaminda Vaas.
Benedict is best remembered for his sensational spell of bowling in the 1972 Battle of the Saints cricket encounter for St Josephs College when he took eight wickets for six runs to rout St Peters College for 36 in the second innings, the lowest total on record in the time-honoured series. His final bowling figures is something that is difficult to emulate: 14.5-12-6-8.
That day I hit the spot and they couldnt play me. The only guy whom I couldnt get was Roy Dias (the Peterite captain) who was caught behind off my opening partner Chandana Fonseka, recalled Benedict now domiciled in Toronto, Canada.
Benedict is currently in Sri Lanka meeting up with former colleagues of his from St Josephs and Tamil Union whom he represented before migrating to Canada.
Rajive Benedict at 65
The only reason that brought me to Sri Lanka again after eight years is to reunite with my friends who played with me in school and club and guys who had played against me. I dont have so many relatives in Sri Lanka, said Benedict, an insurance man throughout his life.
I met a lot of the guys who played with me in school at a reunion on March 17 at Aitken Spence restaurant organized by my 1972 school captain Rohan Fernando who is a big guy there. Then on March 21 there was another reception at the Tamil Union where I met whoever is left from the team I played during my time. The night was spent talking about those days, he said.
Tamil Union is the place I grew up after I finished school. I played for Tamils before I played for college. It was nice to meet up with the guys who guided me along when I joined them as a schoolboy especially people like Felix Perumal, Selva Perumal, Muttiah Devaraj, and of course S Skandakumar who is not here. I met up with Indrajit Coomaraswamy as well after so many years maybe over 30. It was a really nice evening to meet everybody. That is the thing in the game of cricket it has brought me so many friends who are lifelong.
Benedict also bumped into Chaminda Vaas by chance. I have never met him before I had only seen him on TV. It was a really good opportunity for me to say hello to him. He had done well for Sri Lanka. He knew who I was. We just bumped into each other and didnt spend a lot of time. I told him that I had watched him on TV and admired his bowling. He remembered my bowling of 8 for 6 but I dont think he was in school at that time. He was a pretty nice guy, very down to earth.
On a green top or on a surface that provides any kind of assistance Benedict who bowls left-arm medium fast was unplayable.
Rolling back the years Benedict stated: In the three big matches I played against St Peters in 1970, 1971 and 1972 we won two in 1970 and in 1972 when I had 10-wicket hauls on each occasion. In 1971 I took six wickets in the match. In the club scene I have a lot of memories the one that stands out is the game against Bloomfield at the P Sara Oval in 1975. Bloomfield had about seven Sri Lankan players in their team that was captained by Lalith Kaluperuma. In the first three games Bloomfield had topped 300 runs and the headline before the match was can Tamils sustain the Bloomfield batting. We won the toss and put them into bat on a green top and skittled them out for 41. I ended up getting six wickets with a hat-trick. We won the match outright and it was against a mighty Bloomfield side of that time. That was a game that I will never forget.
Then I got 9 for 24 against Peradeniya University which included a hat-trick and in 1981 Tamil Union won the Donovan Andree trophy division II championship under my captaincy. That was also a memorable year because out of the 23 guys who played throughout the season about 16 were schoolboys who played under 14 and under 16 cricket. The seniors who played with me helped me groom these young guys who ended up playing big time cricket, he recalled.
Benedict who has been resident in Canada for 34 years said, I left school in 1972 and continued playing for Tamil Union. In 1984 after the riots my sisters suddenly decided to settle down in Canada and they sponsored us, I went with my family. I came to Sri Lanka in 2010 but couldnt make it for about eight years because my mother was very sick, she passed away in May 2016. Then my brother fell sick and being the oldest in the family I couldnt leave them. In times of need you have to be there for them. I have two boys who are both married.
Benedict has made a name for himself in Canada heading a Sri Lankan club called Centurion CC. As a matter of fact we have done quite well. We have guys like Brian Rajadurai, Nigel Isaac, Srimantha Wijeratne, a Peterite who now plays for Canada, and Ruvinda Gunasekera playing for us.
We had a fairly successful run in the league. We were the first club to win every championship in every division we entered. Last year we ended up winning the league super elite championship. I dont play anymore I stopped playing about four years ago because my shoulders were giving up on me. I turned 65 this year, he said.
Cricket is very big in Canada because of the India, Pakistan and Sri Lankan population. Before that the West Indies had dominated the league which is now dominated by Indians and Pakistanis.
Benedict who follows the Sri Lankan team through the internet or on cricket channels that are available in Canada admitted that the game had changed radically from what it was some 30-40 years ago.
The type of shots that the batsmen play today in my time, they would have been dropped from the team. It was more technique but now it is more about entertaining the crowd and scoring runs, Benedict was of the view.
Its an evolvement of the game, if they continue this way I dont know whether the interest of cricket would wane. Nobody cares about Test cricket anymore because of the short games 50 overs and 20 overs. When you watch on television the amount of crowd that is generated for the shorter game it is unbelievable.
Asked how he would have bowled in modern day cricket Benedict replied, I am not a guy with a lot of pace I depend on a lot of movement and the way the guys bat now it would have given me a lot more opportunities to get wickets than before. The time I played the guys were more concerned about technique and the right way to bat. It was more difficult during my time to get wickets than now. Even the bowlers out of the six balls they bowl three are half pitched and they get clobbered.
Benedict who returns to Toronto on April 2 said, I am taking back a lot of memories. Meeting up with all these friends, reminiscing with them and recalling nostalgic memories have made me feel young again.

Sri Lankan blue helmets in Mali diffuse 35 kg mine
Commendable move risking their lives to avert disaster
The Sri Lankan battalion attached to the UN Peace Keeping Force in Mali deployed only two weeks ago in the African nation, uncovered and diffused a 35 kg remotely controlled mine, while en-route to Mopti, averting a disaster.
Army sources who contacted personnel in Mali confirmed to the Daily News, that the contingent was tipped off to search a suspected area while they were on their way to Mopti. It was here that they found this 35 kg remotely controlled explosive device, he said. They risked their lives to uncover and diffuse it. Their valiant efforts to avert a major disaster is commendable.
The Sri Lankan contingent comprises of around 200 army personnel with 15 officers from the Combat Convoy Company (CCC) and 185 other rankers from ten regiments. The contingent is commanded by Lt. Colonel Kalana Amunupure with Major Hasantha Hennadi as his Second-in-Command.
The Sri Lankan troops who have been deployed to Mali are assisting the ongoing United Nations Peace Keeping Force to support the political process and carry out a number of security-related tasks. The Sri Lankan soldiers in Mali, underwent a rigorous vetting process in keeping with UN requirements prior to deployment.
The Sri Lankan Army in a recent release on the ongoing peacekeeping mission stated, that Sri Lanka was seeking to enhance and expand its participation in UN pacekeeping. Such expansion of Sri Lankas participation which would entrust Sri Lanka Security Forces with responsibilities of an international scale have to be carried out in coordination and cooperation with the United Nations and Sri Lankas bilateral partners.
It is the responsibility of Sri Lanka to ensure that the personnel deployed are Sri Lankas best.
Although the U.N. mission in Mali, known by its French acronym MINUSMA is yet to publicise the finding of the Sri Lankan blue helmets, it is widely known that Mali is one of the deadliest peacekeeping missions for UN peacekeepers to-date.
Earlier last week, UN Spokesperson Stphane Dujarric commenting on the UN Peacekeeping mission to Mali, welcomed a move by Canadian government which intended to send six helicopters and 250 airmen there. Mali has been one of the deadliest peacekeeping missions for UN peacekeepers over the last few years. Unfortunately, on a monthly basis almost, if not more, we have seen peacekeepers being attacked, targeted or killed by improvised explosive devices,he said.
The last casualty was reported in September last year when three blue helmet personnel were killed and five others were seriously injured when a convoy escorting the forces either hit a mine or triggered an explosive device in Northern Mali.

Controversial All Blacks giant Keith Murdoch dies
CHRISTCHURCH, Friday - Keith Murdoch, the only All Black to be sent home from a tour for disciplinary reasons, has died aged 74, New Zealand Rugby said Friday.
New Zealand Rugby mourns the loss of former All Black #686 Keith Murdoch, the All Blacks tweeted.
Murdoch's sister confirmed his death to Newshub, but did not provide further details.
The huge prop -- weighing 110 kilogrammes (242 pounds) and 1.83 metres (six feet) tall -- was widely known for being expelled from the All Blacks ranks after a late-night punch-up with a security guard in December 1972.
The incident had occurred after he was denied a late-night drink at the Angel Hotel in Cardiff.
Hours earlier, Murdoch was the toast of the All Blacks when he scored the winning try in their 19-16 victory over Wales across the road from the hotel at the Cardiff Arms Park.
When the bar closed on the victory celebrations, Murdoch is said to have gone looking for more beer in the hotel kitchen where he ended up in a confrontation with security guard Peter Grant.
He tried to punch one of his tour officials and I stepped in to restrain him. They managed to get him away but then he came round from some pillars and punched me, Grant told reporters at the time.
They held me back to stop me getting at him. Our men restrained him, with one or two of the New Zealand players helping.
It was ridiculous. We were there to protect the New Zealanders. This should never have happened.
Two days later All Blacks manager Ernie Todd decided to send Murdoch home for his own good but he never made it back to New Zealand.
Instead he disembarked in Australia and was rarely sighted again.
Rugby writer Terry McLean traced Murdoch to an oil drilling site near Perth, only to be told to get back on the bus by the former All Black.
In 2001 he was a witness at an inquest into the death of an Aboriginal man in the Northern Territory.
The legend of Keith Murdoch has remained with the All Blacks and whenever they are in Cardiff, players will gather at the Angel Hotel to drink a few beers.
Murdoch played three Tests and 24 other matches in his brief All Blacks career.

Dramatic developments in Korea
The political atmosphere in the Korean peninsula which was marked by policies of brinkmanship followed by the United States President and North Korean Leader as well as joint US  ROK military drills and North Korean missile and nuclear tests has dramatically changed for the better with all parties negotiating to resume diverse summits.
President Kim Jong Un of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will be meeting President Moon Jae in of the Republic of Korea on April 27 at Peace House, in the southern part of Panmunjeom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It will be the first meeting of the leaders of the two Koreas since 2007.
The thaw in relations all began with the offer of North Korea to send a team of sportsmen to the Winter Olympics that were held in South Korea.
The South responded positively and a flurry of diplomatic activity with exchanges of high level official delegations improved the climate at an unprecedented speed.
The North Korean leader also paid a sudden visit to Beijing last week in order to brief Chinese leaders about the impending summit and consult Chinese leaders. After his departure Beijing announced that the North Korean President was willing to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. A high level official of China visited Seoul subsequently and informed Seoul about the outcome of the meeting with Kim Jong Un. Perhaps he would have already delivered a message from Pyongyang to Washington to be delivered through South Korean officials. Two South Korean officials will now fly to Washington to appraise President Trump of the latest developments and on the forthcoming Korean Summit. Meanwhile officials of the two Koreas will meet on April 4th to make final preparations for the Leaders Summit.
President Trump is also expected to meet President Kim Jong Un in May and both of them have expressed optimism about its success. It is reported that North Korea has promised to suspend its nuclear missile and weapons tests and to refrain from calling for a stop to joint US-ROK military drills to facilitate dialogue.
Japan, not to be outdone and feeling left alone has also intimated its desire to meet North Korean Leader. It is said that secret negotiations are being made now through the Japanese Embassy in Beijing for a Japan-North Korea summit in early June.
West on an anti-Russian crusade
Britain, United States and several other Western countries have expelled nearly 150 Russian diplomats in a coordinated move over the alleged poisoning of a former Russian intelligence official Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Russia has denied the charge and says it is part of the anti-Russian policy of the West. Earlier he has defected to Britain.
It all began with the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from London on March 14th. Russia retaliated by expelling 23 British diplomats. Then the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats including some working in the UN on March 26. Russia retaliated by expelling an equal number of US diplomats from Russia and withdrew its approval for a Consulate in St. Petersburg.
In addition to Britain and the United States, altogether 22 countries including France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Poland and Canada have expelled Russian diplomats.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Russia will show a mirror response to all countries that have expelled Russian diplomats.
It yesterday announced that it has already expelled 150 foreign diplomats.
At present Russia is facing sanctions imposed by Western nations against it over its policy in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
More sanctions are expected in view of the aggravation of the present crisis. The United States has also warned about the possibility of freezing Russian assets in the United States.
The Bank of Russia has one-third of its currency assets in the US. Russian economic analysts have claimed that such an act would mean a declaration of war.

Easter messages
Resurrection, a symbol of hope: President
Easter is one of the most important Christian festivals which commemorates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christian devotees around the world choose to spend the period leading up to Easter, by performing prayers, fasting and indulging in acts of self-sacrifice, while engaging in religious activities, President Maithripala Sirisena said in a message marking Easter.
The message added:
"Easter reflects the complexities and pain suffered by Jesus Christ, who sacrificed his life for people and the greatest joy received as a result his Resurrection.
The message delivered to people through Easter, is the hope of Resurrection; the conquering of death. Furthermore, it reflects divine sacrifice.
All living beings dislike cruelty and violent suppression. Sustenance of human beings depends entirely on life.
The world will become a better, more beautiful place when there are people who love each other, value reconciliation among themselves as well as honour the dignity of each other. All of us must pledge to create that kind of heaven in this world, as well as to build a new future by utilising the path shown to us this Easter.
I extend my warmest greetings for a Happy Easter celebration, full of peace and joy to all Christians around the world."
Time for rejoicing: Amaratunga
Easter, celebrating the glory of the Risen Lord, marks the end of the Holy Week commemorating the Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. His Resurrection from the dead is the best attested fact in human history, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said in his message marking Easter.
The message added:
"The glorious rising manifests the Divinity and Humanity of Our Lord, which forms the bedrock of our Christian faith. The Resurrection of defeating death and triumphing over the forces of sin and evil, opened the gates to the Kingdom of God to mankind for eternal life in union with God Himself. As such, we should not fear death, for Resurrection lifts humanity above matter and elevates to a state of peace on earth and eternal life after death.
Therefore, Easter is a time for rejoicing, thankfully assured that sin is forgiven and life extends beyond the soil of the earth.
Jesus stood against a corrupt ruling system, politically and religiously mixed, which threatened the Jews of the day. Historical records and testimonials have found that the crucifixion was filled with political and religious intrigue of which factors pervade society even today.
Let us awaken to demonstrate our committed gratitude to Our Lord the Saviour by contemplating and reflecting on his message of love, reconciliation and justice realistically extending to our neighbour and society at large for peaceful co-existence.
I wish you a blessed and meaningful Easter and may its message bring you a re-awakening with new aspirations and hope contributing to the way forward in a peaceful country."
Let us embrace compassion: Sampanthan
As Christians across the world celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, my heartiest wishes go to the Christian community in Sri Lanka, Joint Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said in a message marking Easter.
The message added:
"The selfless, humble and sacrificial life of Jesus Christ always challenges humankind to treat everyone with self-respect and equality.
As we reflect on the message of Easter which brings hope, renewal of life and compassion, may we also embrace those features in our lives to build a country that will cherish diversity and equality.
The Message of Easter also reminds us not to lose courage and hope on account of short-term adversaries, but to remain confident and steadfast to seek a triumphal end.
While we celebrate, let us also take a step forward to show our solidarity with the less fortunate and downtrodden and make this Easter meaningful."

In favour of unity
There is a special significance in 2018, related to March. The first day was Medin and the last day is Bak Full Moon Poya Day. Another notable feature of the forthcoming month is that it is the festive season for both Sinhalese and Tamils.
It was on a Bak Full Moon Poya Day, in the fifth year of the Buddha that he perceived, with his divine eye, a dispute brewing between two Sri Lankan Naga Kings: Chulodara and Mahodhara. According to Mahavamsa Mahodhara ruled the Naga Kingdom by the sea. His younger sister married the Naga King of the Kannaraddhamana Mountain. Her son was Chulodhara.
His beloved mother's father had given to his beloved mother a magnificent gem-studded throne. This finally resulted in a war between the uncle and nephew to possess the throne.
The Buddha visited Sri Lanka, enlightened Chulodara and Mahodhara with the noble teachings. The Buddha arrived in Sri Lanka on a Bak Full Moon Poya Day, accompanied by Deity Samiddhisumana.
The Enlightened One illustrated the evils of discord and the benefit of unity. The Buddha expounded Kakoluka, Dhandana, Latukika and Wattaka Jataka stories. The Blessed One can be considered as the greatest communicator. His sermons are simple and easy to understand. The Kakoluka Jataka relates the controversy between the birds and animals. The Bhikkus questioned:
Most Venerable Sir, when did the crows and owls begin to hate each other
The Buddha replied: The hatred began an aeon ago: Finally, the controversy ended when they elected a Golden Swan as their kings. Monks, I was the Golden Swan at that time.
The Latukika Jataka centres round Devadatta. Even in his previous births, he was wicked and vicious. Venerable Monks, as a Bodhisatva, I was born as the King of Elephants. Katakirilla  an innocent bird, appealed to me not to kill its eggs while roaming the forest. I advised them not to harm the eggs.
There was a lonely elephant. He was the present Devadatta. He planned to destroy him with the assistance of a frog, fly and a crow.
My message was never to take revenge on anyone and be kind and compassionate to all, stated the Buddha.
Wattaka Jataka was woven around the story of a crow and a bird, known as snipe or quail.

The Battle of the Mangosteen limited overs encounter between Tissa Central College and Kalutara Vidyalaya was concluded with Tissa Central completing a comfortable four wicket victory at the Panadura Cricket Cloub Ground and this was their fifth consecutive win in this limited over match history.
The Kalutara Vidyalaya skipper won the toss and elected to bat first on a good batting surface but their batsmen were struggling with Tissa powerful balling attack and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals until the side was dismissed for just 161 runs in 49th over. Tharaka Sandaruwan, who spearheaded the Tissa bowling attack with 4 wickets for Chasing 161 to win, was an easy task for Tissa Central with their strong batting line up. Nilupul Darshana 43 batted superbly and Rohan Sanjaya was unbeaten on 41 runs at the crease and guided his team to a comprehensive victory and they chased down the target in 33.2 overs with 4 wickets remaining.

The first SAARC Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Conference will be held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo on March 31 and April 1, under the patronage of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the main objectives of the conference are to share country-wise experiences of NCDs, to decide on common areas of interest with regard to controlling NCDs in the SAARC region and to discuss and finalise the terms of reference for the SAARC annual meeting on NCDs.
NCD management interventions are essential for achieving a global target of a 25-percent relative reduction in the risk of premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 and a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in premature deaths from NCDs by 2030, he said.
NCDs disproportionately affect people living in low and middle-income countries, where more than three-quarters of global NCD deaths (31 million) occur. People of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs, but evidence had revealed that 15 million of all deaths attributed to NCDs are related to people between the ages of 30 and 69 years, he added.

Five times Steven Smith brought shame to cricket
Following all the drama of ball-tampering, Cricket Australia have finally announced their verdict by punishing the now-sacked captain Steven Smith and vice-captain David Warner, and also penalising newcomer Cameron Bancroft. The latter two cannot represent Australia for the next one year while the former will be out for nine months, though all three have the option of challenging the verdict.
However, in the case of Smith and Warner, this was not the first case when misconduct or unsporting behaviour on the ground attracted the attention of the authorities. While Warner's stories go back a long way, TopBuzz traces 5 instances when Smith's actions or words brought shame to the game of cricket.
OUTBURST ON UMPIRING DECISION, CHRISTCHURCH 2016
On Day four of the Christchurch Test between New Zealand and Australia in 2016, Smith and pacer Josh Hazlewood got into a controversy when an umpiring decision went against Australia. In the last over before lunch, Kane Williamson was ruled not out by on-field umpire Ranmore Martinesz following a huge LBW appeal by Hazlewood.
Smith immediately referred it to the third umpire Richard Illingworth, who found a small Hot Spot mark beside the bottom of Williamson's inside edge, thus sticking with Martinesz's decision. The visitors, however, seemed convinced that the spot arose with Williamson's bat trudging his boot. That made Smith have a word with Martinesz while Hazlewood was heard on the stump microphone saying, Who the f*** is the third umpire
As a result, Smith was fined 30% of his match fee while Hazlewood was docked half the amount, after which Smith later said, "I'll cop that on the chin and I need to be better as a leader."
DRS BRAIN FADE, BANGALORE 2017
Australia had registered a surprising win on a raging turner in the previous Test in Pune to go 1-0 up in the three-match series, and Bangalore presented them with another spin-friendly surface, albeit not as threatening. India had set the visitors 188 on the fourth day, having fallen behind by 87 in the first innings.
But when Australia came out to chase, it was India's pacers who struck early blows to reduce them to 67/3, with Umesh Yadav claiming two wickets and Ishant Sharma claiming one. With Umesh in action again, Smith was struck flush in the middle by the ball keeping low. Umpire Nigel Llong gave India the wicket, and with the DRS facility available, Smith consulted the non-striker Peter Handscomb before turning to the Australian dressing room to consult whether the decision needed to be reviewed or not.
With Virat Kohli questioning his methods and even claiming that Australia had done that several times in the Test, Smith later described his actions as a brain fade, a term very commonly used in cricketing circles since.
JAMES ANDERSON SLEDGING COMMENTS, ADELAIDE 2017
During the Adelaide Test in 2017, umpire Aleem Dar often had to intervene between Smith and James Anderson
After England had lost the first Test of the 2017-18 Ashes in Australia, James Anderson wrote in a piece for The Telegraph in the UK a day before the second Test at Adelaide, A bully waits until they are in the ascendancy to pounce on people. That is what Australian teams do.
The same day, host captain Smith hit back at his rival when he was asked to respond to Anderson's comments. "I think it's interesting coming from Jimmy, calling us bullies and big sledgers. I think he's one of the biggest sledgers in the game, to me in particular. I remember back in 2010, when I first started and wasn't any good, he was pretty happy to get stuck into me then."
Things seemed heated up even during the match at Adelaide, with umpire Aleem Dar often having to intervene when Smith was standing at the non-striker's end at the same time that Anderson was fielding at short mid-wicket.
KAGISO RABADA SHOULDER BARGE COMMENTS, PORT ELIZABETH 2018
Smith claimed that he remained unheard after being barged by Kagiso Rabada in the Port Elizabeth Test in 2018
Controversy had already taken the upper hand in a fiery battle between South Africa and Australia in the first Test. The next match at Port Elizabeth saw Smith and Kagiso Rabada face-off against one another. Rabada, with already five demerit points to his name, was one misdemeanour away from suspension, which inevitably arrived when he was found brushing Smith's shoulders and even giving him a send-off after getting him out. Further trouble arrived when he screamed in Warner's face on dismissing him in the second innings.
As a result, he was suspended for two Tests, but much to the disappointment of the opposition, had it overturned following a six-hour hearing. The decision pinched Smith, who believed that as the one who was barged, his voice remained unheard. I certainly think he bumped me a little bit harder than it actually looked on the footage. The other person involved not getting asked about it is pretty interesting, I thought, Smith said.
But more trouble was to follow, at least for Smith...
BALL TAMPERING, CAPE TOWN 2018
The biggest scandal broke out in the third Test of the South Africa tour when Cameron Bancroft, on instructions from his captain Smith and vice-captain David Warner, was caught rubbing one side of the ball with a sandpaper on the third day of the match. Later in the day, Smith and Bancroft confessed in the press conference that it was a pre-meditated plan to alter the condition of the ball in order to obtain early reverse-swing, with Smith stating that only the leadership group was involved.
Massive consequences followed when the ICC first suspended him for a Test and fined him his entire match fee, letting off Bancroft with three demerit points and a 75% fine.
Cricket Australia duly stepped up to punish the players, banning Smith and Warner from all cricket for a year while Bancroft was suspended for nine months. This led to the termination of Smith and Warner's IPL contracts, with both having resigned as captains of their respective franchises.

Government to make Sunday Schools compulsory
The government has decided to make Sunday School education compulsory for all school students countrywide. Accordingly, a Cabinet paper for the said purpose would be tabled soon.
I wish to discuss this matter in detail with Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as to how students could be motivated to attend religious education activities, Kurunegala District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian and Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said.
He was addressing a meeting for journalists which was held at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raj Maha Viharaya in Kurunegala, to discuss matters regarding this years Vesak festival that falls on April 29.
Students who show outstanding results at provincial and national-level Sunday School examinations, would be given preference if or when they transfer to another school, or when seeking government job opportunities. This initiative would help create a disciplined future generation within Sri Lanka. As such, the matter should be discussed with Cabinet ministers of different faiths, the minister added.

Schools are finding it difficult due to ground problem
Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most ruggerites, At present schools are finding difficult to play their matches, only Trinity has their own grounds, other schools have to pay a big packet for the ground, and in the same way the gates are also too high. Today rugby is undoubtedly the most popular and champion sport with Kandy Sports Club being the king makers. Today most of the schools do not have their school fixture card due to ground problems.
Sampath says good bye to Antonians
St. Anthonys College, Katugastota cricket coach Sampath Perera and the former Trinity College coach who molded the Asgiriya school into a champion outfit for several years took off to Malaysia on Wednesday night to take up a coaching assignment.

Badly in need of a right place for walking and jogging
Kandys young and old sports lovers are badly in need of a proper place to do their walking and jogging. In the good old days, there was a big crowd at Bogambara but today for some purpose the gates are locked.
Earlier they used the Kandy Lake round for it but today it is in a mess as the surface is not in perfect condition, and there is too much traffic.
Kandy needs a public cricket ground
Today most of the schools in Kandy are without a proper cricket playing field, and they have to go out of Kandy to play the game. Except Trinity, Dharmaraja, St. Anthonys all other schools are without grounds.
This deprives some of the top schoolboys from displaying their talent.
Antonians out

Light of Easter amidst uncertainty of social change
On Easter Sunday Christians world-wide celebrate the Glorious Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the core-truth of their religious faith and spirituality. Jesus of Nazareth thus became an Eternal Galilean who will rule the world and human history till the end of time. The Crucified Nazarene, the carpenters son, the authoritative preacher, the healer of the sick and the possessed, the threat of the demons has vanquished the gloom of the grave and the darkness of that cave having emerged glorious in the brilliance of the Risen Life.
Death has been defeated, doubts have been cleared, fears have been destroyed, hope reassured, peace dawned as the Divine Teacher triumphed in glory. For all what technology and science can do to prolong life, it would be clearly impossible to resist death and its rampage through humankind. Here lies the radical weakness of human endeavour and the ultimate failure of human resources to ensure life and even succeed in their fight for defeating terminal diseases like cancer, chronic heart disease and AIDS, the trinity of death.
The Light of the Risen Christ
Easter means a rising and a new dawn. The brilliance of the Light of the Risen Christ fills the Easter Season. The stories of the close followers of Jesus show that they were a distraught lot after the condemnation and the death of their master. A pale of sorrow, fear and restlessness had over taken them.
Two days had passed without any sign of their master coming back alive from the tomb. But then, came the third day and it was all changed. Christ was alive. He came in through their closed doors exorcising their gripping fears and dispelling the doubts that had crippled all his disciples. He came to them with the greetings and blessings of peace. He would stalk the beaches of Galilee once again and wait for them to return to land to partake of a meal in the open and windy beach. He would be a travelling companion to them during their journeys listening patiently to their stories of frustration and sit down to break bread with them in an inn in order to reveal his glory.
He would appear to the doubting companions, showing the wounds of his crucifixion, challenging their disbelief and leading them to faith in him as the Risen Lord. The Jewish Sabbath that was Saturday would now be replaced by Sunday, the glorious day of the Resurrection. Fifty days later, the disciples empowered by the Spirit of the Risen Lord, would openly and courageously preach the news about the crucifixion and Resurrection of the Lord and would even dare death for his names sake. They would criss-cross lands beyond the city of Jerusalem and Palestine to take this Good News to many middle-eastern cities and even reach imperial Rome to challenge its idolatry and immorality demanding that they believe in Jesus the Redeemer and change their lives for the better into a new life-style of holiness, sanctity and righteous living.
Simon Peter who was once a humble fisherman from northern Galilee would choose to be crucified with the head down and Paul the die-hard Pharisee who converted would reach Rome and be beheaded because of his brave preaching. The later Christian believers in Rome under severe persecution from Roman pagan emperors would bravely face martyrdom for the sake of the faith they had in the Crucified and Risen Lord. Under the severe anti-Christian culture of politics and prevailing idolatry of the cosmic pantheon, Christians underwent cruel forms of persecution with the first Popes, practically all of them, ending their lives as martyrs.
It has been said often in Christian tradition, that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of Faith and so has it been as history of Christianity has unfolded in the first 500 years. However, in the middle ages, it was the golden age of Christianity in the western European continent. Then came the modern and post-modern times, when the Christianity stabilized, traversed through various other continents but not without having to face and being challenged inevitably by newer and more subtle anti-Christian ideologies, philosophies and socio-cultural currents of different hues.
The greatest danger and threat to religions and religious practice in the modern world is secularism that radically marginalizes them and other social ideologies that are extreme forms of social conflict. But, we also see that a world without religious values is more and more turning inhuman and decadent societies are emerging on our horizons, much to the regret of all wise thinkers, who like to see a humanity become more human and a world becoming more peaceful and secure.
Libertine thinking and nuclear arms race are the twin hydras that seem to sway over the world-scene today. They create fear, anxiety and insecurity on the entire world-stage and have to be dispelled, sooner the better with good understanding, solidarity and collaboration among the nations. Dialogue appears to be the language that is most suited for our modern age of diversity in our daily conversations. This planet, our common home, has to be saved together or nations must be ready to run the risk of perishing in its flames together.
Collective wisdom and mutual understanding are the two wings that will soar the nations to the noble heights of world-peace and collaboration for a better and safer world. One has to rise from a false provincialism, a die-hard extremism that is the bane of modern world.
Christianity: An agent of social change and transformation
Our present world has risen from the dust and ashes of two world-wars. It has learnt its lessons that have been bitter, overwhelming and fraught with untold anxiety, fear and suffering. These wars and the present racial, ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts are wreaking havoc on entire nations and their future prospects for prosperity and stability.
The spirit of the risen Christ, on the contrary, has gripped his followers world-wide to spread the spirit of solidarity among nations and peoples, peace and concord among warring factions making the world capable of transcending language, ethnic and socio-cultural differences thus leading nations to build a world of good understanding, mutual appreciation and collaboration. Beginning from the time of Constantine the Great emperor on the fourth century AD down to different epochs wherever Christianity had penetrated, it had raised schools and hospitals to serve in the cause of education and caring for the sick and infirm. It has favored all democratic forms of government and civil life, fostered human rights in favour of human dignity and social justice in favour of human liberation. It readily welcomes an economic system of abundance but with sharing. Compared with the paucity of failures and defects, Christianity has contributed much for a more humane, peaceful and better world throughout the past 20 centuries. The culture of human solidarity that was introduced by St. Paul, the first evangelizer of the ancient nations helping people to sink religious differences, social class distinctions and even gender differences has penetrated even todays thinking.
There is so much effort to make all religions respected, all human beings honoured and the feminine of womanhood restored to its proper dignity with equal opportunities open to them. The modern world can learn from the earliest Christianity that diffused this culture in ancient middle-eastern cities like Corinth, Ephesus and Colossae, and even in imperial Rome and its colonies. This brought in a revolutionary social transformation in that world and this good trend continues unabated ever since, penetrating even the 21st century.
World society is clamouring for human dignity, human rights, democratic freedoms, sharing and the care of the poor and the socially marginalized. We need the blending of the wisdom of the spiritual gurus, sages and saints (Gnosis) with that of the skills (techn) of the technicians and scientists to carry the present world-society forward.
Easter has ushered in a new world where courage, hope and solidarity constitute the basic features that can engender a new era. It is a world society whose culture would be characterized by moral and ethical values, respect for human life and dignity with social justice ensuring prosperity for all.
The spiritual and ethical concerns would play a decisive role even in regulating socio-political and social life without which it would be extremely difficult, nay almost impossible, to build a society of righteousness and justice. Even medical science must delve into the field of mental and spiritual health. If theres an area where truth, justice and honesty are to be most desired , it is politics wherein much of greed, bribery and corruption, in fact, the most dangerous social evils, have to be weeded out and eradicated for good by effective reforms and change.
The primacy of the ethical and the spiritual is non-negotiable. Let us call it simply a categorical imperative in the subtle words of Emmanuel Kant, the renowned German ethicist and philosopher. The spirit of the Christian Easter challenges us to spread and diffuse this spirit of hope and solidarity and thereby usher in a new world that is worthy of its creator.

Markram shines but Australia strike back
JOHANNESBURG, Friday - Opener Aiden Markram led the way with a career-best 152 as South Africa had the better of the opening day of the fourth test against a much-changed Australia, reaching the close on 313 for six on Friday.
The tourists, reeling from their ball-tampering scandal and led by new captain Tim Paine, had to endure chants of where is Warner and where is your captain from sections of the 17,023 home support as a reminder of the bans handed to captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and Cameron Bancroft.
Needing a win to grab a share of the series, the tourists kept themselves in the game as the excellent Pat Cummins (3-53) claimed the wickets of Markram and home skipper Faf du Plessis first ball.
Debutant Chadd Sayers (2-64) removed AB de Villiers (69) with the new ball and two deliveries later had nightwatchman Kagiso Rabada caught without scoring.
Temba Bavuma (25) and Quinton de Kock (7) will resume on the second morning, looking for a sizeable total on a wicket already taking turn and showing widening cracks as they seek a first home series win over Australia in almost 50 years.
After losing the toss, Australias bowlers have found enough in the wicket to dispel the notion of a flat pitch.
But it did not come in the form of reverse swing, which was noticeably absent having been a feature of the first three tests, only becoming apparent with the very old ball.
The excellent Markram has been the anchor for the innings, hitting 17 fours and a six on his way to a fourth career century to go with three fifties in 17 test innings as he scored all around the ground.
His 216-ball vigil ended when he steered Cummins to Mitchell Marsh in the gully, having brought up his 150 the delivery before with a sumptuous drive.
It was the fourth century for the home side in the series, and second for Markram, with Australias batsmen yet to break their duck, a major difference between the two sides.
South Africa were teetering on the brink of another middle-order collapse when Du Plessis misjudged Cumminss next delivery, leaving the ball as it crashed into his pads for a plumb lbw decision.
But De Villiers and Bavuma steadied the innings again with a fifth-wicket partnership of 52, before two late wickets lifted Australia at the Wanderers.
The other batsmen out were opener Dean Elgar (19), caught off the leading edge from a Lyon delivery for the third time in the series, and Hashim Amla (27), who edged Cummins to Peter Handscombe at second slip.
