RTC step forward with new Saddling Paddock for August season

As the time approaches for the next race season which kicks off or rather gallops off on August 6, the Royal Turf club (RTC) is currently erecting a new saddling area.
The site selected is behind the current Jockey and Steward rooms on an area that had no visual appeal as it was a dumping ground for refuse. There will be 14 stalls and an additional 4 in an adjoining area for the collection of samples for drug testing by the Sri Lankan Anti-Doping Agency (SLADA). As per the April racing season SLADA will be in attendance at all race meetings conducted by the RTC.
There are several advantages in relocating the saddling area to this position.
First and foremost is that the racehorses once saddled will no longer be required to negotiate the narrow bridge over the stream running through the stable area. As in any high performance athlete, adrenalin starts to kick in once they know they are soon to compete. This is when a racehorse becomes excited and can be flighty.
For the safety of patrons and the welfare of the horses they will now have direct access to the mounting paddock from the saddling area, avoiding any public space. This nullifies the risk of a horse getting away and endangering the lives of the public or injuring themselves, said CEO, RTC, Wayne Wood.
The close proximity of the saddling area to the weighing room will further assist in the RTC running the races at the scheduled time. This is important as all races will be telecast live via Channel Eye again this season commencing on Saturday August 6.

Lankan hopes at Rio Olympics: KIMIKO RAHEEM

The youngest of the three Raheem sisters, who have made a revolution in Sri Lanka swimming,  Kimiko is set to take family traditions in sport to the Olympic level once more when she competes at the Rio 2016 Games.
After the medal-winning performances of her elder sisters  Mayumi and Machiko Raheem at the South Asia Games, young Kimiko became the female competitor with the most number of gold medals at the 2016 South Asian Games in India.
It was a commendable moment for the 17-year-old youngster to win five gold medals in the womens 50m backstroke, 100m backstroke, 200m backstroke, 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 4 x 100m freestyle at the last South Asian Games in Guwahati. Her elder sister Mayumi - Beijing 2008 Olympian, was a household name during her era after her triple gold medals at the 2006 South Asian Games in Colombo.
While Kimiko was invincible in the South Asian swim arena, her elder sister Machiko won the womens 200m freestyle silver medal in Guwahati.
Fresh after a one-year FINA scholarship in Thailand, Kimiko is in good shape for her pet event the womens 100m backstroke at next months Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
It was a good experience in Thailand. I was under a FINA scholarship. We had year-long fulltime hard training in Phuket. It was really useful, to have two to three training sessions a day  16 sessions per week in total, apart from workouts at gymnasium, she said.
I am glad that I had that kind of intensive training. We had a group of 25 swimmers and eight of them would be competing in Rio. We were trained by Spanish coach Miguel Lopez who made a lot of effort to sharpen our skills.
Our coaches in Phuket worked really hard. That was an ideal lead up for the Olympic Games, she said.
Kimiko, in her last international event before the Olympics - the 2016 Thailand Age Group Swimming Championship, bagged six gold medals in the womens 50m backstroke, 100m backstroke, 200m backstroke, 50m freestyle, 100m freestyle and 200m freestyle. Yet, she is unhappy that she had missed the Olympic qualifying timing in the womens 100m backstroke by a whisker.
I was aiming at the Olympic qualification mark of 1:02.36 in the 100m backstroke event but I missed it by a mere 0.27 seconds. Nevertheless, I will make every endeavor to go past that in Rio, a determined Kimiko said.
With only a couple of days away from her departure to Brazil with the Sri Lanka contingent, Kimiko is trying hard to adjust herself to Rio time which is ten hours behind Phuket for which she has been used to for the past one year. At the moment, I struggle a bit to adjust to the time difference.
But I should be alright in two to three days, she added.
It was the family tradition which has influenced young Kimiko to master swimming. I think I was just two years when my parents had first taken me to a pool. But I started serious training from the age of five years.
Obviously, I was influenced by my two elder sisters. I liked it very much and followed their footsteps. On the other hand, the sports backgrounds of my parents too have been an inspiration to the three of us, she said.
Her father had been a swimmer and a rugby player (Ramzy who is a well-known airline pilot) and mother (Ranjika) had been an athlete during their school careers. The Raheems have had a passion for sport, prompting their three daughters to become South Asian Games medallists, sharing eight gold medals, seven silver medals and five bronze medals amongst them in two South Asian Games, a feat which is hard to emulate.
At the 2016 South Asian Games, Mayumis younger sisters secured first and second places in the 50m freestyle event with Kimiko taking the gold in 26.49 seconds followed by her elder sister Machiko who clocked in at 27.4 and ended up with five silver medals and a bronze.
My dream was to make it to the Olympics and I am happy that it is going to become a reality in Rio. I will try my level best to make my presence felt, go pass Olympic qualification timing and also to renew my Sri Lanka record.
It is going to be a tough task but I am equally geared to achieve my target, Kimiko said.
She plans to get back to Thailand after Olympic Games to complete the last two years of her high school career. I have got a full scholarship at the British International School there. I will be completing last two years of my school career. Actually, I am one year behind as I sacrificed full 12 months for my FINA training before the Olympics, she said.
Kimikos ultimate target as a sports personality is to achieve something nobody has done before! The Rio 2016 Games will be a big experience and exposure for me. I will work harder and set my targets at 2020 Olympics, to gain qualifying standards and then make it to at least semi-finals. I also want to make it to the finals or semi-finals of a FINA World Championship, she said.

Mendis batted out  of his skin - Lyon

Off-spinner Nathan Lyon who became the 16th Australian bowler to take 200 Test wickets during the third day of the first Test against Sri Lanka at Pallekele Stadium yesterday was full of praise for young Kusal Mendis who scored his maiden Test century.
The wicket has improved and it has got a bit easier to bat but youve got to give where credit is due, the young fellow to get 169 has batted out of his skin and hes played extremely well, said Lyon at the end of the day.
What stood out in his batting is his composure. He is only 21 and the way he went about it he got a simple game plan and he stuck to it throughout the day. Hats off to him he batted extremely well.
Lyon who made his Test debut in Sri Lanka and took his first Test wicket (Kumar Sangakkara) at Galle in 2005 said his milestone of taking 200th Test wickets has not really sunk in.
I am very proud of it, but it probably hasnt sunk in yet because we are in the middle of a pretty hard Test match, said Lyon. I will look back at the achievement probably at the end of this Test and the series. Its been a pretty good ride so far hope there are a few more to come.
Dhananjaya de Silva became Lyons 200th victim when he was caught by Usman Khawaja for 36.
Lyon said that losing the services of left-arm spinner Steve OKeefe in the 49th over was a big loss and added: Its a big loss to lose someone like Sockers, a quality bowler on a wicket like that.
To see him go off the field early and for Australia to lose an important member of their bowling attack is a pretty big loss for us. He is very talented in these conditions. Injuries happen in cricket and we as a bowling unit have got to bounce back and pull together for him and hopefully get the right result for us.
The way the Test match is poised Lyon said, We havent written off Sri Lanka. For those guys to come and play in their back yard, know the conditions really well, we knew it was going to be a hard Test in the series. You cant give the team a sniff but credit to Mendis who scored 169 not out and batted extremely well. He has steered them into a strong position but we are confident enough to come back and take early wickets and then get batting.
We missed our half chances and its been a tough day for the Australian bowlers but the good thing about Test match cricket is you can bounce back tomorrow and look forward to take the new ball and hopefully take some early wickets.
Look to chase down whatever they set us. Theyve been pretty good today, simple batting plan and there are no demons out there and they scored runs. One big positive thats been proved is that we can score runs, he said.

Second Sri Lankan to reach maiden Test century with a six : Kusal  thwarts  Australia with a Mendis Special

Twenty-one year-old Kusal Mendis emerged as Sri Lankas savior when he scored a magnificent unbeaten maiden Test century in conditions not suitable for stroke-making to prevent Australia from running away with the first Test at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
Mendis was 169 not out scored off 243 balls when bad light ended play early on the third day with Sri Lanka 282 for six wickets  an overall lead of 196 with four second innings wickets in hand.
Dilruwan Perera was the other not out batsman on five. Australia have the second new ball first thing in the morning today and will be looking to finish off the Lankan innings as quickly as possible and set themselves a target which is within their reach.
Sri Lanka made 117 in their first innings and Australia replied with 203.
It was an extraordinary innings from Mendis from what has already gone before on the first two days when 21 wickets fell and no batsmen could score more than 47.
Mendis who came to the wicket early at the start of play yesterday when Mitchell Starc trapped Dimuth Karunaratne for a duck with the fifth ball of the morning and batted throughout nearly two sessions putting up a faultless display of batting.
The nearest he came to being dismissed was at 69 when the Australians went for a review for an lbw decision off left-arm spinner Steve OKeefe.
Playing the seventh Test of his career Mendis who has shown a lot of promise of doing something big from the time he made his way into the Sri Lanka Test side against the West Indies at the P Sara Oval last year showed that he had arrived with an innings full of flamboyance that saw him strike 20 fours and a six in his 312 minutes stay at the crease.
Mendis had eight scores of over 25 runs in his first 13 Test innings and prior to his memorable maiden Test hundred he had 53 as his highest Test score made in difficult conditions against England at Leeds in May against the likes of Anderson, Broad and Finn.
There was never a dull moment when Mendis was at the crease. He was always busy keeping the fielders on their toes with some deft placements and brisk running between the wickets interspersed by a flow of boundaries whenever the bowlers erred in line or length.
Mendis went to his maiden Test hundred in style reaching it with a slog sweep for six off Nathan Lyon over midwicket off 143 balls. Among the Sri Lankans only Aravinda de Silva had got to his maiden Test hundred with a six when he hooked Pakistan fast bowler Imran Khan at Faisalabad in October 1985. De Silva was only 19 then and the youngest Sri Lankan to score a maiden Test hundred. Asanka Gurusinha took the record from him five months later by becoming the youngest by a lesser number of months.
Mendis knock of 169 not out is the highest score by a Sri Lankan against Australia in Sri Lanka beating Asanka Gurusinhas innings of 137 at the SSC in 1992. He reached the 150 mark in the final over before tea by crashing a short Lyon delivery through the covers for his 18th four.
It is also the second highest score made by a Sri Lankan in reaching his maiden Test century. Only Brendon Kuruppus double century (201 not out) v New Zealand at the CCC grounds in 1987 stands in his way.
Mendis is also 24 runs shy of becoming the highest scorer for Sri Lanka against Australia. The present record is held by Kumar Sangakkara who scored 192 at Hobart in 2007.
Sri Lanka lost the wickets of Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva (7) and Angelo Mathews (9) pretty cheaply to be 86-4 at one stage. But Mendis found in vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal a useful ally and the pair quietly but surely built up a partnership in mid-afternoon to frustrate the Australians.
They added 117 off 186 balls for the fifth wicket before Chandimal lost his wicket falling lbw to Marsh for 42, but debutant Dhananjaya de Silva once again batted with positive intent and helped Mendis build another useful partnership that produced 71 runs for the sixth wicket. De Silvas share was 36.
Australia was somewhat handicapped when OKeefe went out of the firing line having to retire hurt with a right hamstring injury while fielding in the 49th over of the innings. His injury was being assessed. OKeefe had to pull up after bowling two deliveries of his 17th over and retire. Voges filled the void by completing the over.

Batting legend  Aravinda de Silva:  Kusal bats a  lot like Mahela

Batting legend Aravinda de Silva who was the only Sri Lankan to reach a maiden Test century with a six said that Kusal Mendis who emulated his feat at the Pallekele Stadium yesterday had the makings of a cricketer who could reach great heights in the game.
His calm aggression shows the character of the person he is. Hes got all the material to make it big, said De Silva after Mendis had swept spinner Nathan Lyon for six to reach his first three-figure innings in Test cricket playing in his seventh Test.
Kusal tends to bat a lot like Mahela Jayawardene. If he can maintain the same standards as Mahela I am sure he will be able to reach the same lofty heights as Mahela did, said De Silva. I have seen Kusal when he played in the under 19 side and he showed he had a lot of potential. He was fast-tracked into the national team and it is now paying great dividends.
De Silva scored his maiden Test century playing in his fifth Test against Pakistan when he hooked fast bowler Imran Khan for six in the first Test played at Faisalabad in 1985.
De Silva went onto score 19 more hundreds in a 93-Test career.  ST

Pallekele happy hunting ground for Mendis

Pallekele International Stadium it seems is a happy ground for Kusal Mendis who scored his maiden Test century on it yesterday taking on the Australian bowling by the scruff of its neck to give Sri Lanka a whiff of victory in the first Test.
Thanks to Mendis brilliant knock of 169 not out Sri Lanka who were wobbling at six for two at one stage ended the third day at 282 for six wickets  a lead of 196.
Im very happy today because I scored my maiden first-class century here in Pallekele and also my first Test hundred at the same venue today, said Mendis.
The Australians have a very good bowling attack but we played them better in our second innings. When I walked into bat, I clearly knew what my role was going to be. I stuck to my plans and just did what was required.
I didnt try to go in search of runs. Just tried to understand how the wicket played and try to accumulate runs with singles, he said.
Mendis said Australia losing one of their front line bowlers Steve OKeefe to a hamstring injury made batting a bit easier.
He was their main weapon against the right-handers. I think his injury affected their game plan. From our point of view, I was more comfortable against the offie (Nathan Lyon), said Mendis. Reaching his maiden Test hundred with a six Mendis said was not a pre-determined shot.
I usually play the sweep and at that moment, I just felt to go for that shot.
By reaching his maiden Test hundred with a six Mendis became only the second Sri Lankan batsman to do so after Aravinda de Silva who did it 31 years ago against Pakistan at Faisalabad.
Mendis said that he owed his success to practicing a lot and to the many people around him including the current players who come and point out his mistakes at practice and advice him on how to correct it. ST
