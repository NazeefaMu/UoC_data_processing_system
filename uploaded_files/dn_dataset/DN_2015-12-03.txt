Alternate views not split in SLFP - Dilan
Outsiders are not permitted to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) for political gains. Even though there are two alternative views in the SLFP, yet there are no fractions in the party, Minister Dilan Perera said.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press beefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
Perera said that parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila has said that he will drag the UPFA to the fourth place at the forthcoming local government elections.
However, he accepted that there are two alternative views in the SLFP. "But it is clear that some are trying to convert these two alternative views into two fractions," he said.
"His (Gammanpila) saying indicates that he has undertaken a contract to bring the UNP at the first place at the local government elections. Anyone has total freedom to day-dream but those dreams will never come true," he said.
The minister added that the Budget 2016 has plus as well as minus points. The budget has tremendous steps for the betterment of the education sector. Under this, undergraduates will be allowed to obtain interest free loans for their educational needs. A housing scheme will be carried for estate employees. However, several proposals of the budget should be re-considered. The proposals relating to vehicle permits, vehicle emission testing tax should be revised. The budget has not concentrated on coconut and tea cultivators and growers when giving the fertiliser subsidy.
The people-friendly UPFA parliamentarians will vote in favour of the Budget 2016 at the third reading on December 19, he said.
Perera said that the SLFP will move forward under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle said around 85 percent are provided with hygienic water supply by the Water Supplies Board and by community water schemes. Moves have been taken to provide the vulnerable people for kidney disease with pure drinking water under an expedited project. She said that the ministry is engaged in planning 100 towns aiming to set up systematic well-planned towns. As a remedy to the high traffic congestion experienced in Colombo city and suburbs, the 'Park and Ride' method will be implemented in future.
Under this motorists can park their private vehicles at parking plots established out of Colombo and reach Colombo using public transport system. It has been planned to establish parking slots in suburbs such as Moratuwa, Ja-ela, etc. Moreover as a remedy to the high traffic jam, two new highways will be established. Under this project a new highway will be constructed from Borella to Kaduwela and Kelaniya to Fort.
Speaking on the forthcoming local government election, Minister Perera said all UPFA local government members will be allowed to contest at the election. Besides, several new faces will be added under the consent of the organiser of the electorate.

Britain's Prince Charles frets about future of French cheese
FRANCE: Britain's Prince Charles said Monday he feared for the very existence of traditional French cheeses as he received a prize in Paris for his long-term commitment to organic farming.
Having spoken earlier at the opening of the key UN climate talks outside Paris, the heir to the throne was awarded the Francois Rabelais prize by France's institute of sciences and arts, named after the Renaissance scholar and physician. Charles told an audience of distinguished scientists under the institute's domed roof in the French capital: "The distinctiveness of local cuisine is one of the most important ways we identify with the places and regions we love."
He recalled a visit to Paris in 1992 when he pleaded the case for British specialist cheese producers -- and said that more than two decades on, his concerns were only heightened in a world of genetically modified produce. "What will become of the Brie de Meaux, the Crottin de Chavignol or the Bleu d'Auvergne" the 67-year-old asked.
"In a microbe-free, progressive and genetically engineered future, what hope is there for the old-fashioned Fourme d'Ambert, the mal-formed Gruyere de Comte or the odorous Pont L'Eveque"
The prince said that while it may sound "silly" to say so, "a very important part of the whole magnificent edifice of European civilisation rests on the inherited genius and craftsmanship of the people who make such distinguished concoctions".
He hailed the French government for launching an initiative to raise awareness of the fact that the world's soils hold three times as much carbon as the atmosphere. "They have calculated that if the quantity of carbon contained in soils could be increased by just 0.4 percent per year, the annual increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could be halted."

Budget poses danger - Prof. Tissa Vitharana
The entire country is against the Budget 2016. This is the most dangerous budget ever presented to Parliament. The budget does not offer tax relief for investments. The country will face the same fate as Greece, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the budget has allowed foreigners to suck the essence of the country. The country had US $ 8.2 billion worth foreign reserves when the government was taken over by the UNP. It has gone down to US $ 4.5 billion when the loan obtained from India deducted from the total amount. The budget gap was to be reduced to 4.2 percent, but now, it is seven percent, Prof. Vitharana said.
Prof. G.L. Peiris said the Common opposition will launch a well planned programme to rescue the country from the destruction and to ensure people's say. Legal action will be taken against anything and anyone to protect the people. The government only expects praise from foreign countries. It could have been obtained during the previous government. But, it protected Sri Lanka's dignity, territorial integrity and sovereignty. Sri lanka is not a colony of any country to listen to and follow outsiders' orders.
Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the government will win the budget 2016 by using the UPFA MPs snatched by them. The UPFA MPs were snatched by the government opposing the people's mandate and abusing the universal franchise, he said.

From Thanamalwila the Funds were later extended to Ruwalwala, Boralanda, Jaffna and Kilinochchi.

Docs, unions to strike today
Seventeen Unions, including the GMOA will engage in a countrywide strike from 8.00 a.m. today against the 2016 budget proposals, Convener, Joint Committee of Executive Officers in All Island Services, Dr. Nirmal Karunasiri said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka (OPA), Dr. Karunasiri said that it is just the beginning and the strike will be called off considering the government's response.
He said the strike action is being taken against the reduction of benefits for public servants, including doctors.
"Not all politicians are professionals therefore they do not respect the service rendered by the professionals to the country," he said.
Dr Karunasiri emphasized that they seek a practical solution to its issues before the Budget 2016 approved by the Parliament.
The GMOA and the other unions decided to resort to strike action as the authorities failed to respond to its key issues with respect to several proposals suggested in the Budget 2016, Government Medical Officers Association Spokesman Dr. Naveen Soysa said.
He pointed out that certain proposals in the 2016 Budget discouraged state sector employees and added that this is an attempt to privatise the state sector.
"The decision to go on strike was the last option the association had. The government failed to respond to our letters and the discussions through which we attempted to solve the issue. The GMOA held discussions with Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne but he could not give an assurance to our demands," he added.
All the 17 associations are not asking for something new but request the government not to reduce the prestige of the government servants, Dr Soysa said.
"The government servants work on behalf of the people. Therefore people should stand against the proposals made by the government that affect the government servants and the people in general," he said. The GMOA also protested against the cancellation of duty free vehicle permits to government officers including doctors. GMOA Secretary, Dr Nalinda Herath said the unions do not intend to cause danger to the lives of the patients.
He said that The Lady Ridgway hospital, De Soysa Maternity Hospital, Castle Hospital, Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children's Hospital in Peradeniya and island wide cancer hospitals will not engage in the strike action.

Obama tells Russia, Turkey to focus on IS
SYRIA: US President Barack Obama led calls Tuesday for Turkey and Russia to end their dispute over the downing of a Russian fighter jet and focus instead on the real enemy -- Islamic State jihadists.
It came as Obama's Pentagon chief said the US would increasingly rely on special operations forces to battle IS fighters in Iraq and Syria, where the extremists have seized huge swathes of territory including oil fields used to fund their activities.
The US president said he was sure that Russia would soon change tack in Syria and back a political solution to the bloody conflict after years of supporting long-time ally President Bashar al-Assad, who Washington insists must step down.
And NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged Turkey and Russia to find a way to avoid a repeat of the jet incident, which threatens to scupper efforts to forge a common anti-IS front in the wake of attacks in Paris claimed by the group that left 130 dead.
Obama was frank about what both sides should do.
"I want to be very clear: Turkey is a NATO ally. The US supports Turkish rights to defend itself and its airspace and its territory," Obama said after meeting his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Paris. "We all have a common enemy and that is ISIL, and I want to make sure we focus on that threat," Obama said, using an alternative name for IS.
Erdogan, who has demanded that Russian President Vladimir Putin provide evidence to back up charges Ankara trades in oil with the IS group, said he too was keen to move on. "We are always willing to resort to the diplomatic language (...) we want to avoid the tensions," he said.Stoltenberg, speaking at the start of a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers, said the focus should be on "how we can de-escalate and calm tensions (and find) mechanisms so that we can avoid the type of incident we saw last week."
The Turkish air force shot down the Russian jet last week for allegedly violating its airspace near the Syrian border. One Russian pilot was shot dead in Syria after parachuting from the burning aircraft, while the second was found safe and sound. One Russian soldier was killed in a rescue operation.

Former President spent Rs. 1,152 on expenses annually - Ravi
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament yesterday, that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa spent Rs.1,152 billion on expenses annually, but present President Maithripala Sirisena is spending only Rs. 337 billion which is a huge saving.
The minister said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not participate in the debate, but had made comments on the budget proposals addressing people at temples.
Winding up the speech, Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that 182 MPs had participated in the budget debate. There were some constructive ideas and proposals as well as negative responses. We
prepared this budget with the intention of creating a new economy.
He said that MP Rajapaksa draws both a MPs salary and pension entitled to him as former President. He responded to many comments made by the opposition in newspapers.
The new government has allocated the largest ever funds for education from the budget of 2016, while previous governments could never allocate such an amount for education from their annual budgets.
The previous government also agreed to sell 216 acres of the Port City outright to the Chinese. They alleged that today we are attempting to sell lands to foreigners. But we are not doing so. We will give lands to foreigners only on a 99 year lease.
We will rebuild this country. We intend to increase investments and local products. We did not increase the budget deficit. But the former government was engaged in massive white elephant projects which caused Rs. 280 billion. These projects have commenced even without calling for tenders and Cabinet approval.
This budget has allocated a massive capital expenditure since 1977.
Lack of pension funds is a major problem in our country. The governmentis seeking to establish a contributory pension fund for government servants with an initial capital of Rs. 1 billion. The budget has also allocated Rs.14 billion to improve the livelihood activities and infrastructure facilities in the North and East. Minister of Telecommunication & Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando, said this is historic political moment, it being the first budget of the new unity government. We have been able to provide a number of reliefs for the benefit of the common man.
The Mahapola scheme will be increased up to Rs.5,000. Former Minister Bandula Gunawardene said that a family could live on Rs.2,500 and it is such an era that we have changed. Out of the six million vehicle population in the country, around 4 million vehicles are mainly motor cycles and three-wheelers, which would not be liable for the increase of emission test fee.
State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said the budget had been aimed at giving relief to the poor people and developing the country. We have given subsidies when necessary. But we cannot
please everyone through this budget. So what we want is to see the whole nation getting all the benefits. UPFP MP Pavithra Vanniarachchi said it is a question whether this budget can be turned on the right path even with all the proposed amendments. There is no vision and long term development plan in this budget.
Present govt following unsuccessful path - Anura
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told in Parliament yesterday, that the JVP is ready to join in a debate within a week regarding the youth uprising which occurred in 1989, to find out who breached the laws.
Responding to comments by MPs Susil Premajayantha, Dilan Perera and Minister Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe during the budget debate, the JVP Leader also said the history of the JVP had no connections to budget 2016.
He also said that it is unfair for allocating time for members of the joint opposition for the debate from the time allocated to the opposition. Both UNPers and the SLFPers represent the present government and the members of the joint opposition have not informed Parliament that they function as independent MPs.
If they really want to allocate time from the opposition, they should have informed Parliament that they function as independent MPs such as Sri Ranga and Ajith Kumara.
He also questioned the government as to whether they were elected to Parliament by the votes of foreigners. Highlighting that the Budget 2016 had provided relief to the foreigners but not to the local people.
During the previous regime, the countrys economy had been bankrupt and there was a rapid increase of crime and suicide. The countrys exports had been heavily reduced during the previous regime.
He also noted the present government was following an unsuccessful economic path.
Kiriella dubious as to whether KDU is accepted by Medical Council
Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, yesterday stated that he was dubious if the Medical Faculty of the Kotelawala Defence University is accepted by the Medical Council.
He made this observation yesterday while Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the KDU.
State Minister Wijewardena stated that so far 137 foreign students have been enrolled to the KDU Medical Faculty, while 195 locals have been enrolled. The State Minister said the KDU Medical Faculty is accepted by the University Grants Commission. We don't know if the KDU Medical Faculty is accepted by the Medical Council, Minister Kiriella said.
Admission to national schools:
No political intervention - Akila
There had been no political intervention on admission of students to national schools since January 12 this year, said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
He also said that the government would not in any way hesitate to take immediate action in that regard.
Minister Kariyawasam made these observations yesterday in response to a supplementary question raised by Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma, following his question for oral answer. MP Alahapperuma questioned whether the minister was aware that four students who had obtained lesser marks at the scholarship examination, had been admitted to the Matara Mahinda Rajapaksa Vidyalaya.
No influence had been made to admit students to schools since January 12, the Minister said. Give me those details, Ill take actions in that connection, he said. The Minister said further that the government had not halted constructions of the Matara Mahinda Rajapaksa Vidyalaya. He added that this governments objective is to increase the quality of education.
He also said that the construction of the hostel of the same school had been halted due to lack of allocations made in the previous year. He said that however the construction would be completed soon.
Amalgamation of Divi Neguma funds with NSB wont be allowed - SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said that he would not allow the amalgamation of the Divi Neguma funds and National Savings Bank (NSB), as the Divi Neguma fund had helped the poor people immensely.
We urge the Finance Ministry to strengthen the Divi Neguma fund instead of amalgamating it with any other institution, he said.
Participating in the debate on the second reading of the Budget 2016, the minister said when the Samurdhi programme was initiated in 1995, the poverty ratio was 26.7 percent. Today it has come down to 6.4 percent.
This shows the massive contribution made by the Samurdhi programme to eradicate poverty in the country. This also turned into a saving and social security scheme. We have planned to increase its benefits to the Samurdhi benefactors in the future.
The Opposition had claimed that there are so many deals in this budget and the government should probe these claims. This is the first budget presented by a unity government. Although President Maithripala
Sirisena is the countrys leader, this budget has been designed mainly by the UNP, depending on its needs.
We have also some problems regarding certain aspects of the budget. We have discussed it with the Prime Minister and resolved many issues.
However, we should not despair, but we should resolve any issue and move forward. The main objective of the two main parties joining together is is to resolve the main problems affecting the country for a long time.
UPFA MP Rohitha Abeygunawardene said the budget had being designed to fill the pockets of the cronies of the government. Taxes have been reduced on tile imports to provide an advantage to certain persons. This would affect local tile manufacturers badly and the industry would collapse. Taxes have been increased heavily on vehicles, including a Rs.3.7 million tax on Hi Ace vans.
TNA MP Mavai S. Senathirajah said that people of the North and East contributed immensely to elect this government.
The problems of these people have still not been solved and these should be discussed directly with the TNA, without going through third parties.
Former President did not fulfill his duties as MP - Ajith
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said in Parliament yesterday, that new laws and regulations should be brought to Parliament for the abolishment of parliamentary membership of MPs who do not fulfill their duties.
He was joining the Second Reading Debate on Budget Proposals 2016 for the 9th allotted day.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said that there were MPs who had not made a single speech in Parliament, since being elected to Parliament.
He also said that Kurunegala District Parliamentarian former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not take part in the budget debate and did not fulfill his duties as a MP.
Those MPs who have been elected to Parliament from the valuable votes of the people, have the responsibility to raise their voices on behalf of these people. If the MPs cannot fulfill their duties, should resign from the post, the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister said the Budget 2016 is consisting of a proper economic plan which is highly appropriate to the country.
He also emphasized the necessity of allowing private sector investments in power generating activities under better conditions, as the government had no capacity to do so alone. But the government is responsible to ensure the electricity needs of the country.
The government is currently experimenting with regard to the innovative social market economy. Both UNP and the SLFP have agreed to help this experiment.
Condemning allegations made by the opposition claiming that the government was selling lands to foreigners, the Deputy Minister said that the government is making a huge effort to provide legal ownership to the lands where innocent people live in and not for foreigners.
Students suicide: TNA attempting to gain political mileage - Devananda
Foreign Ministet Mangala Samaraweera yesterday observed in Parliament that he would reply EPDP Leader Douglas Devanadas query on the Tamil Youths suicide incident and to divulge the real picture in that regard.
Devananda making a special statement in Parliament, condemned the TNA for trying to gain political mileage by provoking the youth in the North.
He also accused the TNA of playing politics with the Tamil prisoners issue.
They earlier said they would have discussions with the government to get these prisoners released and obtain the lands acquired by the military and the government, Devananda said. What had happened to those discussions Now they are criticizing the government and provoking the youth against the government. He said that provocations were made for petty political advantages and not for the love of those Tamil youth.
At this stage raising a point of TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said the matter did not come under Standing Order 23-2. He said the provisions are made for the opposition and not to criticism another political party in the opposition.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government would answer such a question and the opposition parties should solve their problems.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala however permitted MP Devananda to continue with his statement.
Devananda said the incident concerning the student Rajeshwaran Senthurans suicide was a sensitive issue. He said he conveyed his sympathies to the victims family. He said a day would dawn when the youth would react against those forces who are attempting to provoke them.
Tikiri Jayathilake appointed Asst. Secy. General
Kasturiarachchige Tikiri Jayathilake was appointed as Assistant Secretary General of Parliament, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala announced in Parliament yesterday.

It was a pathetic situation that Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, avoided to join the second reading debate on the budget while taking a salary of Rs. 349,000, including allowances, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was a matter to be sad that although Mahinda Rajapaksa did not speak in Parliament, he spoke at temples concerning the budget.
He made this observation in reply to the members who joined the second reading debate on the budget proposals for financial year 2016.
Karunanayake said that Rajapaksa had been taking a payment of Rs. 97,000 as pension on the Presidential portfolio since March this year. He said Rajapaksa is also taking the salary of an MP which is Rs. 54,000. He also questioned as to what would happen if an ordinary public servant obtained two salaries from public funds
The minister said that Rajapaksa had a responsibility to join the debate as he was the former President as well as the former Finance Minister.
He said that his behaviour was a disrespect to the voters who voted to him.

"Hopefully if the Port City project gets underway - there will be some sort of landfill there - that could have the makings of a special financial and business district which will be a unique one in South Asia," Wickremesinghe said addressing an event held to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The controversial project which commenced under the last regime ran into troubled waters as the then opposition and activists questioned the viability.
Following the January 8 election the project was put on hold until additional assessments were conducted and approval given by the previous government were re-evaluated.

RAF Tornado jets have carried out their first air strikes against so-called Islamic State in Syria, the UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed.

Four Tornados from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus took part in the operation soon after MPs voted to approve bombing.
The strikes targeted the Omar oil fields in eastern Syria, which is under IS control, and were "successful", Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said.

He had personally approved the targets ahead of the Commons vote, he said. On Wednesday, MPs voted by 397 votes to 223 for UK military action against IS - also known as Daesh - in Syria after a 10-hour Commons debate. Mr Fallon said the Ministry of Defence would be assessing the damage done by the bombing later, but the aim was to strike "a very real blow on the oil and revenue on which Daesh depends". (BBC)

Fijian firepower for Lanka Lions at Dubai Rugby Sevens
Roger Rodrigo to play in tournament for 27th year
Lanka Lions will be boosted by Fijian firepower at the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby Sevens this weekend as they make a serious bid to win the elusive Gulf Men's Open title.
Cup runners-up in 2013 and semifinalists last year, Lanka Lions are bubbling with confidence after romping to victory in the Eden Park Sevens Series Dubai leg a fortnight ago.
"We are going win the cup. I have confidence in the side because of the way boys are playing. We have worked hard and the commitment that they showed this year is tremendous," said former Arabian Gulf and Sri Lanka rugby great Roger Rodrigo.
The two Fijians Vito Tuivione and Ranato Tavite could hold the key to success for the Lankans.
"The boys learnt from every game and they went up a level," said Tavite of the Lanka Lions performance in the Eden Park tournament.
"We are carrying two Fijians to make it more open, a little more flair to the side," said Rodrigo who is set to play for a record 27th time at the Dubai Sevens.
"The Fijians coming in makes us more stronger and gives us more confidence," added Madisha Silva who will be leading out Lanka Lions for the third year at the Dubai Sevens.
Lanka Lions coach Richard Murcott said the Fijians would be used to cause more impact though they were not short of firepower.
"Fijians coming in has brought a different dimension to the game. This is just an added bonus to the side. Adds a bit of flair but what we have noticed is the Fijians want to play the style we are playing right now," said Murcott.
"Definitely they will add more control to the game. We know that we are the fastest side. We have superb finishers in Ameen (Jamail), Dulanka (Gunasekera), captain Madisha (Silva) and Akalanka (Dabare)," explained Murcott who said the players were fit and raring to go.
"We were ready a week or two ago. They have recovered from injuries. Boys are fit and new (defence) plan seems to be sticking with them also. Not that we are overconfident, at the same time we are quite confident that we will put up a good show," he declared.
"We have been training on our defence. We have good attacking skills but since we are up against big boys, we need to have good defence lines," said Silva, a former Peterite Sevens captain.
Three players will be making their debut at the Dubai Sevens for Lanka Lions.
They are Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Gamage and Akalanka Dabare.
"Gayashan and Dilshan playing in pack are making impact to the side. Big difference last year was we had smaller forwards," said Silva.
"I'm perfectly fine. I twisted ankle during the tournament but 100 per cent ready to go. Always wanted to play Dubai Sevens and we are playing to win the tournament," said Wijayasinghe, a former Royal flanker.
Lanka Lions were spoilt for choice when finalising their squad.
"This year, the talent that has come is really good than over the last few years. Choosing the final playing squad was a bit of a tough task for the management. Eden Park was a good start for this season. We are just hoping that the boys and veterans can take it forward from there and be able to lift the bigger one," said Roshan De Silva, manager of the Lanka Lions squad who thanked their sponsors.
The main sponsor is Aramex, Ice Watch Spectra, Fairway Holdings, Union Insurance with People's Bank, Sri Lankan airline, Beyond the Beach and Suren Agencies, being the support sponsors.
"Without sponsors we cannot afford to play this tournament because cost is so high. We have to provide medical insurance for 35 players," said Rodrigo, rugby co-ordinator of Lanka Lions.
Former Trinity centre Azarath Deen was confident the Lanka Lions Vets could also win some silverware.
"We have got very good opportunity to win something for Lanka Lions. Roger will be part of our squad and add on to punch as scrum half. This time we also have a few players who have come from Men's like Achala Silva," added Deen.
Lanka Lions squad for Gulf Men's Open:
Madisha Silva (Captain), Ameen Nizamdeen (Vice Captain), Mohamed Rilwan, Dulanka Gunasekara, Akalanka Dabare, Anura Perera, Philip Asinghearachchige, Tuan Zalique Jayah, Vito Tuivione, Hilmy 'Bebo' Mohammed, Ranato Tavite, Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Gamage and Asif Akram.

Severe shortage of manpower - SLASSPA
The 11th Annual General Meeting of SLASSPA (Sri Lanka Security Service Provider Association), under the theme "Thinking Beyond Borders" was held on Novermber 28 at theTaj Samudra, Colombo under the distinguished patronage of Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Defence.
Delivering the welcome address, Major Tissa Aluwihare, President of SLASSPA, said that the presence of Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi was a great boost for the entire industry and a motivating thought for all stakeholders in the quest to uplift the industry. He noted that this gesture set a positive note for the future to achieve the aim of "One Vision, One Industry, One culture" for the Security Industry.
Speaking further, he stated that the Industry is faced with some major challenges such as the severe shortage of manpower, ruthless price undercutting, non-compliance of certain companies - for example, by not paying even the stipulated minimum wages to hard-working guards, by not paying EPF/ETF, by letting guards work in in-humane working conditions.
As a first important step Major Aluwihare initiated the first ever "CEO Forum late 2014, to which SLASSPA invited all the stakeholders of the industry to educate them on the need to be compliant as a first priority - for example: pay their salaries and statutory benefits properly and timely.
"In the 3rd phase, we then invited all the stakeholders to a forum with the theme "Think beyond Borders", where we addressed the owners of the security companies not to undercut prices, but to demand fair, workable rates from potential new clients as otherwise it would only result in a disgruntled guard force delivering poor service. A "no-win" situation for the guards, the clients and the company".
"Such a scenario can only be achieved if awareness levels for each other's' needs are high and TRUST between all parties has been established. As good industrialists, we can all make that difference. The bottom line issue remains: The very poor trust levels that exist in this industry".
The chief guest, Eng Karunasena Hettiarachchi, stated that this was the first occasion on which he was meeting the leaders of the Industry, since taking over as Secretary Defense last month. He said it is heartening to note, that a majority of the recognized security companies are within the SLASSPA fold, and that this augurs well for the industry.
Speaking further, he said "Commercial security is an important auxiliary arm of the security machinery in the country and augments resources of the law & order establishment as part of the national security grid."
He made it clear, that he in his new capacity would insist on industry-wide adherence to standards, as this is the only way to uplift the image and respect for the trade. This can only be achieved by compliance with statutory requirements, such as the payment of minimum wages and EPF/ETF etc. As the drivers of the Industry, he mentioned, it is crucial for all members of SLASSPA to set an example in this regard, which compels the rest of the Industry to follow.
Col. Jayavi Fernando, SLASSPA Senior Vice President, also spoke on the occasion.

SL contemplates standby agreement with IMF-PM
Sri Lanka has made a request from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help in rewriting the tax code and informed them the need for a standby agreement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The unpredictable global economic and political scenarios will determine the fate of the global economy including Sri Lanka in the coming year, he said, addressing an event held yesterday to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Sri Lankas economy is likely to reach a 6.5% growth next year and all efforts have to be mobilized towards reducing the budget deficit to 3.5% of the gross national production in the medium term by 2020, and reach the goal of becoming a high per-capita income country by 2030, he noted.
We have to maintain our momentum and ensure whatever happens there is a 6.5% growth rate for next year.
There may be some unforeseen circumstances which case not only our economies but most of the emerging market economies will have to take a downward plunder. But thats not going to be on macroeconomic policies, it is going to be something outside that. But then from 6.5% what may be the problems we face we have to go to a higher growth rate.
We have to achieve a 8% growth and aim at getting 9%. Now this is a difficult task but not impossible.
We have to have structural reforms to facilitate investment and growth. We want to ensure an expanding and strong middle class in this country, the premier said. Speaking on the Colombo Port City Development Project, Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka will have a unique financial and business district in Colombo when the stalled Chinese funded Colombo port city project is resumed.
Hopefully if the Port City projects gets underway; there will be some sort of landfill there ; that could have the makings of a special financial and business district which will be a unique one in South Asia, Wickremesinghe added.

Sri Lanka doctors strike to demand tax-free cars

Thousands of doctors in Sri Lanka's state-run hospitals went on strike on Thursday to demand the government reinstate their right to import tax-free cars after withdrawing the perk in the latest budget.
Sri Lanka imposes import taxes of between 200 and 300 percent on cars, but government workers have always been able to buy them at concessionary rates -- a privilege withdrawn in the 2016 budget.
"We are maintaining only emergency services," said Nalinda Herath, secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) of the one-day strike.
"We have had talks with the health minister, but he was unable to give us an assurance to restore the permits" to import cars tax-free, he added.
Civil servants are also taking action to protest the government's decision, with a "work to rule" campaign from Thursday.
The finance ministry said last month it was abolishing the special car permits for government workers, including police and military, because it was costing the state too much money.
The move was also aimed at stemming the practice of selling car permits to traders, who have flooded the market with luxury vehicles.

Suu Kyi begins transition talks with Myanmar President
MYANMAR: Myanmar's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi held "warm and open" talks with the president on the transfer of power from the military establishment, a minister said Wednesday, nearly a month after her opposition party cleaned up at the polls.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won nearly 80 percent of contested seats in a November 8 election which appears poised to end the military's decades-long domination of the country.
Immediately after her party's win Suu Kyi, who is blocked from the presidency by the army-written constitution, appealed for "national reconciliation" talks with President Thein Sein and the powerful army chief.
Both men have congratulated her on the NLD's win and vowed to ensure a smooth handover of power to the opposition -- an unprecedented moment in the country's history.
But opposition supporters remain wary of a military establishment that has duped them before and crushed political opponents.
The new NLD lawmakers are not due to take their parliamentary seats until at least February, making for a nervous few months of transition.
The NLD won a similar scale landslide in 1990 polls, only to see the military annul the result and dig in for another two decades.
Nearly an hour of talks were held on Wednesday morning between Suu Kyi -- a Nobel Peace Prize winner -- and Thein Sein, a former top junta general who has shed his uniform to steer reforms over recent years.
"They discussed the peaceful transfer to the next government. The discussion was warm and open," Information Minister Ye Htut who was at the meeting told reporters.
"We have no tradition of the peaceful (power) transfer to a new elected government since we gained independence in 1948. We will establish this tradition without fail," he added.
The NLD confirmed the meeting in a Facebook page but gave no immediate details.
Observers have praised Myanmar for holding a peaceful and broadly free and fair election after half a century of authoritarian rule.
