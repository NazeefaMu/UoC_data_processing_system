Budget proposals would destroy shipping and freight Forwarding
Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents (CASA) and Sri Lanka Logistics and Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) strongly object to the governments budget proposal to lift the remaining restriction of 60% on foreign ownership in shipping and freight forwarding agencies, they said in a news release.
The proposal will not bring any significant benefit to the industries and the economy and in fact will have an adverse impact to the national interest of the country, they said in a joint release.
The removal of restrictions on foreign ownership will not bring in any additional investments or benefits to the country as envisaged.
There will be no new investments by shipping lines and freight forwarders as a result of this policy change. Local companies have already invested in the required infrastructure to support the shipping lines and logistics activities such as in container depots, freight stations, logistics parks, transportation, etc.
Such a policy change would enable shipping lines and freight forwarders to repatriate hundred percent of profits instead of reinvestment locally. They will convert the agencies to cost centres reducing the employment of Sri Lankans and depriving the government of substantial tax revenue.
All major shipping lines and freight networks are currently represented in Sri Lanka and the lifting of restrictions will not bring any new shipping lines or freight networks into the country. With the expansion of capacity (eg., CICT ) in the Port of Colombo shipping lines brought in new services with larger vessels and more volumes in a short period of time.
With continuing expansion of capacity, shipping lines will bring in further new services/volumes predominantly due to Sri Lankas strategic location, the
availability of deep water terminal facilities coupled with competitive port and terminal tariffs and service excellence comparable to competing hubs.
The contention that the shipping lines and logistics operators will base their operations in Sri Lanka as a result of this legislative change is incorrect due to the fact that currently there is no restriction on shipping lines or logistics operators setting up their hundred percent owned headquarters or regional offices in Sri Lanka.
The shipping industry in Sri Lanka, is, in fact, already liberalised where any foreign ship owner can freely operate their vessels in Sri Lanka. Existing restriction applies to shipping agency/freight forwarding functions only and not to investments in other facets of the shipping lines/logistics activities.
The restriction in foreign ownership of shipping agencies/freight forwarding has not inhibited shipping lines interests in investing in port terminal capacity in Sri Lanka as displayed in the expression of interest for ECT where all major shipping lines and terminal operators submitted bids.
There are currently in excess of 750 local shipping and freight forwarding and clearing agents employing over 12,000 direct staff most of whose jobs would be at risk as would the enterprises themselves. Further, the management positions will be filled by expatriate staff depriving Sri Lankan professionals. The indirectly linked staff would be as much as 100,000, whose employment also would be at stake.
Shipping agents have also diversified into seafarer training and education and over the years have produced a pool of some 35,000 employed and employable personnel for global carriers and contribute in excess of US$250 million per annum.
Shipping agency and freight forwarding businesses contribute an estimated US$400 million per annum to the economy.
There will be absolutely no knowledge transfer or technology transfer as a result of this change in ownership as the latest state-of-the-art systems of principals are currently deployed and these systems are integrated with locally developed interfaces customized to support local operations efficiently and to the satisfaction of principals/freight networks by local staff.
We are concerned that with this policy change the foreign owners will get controlling interest of agency/freight forwarding companies and not only will these companies be restricted in their growth but they would be limited in their capacity to invest in related or unrelated business as hitherto done by local entrepreneurial shipping agencies/freight forwarding companies over the past several decades, the joint statement said.
A majority local ownership in shipping agencies/freight forwarding companies have led to local entrepreneurs promoting the principals/freight networks to maximize their business through Sri Lanka as opposed to other regional hubs benefiting the Port of Colombo as well as the country. This position will be entirely jeopardized with this policy change.
Freight forwarders and shipping agencies physically take custody of goods worth billions of dollars per annum. When ownership and directors are all foreign then it would be so much easier for them to simply vanish with goods. This has happened and is happening in markets like Singapore, Hong Kong and India.
The difference, when there is Sri Lankan ownership or directors, is obvious as even if they do the same thing there are other ways to ensure they and their companies remain accountable.
If the intention of this policy change is based on the premise of developing Colombo to be a logistics hub we, as the industry, believe that there are more urgent and important initiatives that should be addressed such as the development of port infrastructure and measures to improve ease of doing business and bring significant relief to the consumer/trade.
The government needs to realise that for the maritime and logistics industry to grow it is the local industry leaders that would promote the utilisation of all ports in Sri Lanka.
The beneficiaries of the budget proposal would focus only on the container segment and would not be interested in developing or promoting the other segments of the industry.
It is important that any policy change should be discussed with stakeholders urgently.
This proposal comes as a great shock to the industry stakeholders concerned. It appears policymakers are misled to believe that this change will lead to Sri Lanka becoming a leading maritime and logistics hub.

Hate speech should be banned
"The hate speeches should be banned, but it should not erode the freedom of expression. To overcome this issue, the District Reconciliation Committee (DRCs) established through a Cabinet Paper submitted by the President with the support of the Asia Foundation and inter-religious leaders will discuss the issue on district level and pass on unresolved matters to the National Reconciliation Committee (NRCs)," a British High Commission delegation said.
The delegation led by Senior Research Analyst and Justice Consultant Paul Bentall, Regional Head of Stabilization Unit Eric Vincent and Political Officer Jovita Arulanantham visited National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry to discuss the progress Sri Lanka has made so far on reconciliation, integration and peace-building.
The delegation was briefed by Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy, who spoke on the various reconciliation interventions ranging from policy; National integration, schools programme peace journalism, institutionalizing national integration and curriculum development initiatives including incorporating virtues, values, ethical principles and comparative religious studies. The delegation was informed of the many housing programmes, road building projects and economic empowerment programmes as well.
While appreciating the steps taken, the delegation expressed reservation on the varying data on missing persons by the Maxwell Paranagama Commission, and the Darusmans report.
The Ministry has initiated action to collect data from the District Secretariat based on actual reported cases. All 25 districts will be covered in collecting data on missing persons and it will not be restricted to one ethnic group, V.Sivagnanasothy said.
The delegation noted that the Northern Ireland experience of devolution has helped the United Kingdom (UK) maintain peace. Constitutional reforms in Sri Lanka can also significantly achieve reconciliation and peace.
The delegation appreciated the actions taken by the Sri Lankan Army to construct houses in Kankesanthurai (KKS) and commended the initiative on 50,000 brick and mortar houses which are socially acceptable to the community.
The delegation added the housing programme should be complimented with other social and economic infrastructure such as schools, temples, health centres, and roads. The selection of beneficiaries to be done in a fair and just manner and appeal boards should be in place to receive complaints and investigate into them, they pointed out.
They requested to pay special attention for the implementation capacity of the Northern and Eastern community. The Ministry officials informed that if districts have commitment, capacity, delivery, these concerns could be addressed. Some Districts are performing well despite constraints, the officials said.
The 2018 budget proposal incorporates many reconciliation focused interventions specifically related to the North and East. The 50,000 housing project, road rehabilitation, Myliddy fisheries harbour, Atchuvely industrial estate, rehabilitation economic centre in the Northern Province, Economically integrated ex- combatants and support for the disable women will contribute significantly to make the national integration a reality.

Hot yoga guru seeks US bankruptcy
Bikram Choudhury Yoga, the studio that popularised hot yoga, has filed for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy after being dogged by $US16.7 million ($23.4 million) in legal judgements and numerous lawsuits and allegations of sexual misconduct.
Founder Bikram Choudhury, who built a worldwide following with classes of 26 yoga postures in rooms heated to 40.6, has been accused of sexual assault by his yoga practitioners, students, instructors and teacher trainees.
Bikram Yoga has hundreds of studios worldwide and is taught by Bikram-certified teachers.
It is claimed have been developed by Bikram and his guru Bishnu Gosh to improve health benefits.
The Simi Valley, California-based company said in a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday in the Central District of California that its liabilities were worth up to $US50 million.
It listed assets of up to $US1 million, suggesting that its largest creditors - women who are owed money for court judgements awarded against Choudhury - will not be paid in full.
They include Miki Jaffa Bodden, former head of legal and international affairs at Choudhury's yoga school who has an $US8 million claim stemming from a wrongful dismissal case that included sexual harassment claims.
Bodden alleged that Choudhury repeatedly subjected her to vulgar sexual gestures and offensive comments about women and minority groups.

Almanac case: Basil files Transfer Application at Appeals Court

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa sought an order from Colombo High Court to transfer the controversial almanac case from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another High Court of Colombo.
High Court Judge Judge Gihan Kulatunga announced that he would make an appropriate order in this regard on November 15.
The Court was informed that Basil Rajapaksa had filed a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, seeking an order staying any further proceedings into controversial almanac case before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding over Court No.6 of Colombo High Court.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for the request citing that the defence was purposely attempting to postpone the hearings. He further added that so far there is no any order by Court of Appeal regarding this transfer application and moved High Court to proceed with the trial.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
Defence counsel appeared on behalf of Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him.
He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
Accordingly, the case filed against two accused including former Economic Development Minister BasilRajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was today re-fixed for trial on November 15 by Colombo High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister and former director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing 5 million almanacs with the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January-2015 presidential election.
The Attorney General alleged that by printing these almanacs between 23 November and 31 December 2014, these accused had attempted to influence citizens of this country to vote for presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The AG maintained that the act of accused deems guilty of the offence of bribery in accordance with the section 79 of the Presidential Election Act No 15 of 1981.
Furthermore, two accused had been charged under the Public Property Act No 12 of 1982 to file misappropriation charges. The AG had listed 32 people as witnesses in the case.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana Silva appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil Silva with Jayantha Weerasinghe PC appeared for the accused.

The Art of Fiction Christopher
Stephen King began this interview in the summer of 2001, two years after he was struck by a minivan while walking near his home in Center Lovell, Maine. He was lucky to have survived the accident, in which he suffered scalp lacerations, a collapsed right lung, and multiple fractures of his right hip and leg. Six pounds of metal that had been implanted in Kings body during the initial surgery were removed shortly before the author spoke to The Paris Review, and he was still in constant pain. The orthopedist found all this infected tissue and outraged flesh, said King. The bursas were sticking right out, like little eyes. The interview was held in Boston, where King, an avid Red Sox fan, had taken up temporary residence to watch his team make its pennant run. Although he was still frail, he was back to writing every day, and by night he would take his manuscript to Fenway Park so that he could edit between innings and during pitching changes.
A second interview session with King was conducted early this year at his winter home in Florida, which happens to be within easy driving distance of the Red Soxs spring training compound in Fort Myers. The house lies at the end of a sandy key, and looksby virtue of a high vaulted ceilingsomething like an overturned sailboat. It was a hot, sunny morning and King sat on his front steps in blue jeans, white sneakers, and a Tabasco hot sauce T-shirt, reading the local newspaper. The day before, the same paper had printed his home address in its business section, and fans had been driving by all morning to get a peek at the world-famous author. People forget, he said, Im a real person.
King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father abandoned his family when King was very young, and his mother moved around the country before settling back in Mainethis time in the small inland town of Durham. Kings first published story, I Was a Teenage Grave Robber, appeared in 1965 in a fan magazine called Comics Review. Around that time he received a scholarship to attend the University of Maine in Orono, where he met his wife, Tabitha, a novelist with whom he has three children and to whom he is still married. For several years he struggled to support his young family by washing motel linens at a laundry, teaching high-school English, and occasionally selling short stories to mens magazines. Then, in 1973, he sold his novel Carrie, which quickly became a best seller. Since then, King has sold over three hundred million books.
In addition to forty-three novels, King has written eight collections of short stories, eleven screenplays, and two books on the craft of writing, and he is a co-author with Stewart ONan of Faithful, a day-by-day account of the Red Soxs 2004 championship season. Virtually all of his novels and most of his short stories have been adapted for film or television. Although he was dismissed by critics for much of his careerone New York Times review called King a writer of fairly engaging and preposterous claptraphis writing has received greater recognition in recent years, and in 2003 he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation. King has also been honored for his devoted efforts to support and promote the work of other authors. In 1997 he received the Writers for Writers Award from Poets & Writers magazine, and he was recently selected to edit the 2007 edition of Best American Short Stories.
In person, King has a gracious, funny, sincere manner and speaks with great enthusiasm and candor. He is also a generous host. Halfway through the interview he served lunch: a roasted chickenwhich he proceeded to hack at with a frighteningly sharp knifepotato salad, coleslaw, macaroni salad, and, for dessert, key lime pie. When asked what he was currently working on, he stood up and led the way to the beach that runs along his property. He explained that two other houses once stood at the end of the key. One of them collapsed during a storm five years earlier, and bits of wall, furniture, and personal effects still wash ashore at high tide. King is setting his next novel in the other house. It is still standing, though it is abandoned and, undoubtedly, haunted.
INTERVIEWER
How old were you when you started writing
STEPHEN KING
Believe it or not, I was about six or seven, just copying panels out of comic books and then making up my own stories. I can remember being home from school with tonsillitis and writing stories in bed to pass the time. Film was also a major influence. I loved the movies from the start. I can remember my mother taking me to Radio City Music Hall to see Bambi. Whoa, the size of the place, and the forest fire in the movieit made a big impression. So when I started to write, I had a tendency to write in images because that was all I knew at the time.
INTERVIEWER
When did you begin reading adult fiction
KING
In 1959 probably, after we had moved back to Maine. I would have been twelve, and I was going to this little one-room schoolhouse just up the street from my house. All the grades were in one room, and there was a shithouse out back, which stank. There was no library in town, but every week the state sent a big green van called the bookmobile. You could get three books from the bookmobile and they didnt care which onesyou didnt have to take out kid books. Up until then what I had been reading was Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and things like that. The first books I picked out were these Ed McBain 87th Precinct novels. In the one I read first, the cops go up to question a woman in this tenement apartment and she is standing there in her slip. The cops tell her to put some clothes on, and she grabs her breast through her slip and squeezes it at them and says, In your eye, cop! And I went, Shit! Immediately something clicked in my head. I thought, Thats real, that could really happen. That was the end of the Hardy Boys. That was the end of all juvenile fiction for me. It was like, See ya! - Paris Review

Budget 2018 includes visionary proposals
Budget 2018 includes far-sighted polices instead of plans to fulfil peoples instant fancies, Southern Province Governor Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
This years budget is rather special in comparison to many financial statements presented to Parliament in the recent past. Many of them were presented to satisfy short-sighted ambitions of the people. Minister Mangala Samaraweera in his 2018 Budget proposals has presented a number of far sighted policies to ensure sustainable economy, he said..
This years budget does not burden the public. Most people thought that there would be numerous imposes on people as the government reduced prices of several essential food items before the budget. But no such proposals were included in the budget as many predicted. Many sections of the society including scholars and experts in the field commended the budget proposals as a well-adjusted reformist budget, he said.
He said the budget proposals have corrected many mistakes previously made. Much progressive far-reaching policies have been introduced and the policymakers have contemplated more over the countrys forward march than petty politics, he said.
The budget proposals ensure the forward march of the country. Blue and Green economic strategies were introduced instead of disastrous highly technological polices, he said.
Raising the per capita income up to US Dollars 5,000, creating one million job opportunities, attracting Foreign Direct Investments up to five billion dollars and doubling the countrys exports income up to $ 20 million are but a few of visionary proposals in the budget, he said.
The objective of the Budget 2018 is to achieve the goals of Vision 2025, the economic policy of the government.
People expect the proper implementation of the budget proposals. he said.

CCC Chairman lauds green light to state banks to opt for listing
The freedom given to two state banks to list on the stock exchange under the 2018 Budget proposals is a welcome change and it will have a clear and positive impact on liquidity and share prices in the capital market, said Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Rajendra Theagarajah.
These two banks have been given the freedom, if they wish to list on the stock exchange. It doesnt mean privatization; its about listing and opening them up to the public.
Theagarajah made these sentiments speaking at the BDO Budget seminar 2018, held at the auditorium of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
According to Theagarajah, these two banks jointly command about 40-50 percent of the assets of the banking sector. While commending proposals relating to the export-focused economic growth, Theagarajah noted that the Ceylon Chamber expected consistency with the policies.
He further noted the trade liberalisation proposed is a smooth transition in the economy.
Deputy Secretary to the Treasury S. R. Attygalle speaking at the event stressed that revenue generation is important as there is a requirement to repay loans that have been obtained in the past.
According to him, Sri Lanka has to pay Rs. 7,000 billion as debt repayments within the next three years.
Commenting on the Debt Repayment Levy, Attygalle said a levy is proposed to be imposed on all transactions including cash and non-cash, such as electronic payments, from all financial institutions.
The levy should be paid by the financial institutions and not be passed on to the customers. The levy will include the repayment of international sovereign bonds as well.
Chemanex Group Consultant Preethi Jayawardena also noted that 65% of the economy is backed by the SME sector and access to cheap source of funds has been very rightly addressed under the 2018 Budget.

This successful business promotion mission was organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia.
The delegation participated at number of business discussions followed by B2B meetings arranged by the Commercial Section of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh in association with the Saudi Arabia Basic Industries (SABIC), Council of Saudi Chambers (CSC), Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)/Saudi Export Programme (SEP), Riyadh Chamber of Commerce, ALFANAR Company (manufacturer of electrical items), Othaim Hyper Market, Lulu Group International and the National Industrialization Company (Tasnee) - Saudi Arabias second largest industrial company and one of the worlds largest producers of chemicals especially Titanium Dioxide.
In addition, a networking event was organised for delegates to meet Sri Lankan expatriate professionals attached to Trade and Investment Steering Committees of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia to share their experience in doing business in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Under the leadership of Azmi Thassim, Ambassador for Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia, Steering Committees have been formed to promote trade, investment and tourism between our two countries.
Sri Lanka looks forward to further strengthening ties with the Kingdom, especially in the fields of trade, investment, employment and tourism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, trade and tourism have tremendously increased for the benefit of the people of the two friendly countries, said by the Ambassador for Sri Lanka Azmi Thassim at the discussion forums adding that nearly 40,000 Saudi nationals visited Sri Lanka last year. The Ambassador said that Saudi families who had visited Sri Lanka had always opted to repeat their visits because of the islands natural scenic beauty and the hospitality of its people.
During the discussion forums, Senior Assistant Secretary General of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Lilakshi de Mel extended invitations to the Council of Saudi Chambers and the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce to organise business promotion missions to Sri Lanka to explore many business and investment opportunities available. It was further stated that the visit will go down in the history book of the Chamber as this is the first formal business promotion mission organised to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.

## Title: Challenge of rationalising public policymaking

Challenge of rationalising public policymaking
When the State fails, everything else tends to fail as well. This is what we observe around us today. Parliament does not enact urgent legislation in a timely fashion. The Government does not come up with comprehensive public policies in critically important areas. State institutions do not function effectively due to a whole host of reasons. The result is public disillusionment leading to many adverse consequences.
In a democracy, people vote out governments that become unpopular but the one that comes in may not be any better. The result is the continuation of the same conditions of poor governance, making the life of many as miserable as ever.
Managing even a household is not easy. It involves planning, sound collective decision making with respect to a whole range of issues such as managing available resources, mobilizing additional resources when necessary, making sound expenditure and investment plans, etc. but, managing a country is incredibly more complex. That is why we need smart leaders. Since they are hard to come by in many countries, in particular in this country, due to either dictatorial or populist tendencies within parties or both. That is why, in mature democracies, there are long established public institutions to facilitate well informed public policy making. These institutions usually mobilize a whole range of specialists and professionals to do the complex analyses and come up sound policy options. If most of them come from narrow fields of interest and expertise such as business and law, much of the larger picture is lost and incredibly unsound decisions are taken leading to disastrous results. Let us look at government decisions regarding public investments on infrastructure projects.
Political leaders and knowledge producers
When a government decides on an infrastructure project like a power plant or an expressway, such decisions cannot be made entirely on an economic cost-benefit analysis. For there are many other equally important considerations that need to guide policy decisions. These include environmental and social considerations. In more recent years, overall social sustainability has become a critical consideration in decision making.
How can policymakers take sound policy decisions if they are not conversant with research evidence relating to the issues that they are supposed to address This is where the think tanks come in.
Numerous research institutions in diverse fields and leading universities often generate much-needed research evidence that enables the experts to provide timely guidance to policymakers. Yet, the asymmetrical relationship between political leaders on one hand and knowledge producers on the other in developing countries like Sri Lanka allows politicians to take arbitrary decisions without worrying about their adverse consequences.
The evidence for this is overwhelming. On the other hand, if one looks at the research evidence related to many issues, it is not difficult to determine the kind of policy measures that need to be taken but politicians who are entrusted with the responsibility of managing such issues continue to do what they like, depending on their whims and fancies. Let me illustrate the above points with a few examples. If I take the transport issue first, it is clear that the country's transport situation is getting worse by the day, with its horrendous consequences such as increasing air pollution, loss of millions of work hours daily on our congested roads, thousands of fatal and not so fatal accidents, millions of gallons of fuel unnecessarily burnt on a daily basis, etc.
On the other hand, public investment decisions taken by politicians are not guided by the above evidence which is obvious to even a semi-literate citizen. While the obvious choice is to develop public transport at the expense of private transport, what is being done is the exact opposite.
Budgetary allocations for education
Now, let us look at the situation with respect to education. There are many pressing issues in the education sector such as rural-urban disparities, de facto segregation of schools on the ethnic, religious and linguistic basis, increasing emphasis on examination results at the expense of holistic education, poor language and analytical skills of school leavers, etc.
While the budgetary allocations for education have long been grossly inadequate to address the persisting structural and other issues, politicians in charge allocate scarce resources for trivial measures like distributing tablets among schoolchildren, as if children are not struggling with more basic problems like the lack of laboratory facilities, libraries, specialist teachers, activity rooms, etc. Allocation of resources in the education sector has to be based on a thorough analysis of the felt needs of the student population as well as the relevant institutions based on empirical data but this is not what happens in a country where politicians do not feel that they are accountable to people who elect them to power.
And now a few words about national priorities. If one looks at the government budgetary allocations for 2018, it is quite clear that national security continues to be the biggest priority, and human security is not considered as important. Europeans after the Second World War realized the need to strengthen human security by giving high priority to social development. An increasing share of the growing state revenue under social democratic regimes was allocated for education, training, scientific research, health, public transport, social security, unemployment insurance, etc. Most of these countries became more equitable, peaceful, contented and prosperous.
Consumption of illicit liquor
And, finally, the most recent decision by the government to reduce the excise tax on beer, in order to curb the consumption of illicit liquor. This is essentially an arbitrary decision that cannot be supported by any research evidence, from here or abroad. There is an enormous research literature on the subject, both globally and nationally that shows clearly that what matters is not what people drink but the amount of pure alcohol consumed by individuals and populations. So, any increase in the volume of any beverage can increase the amount of pure alcohol consumed and this is what causes alcohol-related problems in society, for both consumers and others. If the problem is widespread consumption of illicit alcohol, the solution is something else, namely effective law enforcement and community level interventions to reach out to alcohol abusers. Budgetary allocations should be increased for institutions that have been mandated by law to deal with the issues concerned. But such responses cannot be expected from politicians who have no time or interest to take part in research and policy discussions on the relevant subjects and learn about research evidence related to subjects that have been allocated to them. So, most of the decisions taken by most of the Ministers have long been based anything but evidence produced by researchers in diverse fields. No wonder that there was hardly any mention of research and development during the course of the budget debate or any significant allocation of public funds for research related institutions.
The lack of any serious interest in research and development in the country is a clear sign of the failure of the state at a time when many countries even in this region pay increasing attention to the need for promoting useful research. For instance, today, China and South Korea are leaders in this regard not just in Asia but in the whole world. You only have to look at the data widely available. The results are clear. They are not second to leading industrial countries like Japan, USA and Germany. But who cares about such evidence in a country like Sri Lanka where populist politics largely guided by vested interests and individual prejudices determines what happens to state revenue generated largely by taxing low-income people through indirect taxes.

Let politicians be professionals
A democratic state and a just society need to manage its politics and politicians as professional managers to ensure growth, stability and continuous peaceful coexistence within the global family.
Politics is not a game to be played by politicians like any other sport or competition. It is a serious management profession demanding knowledge, skill, experience, wisdom and competence in order to perform and manage the affairs of a state and its society, so as to ensure the peaceful coexistence of its members, the citizens, not only the members of a particular political party or a community.
The political performance should be within the law of the land and state, which is common to all citizens, to those who govern and to those who are governed equally, without any fear or favour, to uphold democracy, and democratic practices of justice, liberty and freedom without unnecessary agitation or social violence.
Detailed professional political performances and conduct should be considered as a forming part of the primary law of the state, and enshrined in the Constitution. There should be a methodology of continuous development of future politicians in order to ensure filling to gaps, to ensure the smooth transition to serve the state and society as necessary. In order to avoid breakdowns and systems failures, which can create destabilisation of the state and society. Professionally qualified politicians could be permitted to take up duties in the state service on facing competitive examination along with state officers, if they wish to do so, provided they undertake to fit into the roles of the state service.
Sri Lanka with a 2500-year-old civilisation should ensure behaviour as a civilized state and a nation, with inherent ethical practices, rather than trying to copy and imitate other systems and procedures, without considering the need, pros and cons, and analysing consequences.
Developing professional political managers is the collective responsibility of state and society through discussion.

Close doors to diabetes
The theme of the World Diabetes Day 2017 which falls on November 14 this time is Healthy Women - Healthy Nation. World Diabetes Day is the worlds largest diabetes awareness campaign reaching a global audience of over one billion people more than 160 countries. The campaign draws attention to issues of paramount importance to the diabetes world and keeps diabetes firmly in the public and political spotlight.
According to the latest Health Ministry statistics, the percentage of diabetes prevalence in Sri Lanka is over 10.3 per cent. It is 27.1 per cent in Colombo, 20 per cent in Jaffna and 20 per cent in Colombo suburbs. Here Senior Lecturer in Medicine attached to the University of Colombo and Hon. Consultant Endocrinologist and Diabetologist University Medical Unit National Hospital, Sri Lanka Dr. Prasad Katulanda, MD, FRCP (Lond), FCCP, FACE, DPhil (Oxon), speaks about preventing diabetes.
Q - Who are prone to Diabetes more, males or females
A - Women are more prone to diabetes than men because of their lifestyle and pregnancies. The impact of diabetes is severe on women than men due to the same reasons. Women are prone to developing diabetes during the pregnancy and one in every five women who have diabetes in child bearing age. Ten per cent of pregnant mothers develop diabetes. Two out of every five pregnant mothers who develop diabetes have the chance of developing Type Two diabetes at a later time. Various health complications can be developed both in the mother and her fetus due to diabetes.
Q - How women can prevent developing diabetes
A - The young girls should follow healthy lifestyle in order to prevent diabetes and to avoid developing diabetes in children they have in future. This is the only way of preventing diabetes. The young girls should keep their Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 23. They should keep their waistline below 80 cm. Their bodies should not be thin or fat. They need to maintain ideal body size for healthy women. This will minimize the possibility of developing diabetes when they get pregnant. Around 35 per cent of Sri Lankan women are obese.
Q - What should and what should not a wife /mother do to prevent diabetes in her and her family
A - Women, especially Muslim women lack of exercise. All women should do regular exercise and it encourages their husbands and children to do more exercise. Otherwise women face various other health problems in addition to diabetes when they grow old. The weaknesses in muscles lead to put more pressure on their back, knees and other parts of the body. This pressure leads to develop other diseases. Exercises are essential to burn calories, to prevent diabetes and to maintain healthy and strong muscles.
Q - What is the impact of food and beverages on developing diabetes
A - The mother of the house should decide what her family eats and how much they eat. Eating sugar and carbohydrate should be controlled. Green fruits and vegetables should be added to the food list buy from the supermarket. Refined sugar should be completely avoided because it is very bad for health. It is called `empty calories. No nutrition at all in refined sugar. Refined sugar consumption leads to fatty Liver, Diabetes, tooth decay and many other diseases. Pumpkins, Potatoes, sweet potatoes, jakfruit, etc are carbohydrate. We need to cut down the quantity of rice when we eat those food. Salads, cucumber, leaves, Ridge Gourd, Snake Gourd, winged bean, etc are good. Fish is a very good food.
Human beings are omnivores. They should not be fundamentalists when it comes to eating various types of food. Eggs are a good food with many nutrients including Vitamin D, protein and there is nothing wrong in eating eggs. Doctors should apologize from the people for advising them not to eat eggs in the past. We should not eat what we have not been eating. For an example eating various types of specific leaves, fruits etc drinking various specific types of juices etc should be avoided. It is advisable to avoid eating Star Fruit (Kaamaranka) for the moment. We should not eat anything too much.
Q - What are the other changes in life that should be done in order to avoid diabetes
A - We have to completely change some of our `fashions in life such as bringing chocolates when returning from abroad etc. We can bring some olives instead of chocolates. We should never spend our leisure time by watching television, playing with the tab or mobile phone. We should do be physically active. The people who cannot walk due to leg problems can do many other exercises with the guidance of a professional physiotherapist. They can do the exercises that aimed at tummy. We have to burn what we eat (the calories we take). Otherwise they store in our bodies and make trouble for us.

I doubt whether we would be able to present the financial statements for the coming years due to lack of financial reports, Jayasinghe added. However, we have decided to take legal action against the interim committee for the misuse of society funds.

Crotty scores All Blacks 2,000th try in France romp
PARIS: New Zealand racked up their 2,000th international try and threatened to hand France a sound thrashing before a second half rally limited them to a 38-18 win in Paris on Saturday.
Ryan Crotty chalked up the landmark score as four first-half tries -- the others from Dane Coles, Waisake Naholo and Sam Cane -- gave the All Blacks a 31-5 half-time lead on Armistice Day.
Teddy Thomas crossed for France on his return to the fold after a two-year absence while a penalty try helped close the gap before Naholo grabbed his second in the final minute to prevent New Zealand from being kept scoreless after the break.
Beauden Barrett kicked a perfect six from six from a 13-point personal haul for the visitors.
Despite a spirited second-half fightback from the hosts, there was no masking the gulf in class less than two years out from the 2019 World Cup in Japan.
But after a thoroughly one-sided first half, Frances only consolation is that they didnt succumb to a record defeat -- their 61-10 reverse in Wellington in 2007 retains that dubious honour.
New Zealand gave notice of their intent on their first possession as a brilliant one-handed offload after contact from Sonny Bill Williams set up a chance on the very next phase for the centre, but he was held up over the line by prop Jefferson Poirot.
From the resulting scrum typically quick passing and a clever line run by Coles saw the hooker go through a gap to score the opening try of the game. France were struggling to contain New Zealands rapid brand of running rugby and were frequently scrambling in defence deep inside their own 22.
Barrett kicked a penalty to add to his earlier conversion and after his chip ahead forced France to carry the ball over their own line, New Zealand had a five-metre scrum.
France were creaking and following a series of scrums, a long mispass from Barrett found Naholo in acres of space to stroll over for the second try.
Coles went off with what seemed a knee injury and France struck back immediately, kicking a penalty to the corner and then firing the ball out to the right for Thomas to dive over.
Frances expected pack dominance didnt materialise and six minutes before half-time tighthead prop Rabah Slimani was sin-binned after collapsing a scrum for the third time, while loosehead Poirot went off for a concussion protocol. AFP

Professor in Surgery, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Prof. Aloka Pathirana.
In the early stages of breast cancer, symptoms are minimal, therefore disease might progress even without notice. Annually, more than 2,500 women in Sri Lanka are newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Thus it is a timely requirement to increase awareness on breast cancer and thereby to reduce the number of deaths caused.
Artists and people excelling in many fields including popular actress/model/presenter Vinu Udani Siriwardhane, participated in this symposium to encourage all women of Sri Lanka.

A recovering World Economy
The Dynamics of China and India in Global Growth
The remarkable growth of China and India has shifted the centre of the world economy towards Asia. However, the 2008 global financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the export-led model of Asias two economic giants. With the IMF predicting a recovering world economy in 2018 amid policy uncertainty, the economic strategies of the giants are under the microscope. The slowdown in Chinas growth and risks to Indias outlook have fuelled debate on whether their respective strategies can sustain regional and global growth. This article charts the rise of the giants and evaluates their outlook.
Reforms and rapid growth
China and India have followed similarly impressive growth trajectories in recent decades. While China began to open its economy to market forces and foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1978  more than a decade before India  both countries have enjoyed years of rapid growth that has lifted millions out of poverty. China grew at a historically unprecedented 10% per year during 1980-2006 and India at a respectable 6%. Together the giants took an astonishing 806 million people out of poverty (measured as the % of the population living on less than $1.90 per day) between 1993 and 2013. The two Asian giants exports increasingly comprise sophisticated manufactures and services, rather than simple labour-intensive products.
Moreover, after years of tepid growth after the global financial crisis, 2018 seems bright. The latest IMF forecasts suggest that reasonable growth is expected in both countries in 2018  over 6.5% in China and 7.4% in India. This ispartly linked to a recovery in demand in advanced economies, which are expected to grow at 2% in 2018.
China currently dominates global supply chains. In achieving its pre-eminent status, China benefitted from favourable initial conditions including a large domestic market, low-cost productive labour, and the geographical advantage of its proximity to Japan, the previous engine of Asian growth. Even more importantly, China pursued gradual and coordinated economic reforms beginning in 1978 that served as a catalyst for subsequent decades of growth. Titled Market Socialism with Chinese Characteristics by Deng Xiaoping, the reform programme emphasised a strong role for the state alongside controlled opening to market forces.
Opening the door to FDI was at the heart of ushering in market forces. Key steps included (i) a law to encourage joint ventures between foreign and local investors, (ii) establishment of special economic zones (SEZs) with tax incentives for FDI on the Southern coast, (iii) steady liberalisation of a controlled import regime and (iv) a duty drawback scheme to ensure duty-free access for all imported inputs for export processing. The 1978 reforms also marked the beginning of the revival of local private business in China, which had long been stigmatized as the root of evil behaviour.
The state continued to play a role in economic activity. Central planning has remained a feature of macroeconomic and sectoral resource allocation. China has a straggling array of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with millions of employees across all sectors of the economy. More controversially, China used various industrial policy instruments (finance, subsidies, local content rules) to foster globally competitive large firms. The record on industrial policy is mixed. Notable recent successes such as high-speed trains, the Comac C-919 commercial jet and defence activities sit alongside some failures (e.g. Chinas home-grown 3G mobile-technology).
By comparison, Indias economic liberalisation did not begin until 1991  more than a decade later  and it focused more narrowly on easing restrictions on FDI and imports. They also increased the investment limit of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and permitted free determination of interest rates by banks. These reforms, termed the New Economic Policy or NEP, were initiated by the government of Prime Minister Narashima Rao. In recent years India has accelerated reform of FDI entry regulations and import tariffs. For instance, Indias simple average import tariffs for manufactures reached 7.8% for manufactures in 2015compared with 6.4% for China. Nonetheless, as a result of Chinas first-mover advantage and more comprehensive reform programme, it has been able to achieve consistently higher growth than India for the past several decades and has a much larger share of world GDP than India.
Global rise of Asias giants
From 2.3% of world GDP in 1980, China will increase its share to 19.3% in 2018. Although the initial base was the same, Indias increase in world GDP has been somewhat more modest from 2.9% to 8%. Over the same period, the US share declined from 21.8% to 14.8%, while that of Japan dropped from 7.8% to 4%. Thus, the giants appear to be increasingly replacing advanced economies as drivers of world growth. This has led some to talk about a multi-polar global economy as underpinning the future of global growth.
Amid this global rise, China has moved away from a heavy reliance on exports that are resource-based (e.g. food) and low-technology (e.g. textiles, garments and footwear) exports to become the global factory. It is increasingly prominent as the assembly hub of sophisticated global supply chain trade in technology intensive manufactures (e.g. electronic and electrical products, aircraft, precision instruments and pharmaceuticals). For example, while the Apple iPhone was developed in the US, its various components from over 200 industrial suppliers around the world are assembled in a factory in Shenzen that is owned by a firm based in Taiwan. Apple coordinates and sets quality standards for its geographically dispersed suppliers. In 2009-2013, China accounted for 25% of global supply chain trade, up from under 13% in 2001-2014. This compares with 28% for the EU, 8% for Japan and 7% for the US in 2009-2013.
Indias global supply chain exports have also risen from a tiny base to about 1% in 2009-2013. On the other hand, Indian exports are increasingly led by more-sophisticated, skill-intensive services such as information technology (IT), business process outsourcing (BPO) and financial services. In 2016 India accounted for an impressive 11.2% of world IT exports compared with 5.2% for China. Indias success in IT trade is explained by widespread use of English, supplies of high-quality graduates from Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management, falling communications costs and returning non-resident Indian investors from Silicon Valley.
Different reform paths
Firms operating in China today enjoy a more competitive business environment than their counterparts in India, with more market-friendly rules for business start-ups, property registration, contract enforcement and bankruptcy. For instance, in 2017 China is ranked 78 on the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Index compared with 130 for India. Beginning in the 1980s, China attracted FDI into manufacturing to serve as the cornerstone of export-led growth.Annual average FDI inflows to China increased nine-fold from $18 billion to a record $159 billion between 1980-1999 and 2000-2016. Technology transfer accompanied FDI inflows while controlled liberalisation of protected industries led to increased efficiency and industrial restructuring.
Chinese outward FDI into Asia and beyond has increased substantially in recent years.FDI outflows from China averaged $56 billion per year during 2000-2016. It went mainly to neighbouring Asian economies (e.g. Southeast Asian economies and India), the EU and the US. Chinese outward FDI has been driven by easing of regulations on outward investment, internationalisation of Chinese firms to improve productivity, lower labour costs in manufacturing overseas and huge reserves seeking high-yielding assets overseas.
India was slower to adopt comprehensive reforms and in its first decade of reform, which began in 1991, focused more narrowly on easing restrictions on foreign ownership. With the recent acceleration of reforms, annual average FDI inflows into India increased from $2 billion to $23 billion between 1980-1999 and 2000-2016.
Meanwhile, the managed floating exchange rate policies of the two giants have been broadly similar as they both faced tariff reform gradually, seeking to use the exchange rate as a critical tool for encouraging exports. Both had success in the 2000s in maintaining favourable real effective exchange rates for exports, although Chinas stance provided better incentives for exporters.
New leadership
Both giants have strong leaders with ambitious economic visions. Xi Jinping became Chinese President in 2012 and has implementedchange maker policies. These include ending the One Child Policy to counter an ageing population, launching ananti-corruption drive to root out corrupt officials and making the RMB a world reserve currency as a notable step towards the RMB becoming a global currency.
Xis signature international initiative is the Belt and Road (BRI) which some suggest is on a similar scale to the Marshall Plan launched by the US to rebuild Europe after World War Two. The BRI was partly to remedy excess capacity in China and to boost global infrastructure connectivity and growth. It is an ambitious web of intercontinental road, rail and port links involving 60 countries across Asia, Europe and Africa.It is backed by a huge Chinese pledge of least $269 billion and project co-financing from international sources like multilateral development banks.
Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014 and has pursued a radical reform agenda over the last few years. He has implemented a flurry of measures including a nationwide sales tax, a Make in India initiative, demonetised large currency notes, introduced fiscal reform and accountability, fostered investment climate reform and created new social security programmes. As a countermove to the BRI, Modi also introduced an Act East Policy to link with high-performing economies in East Asia,and the Africa-Asia Growth Corridor (in collaboration with Japan) to establish a partnership with Africa on infrastructure and skills upgrading.
Future growth factors
The recent Xi and Modi reforms mean that both giants have laid the foundation for continued growth. The IMF expects China to grow at 6.3% per year in 2018-2020 and India to grow at a faster rate of 7.7%. Growth in both countries will be driven by not just exports but also heightened domestic and Asian demand. Services  fuelled by growing middle-class consumption  will play an increasingly important part in economic activity in the giants.Indias reforms have made great strides and have begun to catch up with China. India has also boosted public investment in infrastructure and other areas. Some of Indias states  Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu  are becoming manufacturing hubs and linking into global supply chains. Yet, Chinas economic policies, investment climate and supply-side conditions remain more favourable than Indias. Accordingly, China will continue to lead India in global supply chain trade for the foreseeable future.
India appears to be enjoying a demographic dividend for growth based on an increasingly youthful population. Between 2000 and 2015, India added about 20 million youth (i.e. population under 24 years of age) whereas Chinas youth population dropped by 80 million. Indias increase in youth is perhaps a mixed blessing. On the positive side, it means that more dynamic young people are entering the labour force. However, Indias tertiary enrollment rate is 27% in 2015 compared with a rate of 43% in China. Furthermore, in 2016 China had 4.7 million STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates while India had 2.6 million. This suggests that India may face a shortage of high-skilled workers, just as the knowledge sector of its economy is poised for continued rapid expansion.
Moreover, China allocates significantly more resources than India to R&D and infrastructure, both key determinants of future growth. China spends as much as 2.1% of GDP on R&D while India spends 0.6%. Likewise, China invested8.6% of its GDP per year during 1992-2013 compared with 4.9% in India. In terms of infrastructure quality, China and India are similar in terms of ports, but India lags behind China in railways and electricity supply.
Managing risks
It seems that China and India will switch places in terms of future growth in the short term. However, many risks lie ahead which could tilt the giants short-term outlook to the downside. These include political uncertainty, protectionism (including President Trumps America First economic nationalism), tighter global financial conditions and weak productivity growth, to name a few. How each giant weathers these risks will ultimately determine their economic performance during 2018-2020.
A part of Chinas bet lies in using the BRI to neatly transit to a position of global leadership alongside, or to replace, the US. Another is reforming its centrally administered SOEs through mergers, restructuring, cutting capacity and closing zombie companies. India has scope for emulating China in global supply chains by enhancing supply-side measures, such as boosting literacy and skill creation, and fostering industrial R&D and investing in infrastructure. Continuing with reforms and private sector development in both giants can also help sustain their growth.

An eco-friendly budget
Budget 2018 includes a series of eco-friendly proposals which will enable Sri Lanka to move forward sustainable development, Central Environmental Authority Chairman Professor Lal Dharmasiri yesterday said.
Professor Dharmasiri described the electric vehicle proposal, the introduction of emission and safety standards, encouragement for bio-degradable material and the carbon tax to be the foremost eco-friendly proposals in Budget 2018.
The proposal to discourage the usage of polythene and plastic products by imposing an excise duty of Rs.10 per kilogramme for plastic resins is an excellent one. The imposed excise duty will affect the products price. When the price goes up we expect the consumers will be discouraged to buy those items and it will ultimately lessen the usage. I believe that Rs. 10 is not enough and it should be more, Professor Dharmasiri said.
Encouraging the private sector to convert to environmentally friendly alternatives, to engage in manufacturing them out of bio-degradable material and freeing bi-degradable polythene of tax are also two complementary proposals to the eco-friendly approach of the Budget 2018, Professor Dharmasiri stated .
All these proposals are not just environmental friendly, but health oriented as well, he pointed out. Professor Dharmasiri also commended the proposal to impose a Carbon Tax as a strong measure taken to lessen carbon emission.
He pointed out that a Carbon Tax is a method adopted by many developed countries, based on the concept that the polluter should pay for the pollution.
This tax will not be a heavy burden on the people either. For example, an amount of Rs. 1,000 will be required to pay as the Carbon Tax for the whole year. For smaller vehicles, the payments will also be very low. I would like to propose that this tax money should also be used for environmental protection programmes. he added.
He also said the proposal to remove the Customs duty for all machinery, equipment, raw materials and intermediary goods used in manufacturing of bio-degradable packaging material is also a well thought out move.
Professor Dharmasiri also said the proposal to introduce 50 electric buses to the public transportation system is an impressive step towards minimizing air and sound pollution in the Colombo metropolitan region. He urged for a similar bus service be introduced for Colombo and the suburbs.
He also complimented the large allocations made for waste management projects. Professor Dharmasiri observed that there never has been such large allocations for waste management in previous budgets.
One of the biggest issues with regards to both environment and development was the lack of proper waste management. This move to regularise the waste management system in the country will provide solutions to one of the burning issues in the urban parts of the country, he further said.
The eco-friendly budgetary proposals also include the Pavithra Ganga project, which will focus on ensuring zero disposal of waste by factories into waterways over time.
Meanwhile, Green Movement of Sri Lanka Chairperson/CEO Suranjan Kodithuwakku, recognising the eco-friendly budgetary proposals for a blue-green economy in positive light, proposed a transitional period of at least of ten years to set the background for these proposals to be actualised.
These proposals are good and spell out national interests, keeping in line with the UN Climate Change Agreements. What is more important now is for the government to set a strong backdrop against which these budgetary proposals can be realized. I personally believe that the policymakers need to look into global conventions on environmental issues and conduct in depth studies to clear the way for the implementation of these proposals, Kodithuwakku said.
Kodithuwakku also observed that more planning and in depth studies are necessary to build a strong foundation to implement these eco-friendly budgetary proposals.
He also pointed out that more emphasis should be put on the concept of Green Energy to realize these proposals as well.

Eminem drops song with Beyonc

Beyonc has a song out with one of rap's biggest superstars.
No, not that one.
Rapper Eminem released a single Friday, featuring Beyonc.
"Walk on Water" has Queen Bey singing, "I walk on water/But I ain't no Jesus/I walk on water/But only when it freezes" -- as Eminem spits bars about the pressures of his life and career.
If you listen closely, you can hear the sounds of Eminem writing and ripping up paper in the background.
The artist born Marshall Mathers hinted on social media earlier this week that something was coming, posting a photo of a prescription pad that read "Revival. 'Walk on Water' take as needed."
He followed that up with a parody of a drug commercial for Revival, which gave followers a heads up to an arrival at noon on Friday and directed them toAskAboutRevival.com.
Fans have been eagerly awaiting new music from the rapper, whose last studio album was "The Marshall Mathers LP 2" in 2013.
Eminem is scheduled to perform on "Saturday Night Live" on November 18.

Emirates Group 1H net profit up 77%
The Emirates Group has announced its half-year results for 2017-18. The Group saw steady revenue growth and a rebound on profitability compared to the same period last year, in spite of the continuing downward pressure on margins, a rise in oil prices, and other challenges for the airline and travel industry.
The Emirates Group revenue was AED 49.4 billion (US$ 13.5 billion) for the first six months of its 2017-18 financial year, up 6% from AED 46.5 billion (US$ 12.7 billion) during the same period last year.
Profitability rebounded after a low during the same period last year, with the Group reporting a 2017-18 half-year net profit of AED 2.3 billion (US$ 631 million), up 77%.
This result was driven by capacity optimisation and efficiency initiatives across the company, steady business growth, and a more favourable foreign exchange situation compared to the same period last year.
The Groups cash position on September 30, 2017 was at AED 18.9 billion (US$ 5.2 billion), compared to AED 19.1 billion (US$ 5.2 billion) as at March 31, 2017.
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group said: A lot of the credit for our 2017-18 half-year results goes to our talented workforce who have worked hard to improve our business performance, and address our challenges without compromising on quality and service.
Our margins continue to face strong downward pressure from increased competition, oil prices have risen, and we still face weak economic and uncertain political realities in many parts of the world. Yet, the Group has improved revenue and profit performance. This speaks to the resilience of our business model, and the agility of our people.
The easing of the strong US dollar against other major currencies helped our profitability. We are also seeing the benefit from various initiatives across the company to enhance our capability and efficiency with new technologies and new ways of working. Moving forward, we will continue to keep a careful eye on costs while investing to grow our business and provide our customers with world-class products and services.
In the past six months, the Groups employee base reduced by 3% compared to 31 March 2017, from an overall staff count of 105,746 to 102,669. This was largely a result of natural attrition together with a slower pace of recruitment, as various parts of the business adopted new technologies, streamlined business processes and re-allocated resources.
Emirates continues to invest in the most advanced wide-body aircraft to improve overall efficiency and provide better customer experience. During the first six months of 2017-18, Emirates received 10 wide-body aircraft  4 Airbus A380s, and 6 Boeing 777s, with 9 more new aircraft scheduled to be delivered before the end of the financial year. It also retired 5 older aircraft from its fleet with further 4 to be returned by 31 March 2018.
In July, the airline announced a partnership with flydubai, leveraging both airlines complementary networks to open new city-pair routings for customers, and optimise operations at Dubai International airport. Emirates also announced it will extend its successful partnership with Qantas for a further five years in tandem with joint network adjustments that will offer travellers more connectivity and flight choices to and from Australia and New Zealand.
Overall capacity during the first six months of the year increased a modest 2% to 30.8 billion Available TonneKilometres (ATKM). Capacity measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASKM), grew by 3%, whilst passenger traffic carried measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPKM) was up 5% with average Passenger Seat Factor rising to 77.2%, compared with last years 75.3%.
Emirates carried 29.2 million passengers between 1 April and 30 September 2017, up 4% from the same period last year. The volume of cargo uplifted at 1.3 million tonnes is up 5% while yield improved by 8%. This solid performance speaks to Emirates SkyCargos recent investments in products and services tailored to key sectors, and is also a positive sign of a gradual recovery in the global air freight market.

Exercise lower Alzheimers risk
Researchers at Vanderbilt assessed the heart and brain health of 314 people. They found those with the poorest heart health had brains that seemed up to 20 years older than they should be. Those with poor heart health had poor blood flow to the brain region where Alzheimers pathology starts. It is the clearest indication yet that exercise does help lower dementia risk
Exercise does lower your risk of Alzheimers, scientists claim after finding a link between poor heart health and memory issues. Experts warn the findings of the new study should be a red flag to everybody to exercise at least 30 minutes five times a week to improve their chances of avoiding the crippling neurodegenerative disease.
We currently know a lot about how to prevent and medically manage many forms of heart disease, but we do not yet know how to prevent or treat Alzheimers disease, said Director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimers Center, Dr. Angela Jefferson.
This research is especially important because it may help us leverage our knowledge about managing heart health to address and treat risk factors for memory loss in older adults before cognitive symptoms develop, she added.
One way to put these results into a meaningful context is to define how one year of aging relates to blood flow in the brain, Dr Jefferson said.
Then, we compare the effect of one year of aging to the effect of lower cardiac index. When we do that, we find that the effect of cardiac index on blood flow in the temporal lobes corresponds to 15 to 20 years of age. she said.
Dr Jefferson said the study suggests that as we age we need to do more to aid blood flow in the brain, and the more exercise we do the lower our dementia risk appears to be.
It is now clear from a growing body of research evidence that there is a strong connection between heart health and brain health, said Alzheimers Association Chief Science Officer, Dr. Maria Carrillo.
We are pleased to have provided the initial seed funding for this intriguing science that is beginning to identify and investigate the mechanisms behind that connection.
Those mechanisms, once confirmed, may hold the key to effective treatments and prevention strategies for Alzheimers disease and other dementias, she added.

Expolanka announces Q2 financial performance amidst challenging external environment
Sri Lankas leading logistics provider Expolanka Holdings announced its second quarter performance for 2017/18, delivering year on year revenue and gross profit growth amidst a challenging climate for business globally.
Expolanka Holdings generated a revenue of Rs 21.7 billion (YOY growth of 34%), delivering a Gross Profit of Rs 3 billion (YOY growth of 9.8%) for the quarter. The company delivered these results while accounting for two key factors; a drop in GP Margin arising from an unanticipated industry-wide increase in airline rates coupled with space constraints challenging the companys procurement process, and an increase in overheads due to identified initiatives that were undertaken over the period. Both these factors resulted in a net loss of Rs 89 million for the quarter.
In the Logistics sector, Expolanka continued to deliver strong top line performance by generating a revenue of Rs 35 billion (YOY Growth of 34%) during the first half of the year. Air Export volumes grew by 25%, and Ocean Export volumes grew by 19% on a Year to Date basis. The company is focusing on accelerating growth from high potential origins in East Asia (China, Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia) whilst expanding the core South Asia operation. Expolanka continues to retain emphasis on growing the core trade lanes of USA and Europe.
In the Leisure sector, consolidation continued with promising growth in the corporate travel solution business which recorded a revenue of Rs 664 million for the first half of the year. With a key divestment, the company realigned its resources to growing the core travel solutions operation, leading to organic growth within the sector. The sector was able to deliver a Profit After Tax of 100 million (YOY Growth 6%) for the same period.
The Investment sector recorded a revenue of Rs 2 billion for the first half of 2017. The loss incurred in this sector is primarily attributed to the corporate center, which functions as a strategic and support service centre to the group.
With Asia reawakening to the key benefits associated with trade, Expolanka expects its Asia pivot to yield strong contributions to the overall business. Asia continues to be a key sourcing hub for Expolanka customers globally and the companys continued growth in volumes and topline have been generated through these key markets, noted Executive Director and CEO Hanif Yusoof.
The challenge remains in addressing the externalities that impact gross margins and operational efficiency. We are very confident that the corrective and precautionary measures we are taking in this regard will have a positive impact on our financial performance in the medium term, said Yusoof. This year has been a challenging one for us at Expolanka, as we attempt to grapple with an unforgiving external environment and the immediate overhead impact of some of our initiatives. We are taking immediate steps to mitigate external challenges, and are confident that our drive to expand and consolidate our business will yield very positive results in the medium term."

Eye care treatments for Agrahara beneficiaries
Lanka Hospitals will offer Agrahara beneficiaries special benefits for eye care treatments. This new venture will help public sector employees to obtain quality eye care treatments such as cataract surgery and the LASIK laser eye treatment for affordable rates.
Agrahara insurance scheme was established by National Insurance Trust Fund Board with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to uplift the living standards of government employees and their families island-wide. Nearly 700,000 government employees and their dependants are entitled to premier healthcare services from private hospitals under Agrahara insurance scheme. Lanka Hospitals has partnered with the NITF since 2010.
Lanka Hospitals facilitates a state-of-the-art Eye Care Centre with LASIK laser eye surgeries, cataract surgeries and other related all eye surgeries and procedures where comprehensive procedures and surgeries are conducted. The centre also provides the services of internationally recognized and highly experienced consultant physicians and specialist doctors.
Group Chief Executive Officer of Lanka Hospitals Dr. Prasad Medawatta said the affiliation paves the way for more transparent costs, thus letting them prepare their finances accordingly. The collaboration between the NITF and Lanka Hospitals was particularly encouraging as both entities are under the auspices of the same government entity, and are therefore able to better understand and efficiently serve the particular needs of the public sector employees. Chief Executive Officer of the National Insurance Trust Fund Sanath C. De Silva said the scheme empowers public sector employees by providing them financial protection against unforeseen health problems. Our main objective is healthcare and well-being of people who are employed by the government. Standardization of medical surgery is our long term objective and our collaboration with Lanka Hospitals is an initial move in that direction. The rates we offer are unmatched by the private sector, he said.

Fuel shortage report due on Tuesday
The report detailing the cause of the week-long fuel shortage, prepared by the Cabinet Sub-committee appointed on the request of Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, will be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday (14).
The Cabinet Sub-committee is investigating whether there was a delay in ordering the fuel consignment, the reasons for the sudden malfunction of the oil refinery and matters such as the arrival of low quality fuel and if the previous fuel stocks were maintained to proper standards.
The committee which was appointed by the President comprises Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Special Assignments Minister Dr.Sarath Amunugama and Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
It is widely believed that the reason for the fuel shortage was the delay in the chemical vessel which was expected to arrive on November 2. The vessel arrived many days later on November 8. Panic buying on the part of consumers who feared an all-out shortage is also cited as another reason for the islandwide fuel shortage.

Gamini Sedara Senarath, two others remanded until Nov. 15

Three suspects including former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath were ordered to be remanded till November 15 by Colombo Fort Magistrate today for allegedly missing public funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet for hotel project in 2012.
The Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order in respect of three suspects Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna when they surrendered in court through their lawyers. The Magistrate announced that she would make an appropriate order on next inquiry date after inspecting both legal and incident material relevant to the case. Both Prosecution and defence parties were directed to file their written submissions before tomorrow.
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The funds in question had been the allocation for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings Ltd, a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
The prosecution maintained that the Canwill Holdings Ltd is a state-owned public enterprise set up during former regime with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity secured from its major shareholders Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation which has put Rs. 8.5 billion, and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, Anil Silva PC and counsel Nalinda Indatissa appearing for the suspects argued that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act citing that the Canwill Holdings is not a state institution. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is a company registered under Company Act.
Money were invested on a contract by several parties including Canwill Holdings, EPF and Litro gas Lanka company. No offence disclosed against these suspects, Ali Sabry added.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing on behalf of the FCID denied the claims made by defence that the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is not a state institution. He stated that the company named Canwill Holdings had been formulated by first suspect through his personnel capacity and he is shareholder of the company. 
On November 9, three suspects appeared before Court as per an undertaking given to the Supreme Court.
However, at that time the defence counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects told Court that their clients were not surrendering in Court, but just appearing for the purpose of making a statement to the FCID.
Senarath and two others had filed three Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting him in connection with a magisterial inquiry, under the Public Property Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
This petition is to be taken up for support on November 17.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry with Anil Silva PC and counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the suspects. DSG Thusith Mudalige with Chief Inspector Anura Premaratne appeared for the FCID.

Genius kid 'born on Mars'
A 'genius' Russian boy believes he had a previous life on Mars and his parents believe him.
The curious case of Boriska Kipriyanovich, now aged 20, continues to startle experts. He first came to the mainstream attention of conspiracy theorists and New Age believers in 2008 when he was the subject of the documentary 'Boriska: Indigo Boy from Mars'.
From an early age, he began telling experts about his previous life on Mars. Boris believes he lived among an alien civilisation that was ravaged by war and then a nuclear catastrophe.
The martians were seven feet tall and breathed carbon dioxide, he said.
He claims he was a martian pilot and travelled to earth where he was 'reborn' in 1996.
The human race has much more knowledge to unlock, and the Great Sphinx in Egypt holds the key, he says.
"The human life will change when the Sphinx is opened, it has an opening mechanism somewhere behind the ear; I do not remember exactly," claims Boriska. The outlandish claims have sparked endless discussion on conspiracy theory websites.
Boriska is said to have displayed much higher than average intelligence from young age and was reading, writing and speaking by just 18 months.
He first became famous in Russia after holding adults spellbound with his tales of his former life on Mars during a camping trip aged seven.

Global call for dignity and respect for all
UNESCO observes the International Day for Tolerance on Thursday, November 16. All over the world it will be a time for people to learn about respecting and recognising the rights and beliefs of others. It will also be a time of reflection and debate on the negative effects of intolerance. Live discussions and debates will take place across diverse borders on this day, focusing on how various forms of injustice, oppression, racism and unfair discrimination have a negative impact on society.
Rights and freedoms
We are all aware that the human family is extremely varied with many different beliefs, cultures and ways of life. Several conflicts in our world are caused when people are intolerant of the ways that others see the world. Learning tolerance is an important cornerstone to creating a better world. If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races or religions, we call that person a bigot. The intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry is ugly.
There are different types of bigotry  such as religious bigotry or racist bigotry. Although bigotry can mean any form of intolerance or prejudice, when the word is used alone, it is most often understood to mean racial bigotry.
What actually is tolerance Tolerance is the most necessary quality of man. It is one of the conditions of good manners. Intolerance often leads to the worst type of calamities. So, that is why we must put so much importance on tolerance. Intolerance is often caused by ignorance and fear. When we do not know about other cultures, religions or nations we sometimes fear them. Education is the most important way to promote tolerance.
Teaching people what our shared rights and freedoms are is the first step in tolerance education. Learning about other cultures is also important to help us see the similarities between all cultures and to respect and celebrate our differences.
Laws are necessary but not sufficient for countering intolerance in individual attitudes. Intolerance is very often rooted in ignorance and fear. It is unfounded fear of the unknown, of other cultures, nations and religions. Intolerance is also closely linked to an exaggerated sense of self-worth and pride, whether personal, national or religious. These notions are taught and learned at an early age. As such, greater emphasis needs to be placed to teach children about tolerance and human rights and about other ways of life. Children should be encouraged at home and in school to be open-minded and curious.
Hate-mongers
Education is a life-long experience and does not begin or end in school. Endeavours to build tolerance through education will not succeed unless they reach all age groups and take place everywhere. Yes, this means at home, in school, in the workplace, in law-enforcement and legal training and not least in entertainment and on the information highways.
Fighting intolerance basically requires access to information. Intolerance is most dangerous when it is exploited to fulfil the political and territorial ambitions of an individual or groups of individuals. Hate-mongers often begin by identifying the public's tolerance threshold. They then develop fallacious arguments, lie with statistics and manipulate public opinion with misinformation and prejudice. The most efficient way to limit the influence of hate-mongers is to develop policies that generate and promote media freedom and pluralism in order to allow the public to differentiate between facts and bigoted opinions.
Still, fighting intolerance requires individual awareness. Intolerance in a society is the sum-total of the intolerance of its individual members. Bigotry, stereotyping, stigmatising, insults and racial jokes are examples of individual expressions of intolerance to which some people are subjected to daily. Intolerance breeds intolerance. It leaves its victims in pursuit of revenge. In order to fight intolerance individuals should become aware of the link between their behaviour and the vicious cycle of mistrust and violence in society. Each one of us should do some soul-searching in this sphere and begin by asking ourselves: Am I a tolerant person Do I stereotype people Do I reject those who are different from me Do I blame my problems on them
Yet, fighting intolerance requires local solutions. Many people know that tomorrow's problems will be increasingly global but few realise that solutions to global problems are mainly local, even individual. When confronted with an escalation of intolerance around us, we must not wait for governments and institutions to act alone.
We are all part of the solution. We should not feel powerless for we actually possess an enormous capacity to wield power. Nonviolent action is a way of using that power - the power of people. Among the tools of nonviolent action are putting a group together to confront a problem, to organise a grassroots network, to demonstrate solidarity with victims of intolerance. Also ways to discredit hateful propaganda are available to all those who want to put an end to intolerance, violence, bigotry and hatred.
Peace and progress
UNESCO's Declaration of Principles on Tolerance defines tolerance as "respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world's cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being humane. It is fostered by knowledge, openness, communication and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. Tolerance, in other words could be called harmony in difference.
That is not to say that fighting intolerance would be a cakewalk for even the most devoted towards this task. Building tolerance and trust in diverse communities takes time and commitment. Tolerance Day is an opportunity to see what progress has been made throughout the year and rededicate our commitment to promoting acceptance, respect, cooperation and dialogue between different cultures in our communities and between nations.
It leads us to respect cultural diversity, ways of life and expressions of our own humanity. It is a necessary condition for peace and progress for all people in a diversified and ever-more connected world. In a globalized world, home to people from many cultures and backgrounds and flooded with pictures and information about other peoples, tolerance is the cornerstone of sustainable citizenship. In addition, it teaches that a persons racial or religious background is inconsequential to the potential for tolerance and friendship between them.
Along with outright injustice and violence, discrimination and marginalisation are common forms of intolerance. Education for tolerance should aim at countering influences that lead to fear and exclusion of others and should help young people develop capacities for independent judgement, critical thinking and ethical reasoning. The diversity of our world's many religions, languages, cultures and ethnicities is not a pretext for conflict, but is a treasure that enriches us all.
History reminds us of the massive human toll taken when hatred and bigotry rear their ugly heads and go unchallenged or infect and persist within society. The same history, however, also gives us many examples of heroic and principled efforts to build and sustain human progress  achieved through the inspiring bravery and resolve of many in generations before.
Embracing diversity and having no tolerance for bigotry just needs to happen in all sectors of the world for racism to ever be a thing of the past.

## Title: On Greeks and Romans

On Greeks and Romans
Edith Hamiltons The Greek Way and The Roman Way, originally published in 1930 and 1932, are classics in their own right. Praised for their lucidity and accessibility, her books served as an introduction to classical antiquity for the general American public for much of the twentieth century.
Although less well known in Europe, Hamilton achieved such popularity in the United States that, when I tell people that I study Classics, most people over the age of fifty who are familiar with the subject tell me that Hamilton was their entry point. The Greek Way was a favourite volume of Robert Kennedy, and  he claimed  a text that helped him process his grief after the assassination of his brother. Hamiltons works underlie one traditional American approach to the Classics. Do they deserve re-publication
Unapologetically popularizing
Hamilton herself is a figure about whom much has been written lately (for example, the excellent chapter by Judith Hallett in the volume Women Classical Scholars, 2016). She had two distinguished careers, first as headmaster at Bryn Mawr, then as a writer about the ancient Mediterranean. It is tempting to compare Hamilton to her British contemporary Jane Ellen Harrison, but while Harrisons work on Greek mythology became the foundation of scholarship on the subject, Hamiltons work on mythology and classical civilization was unapologetically popularizing.
As with most classic works, Hamiltons books present something of a conundrum to readers today: they are obviously products of a different time. Mary Beard, in her SPQR (2015), has compared studying ancient Rome to walking on a tightrope, a very careful balancing act. If you look down on one side, everything seems reassuringly familiar . . . on the other side, it seems completely alien territory. Reading Hamilton is a similar experience.
Much of her analysis is clearly the product of a society very like our own, but occasionally one is forcibly reminded that Hamiltons world was one in which it was entirely acceptable to highlight how remarkable the Greeks freedom was by claiming that a despot enthroned and a great, subjugated populace is what we know as the Oriental state to-day. It has persisted down from the ancient world through thousands of years, never changing in any essential.
Ancient Rome
Can and should this reprint of The Greek Way be judged alongside more recent volumes on the same topic, whether Thomas Cahills Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks matter (2003) or Edith Halls Introducing the Greeks: From Bronze Age seafarers to navigators of the Western mind (2015) Is The Roman Way as useful an introduction to Ancient Rome as Beards SPQR
In short: certainly not. On almost every account, there are better books that have been written in the past eighty years  particularly about Rome, which inspires markedly less enthusiasm in Hamilton than Greece does. Early on in The Greek Way, she writes, The classical world is a myth in so far as it is conceived of as marked by the same characteristics.
Athens and Rome had little in common. That which distinguishes the modern world from the ancient, and that which divides the West from the East, is the supremacy of mind in the affairs of men, and this came to birth in Greece and lived in Greece alone of all the ancient world. Her judgements of Roman writers are typically harsh: Terences comedies reflect the Romans love of mediocrity; Cicero is brilliant only in his orations, and his other prose works failed and died; Horaces thought is hardly more than sagacious at its best and far oftener commonplace than not.
Interested ideas
Hamiltons work concentrates on ancient literary sources  there is little archaeology here. More than that, she analyses texts in order to make judgements about the kind of people their authors were  as, for example, when she writes What Xenophon was comes through clearly in his writings  a man of good will and good sense, kindly, honest, pious; intelligent too, interested in ideas . . .. This methodology of reconstructing culture through literature creates something of an interpretive minefield for Hamilton. On the one hand, the texts and authors must be extraordinary to be still worth paying attention to millennia later.
On the other hand, she often stresses that the individuals she writes about are not exceptional: indeed, that they were entirely characteristic of their time. This strategy is clearest in a chapter in The Greek Way about Pericles and Socrates, in which the two men are discovered to be typical, albeit exemplary, avatars of the values of fifth-century Athenian society as a whole  and, of course, her vision of fifth-century Athens rarely extends to include the women, the metics, the slaves.
So what is the value of introductions to ancient Greece and Rome that rely almost exclusively on outmoded forms of literary analysis and are peppered with casual racism (as when she declares, The miseries of Asia are a fearful page of history) The answer, of course, is that these texts have become works of reception, especially important for those curious about women classical scholars, or the history of the popular classical tradition in the years before the Second World War. And as Robert Kennedys enthusiasm also shows, Hamiltons popularity among politicians of the twentieth century is a fascinating subject. But I would be alarmed to hear that present-day politicians were reading her analyses as part of their enthusiasm for Thucydides. (Her chapter on him contains sentences such as There has never been a war fought for purer motives than the war against Persia.)
Surprisingly relevant
Inevitably Hamiltons books suffer by comparison with more recent introductions to ancient Greece and Rome. She is too flowery and imprecise. But her works still have the power to enlighten, particularly as artefacts of a time when what Europe meant was in crisis. Hamiltons project is, self-consciously, an attempt to understand Western culture. Viewed in that light, her books are surprisingly relevant in a world where President Trump is giving speeches about the values of Western Civilization in Warsaw and fascistic fringe movements are an increasing presence in European politics. Hamilton could have been writing for the present day in these lines: When the world is storm-driven and the bad that happens and the worse that threatens are so urgent as to shut out everything else from view, then we need to know all the strong fortresses of the spirit which men have built through the ages. Whatever her personal politics, Hamiltons romantic vision of the West is one that has proven attractive to far-right political groups today; for that reason alone her books are well worth reconsidering.

Hayleys Advantis invests in SLs future by inspiring future logisticians
Hayleys Advantis Limited recently completed the second programme in their capacity building initiative under the theme Inspiring Logistics in Sri Lanka. The programme was launched earlier this year to uplift the local logistics sector by bridging the gap between academic qualifications and corporate requirements. The company is working towards developing a competent, productive and skilled workforce to uplift trade standards and improve the global competitiveness of Sri Lanka.
The latest programme involved a field visit to the Port of Colombo and gave the opportunity for 60 students from the University of Moratuwa and Kotelawala Defence University to observe and learn first-hand how the port operates. Participants were briefed on standard operations at the port, ROI, procedures, planned future developments and were also given an operational tour of the port by Upul Jayatissa, Chief Manager - Marketing and Business Development, and Chitral Jayawarna, Senior Manager - Marketing and Business Development, Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
Commenting on the programme, Upul Jayatissa said, We are delighted to be a part of this initiative that strives to shape the next generation of skilled logisticians and take this sector to the next level. Due to Sri Lankas strategic geographical positioning investment in this sector is imperative, if we are to take full advantage of every opportunity afforded to us and this should begin with talent development. This also fits in with the Governments plans to make Sri Lanka a key logistics hub in the region.
Speaking about the event, Ruwan Waidyaratne, Managing Director of Hayleys Advantis, said, There is great potential for the logistics sector to contribute further towards the transformation of the country. This potential can be achieved through strategic investments in developing the skills necessary to navigate and capitalize on the future of the industry. We are thankful to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority for providing great insight into how the Port of Colombo functions and helping shape the minds of tomorrow. This programme looks to not only teach but to inspire the next generation of logisticians.
This was the second in a series of sessions planned to share knowledge and build capacity towards energizing the logistics industry in Sri Lanka, with many more workshops, internship programmes and discussions scheduled to take place throughout the rest of the year. These will be conducted free of charge for graduates, undergraduates and employees related to the industry in the hope of uplifting the logistics sphere in Sri Lanka.

Heed John's plea
There have been mixed reactions to Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera's budget announcement of a price reduction in beer, while effecting strength based increase in the price of hard liquor. Minister John Seneviratne has expressed his misgivings. Speaking in parliament, during the budget debate, he said, the price of Gal arrack, which he claimed, was the popular brand among the working class, who go for it in a big way, after their hard grind, at the end of the day, should be brought down. Minister Seneviratne, being in charge of the subject of Labour, naturally, would be sympathetic towards the working class. On the other hand, Joint Opposition Member of Parliament, Kanaka Herath, has praised the minister for slashing the price of beer, which, he hoped, would lead to the kassippu drinker taking to this soft brew.
Many imbibers would have hoped minister Samaraweera, to have left liquor prices untouched, when he presented the budget, due, mainly, to the sentiments he had expressed earlier, denouncing the hypocratic liquor policy that is being adopted in this country, and, also, speaking in favour of opening liquor outlets on Poya days, on the basis that the largest volume of liquor was sold on this particular day, holy to the Buddhists, on the sly.
Commendable, though, the minister's move to encourage the habitual imbiber of hard liquor to take to beer, it is doubtful if things will work out in that direction. This is mainly because, once addicted to hard liquor, it is next to impossible to settle for less. It is, mainly, a psychological thing, and, no deterrent, in the form of price hikes (of hard liquor), is going to change things. That is why we tend to agree with the suggestion of minister Seneviratne that his colleague has a change of heart and bring down the price of Gal, or, let it remain at the current price. As minister Seneviratne argued, the price of a bottle of this brand of arrack, which was once only Rs. 750, has now soared to over Rs. 1,500. The labourer, who earns a pittance, can ill afford this, but is helpless, and would give into the urge, whatever the price, leaving little to survive on, for self and family. This could lead to other social problems, far worse than if hard liquor prices were kept untouched, if not slashed.
Minister Seneviratne was circumspect when he pleaded for the reduction of the price of Gal'. He said, bringing down the price of Gal arrack would help ease the economic burden of the common man. If you need, you can increase the price of brandy. That would not affect the common man, Seneviratne said.
He said, he was in no way promoting liquor consumption, but only wanted to put things in perspective. All governments, he said, attempted to find ways to tackle liquor addiction, but failed in that endeavour. Those who drink will continue to drink. We brought the mathata titha programme, during the last regime, to discourage drinking. But that programme was not successful, the minister went onto elaborate.
He went on explain, that, the daily wage earner, the estate workers, the coolies, the natamis, those who toil in mines and gem pits, without seeing daylight, and, others engaged in backbreaking jobs, are all eagerly looking forward to the moment, at the end of day, when they could wrap themselves round the bottle and drink away their cares and drown their sorrows.
True, drinking in the evenings has become a daily routine for these types. No amount of persuasion, counselling, and, above all, the price stick, is going to change this way of life. Neither will they go for a soft liquor, just because it is being made cheaper. It will in no way have an effect on their senses that demands a feeling of oblivion, or, an escape, so to speak.
Minister Samaraweera, it is hoped, would reconsider his decision and heed the pleas of his ministerial colleague. There is going to be a further increase in the prices of hard liquor, from April next year, with the addition of the Nation Building Tax .The Minister, at least, should refrain from implementing this, because, things can only get worse, where the wage earner in concerned. Even Prof G. L. Peiris tried to encourage more and more hard liquor drinkers to take to beer, by similarly reducing the price. He argued that the excise revenue would not be affected due to the increase in the numbers consuming beer. However, a recent survey showed that hard liquor consumption had undergone a steep rise, while beer sales remained the same.
To be fair by Minister Samaraweera, his stated intention in effecting the beer price reduction was to convert the kassippu drinker to take to the soft brew and spare him the dangerous consequences. This was based on the scenario in western countries, where, only a very small percentage drink hard liquor, with the vast majority consuming soft liquor, such as beer and wine. It is moot, though, if the experiment will work in this country.

TradMed International 2017
Holistic Healing
Dr. Ranil De Silva, Director of the USJP University Project and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Innovation in Biotechnology & Neuroscience at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, is a neuroscientist by training and co-Chair of this years TradMed International 2017, an international symposium, educational exhibition, and trade fair on traditional medicines organised by the Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine Ministry. The TradMed International 2017 will be held from November 23-25 at Waters Edge in Colombo. In an interview with the Daily News in advance of the conference, De Silva, joined by a select group of his graduate students, said the west has failed miserably in combating many diseases and illness and advocated for a more traditional and indigenous approach to be adopted by the medical community.
Excerpts follow:
What is traditional medicine in a Sri Lankan context
A: Our traditional medicinal practices are related to the lifestyle of the Sri Lankan people. People used certain herbal medicines in their day-to-day life, and that became indigenous medicine almost as it is practised today. We have a 5,000 year history of doing this, starting from King Ravana and continuing on to the present day. But right now, it has fallen to the background. So we must bring it back and place a real emphasis on it and develop it so the country can benefit.
Traditional medicine in Sri Lanka is somewhat different from Ayurveda. Most people have the idea that its the same but its not. The mantra of traditional medicine in Sri Lanka is, You are what you eat and what you do. You are your environmentthe food you eat, relaxation, yoga, meditation, the work you do. Its a holistic approach, rather than like in western medicine, with the prescription of one aspirin. In modern days, the trend is going to functional foods, which came into the western world after the year 2000. But the concept has been there with traditional medicine more than 5,000 years ago. Each and every plant that grows in Sri Lanka has medicinal properties and is unique to a certain area, some in the Central Province, some in the southern areas. In traditional medicine, the belief is that plants that grow in a certain area are suitable for the well-being of people who live in that area. So if you add it to your curry, you wont have to visit the doctor. In western countries there is a saying, An apple a day keeps the doctor away. Im not going to say thats wrong, but what we say is that if you have a traditional diet you wont need the doctor.
How did you get into traditional medicine How has it complemented your work
A: As a neuroscientist, it is very alarming to look at the data on neurological diseases. Up to 1 billion people, over one sixth of the worlds population, forms neurological disorders. If you take just one disease alone, Dementia, its estimated to become a $1 trillion USD disease by 2018. One simple disease is the 18th largest economy in the world as far as GDP is concerned.Then we looked at what has been done in terms of science. The West has gone to town trying to prevent these diseases, treat them, and up to now there is not a single drug that works fully. So they have failed miserably. Thats why I ventured into natural products.
One thing weve done is take autopsied brains of people in Sri Lanka who had died with dementia and compared them to brains of people who were otherwise healthy but died from ageing, around 76 brains in total, and then we went and collected 50 brains from India. This was the biggest study ever done between two Asian countries. With it, we showed that people who were consuming more than three cups a day of green leaves and yellow vegetables had a better pathology in their brains, they were more protected. So that again proves our 5,000 year old holistic approach. We have published case control studies on Parkinsons Disease in 2017. It again showed that with people who consumed coffee and tea and had Parkinsons Disease, their Parkinsons had a protective effect by these natural products.
Youve done a bunch of research and work on the preventative or therapeutic effects of Ceylon cinnamon and tea. How do they help combat degenerative neurological disorders
A: My two publications on the subject have clearly shown it is protective. The more you drink black tea for example, the less plaque you get in the brain. Then, we have done work on 950 stroke patients, and we have again shown that people who were taking over three cups of black tea a day have a later age of onset (for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's). If you are drinking one cup of tea, onset might be at 60 years, but with three cups a day, people had an onset of 70 years. Age of onset of neurological disorders is directly correlated with black tea consumption. So we have done autopsy studies, we have done clinical studies, and also cell-culture studies. With the last type, weve definitively proven that Ceylon Green Tea protects the brain from stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Then, because of my involvement in this work with natural products, I got called to take on a challenge with the national leader of Ceylon cinnamon. Weve just started our work; so we dont have data yet. But cinnamon is interesting because of the structure it has - it has the ability to bind to the 2 protein that causes Alzheimers disease, preventing the aggregation of this protein. So this could be part of a remedy in the future.
Last year, you presented original research at the 56th annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, titled, Banking the Brain and Blood: A Sri Lankan Emerging Era of Collaborative Research, subtitled, What the East Can Offer the West. In your view, what could the western world learn from traditional medicine practices of the east
A: Sri Lanka sits on two gold mines. One is our indigenous history and knowledge, our herbs, which date back to 5,000 years. The second is my bio-bank. We have 76 completely studied brains, and over 3,000 blood DNA samples. In South Asia, this is the biggest. So the West is eager and interested to work with us because of these two gold mines.
If you take the United States as an example, to make one drug and bring it into the market, they take a minimum of twelve years with a cost of almost $6 billion USD. More than 90 percent of these drugs fail. So see how much the USA is investing, the time theyre using, and the end result. On top of that, their healthcare is quite expensive. But here, the holistic approach is absolutely accessible, cheap or free. When you compare western medicine and indigenous medicine, there is a big disparity. Over 80 percent of the world population depends on traditional and plant-derived medicine. Even in Germany, 90 percent of the population now uses herbal medicine. So you can see how things are changing, and theres a huge potential and huge market for herbal medicine.
If you look at it from a western point of view, they will look at turmeric, take the molecule, go to town, and pay billions of dollars to do that. But look at the 5,000-year-old tradition of Sri Lankans using this. They dont take turmeric alone; its a mixture. If you consider the curries, we have a mixture of spices in curry powder called thuna paha, and all those have a synergetic effect together that cannot be replaced by western medicine. Science has now proven that the synergetic effect of them makes the absorption better. Western medicine looks at a molecule or nanoparticle, whereas indigenous medicine is holistic.
What is your involvement with TradMed International 2017
A: This is my first TradMed conference. My area of expertise is neuroscience, not necessarily traditional medicine, but because of a request made by the Health Minister, I took on this challenge. We have really fulfilled that challenge. We have over 300 abstracts already in the pipeline, one of the highest in Sri Lanka to get into an international symposium. The authors are from Sri Lanka and around the world; from Iran, India, Australia, and many more. These 300 abstracts come from medical faculties, agricultural faculties and indigenous faculties. Everybody has contributed. In a true sense, its a multidisciplinary event, so everyone can enjoy it.
What we are trying to do in this conference is, first, make traditional medicine evidence-based. Even though we have a 5,000 year old history of using it, every western person still asks us, Where are the clinical trials One of the main criterion of this conference is to introduce evidence-based traditional medicine with success proven in control studies. Second, we know that you cant ever prove the efficacy of holistic traditional medicine if you dont use a multidisciplinary approach. So the entire conference is centred around being multidisciplinary and evidence-based. Were trying to regularize traditional and indigenous medicine, so that western medicine does not eventually overtake ours.
What can attendees expect to gain from this years TradMed conference
A: A tremendous amount. For younger graduates, there will be two directors from EURON (European Graduate School of Neuroscience) and Queensland University of Technology in Australia, with whom the University of Sri Jayewardenepura signed MOUs (Memorandums of Understanding), to provide fully-funded scholarships to study abroad. There will also be scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science, with whom we also signed a MOU. So there is the option to meet officials from China, Australia and Europe and see the possibility of doing double doctorates or double masters with these affiliated institutions.
Then for the business sector, there are tremendous opportunities. You can forge relationships with export market buyers. On the last day (November 25) of the conference, chaired by the Health Minister, there is a brainstorming session at the end which will focus on business to business and business to academic partnerships. What we are trying to do there is foster innovation. For example, were not going to be exporting turmeric. Were exporting an end product from turmeric, in which clinical trials have been done. That has a huge potential. Finally, especially for the indigenous groups, they could come in in a big way and open Sri Lanka for indigenous medicine with the international community. We are not asking for their secrets, what they have been holding for a long time, otherwise people might take them and patent them.
We are getting academics from Iran, the US, Australia, Singapore, Norway, and Holland. So interaction with them and their research will help develop new products. Earlier we had the Mahaweli, which opened the economy. This is going to be the second Mahaweli for Sri Lanka.
Tea protects the brain from stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Officers who dont speak decently, understand peoples problems humanely and act maliciously should resign from their posts as they have no place in the Police Service, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
He was addressing the gathering at a social service programme held at the Mallawapitiya Elders Home where the Police, Buddhist and religious officers donated a set of equipment for the use of its inmates on November 11.
The IGP said a very peaceful situation prevails today in the country with freedom of speech and association fully restored.
Even the President and the Prime Minister had become targets of criticism and verbal attacks since the country has unbridled freedom. Those who misappropriated millions of public funds and stacked them in foreign banks during the previous regime now criticise the Government.
He said the Police Service had undergone a major transformation under the guidance of the President, the Prime Minister and the Law and Order Minister. The crime rate in the country will reduce by 75 percent by the end of this year, he said.

India tops list of countries affected by climate change

The recently released Global Climate Risk Index 2018 report has put India amongst the sixth most vulnerable countries after Haiti, Zimbabwe, Fiji, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The report, recently released in Germany, has, however, analysed and taken into account data between 1997 and 2016.
Prepared by a group of researchers on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), has estimated that more than 5.24 lakh people died across the world, as a direct result of more than 11 000 extreme weather events accounting to loss of around US$ 3.16 trillion during this period.
In India 2,119 people were killed during 2016, a number higher than any other country, losing $21,500 million the third highest financial loss after those suffered by China and the US. The report ranked the US fifth in fatalities from climate change impacts during 2016.
It mentions the heat waves in South Asia which persisted until the beginning of summer 2016, breaking a record of 51C in Rajasthan, in May 2016. Over a thousand people died of hyperthermia or dehydration. In total, 1 800 fatalities were reported, especially in Southeast India. The persisting drought and heat waves affected over 330 million people. They were followed by an extreme monsoon season lasting from June to October in eastern, western and central India. At least 300 people died due to the heavy rainfall and landslides and millions of people were affected by washed away crops, destroyed roads or disrupted electricity and phone lines. On 12th December 2016, cyclone Vardah, one of the costliest cyclones ever in the North Indian Ocean basin, made landfall in Chennai31. Several people died here and infrastructure was severely damaged.
Researchers also conclude that sea surface temperature seems to play a key role in intensifying storms. But said, it was difficult to distinguish between natural variability and human induced extremes. It concluded that rising sea level, which is partly caused by climate change, was responsible for the increased intensity of floods, storms and droughts. For example, a study shows that the 2016 torrential rains in Louisiana, USA, were made almost twice as likely by human-induced climate change.
Furthermore, the report also found increasing evidence on the link between extreme El Nio events and global warming. Date collected in 2014 showed, the occurrence of such events could double in the future due to climate change.

Iran and Iraq quake kills more than 340: [VIDEO]

A 7.3-magnitude earthquake has shaken the northern border region between Iran and Iraq, killing at least 348 people and injuring thousands more.
One Iranian aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, one of the largest this year.
The majority of those who died were in Iran's western Kermanshah province. Nearly 5,660 were said to be injured.
Seven people died in Iraq, where people fled into the streets in the capital, Baghdad.
"I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"
In the latest updates from Iran:
State news agency Irna quoted an emergency official as saying 5,346 people were injured in Iran alone
Most of the victims were in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 15km (10 miles) from the border, emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said
The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded, state TV reported
A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said.
Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks. As a result, they are at risk of collapse during a significant earthquake like the one that struck on Sunday.
Rescue teams were being hampered by landslides, Koolivand said.
About 1.8 million people live within 100km (60 miles) of the epicentre,the UN estimates.
On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan in the Kurdistan Region.
The Iraqi ministry of health said 321 people had been wounded in the Iraqi Kurdistan region.
The BBC's Rami Ruhayem, in the regional capital Irbil, said shaking there had lasted for more than a minute.
"For a few seconds at first it was barely detectable, I wasn't sure whether it was a minor tremor or just my imagination," he said. "But soon enough it was unmistakable as the building started swaying from side to side."
The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km southwest of Halabja, near the northeastern border with Iran,the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.
It occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait.
In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people.
Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 last year and 19 the year before.
Why is Iran prone to earthquakes
Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past.
In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple centimetres a year.
In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the northwest these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression.
Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture.
Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals.

A jailer carrying hashish into the Dumbara Bogambara Prison for sale among its inmates was arrested by prison security officers on November 10.
The security officers said they had kept the jailer under close observation as his close association with certain inmates caused suspicion. Accordingly, they examined the guard while he was entering the prison on November 10 and found 14.84 gm of hashish in his possession.
The suspect was handed over to the Prison Superintendent and then to Pallekelle police for further investigations. The 43-year-old jailer is a resident of Werallagama, Katugastota. He may have been carrying on the illicit trade for many months, police said.

On year-on-year basis for the period ending June 2017, Land Price Index (LPI) recorded a 12.6 per cent increase, continuing the recent trend in land price movements in the Colombo district, the Central Bank said in a news release.
All three sub-indices of LPI (Residential, Commercial and Industrial) contributed to this increase.
In order to monitor the developments in the real estate sector, Central Bank (CB) has been compiling and analyzing several indicators.
The bi-annual Land Price Index (LPI) which is compiled covering the Colombo District since 1998 is one of the indicators of this nature. In the compilation process of LPI, the CB uses the land price data collected by the Valuation Department of Sri Lanka covering around 50 centers of five District Secretariat (DS) divisions1 in the Colombo District.
In view of the diverse nature of the land use and to maintain homogeneity, three indices for residential, commercial and industrial lands are computed separately. The overall LPI is computed by taking the average of these three sub-indices.

LAUGFS, Ministry of Education partner to strengthen mathematical knowledge of O/L students
In a bid to help strengthen mathematical knowledge among students, LAUGFS Holdings has partnered with the Mathematics branch of the Ministry of Education to facilitate a series of Math Camps conducted using Advanced Learning Techniques developed by the Ministry. The Nana Maga Math Camps will assist over 3,000 students sitting for their G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) Examination in the years 2017 and 2018.
Enhancing mathematics knowledge is critical for a students higher studies and career prospects. Our efforts to strengthen maths within the school curriculum is driven by a long term aim to strengthen our countrys human resources with the necessary aptitudes and skills. This is critical to secure the future of our nation, explained Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education.
Asanga Ranasinghe - LAUGFS Holdings Sector Managing Director, Thilak De Silva  LAUGFS Group Managing Director, Priyatha Nanayakkara - Director of Education (Mathematics Division) and Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education together with other senior Ministry representatives at the official handing over of the Nana Maga textbooks to the Ministry of Education.
We need the support of corporates, media and all others to reinforce this message with renewed interest in this important subject. We are extremely pleased to have the support of a large corporate like LAUGFS to take this endeavour forward.
The Nana Maga Maths Camps are conducted for G.C.E. (O/L) students with a specially designed Accelerated Teaching Methodology developed by the Ministry of Educations Mathematics Branch.
The project will be rolled out in the Southern Province during 2017/18, and is expected to be expanded across the country in different phases.
As a truly Sri Lankan conglomerate, we have a strong focus on nurturing future leaders of our country. The LAUGFS Nana Maga program was set up with this vision in mind, remarked LAUGFS Holdings Chairman, W.K.H. Wegapitiya.
The Nana Maga Math Camps project is one such initiative under this, where we have collaborated with the Ministry of Educations Mathematics Branch, whose work is truly commendable in continuously elevating and enriching mathematics knowledge and understanding among students.
The project launch took place at the Sariputhra Maha Vidyalaya in Galle recently, with the presence of LAUGFS Holdings and the Ministry of Education. During the event, over 3,000 academic textbooks were also handed over to the Ministry of Education by LAUGFS Holdings.
We partnered with the Ministry of Education to roll out this unique program for children across the island with a firm resolve to help make quality education more accessible and engaging for all, commented LAUGFS Holdings Managing Director Thilak De Silva.
As a conglomerate, we employ talent from a diverse range of professions. These range from the engineers at LAUGFS Engineering, to scientists at our R&D facilities of LAUGFS Lubricants. Maths is a critical subject for many professions today, whether it is finance, IT, engineering, auditing, quality control or procurement. Therefore, we felt the need to play an active role to help create awareness of the importance of mathematics to build a successful career, which needs to start from the classroom.
These interactive maths camps have been designed by using newly developed advanced learning methodologies with the aim of increasing student interest and understanding of mathematical concepts. They are also aided with activity-based learning techniques to better engage students and to make learning maths an enjoyable experience, explained Priyatha Nanayakkara, Director of Education (Mathematics Division) at the Ministry of Education.
With the support of LAUGFS, we are now able to reach out to a large number of deserving students across the country, she further elaborated.
A solid foundation in mathematics is important to enhance essential skills such as problem solving and analytical thinking. The unique and advanced methodologies used to introduce mathematical concepts at the LAUGFS Nana Maga Maths Camps will significantly support students with the proper guidance and tools to develop mathematical skills in a supportive and enjoyable environment.
LAUGFS is one of the largest diversified business conglomerates and a trusted name in Sri Lanka.

Boost tourism with Srilankan Airlines
Liberalising air links
According to news reports, Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena has asked Qatar to partner with the island's troubled national carrier SriLankan Airlines. The Presidents move is to be commended: the airline has racked up billions in losses, getting rid of it will allow the Government to focus its limited resources on priorities such as health and education.
The argument about the airline has been muddied by emotion, the people; for it is ultimately the people who pay for this; must ask if this is the best use of taxpayers' money.
The annual report for 2016/17 reports that the Srilankan Airlines Group recorded a loss of LKR 28bn (2016  LKR 12bn) with an accumulated loss of LKR 170bn (2016  LKR 141bn) as at March 31, 2017. The Companys current liabilities exceeded its current assets by LKR 99Bn (2016  LKR 73Bn) and the total equity of the Company as at Reporting date has declined to a negative LKR 116, Bn (2016  negative LKR 88 Bn).
The Group is technically insolvent and the Auditor General has warned that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. The Auditor General has relied, inter alia, on two letters of support: a letter issued by the Secretary to the Treasury on December 23, 2016 and Cabinet approval on July 18, 2017 as notified by letter dated July 26, 2017 confirming the support of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) to the Company to continue its operations as a Going Concern. In a laymans terms, unless the Treasury (read taxpayers) is willing to underwrite the activities of the airline it will go bust.
The airline is in debt to the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples Bank to a total of Rs.49 bn as at March 31, 2017. The banks have extended support to the airline on the basis of letters of comfort issued from the Ministry of Finance. Further, the airline owes Rs.26.5 bn to international bondholders which are secured on the basis of a Government Guarantee of USD 175 mn. The guarantees extended by the Government to banks and bondholders represent additional potential losses of public funds.
The airline last reported a profit only in 2008, when under the management of Emirates. It has failed to report a profit in any year since then. The airline industry is a high risk, low profitability business. A study by Oliver Wojahn for IATA published in 2012 shows that the overall airline industry has failed to cover its cost of capital in all years except six, since 1981. The study covered 69 public listed airlines worldwide, covering roughly 70% of the airline industry.
Future losses
Sri Lanka has obtained a loan from the IMF a loan US$1.5 billion (the second since 2009, the previous administration borrowed US$2.6 bn) to attempt to put public finances in order. It is sobering to note that the accumulated losses of the airline (just over a US$1 billion) are 65% of the IMF loan. Sustaining further losses is suicidal and tax increases to fund these and future losses represent an unacceptable burden the public.
Sri Lanka does need air connectivity but this is best provided by liberalising air services, not by running an airline. A good example is an extensive liberalisation with India which took place in 2003. Prior to deregulation, only the national carriers of the country were allowed fly, the number of flights was restricted, the pricing was regulated and the destinations controlled.
The liberalisations were in the areas of pricing, competition, capacity and new routes. Market forces were allowed to determine prices as opposed to being set by the two governments. A report by Raveen Ekanayake of the Institute of Policy Studies in January 2016 notes that:
The benefits of liberalization are clear... passenger traffic between the two countries more than doubled in the immediate wake of liberalization in 2003 and has since increased. The bulk of the new traffic being generated is a result of the relaxation of capacity constraints on metropolitan destinations.
The improvement in air connectivity has facilitated the movement of people to forge trade, investment, and cultural linkages between the two countries. The tourism industry in Sri Lanka, in particular, has been a major beneficiary.. During the early 2000s, India in terms of volume was the 3rd top source of tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka after the United Kingdom and Germany. By 2004, India had jumped to the second place and by 2005, India became the top source of tourists to Sri Lanka, surpassing the United Kingdom by as much as 20% in terms of tourist numbers. Since then India stands as the top source of tourist arrivals to the island.
This is not an isolated experience, it is confirmed by numerous studies including one by IATA which showed that traffic growth subsequent to liberalisation typically averaged between 12% and 35%, directly benefiting economies by increasing GDP, employment, tourism, and exports. According to the IATA report, the creation of the Single European Aviation Market in 1993 led to average annual growth doubling between 1995-2004 compared to growth in the years 1990-1994. The US-UK agreement lead to an almost 29% increase in traffic.
Aviation hub
Singapores liberal aviation policy has been a key factor in the growth of Singapores Changi International Airport, where air transport contributed nearly S$20 billion of value-added to the Singapore economy or about 6% of the Singapore GDP in 2011.
A national carrier is a source of pride but it is not a priority for cash-strapped Government. The airline should be disposed, or even closed and a liberal air services policy adopted instead.
This could boost growth and truly turn Sri Lanka into an aviation hub, freeing taxpayers money to be used for health, education and other priorities.

Sri Lankas 1.5 million three wheeler drivers will get an opportunity to become owners of brand new electric three wheelers under a scheme proposed by Minister Mangala Samaraweeras maiden budget in parliament on Thursday.
It has proposed to provide loan facilities for leasing electric three wheelers in the ratio of 10:90.
Anyone can purchase electric three wheelers by paying 10 percent of its value up front under this scheme.
The government will also take measures to export the used fossil fuel trishaws to needy countries like Bangladesh, as this country has already expressed willingness to import those used trishaws from Sri Lanka.
Further, the green three wheeler service will be made a mode of transport for foreign tourists by providing necessary training for tuk tuk drivers with licence from the Tourist board.
Although riding in a tuk-tuk at present has become more messy than comfortable, this new initiative will make it a convenient trade of transport and brand for a true, Sri Lanka experience with a smile!

West Indies batsmen have lost their cavalier approach - Avishka
Lots of positives on A team tour of Caribbean
A team tours are normally meant to give exposure to young players and at the same time give opportunities for out-of-form players to get back into form and reclaim their places in the national team. From that aspect Sri Lanka A teams tour of the Caribbean proved a success.
One of the biggest achievements was getting Dhananjaya de Silva back in form and in the national team. He is a good enough player to be in the Test team but he kind of lost his touch in the last few months. One of the challenges on the A tour was to get him back into the national side which we did and he is back in the Test squad to India, said Sri Lanka A team coach Avishka Gunawardene.
De Silva given the responsibility of captaining the side scored a century and two fifties in his five innings in the three-match 4-day unofficial test series against West Indies A which Sri Lanka A won by a 2-1 margin. The rain-hit three-match unofficial ODI series Sri Lanka A drew one-all.
Talking of the positives to come out of the tour Gunawardene said, If you talk about positives on this tour Dhananjaya, Dasun (Shanaka), (Malinda) Pushpakumara showed his skills with the ball again, Shehan Jayasuriya and, Lahiru Kumara got his rhythm back in the last couple of games. He had lost a little bit of his rhythm thats why he was put on the A tour. We also had a chance to look at the young boys. I had six boys who were less than 22 years old on that tour, some of them had hardly played a first-class season. Charith Asalanka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Asitha Fernando the benefits are the experience they gained on the tour. It was a very good experience for the young guys. What we wanted to achieve we did but I would have liked someone like Asalanka and Wanindu who have played a few games for Sri Lanka to do a little bit better than what they did. Still they are in their early 20s they still havent played a proper first-class season so theyve got time.
The whole tour Gunawardene pointed out took place at only two venues in Jamaica  Sabina Park, Kingston and Trelawny Multiplex in Florence Hall.
The wickets were fast but the tracks were pretty fair for both teams. The bowlers if they bend their backs and if they actually put revolutions you could get the ball to turn you can get a bit of bounce and get the ball to move. If the batsmen actually put their minds properly you can score runs.
The only thing was the whole tour took place at only at two venues which had very slow outfields that probably was one of the reasons why batsmen were at a disadvantage. The scores were a little low than on a normal ground, you could add at least another 40 runs to every total, said Gunawardene.
The whole series was bowler dominated and West Indies A had a really good pace attack with four seamers who were quick and they were at you all the time. We played all three formats with the duke ball  white, red and pink. The bowlers had a slight advantage with the Duke balls than the Kookaburra. Throughout the series we had rain and it was overcast and it helped the bowlers a bit.
Sri Lanka A lost the first unofficial test by an innings and 13 runs inside three days but bounced back to win the next two tests and with it take the series 2-1.
What youve got to understand is that in the first test we played with only four batsmen. Sadeera (Samarawickrama) and Roshen (Silva) were supposed to join us but because they were playing against Pakistan the dates over lapsed because it takes two days to get to the West Indies. And when you go to the West Indies you lose a day because we are 12 hours ahead, said Gunawardene who will continue with his role as A team coach till his contract expires in 2019.
Roshen couldnt make it and Sadeera didnt make it to the whole tour. Actually we played with only four batsmen which included our reserve wicket-keeper. Basically it didnt help our cause but once Roshen was back the middle was good and then we carried on. In the first test we didnt have time to settle down. It was a 35-hour flight (two flights) to get to the West Indies and once we got there we had lost a day because of the 12-hour time difference. It takes a couple of days to get adjusted. These little things contributed towards our defeat in the first test, he said.
Commenting on the present state of West Indies cricket Gunawardene who was last there 12 years ago as captain of the Sri Lanka A team said, I dont think there is any problem with their talent. There are plenty of talented guys out there and especially the seamers who played in that series were very quick and very impressive. Even (Rahkeem) Cornwall let alone his huge size he actually balanced the team. He bats at no. 7 and he bowls 25 overs from one end, he bowled well with his off-breaks. There isnt anything wrong with West Indies talent but I dont know what their system is like. If they have a problem it must be with the system because there isnt anything wrong with their cricketing skills.
There is still enthusiasm in the country and their culture in cricket has not changed much. They have kind of moved away from their typical West Indian style of play especially the batsmen. They have moved away from their traditional game and they have kind of taken more to the technical side, maybe because they are having English coaches. Their A team coach is an Englishman. I dont know whether that influence has made them concentrate more on the technical side, continued Gunawardene.
The difference I see is that the typical West Indian calypso when it comes to batting is not there. They had their unique way of playing cricket that kind of culture has changed. That is one of the biggest changes Ive seen in the Caribbean touring there after 12 years. No cavalier approach like the days gone by. The West Indies players of the bygone era didnt care too much about their techniques each and every individual batsmen had their own way of playing cricket. They might not look good but they were very effective. The bowlers they were pretty much the West Indies style big made, aggressive and fast, he added.
Gunawardene stated that for the next four months there will be no A team fixtures as Sri Lanka Cricket want the players to concentrate on playing in the upcoming domestic season. We need cricket off season. The guys will have domestic cricket for the next four months so nothing has been confirmed so far.

Dialog Axiata followed suit, accounting for 11.57% of turnover (value of LKR0.82Bn) while Hayleys contributed LKR0.71Bn to account for 10.01% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR7.11Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR5.25Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR1.42Bn (+8.19% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 1.31Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 1.03% W-o-W (or LKR 30.90Bn) to LKR2,979.73Bn cf. LKR3,010.62Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Motors Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 34.12% (or LKR 2.42Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by United Motors which accounted for 99.9% of the sectors total turnover. The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 22.00% (or LKR 1.56Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Hayleys & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 64.57% of the sector turnover.
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 16.31% (or LKR 1.16Bn) to the market driven by HNB, Sampath, Central Finance which accounted for 83.56% of the sector turnover.

Top gainers and losers
PC Pharma was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 100% W-o-W from LKR0.10 to LKR0.20. Adam Investments gained 25.0% W-o-W to close at LKR0.50. Durdans NV (+11.5% W-o-W) and Lion Brewery (+8.6% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
Madulsima was the weeks highest price loser, declining 27.3% W-o-W to close at LKR13.60 while Udapussellawa (-15.9% Y-o-Y), Balangoda (-15.9% W-o-W) & Hapugastenne (-12.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.

In terms of volume, Melstacorp & Access Engineering led foreign purchases while United Motors & Dialog led foreign sales. In terms of value HNB & Melstacorp led foreign purchases while United Motors & Nestle led foreign sales.
Point of View
Markets lost momentum this week, losing 69 points W-o-W as investors waited in anticipation of the National Budget for 2018.
The CBSLs monetary policy decision on Tuesday to hold policy rates steady for the 4th consecutive time this year (at its one before the last policy meeting for the year), was mostly priced in and the decision failed to move markets significantly in either direction.
The benchmark ASPI consequently fell below the 6600-mark for the 1st time in a week. Despite the drop in the Index, average daily turnover levels picked up 8% this week, as Institutional and HNI investors returned strongly, accounting for ~67% of the weeks total market turnover cf. just 56% last week.
In contrast to last week, when Blue-chips dominated crossings, strong activity in mid-caps such as UML (50% of total crossings), DIAL (16% of total crossings) and Hayleys (15% of total crossing) dominated market activity over the week.
Foreign investors meanwhile, turned into net sellers this week, with net outflows from the Bourse totaling Rs. 2.2Bn cf. net inflows of Rs. 0.7Bn last week and Rs. 0.5Bn the week prior. Year-to-date net flows to the CSE consequently amounted to Rs. 17.41Bn, lower than the H117 total of Rs. 21.5Bn. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the continued release of corporate earnings for the Sept17 quarter which have been relatively mixed thus far.
Budget proposals align with broader policy agenda
The GoSL unveiled Budget 2018 this week, presenting a set of proposals that are broadly aligned with the goals stated in the PMs statement and Vision 2025 from earlier this year.
In line with this broader policy agenda, Budget 2018 included proposals to promote investment and liberalize trade while ensuring social safety nets and encouraging SMEs to ensure inclusive growth.
Notable proposals to promote investments include the removal of certain foreign land ownership laws and setting up a one-stop-shop for business registrations while drafting new anti-competitive laws.
Proposals to liberalize trade meanwhile, include the abolishing of 1200 para-tariffs, the drafting a new Customs Ordinance Act and automating specific customs processes.
SMEs (which account for ~52% of GDP but still remains in the informal sector) got a slew of incentives under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme which falls under the GoSLs broader theme of Enterprise Sri Lanka, targeted at encouraging Sri Lankas entrepreneurial spirit.
In terms of capital markets meanwhile, Budget 2018 proposals include the implementation of a legal framework & policy environment to further develop capital markets.
The Budget also addressed the fact that two of Sri Lankas systemically important state banks are facing capital pressures and that in addition to a total capital infusion of Rs.10Bn (in equal parts over 2017 and 2018) to BoC, these two entities will be allowed to raise equity capital following the GoSLs partial divesture of its controlling stakes in these state banks.

From mid-century confessional poetry to reality TV
Studies of confessioneven offhand remarks on the subjectmust, by custom, begin with a few sweeping claims about Confession in the West. No essay on personal poetry, no think-piece on memoir feels complete until someone has lit a candle at the shrine of St. Augustine. Having witnessed a few such acts of historical hand-waving, you could be forgiven for thinking that a council of 13th-century bishopsor was it an 18th-century philosophermade the debut of The Real World in 1992 a historical inevitability.
There is, however, a serious point to be made on this millennial scale. Our current culture of self-awareness, self-expression, and self-care rests on foundations laid long ago. Weve risen to penthouse levelsmillions of life stories highso its only natural if weve lost sight of the ground. If we could just get our heads out of the clouds, maybe wed see that other foundations were pouredor were possible. As it is, we have trouble imagin[ing a] self absent the imperative to scrutinize and . . . articulate it. In the famous words of Michel Foucault: Western man has become a confessing animal.
Stories on this scale (Western man!) can take your breath away. They can also suck the air out of the room. Theyre not harmful in themselves, but they turn deadly when we use them not to explain new phenomena, but to explain them away. Theres nothing new under the sun. Just read your Augustine and Rousseauyour Wordsworth, your Sade, your Freud! But heres the thing: midcentury Americans had read themwell, all right, maybe not Sadeand still they felt that they were witnessing something new. I want to start by taking this sense of newness seriously.
Consider American poetry, which took a confessional turn around 1959in April of that year, to be precise.
April 1st, Newton Lower Falls, MAAnne Sexton, a little-known poet, declares herself the most about to be published poet around. Boy, shes not kidding! Before ten weeks more can pass, shell have poems out in Harpers, the Hudson Review, the New Yorkerthe list goes on. She will write about her brushes with madness, about suicide attempts, about sex in (and beyond) the marriage bed. Pretty soon, shell be known as the confessional poet par excellence.
April 13th, New York, NYKnopf publishes W. D. Snodgrasss Hearts Needle, in which the poet deals frankly with his recent divorce and subsequent estrangement from his daughter. The book would gain national attention and go on to win the Pulitzer Prize in poetry.
April 28th, New York, NYFarrar, Straus & Cudahy releases Robert Lowells tell-all book Life Studies. In a series of memoirssome in prose, some in verseLowell exposes his troubled youth and confesses to an ongoing struggle with mental illness. Life Studies flies off bookstore shelves and drugstore racks. It would go on to win the National Book Award.
This sudden swell of confession, rising and breaking as one, quickly pulled in other people, too. Emerging poets were caught in the undertow (see: Sylvia Plath), while established figures (Ginsberg, Berryman, Roethke, Rich, etc.) suddenly found that they were riding a wave. It turns out theyd been writing confessional poems for years already. Reviewing Life Studies for the Nation, M. L. Rosenthal dubbed this book confessional, and the name stuck like tar. Manythough not Rosenthalmeant it as an insult, but the public didnt care. Pretty soon, confessional poetry was Americas most popular genre of verse.
Telling this story of confessions sudden ascent, poets and critics reach for the same word again and again. This was a breakthroughpast formalism, past repression, past social restraintinto emotion, into experience, into the world. - Lit Hub

Morocco reach World Cup at Ivory Coast expense
Morocco qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia with a 2-0 victory away to Ivory Coast, who missed out on a fourth consecutive appearance at the finals.
Goals from defenders Nabil Dirar and Medhi Benatia in Abidjan ensured that Morocco would finish as Group C winners.
Morocco needed only a draw in their last group game to finish top of the standings ahead of the Ivorians, who had to win to clinch a place in Russia.
After weathering an early storm, including a potential penalty call, Morocco scored two goals in the space of five minutes. Dirar opened the scoring off a cross-turned-shot on 25 minutes and Benatia doubled the lead after a corner on the half-hour.
Morocco, who completed their qualifying campaign with maximum points and no goals conceded, last appeared in a World Cup in 1998 in France.
They topped the group on 12 points, four above the Ivorians. Gabon, who earlier drew 0-0 with Mali in Franceville, finished with seven and bottom-placed Mali five.

Naimbala State Dispensary in ruins
The Naimbala State Dispensary was suffering with many shortcomings, people in the area said.
The dispensary does not have essential drugs and equipment needed for treating emergency cases.
The Yatiyana and Thihagoda towns lack an Osu Sala outlet or a state pharmacy. Poor patients seeking treatment from the dispensary have to purchase medicines from private pharmacies at high cost, they said.
Clinics at the dispensary are poorly maintained and the entire building in ruins. Water seeps into the building during rains, patients said.
Weeds have encroached on the ground and the place is seen like an abandoned construction. A broken boundary fence around the dispensary cannot protect it from looters and vagabonds, the residents said. Walls badly need paintings and doctors and staff members have no space to have their meals or even for a rest. .
Many emergency cases brought to the hospital daily are transferred to the Matara District General Hospital and the Kamburupitiya Regional Base Hospital since the Naimbala State Dispensary hardly has necessities.
They said over 50,000 people live in the area and they urgently need a proper divisional hospital.
Therefore, they request the authorities to take steps to renovate the hospital and provide it with necessary facilities.
The dispensary was shifted to a private building recently but the new place does not meet required condition or facilities for a proper medical institution, the residents said.

NCP kidney patients suffer without dialysis treatment
Three hundred persons are suffering from chronic kidney diseases (CKDu) in the Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura districts and they do not have access to dialysis treatment facility, sources said.
Reportedly, a few hospitals in the North Central Province have dialysis treatment machines and relevant medical care including the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, Hingurakgoda, Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Medawachchiya and Thambuttegama Hospitals. Around 19,000 kidney patients including CKDu patients have been registered at the hospitals in the NCP. Nearly 300 CKDu patients do not get dialysis treatment three times per month due to lack of medical facilities at many hospitals in the districts.
Lack of doctors, nurses and trained staff is the main obstacle to provide proper treatment for these patients, the sources said.
We need at least 50 trained nurses and 20 doctors, Dr. Palitha Bandara said.
He said the President, during his recent visit to Kahatagasdigiliya, came to know about the shortcomings and directed officials to take steps immediately to resolve them.

Owning a cat could prevent asthma
According to a new study, owning a cat can help prevent high risk children from developing asthma.
Contrary to popular belief, a cat in the house is good for infants born with a gene that makes them more susceptible to the condition. According to Danish scientists, early exposure to these allergens could help prevent the ailment developing. However, researchers at the University of Copenhagen's specialist childhood asthma research facility found no benefits for owning a dog.
In the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunilogy there is a genetic variant, called a TT genotype, which is associated with a higher risk of asthma and related illnesses such as pneumonia and forms of bronchitis. Having a cat made little difference to children with a low risk of asthma, lead author Dr Jakob Stokholm discovered. However, the chances of getting asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis were 'inversely associated' among the TT genotype kids.
In other words, the higher the risk of getting asthma, the more benefit owning a cat would have.
It is believed that exposure to the allergens in cat hair helps bolster a child's immune system as it develops, rather than as an adult when it is fully formed.
The reason cats are more effective than dogs is possibly because they are more likely to have contact with a child's bed than dogs.

Over Rs.287 b allocated for social welfare in Budget: Alagiyawanna
Although some politicians attempt to mislead the people, this budget has allocated Rs.287 billion for social welfare, said Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna. He also said the recurrent expenditure and the amounts allocated for social welfare have not been reduced.
He added that these additional amounts have been allocated without curtailing those of the previous years. He made these observations in Parliament on Saturday, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2019.
The Deputy Minister further said that over 10 million people use public transport while 10 million people use their own vehicles. Although the ownership of a private vehicle reflects the improved economy of the country, a developed public transport service is required for a country too.
Minister Alagiyawanna said if commuters who used their own private vehicles they could be attracted to the public sector transport, it would be a great means to save fuel.
The Deputy Minister said that Rs.19 billion had been allocated for the welfare of students. He also added that spending on teacher training is better than constructing school buildings.
He said some politicians attempt to say that the Customs Ordinance had been cancelled with the proposals of this budget which is totally misleading.
Whatever it is, several Acts, including the Customs Ordinance need to be amended, Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna said.
Ministers John, Patali Champika oppose reduction in beer prices
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragawmuwa Development Minister John Seneviratne and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka expressed their opposition to reducing the prices of beer.
Instead Minister Seneviratne requested the Finance Minister to bring down the price of Gal (extra special) arrack from Rs 1,500 to Rs 750.
Participating in the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament on Saturday, he argued that beer and wine are middle class drinks and therefore he preferred increasing their prices further.
Middle class people drink wine and beer just for fun. Unlike them, the labourers who toil throughout the day need some drink at dusk to relieve their pains. We must allow them to drink.
The reality is that many labourers are addicted to moonshine because Gal Arrack is costly.
Those people die at a young age by consuming moonshine.
I request the Finance Minister to bring in a special amendment to reduce the price of Gal Arrack. Otherwise, we would have a shortage of labourers in this country, Minister Seneviratne said.
Speaking on a totally different line, Minister Champika Ranawaka objected to the reduction of beer prices, stating it could be the first step to encouraging children and women to use liquor.
It is a myth to think that the people will shift from hard liquor to soft liquor, when the prices of soft liquor goes down.
This is not the way to solve the problem of liquor addiction. It is good to have a price formula based on the alcohol percentage, but if you reduce the prices of beer, then you will be encouraging more people to drink, he said.
Budget increases per capita tax burden: Vijitha
The Budget for next year has increased the per capita tax burden by Rs.10,000 compared to 2017, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
Joining in the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament on Saturday, the MP pointed out the indirect to direct tax ratio in the Budget for the next year as 82:18.
This is contrary to the Governments repeated pledge to bring down the indirect tax and increase the direct tax, he said.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, while admitting that the tax ratio remains unchanged, however, assured that the situation will change for the better once the new Inland Revenue Act comes into effect from April 1, 2018.
Once its provisions are implemented, we will move to achieve the target of 40:60 indirect to direct tax ratio by 2020, he clarified.
MP Herath questioned as to why it was not mentioned in the Budget, pointing out that those changes expected from the new Inland Revenue Act are relevant to the next year.
He also noted that the per capita tax burden which was Rs 67,971 in 2017, would rise to Rs.78,254 in 2018 as of the Budget predictions.
The Government has imposed a tax on every vehicle including motor cycles by way of Carbon Tax. It has proposed to increase the public service charging fees by 15 percent and hopes for Rs. 1,100 million additional income from them. Words such as Blue-Green Economy and Carbon Tax are attractive, but, ultimately the ordinary people will have to bear the entire burden of our economy, he commented.
Another 194 kms of Expressways to be constructed: Dayasiri
An extension of 194 km of Expressways would be constructed across the country within the five years to be completed by 2020, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
He made this observation in Parliament on Saturday joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposals for the fiscal year 2019. The Minister said the construction of 194 extension of Expressways was a major project. He further said that the Acts and laws have to be amended according to the country's needs. He added thatnew Acts have to be introduced to suit the future requirements and to direct the country in the right direction. MinisterJayasekara pointed out that private tuition in the country should be banned as it has caused a severe mental drain. He added that children have no peace of mind due to tuition and added that tuition masters should be absorbed as government school teachers.
Minister Jayasekara added that the education sector in the country needs a revolutionary change. There are a large number of students who drop out of school after GCE (O/L) examination, MinisterJayasekara pointed out. They go begging for jobs and this situation has to be changed by way of revolutionary reforms.
Minister Jayasekara said the budget proposals seek new investors.
He added that proposals seek public contribution for the growth of the economy.
We could build a strong economy by developing vocational training skills, Minister Jayasekara said.
We have to set up an information center at each divisional secretariat for this purpose.

Professionalism reduced to ground zero
An unprecedented happening during the proceedings of the Presidential Bond Commission inquiry on November 3 received maximum publicity. One of the senior most law officers of the State Senior Additional Solicitor General De Livera was severely admonished by the two Supreme Court Judges on the Presidential Commission for disregarding an order of the Commission and arguing that it was made with no regard to law or facts.
The front page of one newspaper had the following headlines boxed in red, black and white:
Commission denounces conduct of A S G De Livera says its deplorable.
Chairman, Justice Chitrasiri and Justice Jayawardena say that such conduct has been witnessed for the first time.
A heated argument erupts following the order by Commission on Statements given to CID by witnesses.
Prestigious judicature
In the face of the arrogant recalcitrance of the A.S.G. some of the statements and comments that the two Supreme Court Judges had been compelled to make, quoted below, clearly show the depths to which professional conduct has plummeted in Sri Lankas once prestigious judicature. One wonders whether it will go the notorious way of our legislature!
I have served thirty seven years as a judge, and I have never seen this happen after an order is made, Chairman, Justice Chitrasiri.
Admonishing A S G De Livera who continued to make statements following the order given by the Commission, Justice Jayawardena stated he had never witnessed such behaviour in his entire legal career.
Your behaviour is not fitting to a Senior Counsel. I warned you about your behaviour in the chambers as well and I have never seen such behaviour in my thirty years as your deplorable conduct.
This is not the first time you have behaved like this after the Commission made the order. Definitely, we are going to think about this behaviour.
After these admonitions, ad nauseam by two of the countrys most respected judges A S G De Livera who for months had been pompously hogging the limelight must surely be hanging down his head in shame (reminding me of the miserable Tom Dooley).
Personally, having been involved as a witness in trials such as the Coup trial, several murder cases and election petition inquiries; and having faced lengthy cross-examinations by eminent Counsel of the calibre of George Chitty, G.G. Ponnambalam Snr, Guy Wickremanayake and A.C.M. Ameer in cases presided over by highly respected judges such as Justice Sansoni, Justice T.S. Fernando and Justice H.N.G. Fernando, this episode is indeed shocking, to say the least.
The legal greats of the past with whom I was fortunate to interact in the course of my official duties particularly in the sixties when I was still in my twenties were men to whom courtesy and politeness came naturally. The respect that Counsel had for judges was exemplary. Most importantly in keeping with traditions and high professional standards, they were aware of the role they had to play to sustain the dignity and decorum of courts of law. Disobeying orders of a presiding judge and adding insult to injury by arguing can cause irreparable cracks in this noble edifice.
Lack of knowledge of court procedure
Insulting and intimidation of witnesses by counsel more with the intention of impressing clients or gaining cheap publicity are not uncommon, particularly in the lower courts.
However, to disobey a court order without compunction can arise only out of lack of knowledge of court procedure, professional arrogance, an assumed state of self-importance or wittingly or unwittingly to insult court. Under such circumstances, recalcitrance with no signs of an apology to Court forthcoming, the deplorable conduct as referred to by Justice Jayawardena stands compounded. In my humble opinion, even Counsel assisting judicial proceedings are not exempt from the law of contempt. Corrective action in some form is definitely called for to prevent a recurrence of this nature.
When most organs of the State are reeking with inefficiency and corruption, the country can be proud not only of the content of the human resource of our judicature but very importantly the disciplined and dignified manner of judicial proceedings. Unquestionably, this flows from the authority and respect that judges command.
Even at the proceedings of a lowly Mediation Board in a remote rural area the authority of the chairman is always respected, never challenged.
To contemptuously disobey an order of the Presidential Bond Commission particularly by a person expected to know and understand the gravity of such act is a complex challenge to the entire judiciary. The nation is beholden to Justices Chitrasiri and Jayawardena for their intrepidity to remind a very senior law officer of the State the rules of the game. Not to argue with the umpires and willingly walk when given out will forever remain the cardinal lessons of Cricket.

Real-life Iron Man
Talk about putting the pedal to the metal: A real-life Iron Man has just set a world record for fastest speed in a jet suit.
Richard Browning managed to whiz around a park in the English city of Reading in a jet suit he built himself. His maximum speed during the record-setting flight was 32 mph. It was the culmination of a project three years in the making. It started when Browning decided he wanted to build his own flying suit. At first, he tried gliding with wings and electric fans, before deciding it would be easier to just strap a jet engine to his body, according to Wired.com.
The current suit, called Daedalus, is a light exoskeleton attached to six gas turbines four mounted on the arms and two on the hips that have a combined thrust of 286 pounds. As you might expect, the Iron Man suit has attracted lots of attention, especially from search-and-rescue agencies, military researchers and Hollywood producers, according to Channel News Asia.
In theory, you could have first responders with this equipment easily go a couple of miles quite low to the ground and get over any obstacle you want, he told the website.
However, Browning admits the jet suit isnt for everyone yet. I dont think anybodys going to go down to Walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while, he said, according to the Mirror. Were working on some things that will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience, beyond the events and displays were doing.
Browning made the record attempt as part of Guinness World Records Day, an event held each November to honour the record-breaking agency of record.

Sagala responds to Gamini Senerath allegations

Law, Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka has responded to allegations that he has kept company with former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Senerath who is currently being investigated into misuse of public funds.
In a statement, the Minister said: This a baseless and malicious allegation. I have no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case, which involves billions of public money. I have nothing to gain by holding meeting with a person of that caliber.
"It is widely known that a small clique affiliated with the top-brass leaders of the previous government were involved in large scale bribery and corruption cases.Their corrupt practices pushed over 6.2 million people to come forward on January 08, 2015, in a bid to topple the Rajapaksa government. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who gave leadership to these progressive forces, played prominent roles in this 'silent revolution', he said.
"The government of good governance and its ministers came to power with the promise of investigating into these cases of large-scale corruption and bringing the culprits to book.I, as the Minister of Law and Order, have a special responsibility in this regard and I must state that I am committed and determined to fulfill that responsibility."
He said despite many challenges and obstacles, he had - together with the Sri Lanka Police, the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID), and the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) - endeavoured to "deliver results".
"It is in this context that a section of media, including some online publications and social media pages, have published news items indicating that former President's Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath, who is suspected to have embezzled Rs 4 billion of public money, had a secret meeting with me."
"This a baseless and malicious allegation. I have no reason to meet a suspect in a corruption case which involves billions of public money. I have nothing to gain by holding meeting with a person of that "calibre," he said.
"Therefore, I categorically deny this malicious allegation with the contempt it deserves. I am of the firm belief that a handful of bankrupt political elements with hidden agendas are behind this propaganda campaign," the Minister said.

SPA CEYLON ON AN ELEPHANTINE MISSION
Spa Ceylon has strengthened its mission to aid and promote the work of elephant conservation projects in the island by launching a new range of luxurious products under the label Ceylon Elephant Co. The brand is building upon its long history of commitment to the cause with a new pledge to donate 10% of the retail value of all Ceylon Elephant Co. product sales towards strategic conservation projects identified by the company.
As a conscious brand, Spa Ceylon believes in contributing to the island and mother nature by promoting the protection of the countrys most recognizable ambassador - the majestic Ceylon Elephant. This majestic creature is at risk - large populations of elephants across the country are rapidly losing their natural habitat to the advent of cities and livelihoods. The natural result of this human-elephant conflict tips the scale against these creatures, as the traditional forest area that they can inhabit is limited. Recognizing this Spa Ceylon has taken several initiatives over the last few years to help raise awareness about their plight and to fund conservation projects that address the situation.
Ceylon Elephant
Since setting in motion the Save The Majestic Ceylon Elephant Campaign in 2012, Spa Ceylons aim has been to safeguard the Ceylon Elephants around the island from the increasing threats prevalent in their natural habitats. In addition to raising awareness about the dilemma faced by these majestic creatures due to the human-elephant conflict, the campaign has raised funds that have been directed to carefully chosen and monitored conservation projects around the country, including towards the purchase of equipment, food, cash and vehicles donated to various conservationist projects around the island.
Orange Elephant project
Project Orange Elephant is a worthy and ground breaking cause which will benefit from the Ceylon Elephant Co. This is an initiative that was first taken in 2012 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society in the village of Radunnewa, which borders the Wasgamuwa National Park.
Radunnewa lies along an elephant corridor and suffers extensive crop losses from elephants, with the elephants in danger of falling victim to deterrant devices built to keep them at bay.
The pilot Project Orange Elephant initiative provided grafted orange plants to 10 villages that suffered the most crop damage from elephants. As elephants were averse to the pith of the green orange, they would leave this particular crop alone. Since then the farmers of Radunnewa, alongside several other villages, have successfully established orange groves that provide them with a steady source of revenue, and keep the elephants safe from human conflict as well.
Spa Ceylon will assist the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society to broaden the projects reach and success by contributing funds to sustain the project and expand its reach.
Elephant Transit Home
Another project supported by Spa Ceylon is the Udawalawe Transit Home, a facility within the Udawalawe Park established in 1955 by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. The transit home rehabilitates orphaned elephant calves before releasing them back to the wild. It perfectly captures Spa Ceylons vision for the future of these majestic animals, says Spa Ceylon founders Shiwantha Dias and Shalin Balasuriya in a press release.
Our funding is directed towards supporting elephants in the wild. We believe that these animals belong in the wild, not chained up to service human needs. We have been so moved by the transit homes work in rehabilitating baby elephants that have lost their parents to the human-elephant conflict, in order to release them back to the wild. Spa Ceylons support to the Transit Home includes purchase of equipment for use by Wildlife rangers, such as tractors for carrying food. The company has also adopted baby elephants by providing financial support for their care until they are old enough to be returned to the wild.
Ceylon Elephant Co. Range
In introducing the campaign, Spa Ceylon created a decadent range of Ceylon Elephant Co. themed bath, body and home aroma products. They are perfumed with fresh and invigorating blends of fragrant essential oils inspired by the natural habitat of these majestic creatures.
The aromatic blends are enriched with essential oils of Pink Grapefruit, Sandalwood, Kaffir Lime, Frankincense, Lemongrass, Eucalyptus and Patchouli. The formula also includes powerful Ayurveda actives, virgin coconut oils and natural fruit butters to soothe the body and uplift the soul.
The Ceylon Elephant Co. range consists of nearly 37 products including Home Fragrance Oil Blends, Elephant Shaped Cleansing Bars, Luxury Candles, Home Aroma Diffusers, Aroma Incense, Aroma Car Fresheners, Room Aroma Sachets and a collection of luxury gift sets with these formulae.
These products are available in the trademark Spa Ceylon packaging, which utilizes vibrant colours coupled with unique Ceylonese palace art motifs - depicting the magnificent mammoth form of the Ceylon Elephant.

Sri Lanka use 14 bowlers in drawn warm-up game
KOLKATA, Sunday: Sanju Samson struck a century as Sri Lankas two-day warm-up game against Indian Board Presidents XI ended in a draw. All the 14 players, barring wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella, rolled their arms over in the 75 overs of the hosts innings at the Jadhavpur University Ground in Kolkata.
Sri Lanka declared their innings on their overnight score of 411. With the ball, however, they made an interesting start with Dimuth Karunaratne and Lahiru Thirimanne opening the attack. And surprisingly, the latter proved quite effective in his morning spell. With his medium pacers, he picked up the wickets of Tanmay Agarwal and Akash Bhandari early to leave the hosts reeling at 31 for 2.
However, once Jiwanjot Singh, who got off to a steady start, got the company of skipper Samson, the Indian sides innings found some stability. While Jiwanjot was cautious with his batting, Samson was more extravagant in his strokeplay.
Even when the Punjab opener was dismissed, caught behind off Dilruwan Perera, Samson continued his flourish in the company of Rohan Prem and B Sandeep. However, no one apart from Samson managed to make good of the starts they got.
Samsons innings included 19 boundaries and a six, before he was caught behind off Sadeera Samarawickrama on 128.
Lakshan Sandakan was the only bowler to bowl more than 10 overs (12), but he returned wicket-less. So was the case with Rangana Herath, who couldnt bag a scalp in his five overs. It was instead the part-timers, who managed getting quite a few breakthroughs. After Thirimanne bagged a couple, back-up wicketkeeper Samarawickrama took one, while among the regulars Dananjaya De Silva and Dilruwan bagged one each. Indian Board Presidents XI managed to post 287 for 5 before the match was called off. B Sandeep and Jalaj Saxena were unbeaten after having spent over an hour at the crease.
Sri Lanka commences a three-match Test series against India at Kolkata on November 16.

Tax revenue doubled
The State Tax Revenue has doubled within three years from 2014, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister, opening the Second Reading debate of Budget 2018 on the second allotted day in Parliament on Saturday, pointed out that reversing the years of downward trend in tax revenue was a significant achievement of the Government.
In 2014, the total State Tax Revenue stood at Rs.1,050 billion. The estimated state revenue for 2018 is Rs 2,034 billion. The gradual drop in state revenue had been a worrying factor of our economy for many years. The Finance Ministry, the President and the Prime Minister must be congratulated for reversing it, Minister Ranawaka said. He pointed out that Sri Lanka, after many decades, has been able to show a positive primary budget balance indicating that the country can manage its expenditure from the income it earns when the debt repayment has been excluded.
Our economy has been balanced now. The loans we obtained are to repay the excessive debts obtained during the last regime. Out of the total estimated expenditure of Rs.4,079 billion for next year, Rs. 1,970 billion is for debt servicing, he explained.
As the peak of debt repayments comes in 2018-2020, the Minister observed, the Government will have a hard time balancing the economy and preparing for crucial national elections at the same time.
The debt burden will ease by 2022-2023. This Government is saddled with the most difficult period, the country has ever been in, on the fiscal front, he noted.
The Minister, commending the budget proposal to bring down the prices of electric cars, however, pointed out charging them during the peak hours must be discouraged.
If people start charging them between 6.30 p.m. to 9 p.m., the peak-demand will go up, burdening the CEB more. Charging of electric vehicles must be done only after 9.30 p.m., he suggested.
Minister Ranawaka also lauded the tax on polythene as a progressive move, while proposing to use the additional revenue of Rs. 2 billion expected from it for solid waste management projects.

Three arrested in people smuggling racket
Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) officers arrested three people including a monk, who were trying to send women to Dubai illegally, to work as domestic aides, under the pretext of promoting Buddhism.

The seized passports.
Upon questioning, the women had said that they were going to Dubai for domestic work and that a monk was taking them there. "However, the women were not in possession of valid documents to embark on foreign employment,a SLBFE spokesman said.
When the monk was questioned, he had said that the women were going to Dubai to promote Buddhism to participate in several religious programmes.
He said the women were planning to visit Nepal on a pilgrimage after visiting Dubai. The officials later had arrested the monk and two others involved in the racket. During questioning, the suspects had revealed they had taken groups of women to work in Dubai on four previous occasions using the same modus operandi.
The suspects had revealed the women were taken abroad illegally as they all had children under the age of five, a disqualification to work overseas as domestic aides according to SLBFE laws. The suspect monk had paid Rs.5,000 for each woman and Rs.10,000 for each of the two suspects who assisted him.
He had also promised to pay Rs.75,000 to the relatives of the women two weeks after they departed for employment. The women had been promised a monthly salary of Rs. 40,000.
SLBFE officials plan to arrest two more suspects involved in the racket.
Meanwhile, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said the laws would be strictly enforced against the suspects irrespective of their status.

Trump offers to mediate on South China Sea dispute
VIETNAM: US President Donald Trump told his Vietnamese counterpart Sunday he is ready to help resolve the dispute in the resource-rich South China Sea, which Beijing claims most of.
If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know... I am a very good mediator, the dealmaking American leader told Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang during an official state visit Sunday.
Vietnam has long courted support from Washington in its dispute with China over the precious waterway, where Beijing has built military installations and artificial islands.
Beijings sweeping claims also overlap with those of the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
Trumps comments come ahead of a state visit on Sunday afternoon by Chinese President Xi Jinping who will meet with top communist leaders.
Tensions over the sea spiked earlier this year when Vietnam suspended an oil exploration project in an area of the waterway also claimed by Beijing, reportedly over pressure from its powerhouse communist neighbour.
In 2014, China moved an oil rig into waters off Vietnams coast, sparking violent protests in several Vietnamese cities.
Trump is in Hanoi for a brisk visit that could touch on boosting military support for Americas former wartime foe. Talks will also focus on promoting trade between the cosy allies, though Vietnams gaping trade surplus with the United States, worth $32 billion in 2016, could be a sticking point.
Trump heads to Manila later Sunday for the final stop on his marathon Asia tour that has mainly focused on building regional consensus against North Koreas nuclear ambitions and espousing his America First vision of global trade. - AFP

Two-time cancer survivor returns to hospital as a nurse
Cancer is a bitch, everyone knows that. 24 year old Montana Brown knows it, having been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer of the connective tissue not once, but twice as a child.
The first shock came when she was just 2 years old. Her parents took her to AFLAC Cancer Center in Atlanta, Georgia, where after a year of chemotherapy she was thankfully in remission. She went on to have a normal and happy childhood until the next seismic event  the cancer returned when she was 15.
She went back again to AFLAC for more chemotherapy, and again came out on top. It was these difficult battles that she fought and survived that inspired her to become a nurse.
The nurses here were extremely loving and caring and compassionate.
The love they showed me and my family in our time of need just really helped me, she told ABC news. It helped me want to become as kind and as caring and as compassionate as they were for me.
Now the shoe is on the other foot, and it is Montana that is working as a nurse. She believes that her difficult personal experiences with cancer can help her create a special empathetic bond with children battling cancer, becoming a source of hope and inspiration for them.
I really wanted to be that person that can say hey, I totally understand. This is where I was. This is where I am now.
As well as her empathy, expertise and experience Montana brings with her a ton of enthusiasm to her new job.
Never in a million years did I think that at the age of 24 I would have achieved my biggest and wildest dream  to work at the hospital I was treated at as a child/teenager, she writes on a Facebook post.
Its amazing and crazy and awesome and Im SO excited to work for such an inspirational organization!

UNCTAD assures support
United National Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary General Dr. Mikhisa Kituyi has assured Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha that the UNCTAD stands ready to assist Sri Lankas Science, Technology and Innovation Policy Review (STIP) and to explore modalities of technical assistance and a strategy for mobilizing the funding required.
The assurance was given by the UNCTAD SG following consultations Minister Premajayantha had in Geneva last week with Senior Officials of the UNCTAD.
During his meetings, the Minister noted that consistent with the SDGs set by the UN, Sri Lanka was working with the relevant ministries, institutions, private sector and civil societies to achieve targets set by 2030.
He emphasised the need to explore avenues to strengthen relations between UNCTAD and the Government of Sri Lanka to promote Science, Technology and Innovation for SDG achievement and to assess a policy review on Science, Technology and Innovation in Sri Lanka.
Presenting Innovating Sri Lanka, the three-year action plan on Science, Technology and Innovation in Sri Lanka, the Minister introduced the emerging technologies that Sri Lanka is working on and has succeeded such as Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Genomics, Immunotherapy, Enzyme Manufacturing, Biopharma, Robotics, Mechatronics, Artificial Intelligence and Space Technology.
He shared Sri Lankas best practices, in particular the success story of the Nanotechnology Laboratory (SLINTEC), which was initially capitalised by the Government funds, but where the private sector is successfully running its operations. The Minister said Sri Lanka was planning to follow similar approaches for other technologies as well. The Minister said the private sector in Sri Lanka is closely working with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research.
The Minister invited the UNCTAD Secretary General and officials to participate in the Science and Technology for Society Forum scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka in September 2018.
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha detailed the Programmes of Action with a bearing on the 2030 Development that Sri Lanka had entered into with the WIPO, CERN, UNITAR, IOM and were being negotiated with the ITU and WMO.
It was proposed that Sri Lanka embark on a similar initiative with the UNCTAD in the Science, Technology and Innovation, that could compliment the current POAs.
UNCTAD Technology and Logistics Division Director Shamika Sirimanne said her organization was encouraged by the science and technological advancements taking place in Sri Lanka and saw many of them as suitable to adopt as best practices in other developing countries.
Given that at present UNCTADs main focus is on SDGs, it was agreed to make an assessment on how these could be linked with the SDGs. She informed that the UNCTAD will prioritise the areas that they could support and also share experiences from elsewhere with Sri Lanka. Sirimanne said she was encouraged by Sri Lankas experience in leveraging the support of Geneva based UN and other organization, and looked forward to collaborating in continuing the discussion relating to the SDGs and Science, Technology and Innovation.
Dong Wu, Chief of Policy Review Section, Science, Technology and ICT Branch of UNCTAD, Angel Gonzalez, and the Ambassador and officials from the Permanent Mission in Geneva attended.

Vehicle Importers Assn. hails Budget
The vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIAL) highlighted the taxes imposed by government on motor vehicles and said apart from few differences, the 2018 Budget has generally paved the way for all interested parties to purchase motor vehicles, especially vehicles with less than 1000cc engine capacity.
While hailing the Budget proposals on motor vehicles, President Indika Sampath Merenchige, at a post-Budget media briefing requested authorities to provide necessary assistance to people who are interested in purchasing used vehicles imported from Japan.
He also said it was commendable that the government extended an assurance that the taxes already imposed on motor vehicles will not be changed under any circumstances, especially for a period of three years.
Such a situation immensely benefits all stakeholders involved in the motor vehicle business industry including leasing companies and banks that are providing vehicle loans and also members of the general public who are interested in purchasing vehicles.
During the media briefing, it was revealed that the taxes of Sri Lankas most popular vehicles such as Aqua, Axio and Honda Vezel will be increased by Rs. 750,000.
Meanwhile, due to new Budget proposals 1300cc - 1500cc vehicles will go up by Rs. 730,800, Toyota Premio by Rs. 118,600, Prado by 51, 20,000 and Land Cruiser by Rs 2.9 million.
According to Budget proposals, the prices of certain motor vehicle such as 990cc, 1290cc and the Toyota Passo will be reduced to a certain extent.
In addition, the VIAL is also of the view that the taxes of many other varieties of vehicles will go up so as to make them too expensive for vehicle buyers in the future. He said as the Nissan Leaf has become very popular in the country and the authorities should focus more attention towards importing such motor vehicles in the coming years.
Merenchige also focussed attention towards imposing Rs. 5 to Rs 20 vehicle registration tax on certain vehicles and said authorities should reconsider reducing such taxes considering the peoples economic situations.
The Budget proposal to ban the import of vehicles that do not have airbags, anti-locking breaking system (ABS) and three-point seat belts is a move in the right direction, said VIAL Secretary Keerthi Gunawardana.
However, he scoffed at the argument that the Budget proposal will see the reduction of prices of brand new electric cars.
Gunawardana said Japanese manufacturers do not permit the export of brand new electric vehicles to agents in Sri Lanka due to the non-availability of infrastructure mechanism to maintain electric vehicles in Sri Lanka yet.
He questioned as to how, under such a scenario, the prices of electric vehicles could be reduced as envisaged in the Budget.
VIAL also hailed the measures taken to improve the quality of vehicles imported to the country such as putting mandatory requirements on airbags, the anti-locking breaking system and imposing Euro 4 (European emission standards) or equal standards on vehicles imported to the country.
However, the VIAL said that there would not be any significant benefits for customers from the tax reductions proposed in the Budget. There would not be much in terms of price reductions as had been expected by the people prior to the Budget, he added.

According to reports in the Telegraph, all breeding attempts between Sudan, the 44-year-old rhino and the surviving females in a conservatory in Kenya have been unsuccessful.
Scientists are trying to develop IVF techniques that might keep their species alive.

Winding down The roads of the wilderness
In a place as naturally lush and dense with wildlife as Sri Lanka, it only makes sense that tourism emphasizing the outdoors would be on the rise. And indeed it is, with new eco-tourism outfits popping up regularly, encouraging both locals and foreign travellers to spend their time in Sri Lanka outside.
An increasingly popular way to do this is to take advantage of the safaris offered all around the country in national parks such as Yala, Udawalawe, Wasgamuwa, and Wilpattu. These safaris offer patrons the opportunity to traverse the parks by Jeeps and get up close and personal with an array of animals in their natural habitats.
One organization leading the way forward in this field is EcoTeam Sri Lanka, which has been around since 1998 and bills itself as a one-stop shop for adventure activities and camping in all national parks and nature reserves in Sri Lanka. One of their main ventures is the Mahoora Tented Safari Camps, which aim to mesh the thrill and nature-immersive experience of camping and a safari with some of the luxuries afforded by a hotel. Last week, a group of reporters got a chance to check out Mahooras recently renovate Tented Safari Camp in Wilpattu National Park.
The authentic feeling
Wilpattu National Park is Sri Lankas biggestover 130,000 hectareswhich means its also the least crowded. According to Channa Jayasundara, a consultant for new projects and development for EcoTeam, this makes it the perfect place for a safari.
Our group left Colombo early on a Thursday morning, and around four hours later we pulled up to the entrance of Wilpattu. Since buses arent allowed inside, there was a group from Mahoora there to transport us in two Jeepsgiving us our first taste of the experience of the safari to come. From there, it was a short ride to our campground located on the edge of the nature reserve, a mere ten minute drive from the entrance to the national park.
Upon arrival, we were greeted initially by members of the Mahoora staff in a welcome tent, who served us a welcome drink of fresh coconut water, and next by the first sign of wildlife we would see on our trip: the Sri Lankan jungle fowl. Endemic to the country, the colorful jungle fowl peppered the campgrounds, adding to the authentic feeling of the experience.
Rain had started to come down hard at this pointa karmic effort, it seemed, to make the camping conditions as unsuitable as possible. And yet it put little damper on the tour. We were provided with umbrellas that behaved in an almost fortified manner, just like the tents we were next directed to, behaved themselves.
Stepping inside the tent, one would not be blamed if she forgotfor a secondthat she was technically outdoors. While the tents lack many amenities currently expected from higher-end hotels, such as air conditioning, internet access, and hot water, the rooms themselves would fit right in at any five-star hotel, with plush beds, couches, a full bathroom, and tasteful decor containing much elephant iconography. One piece of advice, however: if you cant sleep through the sound of rain, you might have a problem.
natural setting
After dropping our belongings inside our tents, we had a hearty lunch of rice and curry, some of the best Ive tasted in Sri Lanka yet, before heading out on the highlight of our tour: the safari through Wilpattu.
Jeeps need to be out of Wilpattu by 6 pm, so according to Jayasundara, most safari tours begin at either 5.30 am or 2.30 pm. Given our afternoon arrival to the campground, our tour began at the latter time, give or take an hour or so. We were warned beforehand that the likelihood of seeing the two specific animals which draw most people to Wilpattuthe Sri Lankan leopard and elephantwas low, given the rain which had still not stopped coming down. And much to our chagrin, we didnt see either of them.
Yet the safari was hardly bereft of wildlife to observe. As our Jeep winded its way through the parks rocky dirt roads, accompanied by a trained naturalist from the area, wildlife surrounded us at every turn, at which point wed stop the vehicle and observe.
Over the course of the next few hours, we saw evermore jungle fowl, barking deer, sambar deer, spotted deer (there were a lot of deer), peacocks with soaking wet feathers, freshwater crocodiles, eagles, tortoises, snakes, and even one mother sloth bear protecting her cub. But even as our safari tour came to an end at the 6:00PM park-exit deadline, our opportunity to immerse ourselves in the natural setting surrounding us had only just begun.
knowledgeable and charismatic
As with all meals at Mahoora, dinner was served under an open-air dining tent. Lit by a campfire and torches along the camps many winding paths, the meal was far more indulgent than one would expect to eat when going camping. Served in multiple courses, the meal consisted of soup, garlic bread roasted vegetables, barbecued chicken and pork, some flan-type dessert, and fresh fruit.
As Jayasundara explained, the skilled chefs at Mahoora can accommodate any dietary restriction, and have previously cooked for guests who are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free, among others. Most of the meals ingredients are sourced from the locality in which the park is based, which means that in a way, eating with Mahoora is a means of invigorating the local economy.
Then it was time for our night walk. Venturing into the backwoods of Mahooras campgrounds, we were directed by flashlight around the area for thirty minutes or so, led by two EcoTeam naturalists who were both knowledgeable and charismatic. On the hunt for nocturnal creatures, we spotted birds, bugs, and even a snake, which we were less than thrilled to realize had been crawling on a branch above our heads.
Sleeping in the tents at night, one is keenly aware of the fact that she is in nature. The sounds of rain falling and birds chirping are far from quiet. But as Jayasundara says, this is all part of the experience.
Campingeven at its most luxuriousis not for everyone. There will always be people who complain without hot water, insist on air conditioning, need to sleep in silence, and fear the occasional bug crawling up their leg. But with its newest Mahoora Tented Safari Camp in Wilpattu, EcoTeam has made a tremendous effort, and a successful one at that, in ensuring that the safari concept is an accessible one which allows everybody a chance to experience a wilderness setting.
Even in the pouring rain, and even without seeing the elephants and wild leopards, the experience in Wilpattu is one I would repeat in a heartbeat and one I will not soon forget.
