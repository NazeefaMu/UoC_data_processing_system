FFSL to conduct inquiry into Sri Lankas poor display in Malaysia
An inquiry will be held into the poor display of the Sri Lanka Soccer team at the Asian Solidarity Soccer Tournament which is being held in Malaysia and on the steps to be taken to develop football in Sri Lanka at a meeting of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka.
All committee members of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka will attend this meeting at which decisions will be taken regarding on how to improve the standard of the Sri Lankas Soccer team in view of the forthcoming Asian Football Tournament according to the Media Director and Finance Committee Chairman of FFSL Ranjith Rodrigo.
In addition, reports will be called from the Manager and the captain of the Sri Lanka Soccer team and vice presidents of the FFSL Brigadier Dhammika Kariyawasam and Robert Peiris. The Football Federation of Sri Lanka is disappointed at the way the Sri Lankan Soccer team played in this tournament and are determined to build a strong team for the Asian Football Tournament in 2017.
However the coach of the Sri Lanka team Dudley Steinwall said that the Lankan soccer standard has improved slightly. He also said that the reason for Lankas poor display was that they lacked international exposure as they did not play sufficient international matches before this tournament. He also hoped at least two matches per month will be played by the national soccer team in the future.
He also said that we have to change our tactics to attacking and defence whereas earlier we were more concerned in defending our goal. He said that he was happy with the teams performance in the last game against Macau. AFP

Norwegian grandmaster adds sex appeal to chess
OSLO: Norwegian world chess champion Magnus Carlsen is hoping to prove that smart is the new sexy, as he prepares to defend his title against Russias Sergei Karyakin.
Interest in chess in the Nordic country has skyrocketed since the photogenic 25-year-old international grandmaster took the games global throne in 2013.
International chess master Atle Gronn described enthusiasm among Norwegians for the game as completely crazy.
Chess is associated with intelligence, or a narrower activity. Thanks to Magnus Carlsen, it has gained a popular image as well, Gronn told AFP.
He has a style that appeals very broadly, which also girls and women in the population find interesting, he added.
Carlsen faces Karyakin in New York from November 11-30, in a 600,000-euro ($660,000) match some are hyping as a clash between East and West that echoes the Cold War.
Cold War parallels
The showdown has drawn parallels with the 1972 world championship match between American grandmaster Bobby Fischer and Soviet star Boris Spassky as it comes during another surge in tensions: this time over Ukraine and Syria.
Carlsen has his homeland right behind him as the world championship will be broadcast primetime on Norwegian national television, while numerous books have been published on him and on the game.
A Norwegian documentary about Carlsen will also be released in New York movie theatres on November 18, as the competition heats up.
But he wasnt always so popular: Carlsen has told of how he was bullied by other students in the ninth grade at school.
I am in one sense an outcast because I am very different from the rest of the class, he said at the time. It is difficult to be cool when I play chess.
Child prodigy
Introduced to chess by his father, Carlsen showed off his photographic memory as a toddler.
At the age of two, the self-taught prodigy knew by heart all the car brands and later memorised the long list of all Norways municipalities, with their flags and administrative centres.
He played in his first tournament at the age of eight and burst onto the chess scene in 2004, at the age of 13, when The Mozart of Chess was born, according to the Washington Post at the time.
That was the year Carlsen first defeated former world champion Anatoli Karpov, and pushed legendary chess champion Garry Kasparov to a draw in March. He became a grandmaster the following month.
Kasparov described Carlsen as a Harry Potter-type super talent long before the Norwegian superstar became the first Westerner to hold the world title since Americas Fischer in 1975.
Carlsen quickly became a ruffled-looking regular of the chess circuit, his shirt untucked and at times yawning and stretching during games, while reading Donald Duck to relax between playing sessions.
He also won the Chess Oscars, awarded by Russian chess magazine 64 to the worlds best player, for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012.
A fashion model in his spare time, Carlsen made it to the Time magazine list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.
Bigger than football
In 2013, Carlsens long-held dream came true when he dethroned his Indian rival Viswanathan Anand as world champion.
During the chess world championship that year, there were more internet searches about the game than for football, according to the Norwegian chess federation, while Norwegian media reported that Oslo shops had sold out of chessboards.
Since Carlsen took the throne in 2013, the federation reported a 36 percent jump in the number of members.
Kristoffer Gressli, head of marketing and communications at the federation, called it the Magnus effect.
The entire Norwegian population in three years has gone from being chess novices to knowing all the chess rules, Gressli told AFP.
When Carlsen defended the title against Anand in a reprise game in 2014, some 2.76 million people in Norway -- population five million -- tuned in to watch on public broadcaster NRK, giving it higher ratings than cyclings Tour de France.
The federation now aims to offer a free introduction to chess to all schools in the country.
But shaping a future generation of talent is one thing and giving birth to a new superstar is a more complex move.
I dont think that Norway will have a new Magnus Carlsen, Geir Nesheim, the general secretary of the federation, told AFP. He is so special. AFP

Pushpa left us when needed most
Gampaha District Cricket Umpires Association Vice President (veteran umpire) and retired English lecturer attached to Colombo University (Extension English Course for Under-graduates) Pushpa Gunatilaka passed away on October 30 (Sunday).
The 64 year old Pushpa was a distinguished old boy of Thurstan College, Colombo, and joined English Teaching Profession in early seventies from Polonnaruwa District, until he was selected to the Mirigama English Teachers College in late seventies. I first met him there when I too joined the same teachers college, where we played and discussed on cricket as young teacher trainees because our first love was cricket the gentlemens game.
After leaving teachers college, he was fortunate to get a school in the city of Gampaha Gothami Vidyalaya, later he joined Galahitiyawa Central and became the MIC of cricket and developed school cricket there. A few years back he joined Bandaranaike College, Gampaha and became MIC of cricket. With the help of the principal he was able to get Raja Athukorale the renowned cricket coach to help the young cricketers there. Not only that he brought the college band to the top as MIC.
Pushpa had many good qualities, one of the noblest being his willingness to help less fortunate but skilful, irrespective of their caste, creed and race. He completed nearly four successful decades as an English teacher. He retired as the Head of English Support Centre, Gampaha where he helped young English teachers on the subject of English Teaching profession but he continued his university lecturing until his death.
After becoming a qualified umpire and cricket coach, he wanted to help cricket playing schools in Gampaha District. The poor schools could not bear the umpires fee then, because they had to pay considerable amount to the Colombo Branch umpires including travelling. So he with some of the veteran umpires of the Gampaha District like D S Dissanayake, Pushparaja, Rodrigo joined hands to develop the separate cricket umpires branch to do matches without travelling fee (only the umpires fee was paid) (2016) until recently the travelling fee was added. Pushpa did a tireless job holding several posts (he was the General Secretary until 2015) to improve the Gampaha Branch.
Many give up studies after getting a job, but Pushpa followed the Advanced English Diploma at the National Institute of Education, Maharagama and passed out with flying colours and selected to another English professional course in the UK where he met great professors.
He led a very simple life. Nobody knows that he was such a unique person. He was so humble and his motto was Perseverance and patience will help you to steer your ship in the stormy sea of life. he spent most of time on organising cricket clubs (Ganemulla Sports Club one of them) and school cricket in Gampaha. I heard one of the principals saying during his funeral oration. You could see him after school at the cricket field practising cricket with young cricketers. He was fortunate to have an understanding wife who helped him devotedly.
Dear Pushpa, though you are no more you will always be in our hearts as a loving and caring brother and wonderful human being. Thank you very much for all your valuable advice.
May you attain Nirvana!

Kandy out to maintain their supremacy
The Kandy Sports Club was founded in 1874 by a group of expatriate coffee planters and others working in the plantation sector in and around Kandy. In 1888, the club also started playing rugby, hockey and polo. The home ground was Bogambara grounds until 1939 when the British Colonial Army took over during the Second World War. Later the buildings were taken over by the General Hospital to house its offices; however Kandy SC continued to play rugby at the Bogambara grounds without a club house. In 1949 the Municipal Council released the garbage dumping ground area at Nittawela to the club.
From 1997 to 2009 Kandy SC had won all the Presidents trophy knockout tournaments with the exception of the 1998 tourney, where it lost 26-30 in the final to CR&FC. They have also dominated the Clifford Cup tournament, winning 17 titles in the last 20 years, which is the most number of wins by any club since the expanded competition commenced in 1950. In the period between 1995 and 2012 the club did not lose a single Clifford Cup title, although in 1998 there was no tournament and in 2006 the club withdrew from the tournament. Kandy SC had won the league title for a record nine consecutive years between 2000 and 2009.
On March 10, 2010 the rugby team of the Kandy SC left for a 15-day tour of Dubai and South Africa. The club played one match in Dubai and two in South Africa. This was the first time Kandy SC toured two different countries on one tour.
Kandy SC who were one time the kings of local rugby lived up to their expectations last season by winning all three major cups (League, Clifford Cup and Sevens) which were on offer and this season they are working hard towards retaining their position at the top.
They are in search of their past glory and in the upcoming 2016/17 season they will have some of the best players in the country led by that fantastic scrum half ex-Kingswood and Sri Lanka vice-captain in Roshan Weeraratne.
This season they are under the watchful eyes of their head coach, former Trinity, Kandy and Sri Lanka skipper Sean Wijesinghe, ably assisted by former Kandy and Sri Lanka player Nalaka Weerakkody and Saliya Kumara. The manager of the side is former Isipathana, CR and FC and Kandy SC player Kapila Silva.
Kandy SC must be really happy with the squad of players that they have got for this season having a blend of youth and experience that they only have to motivate them and do a bit of fine tuning for the guys to deliver the result. The real concern is that every club in Sri Lanka wants to beat them; no matter it can be even Air Force or CH and FC, because at present they are the reigning champions. Due to this when Kandy is playing a game they are under tremendous pressure, since they are carrying the legacy of the whole Kandy crowd and their expectations are high, so Kandy SC has to somehow deliver the goods by winning all the games for their fans.
There are many new faces turning out for them this season out of which some of the well known national players are centre Danushka Ranjan, third row forwards Jason Dissanayake and prop forward Ganuka Disssanayake who are all out to give a good display of rugby for their new club in the upcoming season.
The Kandy squad:
Roshan Weeraratne (captain), Fazil Marija, Gayan Weeraratne, Kishore Jehan, Gayan Jayawardane, Asitha Ratnayake, Damitha Dissanayake, Lavanga Perera, Oshan Perera, Dansha Dayan, Anuruddha Wilwara, Pumal Manchanayake, Uchitha Jayasooriya, Lasitha Maduranga, Thilina Wijesinghe, Tharindu Chanaka, Richard Dharmapala, Heshan Kalhara, Gayan Ratnayake, Arshad Jamaldeen, Yakoob Ali, Nigel Ratwatte, Buwanaka Udangamuwa, Dimithri Wijetunga, Chanaka Bandara, Shehan Lema Pathirana, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Soyuru Anthony, Danushka Ranjan, Jason Dissanayake , Ganuka Disssanayake, Raveen de Silva, and Fazrul Rahuman.

SOSL PAYS TRIBUTE TO PANDIT AMARADEVA
The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka dedicated its  Russian Masterworks concert, held on November 5 to Pandit W.D. Amaradeva who passed away at the age of 88 two days prior to the concert. 
The Chairperson of the SOSL, Mrs Sharmini Wettimuny opened the concert with a dedication to the revered musician saying  The SOSL notes with great sadness the recent demise of Pandit W.D. Amaradeva. The Orchestra has had the privilege of having him perform as a vocal and violin soloist with the orchestra some years ago. More recently, at the SOSLs Christmas concert last year, he added lustre to the event by attending it as its Chief Guest. Pandit Amaradevas creative works represent the peak of achievement in the evolution of Sri Lankan music. We dedicate our concert of Russian Masterworks to the memory of this great musician. 
A minute of silence marked the respect of all gathered for this Sri Lankan icon. 
The Russian Masterworks concert proved a gem of a treat for classical music afficionados. In particular the guest pianist Maxim Puryzhinskiys performance of Rachmaninoffs Piano Concerto no 2 in C minor was just spectacular. The SOSLs much- prized grand piano sang from deep within its depths as the soloists fingers rippled over the keyboards  many commented that they have never heard such a deep rich sound from this very instrument. A testament to Puryzhinskiys power and technique. The pianist also displayed typical Russian passion and emotion as he played, ending up rosy cheeked and disheveled at the end of the magnificent turn and earning a standing ovation from our usually reticent Colombo audience. 
The Orchestra backed Maxim admirably, conducted by their own Dushyanthi Perera, who stood in at the very last minute as the guest conductor, Ksenia Zharko of Moscow, fell ill the previous night and could not perform. Dushyanthi showed her versatility and talent in stepping in at short notice and ably directing the Orchestra who played with power and depth and complemented the talent of the soloist with their own effort and dedication. 
For the second half of the performance Maxim, himself a graduate of Moscow State Conservatory music college, stepped in as guest conductor and took the Orchestra through a charming rendition of short set pieces from Tchaikovskys Nutcracker Suite, followed by the poignant Adagio from Khachaturians Spartacus ballet and closing with the short but energetic Sabre Dance from the ballet Gayane by the same composer. 
The SOSL has gone from strength to strength in recent years, playing a challenging variety of classical music and also moving into the much appreciated annual SOSL  POPS concerts. Exposure to artistes such as Maxim and Ksenia (who has guest- conducted the SOSL previously) has no doubt inspired our local classical musicians to reach for ever-improving heights, and certainly provides us, their audience, with performances to remember. To quote the Sponsor & Chief Guest, Mohan Tissanayagam, on this occasion, our  sincere thanks to the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, and the piano soloist Maxim Puryzhinskiy for giving us this opportunity to experience and enjoy that which cannot be expressed with words!

Stokes, Ali star as England post commanding total
RAJKOT: Century-makers Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali piled on the agony for India's bowlers Thursday as England posted the highest score by a visiting team in nearly five years on the second day of the first Test.
Stokes smashed 128 runs after Ali, who had been unbeaten on 99 overnight, made 117 as England compiled a commanding total of 537 before India's openers responded with an unbeaten stand of 63 in the final session.
Joe Root (124) had notched up a century on the opening day to lay a solid foundation for the middle-order batsmen at Rajkot's Saurashtra Cricket Association ground.
India made a cautious start to their innings with Murali Vijay (25 not out) and Gautam Gambhir (28 not out) at the crease when stumps were called.
The day belonged to England's batsmen who made India toil on an easy-paced track after captain Alastair Cook had elected to bat first.
Although the tourists lost a succession of tailenders in the period immediately after lunch, Stokes stayed put to help England post their third highest total on Indian soil.
Stokes, who had three ducks in three previous Test innings against India, hit 13 fours and two sixes on way to his fourth ton in the longest format of the game. India's bowlers struggled in the heat and grime, with top-ranked spinner Ravichandran Ashwin conceding 167 runs while taking just two wickets.
England showed their aggressive intent in the morning session, hammering 139 runs while losing two wickets including that of Ali who was bowled by Mohammed Shami (2-65).
Jonny Bairstow, the highest Test run-scorer this year, made 46 and shared a brisk 99-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Stokes before also falling to Shami.
At least five dropped catches and some sloppy fielding underlined a miserable day for the Indians before their home fans. Top-ranked India have won 12 and drawn one of their last 13 Tests at home since England sealed a historic 2-1 victory in Kolkata in 2012.
Stokes was dropped twice in his sixties by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha with Umesh Yadav (2-112) being the unlucky bowler on both occasions. The Indians took the new ball in the morning after England resumed at 311 for 4, but failed to get an immediate breakthrough.
Ali reached his century off the third ball of the day from Shami who seemed to have recovered from the cramps he suffered on the opening day.
The spinning all-rounder singled out Yadav for special punishment, taking three fours in four balls off the paceman. Stokes chipped in before Shami broke their 62-run stand with the wicket of Ali who saw his off-stump cartwheel away in spectacular fashion after misjudging the line and not playing a shot.
England's total was the highest by a visiting team in India since the West Indies made 590 at Mumbai in November 2011. The previous instance when three batsmen from a visiting team scored centuries in the same innings in India was in 2008-09 when Sri Lanka toured the country. AFP

Leonard Cohen Dead at 82

Leonard Cohen, the hugely influential singer and songwriter whose work spanned five decades, died at the age of 82. 
Cohen's label, Sony Music Canada, confirmed his death on the singer's Facebook page.
"It is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away," the statement read. "We have lost one of music's most revered and prolific visionaries. A memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief." 
A cause of death and exact date of death was not given.
After an epic tour, the singer fell into poor health. But he dug deep and came up with a powerful new album
"Unmatched in his creativity, insight and crippling candor, Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed," his manager Robert Kory wrote in a statement. "I was blessed to call him a friend, and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand, was a privilege and great gift. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come."
Cohen was the dark eminence among a small pantheon of extremely influential singer-songwriters to emerge in the Sixties and early Seventies. Only Bob Dylan exerted a more profound influence upon his generation, and perhaps only Paul Simon and fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell equaled him as a song poet.
Cohen's haunting bass voice, nylon-stringed guitar patterns and Greek-chorus backing vocals shaped evocative songs that dealt with love and hate, sex and spirituality, war and peace, ecstasy and depression. He was also the rare artist of his generation to enjoy artistic success into his Eighties, releasing his final album, You Want It Darker, earlier this year.
"I never had the sense that there was an end," he said in 1992. "That there was a retirement or that there was a jackpot."
Leonard Norman Cohen was born on September 21st, 1934, in Westmount, Quebec. 
He learned guitar as a teenager and formed a folk group called the Buckskin Boys. Early exposure to Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca turned him toward poetry  while a flamenco guitar teacher convinced him to trade steel strings for nylon. 
After graduating from McGill University, Cohen moved to the Greek island of Hydra, where he purchased a house for $1,500 with the help of a modest trust fund established by his father, who died when Leonard was nine. 
While living on Hydra, Cohen published the poetry collection Flowers for Hitler (1964) and the novels The Favourite Game (1963) and Beautiful Losers (1966).
Frustrated by poor book sales, and tired of working in Montreal's garment industry, Cohen visited New York in 1966 to investigate the city's robust folk-rock scene. He met folk singer Judy Collins, who later that year included two of his songs, including the early hit "Suzanne," on her album In My Life. 
His New York milieu included Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground, and, most importantly, the haunting German singer Nico, whose despondent delivery he may have emulated on his exquisite 1967 album Songs of Leonard Cohen.
Cohen quickly became the songwriter's songwriter of choice for artists like Collins, James Taylor, Willie Nelson and many others. His black-and-white album photos offered an arresting image to go with his stark yet lovely songs. His next two albums, Songs From a Room (1969) and Songs of Love and Hate (1971), benefited from the spare production of Bob Johnston, along with a group of seasoned session musicians that included Charlie Daniels, gave them in Nashville.
During the Seventies, Cohen set out on the first of the many long, intense tours he would reprise toward the end of his career. "One of the reasons I'm on tour is to meet people," he told Rolling Stone in 1971. "I consider it a reconnaissance. You know, I consider myself like in a military operation. I don't feel like a citizen." 
His time on tour inspired the live sound producer John Lissauer brought to his 1974 masterpiece, New Skin for the Old Ceremony. However, he risked a production catastrophe by hiring wall-of-sound maximalist Phil Spector to work on his next album, Death of a Ladies Man, whose adversarial creation resulted in a Rolling Stone review titled "Leonard Cohen's Doo-Wop Nightmare."
Cohen's relationship with Suzanne Elrod during most of the Seventies resulted in two children, the photographer Lorca Cohen and Adam Cohen, who leads the group Low Millions. 
Cohen was well known for his wandering ways, and his most stable relationships were with backing singers Laura Branigan, Sharon Robinson, Anjani Thomas, and, most notably, Jennifer Warnes, who he wrote with and produced (Warnes frequently performed Cohens music). After indulging in a variety of international styles on Recent Songs (1979), Cohen accorded Warnes full co-vocal credit on 1984's Various Positions.
Various Positions included "Hallelujah," a meditation on love, sex and music that would become Cohen's best-known composition thanks to Jeff Buckley's incandescent 1994 reinterpretation. Its greatness wasn't recognized by Cohen's label, however.
By way of informing him that Columbia Records would not be releasing Various Positions, label head Walter Yetnikoff reportedly told Cohen, "Look, Leonard; we know you're great, but we don't know if you're any good." Cohen returned to the label in 1988 with I'm Your Man, an album of sly humor and social commentary that launched the synths-and-gravitas style he continued on The Future (1992).
In 1995, Cohen halted his career, entered the Mt. Baldy Zen Center outside of Los Angeles, became an ordained Buddhist monk and took on the Dharma name Jikan ("silence").
His duties included cooking for Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi, the priest and longtime Cohen mentor who died in 2014 at the age of 104. Cohen broke his musical silence in 2001 with Ten New Songs, a collaboration with Sharon Robinson, and Dear Heather (2004), a relatively uplifting project with current girlfriend Anjani Thomas. 
While never abandoning Judaism, the Sabbath-observing songwriter attributed Buddhism to curbing the depressive episodes that had always plagued him.
The final act of Cohen's career began in 2005, when Lorca Cohen began to suspect her father's longtime manager, Kelley Lynch, of embezzling funds from his retirement account. 
In fact, Lynch had robbed Cohen of more than $5 million. To replenish the fund, Cohen undertook an epic world tour during which he would perform 387 shows from 2008 to 2013. 
He continued to record as well, releasing Old Ideas (2012) and Popular Problems, which hit U.S. shops a day after his eightieth birthday. "[Y]ou depend on a certain resilience that is not yours to command, but which is present," he told Rolling Stone upon its release. "And if you can sense this resilience or sense this capacity to continue, it means a lot more at this age than it did when I was 30, when I took it for granted."
When the Grand Tour ended in December 2013, Cohen largely vanished from the public eye. In October 2016, he released You Want It Darker, produced by his son Adam. 
Severe back issues made it difficult for Cohen to leave his home, so Adam placed a microphone on his dining room table and recorded him on a laptop. The album was met with rave reviews, though a New Yorker article timed to its release revealed that he was in very poor health. "I am ready to die," he said. "I hope its not too uncomfortable. Thats about it for me."
The singer-songwriter later clarified that he was "exaggerating." "Ive always been into self-dramatization," Cohen said last month. "I intend to live forever.
