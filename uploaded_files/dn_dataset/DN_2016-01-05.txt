Struggling McCullum out of Sri Lanka ODI
MOUNT MAUNGANUI, MONDAY: Outgoing New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was ruled out of the final one-day international against Sri Lanka on Monday as he struggles to recover from a back injury.
Tuesday's game in Mount Maunganui will be the third McCullum has missed since he was injured on December 28 while fielding against Sri Lanka in the second game of the five-match series.
Coach Mike Hesson initially said McCullum, who will retire from international cricket after next month's Tests against Australia, had a chance of completing the Sri Lanka series. But Hesson said on Monday that the skipper will not be considered until the first ODI against Pakistan in Wellington on January 25.
He's really struggling, Hesson said. He hasn't progressed as well as we'd thought. He will get a further assessment.
McCullum had already announced he would sit out the Twenty20 matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan as he will not be going to the World Cup in March. Fast bowler Tim Southee, who suffered a foot injury in the third ODI against Sri Lanka in Nelson last Thursday, will also miss Tuesday's game.
However, his regular new-ball partner Trent Boult returns to the side after being rested for the first four games.
With New Zealand 2-1 up, Sri Lanka need to win on Tuesday to draw the series after earlier being beaten 2-0 in the Tests.
The fourth ODI was abandoned Saturday because of heavy rain.

The Bard for all time
This years four hundredth anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare is not just an opportunity to commemorate one of the greatest playwrights of all time. It is a moment to celebrate the extraordinary ongoing influence of a man who - to borrow from his own description of Julius Caesar -doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.
William Shakespeare
Shakespeares legacy is without parallel: his works translated into over 100 languages and studied by half the worlds schoolchildren. As one of his contemporaries, Ben Jonson, said: Shakespeare is not of an age, but for all time. He lives today in our language, our culture and society  and through his enduring influence on education.
Shakespeare played a critical role in shaping modern English and helping to make it the worlds language. The first major dictionary compiled by Samuel Johnson drew on Shakespeare more than any other writer. Three thousand new words and phrases all first appeared in print in Shakespeares plays. I remember from my own childhood how many of them are found for the first time in Henry V. Words like dishearten, divest, addiction, motionless, leapfrog - and phrases like once more unto the breach, band of brothers and heart of gold  have all passed into our language today with no need to reference their original context. Shakespeare also pioneered innovative use of grammatical form and structure - including verse without rhymes, superlatives and the connecting of existing words to make new words, like bloodstained - while the pre-eminence of his plays also did much to standardise spelling and grammar.
Shakespeares influence
But Shakespeares influence is felt far beyond our language. His words, his plots and his characters continue to inspire much of our culture and wider society. Nelson Mandela, while a prisoner on Robben Island, cherished a quote from Julius Caesar which said Cowards die many times before their death, the valiant never taste of death but once. While Kate Tempests poem My Shakespeare captures the eternal presence of Shakespeare when she wrote that Shakespeare is in every lover who ever stood alone beneath a windowevery jealous whispered word and every ghost that will not rest. Shakespeares influence is everywhere, from Dickens and Goethe to Tchaikovsky, Verdi and Brahms; from West Side Story to the Hamlet-inspired title of Agatha Christies The Mousetrap  the longest-running theatre production in Londons West End today. While his original plays continue to entertain millions - from school halls across the world to the overnight queues as hundreds scrambled for last minute tickets to see Benedict Cumberbatch playing Hamlet at Londons Barbican last year.
But perhaps one of the most exciting legacies of Shakespeare is his capacity to educate. As we see from the outreach work of the Royal Shakespeare Company and Shakespeares Globe and the impact of pioneering British charities like the Shakespeare Schools Festival, studying and performing Shakespeare can help improve literacy, confidence and wider educational attainment.
Life and legacy of Shakespeare
So this 5th January, Twelfth Night, and every day throughout 2016, Britain is inviting you to join us in celebrating the life and legacy of William Shakespeare. Today we are launching Shakespeare Lives  an exciting global programme of activity and events to highlight his enduring influence and extend the use of Shakespeare as an educational resource to advance literacy around the world.
The programme will run in more than seventy countries, led by the British Council and the GREAT Britain campaign. You can share your favourite moment of Shakespeare on social media, watch never-before-seen performances on stage, film and online, visit exhibitions, take part in workshops and debates, and access new Shakespearean educational resources to get to grips with the English language.
The Royal Shakespeare Company will tour China; Shakespeares Globe will perform across the world from Iraq to Denmark. Young people will reimagine Shakespeare in Zimbabwe. A social media campaign called Play your Part (#PlayYourPart) will invite the next generation of creative talent to produce their own digital tribute to the Bard  and, in partnership with the British charity Voluntary Services Overseas, we will raise awareness of the huge challenge of global child illiteracy and use Shakespeare to increase educational opportunities for children around the world.
Beyond the great gift of language, the bringing to life of our history, his ongoing influence on our culture and his ability to educate, there is just the immense power of Shakespeare to inspire.
From the most famous love story to the greatest tragedy; from the most powerful fantasy to the wittiest comedy; and from the most memorable speeches to his many legendary characters, in William Shakespeare we have one man, whose vast imagination, boundless creativity and instinct for humanity encompasses the whole of the human experience as no one has before or since.
So, however you choose to play your part, please join us in 2016 in this unique opportunity to celebrate the life and enduring legacy of this man; ensuring that, as he himself put it, all the worlds a stage and that through his legacy, truly, Shakespeare Lives.

## Title: Amla stands firm against England

Amla stands firm against England
Cape Town, Monday: South African captain Hashim Amla defied England's bowlers and batted throughout the third day of the second Test at Newlands on Monday.
Amla made an unbeaten 157 as South Africa reached 353 for three at the close, still 276 runs behind England's first innings total of 629 for six declared.
AB de Villiers was the only batsman dismissed during the day as South Africa, 1-0 down in the four-Test series, dug in on a pitch which offered no assistance to the bowlers.
Steven Finn was the only successful bowler. He had De Villiers caught at midwicket shortly before tea after Amla and De Villiers had put on 183 in a third wicket partnership which lasted for two minutes short of five hours.
Faf du Plessis, who like Amla had endured a lean spell with the bat, made 51 not out as he helped his captain put on an unbeaten 85 for the fourth wicket.
It was a crucial innings for Amla, who was under pressure for both his captaincy and his batting. South Africa have not won a Test since beating the West Indies at the same venue a year ago, while Amla had made only 150 runs at an average of 15.00 in 10 innings since that match.
It was a triumph of technique and concentration as he made his first Test century since he hit 208 against the West Indies in Centurion in December 2014. By the close he had batted for nine hours and 26 minutes and had faced 371 balls. His innings included 21 fours.
After the worst year of his international career, Amla had two strokes of luck. He was dropped by James Anderson at slip off Joe Root when he was on 76 and by Nick Compton at backward point off Steven Finn when he had 120.
With South Africa's batting having been fragile for most of 2015, the partnership between Amla and De Villiers, the side's two senior batsmen, was important for the team.
Both men batted solidly for the most part but had anxious moments which required decisions by television umpire Rod Tucker.
Amla managed to get his bat down just in time after Finn deflected a drive by De Villiers into the stumps at the bowler's end. De Villiers was given out leg before wicket to Ben Stokes by umpire Aleem Dar when he had 85, but De Villiers immediately sought a review which showed the ball had gone off an inside edge onto his pad.
De Villiers scored only three more runs before he pulled a short ball from Finn hard but straight to Anderson at midwicket. He had defied the England bowlers for 298 minutes and 211 balls, hitting 12 fours and a six.
By contrast to the second day, when Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow thrashed 196 runs for England before lunch and 453 runs were scored in the day for the loss of three wickets, it was attritional cricket, with only 212 runs scored in 87 overs. AFP

Bajirao Mastani teaches how to love

Legendary warrior Peshwa Bajirao battles Mughals but falls in love with half-Muslim Mastani - what happens when Bajirao's family declares war on his loveReview: Straight away, Bajirao Mastani is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's most gorgeous - and most political - movie. Peshwa Bajirao (Ranveer) stretches the Maratha empire across 18th century India, fighting Mughals and rivals for Chhattrapati Shahu (Mahesh). Suddenly, Bundelkhand requests protection, Bajirao approached by its half-Muslim princess Mastani (Deepika).
As Bajirao-Mastani fall in love, how does his wife Kashibai (Priyanka) react And can Bajirao-Mastani battle the bitter opposition they receiveBajirao Mastani's most outstanding star is its cinematography. Every visual resembles a grand painting - courts with shadows and chandeliers, courtiers with tilaks and teers, chambers gleaming with mirrors, skies blushing with passion. Certain shots - Bajirao leaping up an elephant - stamp themselves onto your memory.
The movie's battle scenes are grand and complex while its family battles - led by Bajirao's Ma Sahab (bitterly good Tanvi) and brother Chimaji (Vaibbhav, whose nervous spite impresses) - are acrid and intense. With his faithful friend Ambaji (Milind) and acidic rival Pratinidhi (Aditya), the story takes twists and turns like Bajirao's Shaniwar Wada palace, where corridors resound with whispers, bedrooms with sighs, courtyards with clashing tempers and swords.Ranveer pulls off Bajirao with chiseled muscles and glittering eyes, a Marathi lilt that delights, balancing vulnerability and vivaciousness.
But Deepika's Mastani remains muted - you occasionally glimpse dark eyes drunk on love, the fire of a fighter-princess, but you miss the full-blown passion of this lead pair. In contrast, by the end, Priyanka impresses as quiet Kashi conveys the sorrow of a wife, a lover, a friend, forgotten.The end, by the way, is marvelous.
Where the first half looks fabulous but slightly far-off - like watching an opera from seats high in a theatre's skies - the second half mesmerizes. Post-interval, Bhansali imbues every frame with epic, precise passion. His question - what should religion do Tear us to bits Or bring us closer - frames an end that is frightening, beautiful and powerful.Bajirao-Mastani resembles Jodhaa-Akbar with teeth that bite, Mughal-e-Azam with shades of philosophical grey. It rediscovers roots to Maratha pride - and bravely confronts one of India's most crucial questions now. Quickly 'chala' to the biggest screen you can find.

Cabinet approval to be sought for elevated highways

The Mega-polis and Western Development Ministry along with the Highways Ministry is to hand over the proposal pertaining to the elevated highways for Cabinet approval with the aim of linking Colombo with key towns.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mega-polis and Western Development Nihal Rupasinghe said that this is a three year project which was now being formulated.
Accordingly, a 21.6 kilometer-long elevated highway would be built from Athurugriya to Colombo Fort via Malabe, Battaramulla, Rajagiriya, Dematagoda and Orugodawatte, while such other elevated highway from the Kelaniya Bridge would also be linked to the project.
The elevated highways are to be linked with the existing Colombo outer-circular road at Pore in Athurugriya, with the Katunayake Expressway at the Kelani Bridge, while another extension would be linked with Baseline Road near the Railway Grounds at Dematagoda, he explained.
The elevated highways, that are to be newly constructed to ease traffic congestions, would have access from Malabe, the Koswatta junction, Rajagiriya, Madinnagoda and Kolonnawa. This would be in addition to access from a point close to the Fort Railway station, the Port City, the Kelani Bridge and Dematagoda. It is also to be further extended to Duplication Road. The proposed project is expected to be completed within a period of three years, Rupasinghe added. According to him, the proposed elevated highways project would be one of the most prominent projects to be implemented during the current year.
While the project cost would be around Rs. 130 billion, it would be worked out on a Build-Operate-and Transfer (BOT) basis in a 25-year period, the sources said.
The authorities explained that they have planned to build elevated highways over canals and Port Authority lands would be reduced for relocating of the people.
In addition, arrangements are also in place to build a bridge over the Kandy Lake with the aim of reducing traffic congestion in the Kandy town.
Environmentalists in Kandy have opposed the above proposal of building a bridge over the Kandy Lake, as the Kandy Lake is deemed sacred and should not be violated.
They further said that if a bridge was to be built over the Kandy Lake, the entire landscape would be obliterated and the vision of an aesthetic king who beautified Kandy with the lake and Pathiruppuwa would be lost.
They said the move was not in keeping with the aspirations of the people of Kandy.
"The only remaining beauty of the City of Kandy was the Sri Dalada Maligawa and the Kandy Lake. If this too was lost, we would have nothing to show the next generation, they added.

Chris Gayle fined $10,000 by Melbourne Renegades, Big Bash League team apologises to Mel McLaughlin

Chris Gayle has been fined $10,000 by his Big Bash League team the Melbourne Renegades following his controversial interview with Channel Ten reporter Mel McLaughlin.

In doing so, the Renegades have extended a formal apology to Mel McLaughlin after Gayle made inappropriate comments during Monday night's Big Bash clash against the Hobart Hurricanes.

"Chris's comments were completely inappropriate and disrespectful and there is simply no place for these kind of comments at the Melbourne Renegades or the broader community across any sport," Renegades chief executive Stuart Coventry said in a statement.

"The club would like to extend a formal apology to Mel McLaughlin. Mel is an outstanding sports presenter. We think of her very highly and the club and the players will ensure we work with her in a professional and respectful manner in the future.

"We've had several discussions with Chris in the last 24 hours and he has acknowledged that his comments were out of line."

Gayle's fine will be donated to the McGrath Foundation.

"We didn't think the situation would require a ban," Coventry told the media gathering.

"We looked at the circumstances and we saw it as a one-off scenario.

"We looked at the circumstances and we think this is a one-off scenario.

"We looked at Chris's attitude over the last four or five weeks in the Big Bash games and it has been first class and outstanding."

Coventry said Gayle was surprised by the fine, but will play in the all-Melbourne clash against the Stars.

"He was quite surprised but he has accepted it in good faith and is looking forward to playing in the derby on Saturday."

Gayle caused a media storm after an interview with McLaughlin after smashing 41 runs off 15 balls for the Melbourne Renegades in their Big Bash clash with the Hobart Hurricanes.

McLaughlin asked Gayle about the aggression on display in the Renegades' innings during their win over the Hurricanes and the ex-West Indies Test captain took the interview in a completely different direction.

"I wanted to come and have an interview with you as well. That's the reason why I'm here, just to see your eyes for the first time," he said.

"Hopefully we can win this game and we can have a drink later. Don't blush, baby."

A visibly rattled McLaughlin responded by saying: "I'm not blushing."

Renegades deny Gayle has a track record

But Coventry and the Renegades have denied Gayle has a track record of poor behaviour towards female journalists despite others coming forward with stories similar to the incident with McLaughlin.

"I'm unfamiliar with what those journalists have said and the grounds and evidence behind that," Coventry said.

"We've done a fair bit of history and research today and we do think it is a one-off. As explained this morning we think it is more of a cultural indifference as to why he said and it was done in jest.

"But it is inappropriate and we have taken this course of action.

"We think that Chris's contribution is very positive around the group. He is a seasoned professional. He just said the wrong thing at the wrong time. He's copped that and he has copped the fine." (ABC News)

Delighted by the chance to wear the Pakistan green shirt once again, says Mohammad Amir

Even by the normal standards of activity in the usually topsy-turvy universe that defines Pakistans most popular sport, the chain of events that began with the news that Mohammad Amir had been included for the training camp ahead of the tour of New Zealand can only be described as frenetic.
With welcome news that grave reservations expressed by some senior players about the inclusion of Amir in the camp had been addressed to satisfaction of all concerned after a few days of intense diplomatic activity, the nation as a whole was starting to feel that things were perhaps getting back on track. However this sentiment did not last long as a shocking news in the shape of a provisional ban on Pakistans ace spinner Yasir Shah exploded on the national headlines without warning and threatened to plunge the nation into another round of depression.
What Pakistan needed now was some good news and good news is what the selectors delivered to the nation on Friday when they announced the Limited-over squads for the upcoming tour of New Zealand. Much to the relief of fans and observers of the exciting brand of Pakistan cricket, Mohammad Amir was included in both the ODI and T20I squads, subject to the granting of a visa by the New Zealand authorities.
The man who back in 2010 was regarded as the rightful inheritor to the throne of left-handed greatness, left vacant by the departure of Wasim Akram, is now part of the Pakistan squad again. His current form leading up to his inclusion in the national squad has been described as phenomenal by many, with the head coach of Pakistan Waqar Younis going as far as saying that despite the passage of more than five years of inactivity in a cricket field You cant kill that zip as thats what Amir is all about. He is very humble, has very worked very hard in the training camp and I am proud of his attitude.
With the backing of his coach and the blessings of legendary figures such as Imran Khan and Wasim Akram, the pace-bowler now stands on the verge of continuing his fascinating journey in international cricket where he has taken 51 Test, 25 ODI and 23 T20I wickets.
In exclusive remarks to PakPassion.net, an understandably elated Mohammad Amir who has worked hard since the expiry of his ban in September 2015, looked forward to making an international return after being selected for the Pakistan team for tour of New Zealand, stating that Im really excited that my name has been included in the squads for the tour of New Zealand. Its what I have been aiming for since my return to cricket and what I have been looking to achieve since my ban ended. There is nothing like playing for your country and thats what I want more than anything else.
Whilst many of his detractors would like to point at events of the past to cast doubts over his integrity and suitability as a member of the national squad, the twenty-three year old has no doubts about the support and background work done on his behalf and how he intends to pay-back his fans for their unwavering support Im absolutely delighted at being given the opportunity to wear the Pakistan green shirt once again and I thank the Pakistan Cricket Board for giving me a second chance and also thank all of my friends and fans out there who have given me so much love and support, especially during the tough times.
Ive learnt a lot from my mistakes and I will never let the cricketing family down again. We all make mistakes and I have learnt the hard way. But Im a more mature person now and will not let anyone down. I have a good team around me, a very supportive team who are looking after me in all aspects of my cricket and life. Im indebted to them for their guidance and help.
Spending the last few years away from the game he obviously has a lot of passion for, must have been painful for the bowler who was marked for greatness back in 2010 but being part of the team is something he genuinely seems to be enjoying as he states I really enjoyed the recent fitness camp in Lahore and I thank the PCB for including me at the camp. It was fantastic to be around international players and team mates again and all of the coaching staff especially Waqar Younis. I worked hard at the camp and everyone was very supportive and friendly towards me. It was a very useful camp and certainly helped me in regards to a return to international cricket.
Now that Amir has earned his place in the national squad, what Pakistan fans will want to know is if the bowler can get down to business and deliver the performances they have yearned for many years. AFP

DO JUSTICE, NO DIVISIONS
As the Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Tamil National Alliance, R. Sampanthan holds a unique position to contribute towards reshaping Sri Lankans political culture and constitutional parameters within which the government should operate.
Sampanthan, a leader of coalition of minority parities, is the second such leader to be elected as the Opposition Leader after a gap of over three decades. His predecessor A. Amirthalingam, leader of TULF to which Sampanthan also belongs, became the Opposition Leader in 1977. Unlike Amirthaligam and other Tamil Leaders who either had no opportunity or followed an apathetic approach towards contributing to constitutional building Sampanthan is poised to take an active role in designing of the new constitution. The Daily News spoke to R. Sampanthan on his approach to designing of the new constitution and about the turbulent times in his own party and TNA.
Following are the excerpts of the interview:
Q: You are the second Tamil Party leader to be appointed as the Leader of Opposition. What do you think of this
A: I dont think one should view this from the point of view of ethnicity oriented politics. A decision as to who should be the leader is generally made by the Speaker on the basis of certain facts. It so happened that in 1977 Amirthalingam was the leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and the TULF had won the second largest number of seats in the parliament after the United National Party (UNP). So he was an automatic choice.
In the current parliament, although the UPFA as a whole is the second largest party after the United National Front or UNP, several members of the UPFA hold positions in the government and the UPFA is subject to the principle of collective responsibility.
In that position it is not possible for any member of the UPFA to officially lead the Opposition. In those circumstances the ITAK is the next party with the largest number of seats and been accorded with the due recognition by the Speaker.
Q: TNA is considered as a Peripheral political Party by some politicians and fractions of the public. The Party mandate its self concentrates on issues concerning Tamil people of the North and the East mainly. How do you now transform to a national focus with the new position you hold
A: I dont think it is correct to call the TNA a peripheral political party, that is insulting, and I reject it.
Northern and Eastern provinces are an integral part of this country and in many respects have more importance than many other parts of this country. I do not know how anyone can regard it as a peripheral territory.
But of course as the leader of the opposition I recognize that I have to play a role that extends beyond the concerns for only the North and the East. I have to play a national role and I and my party are both endeavouring to play that role.
Q: But the Party mandate it self concentrates on issues concerning Tamil people of the North and the East mainly. How do you span out of this view to more national issues that fall under your concern now
A: The mandate given to the TNA may particularly relate to issues in the North and East. Particularly relating to the resolution of the national question through a new constitution. That also relates to the wellbeing of the whole country and its future. They are all inclusive.
Q: In a situation where you are focusing on more national level issues, do you think you may be neglecting the communities that you directly represent
A: I dont think there is a conflict between both. I think both issues are integral and integrated. And I think one can well perform one without conflict with the other. When you focus on the issues of the North and the East you are focusing on issues that relate to a part of this country and which have an impact on the whole country. When you focus on the issues of the rest of the country, you are again focusing on the issues that have an impact on the whole country. I dont think we should seek to divide these issues. That has been the primary cause of the problems.
Q: Do you think the South has accepted you as the Leader of the Opposition, as your immediate predecessors have been
A: JVP, JHU, and other parties have welcomed me. The UNP has raised no objection to me, the SLFP, UPFA has raised no objection to me. The Muslim Parties have welcomed me. The Indian National Parties have welcomed me. I have received welcome letters from number of people from all parts of the country. I think public is more sensible and many are prepared to accept.
Q: What does 2016 hold in terms of your focus as the Opposition Leader
A: Well 2016 is going to be primarily spent on framing the new constitution, abolition the Executive Presidency. Electoral reforms are going to be another part of the new constitution. The resolution of the national question through the constitution would be another focus, a more acceptable Bill of Rights and fundamental freedoms is going to be another feature of the constitution.
Q: As the Leader of the TNA and also the Leader of the Opposition you hold a unique position to contribute to the new constitution representing your communities as opposed to the contributions in the three decades. How do you view this
A: The making of the constitution is for the whole country. All the issues that constitution deals with concern the whole country. Abolition of the Executive Presidency relates to the whole country, electoral reforms relates to the whole country; resolution of the national problem relates to the whole country, it is just as much a problem as the first two. Everything else relates to the whole country. If things are done on the basis of equality, justice and righteousness then we dont look at it thorugh a defferant prism; you look at it through the correct perspective.
Q: Doesnt your position as the leader of the TNA give you better chance to represent the Tamil community the party represents
A: I dont look at it that way. I am an elected Member of Parliament and the leader of a political party, I have been recognized as the Leader of the Opposition, I have a role to play in the making of the whole constitution and I will play that role.
Q: So it is as the Leader of the Opposition and a Member of the Parliament that you will design your contribution to constitutional building
A: I do not see a distinction between one and the other, you want human rights to be preserved, you want fundamental rights to be preserved, and you want equality rule of law to be ensured; these are issues that concern the whole country. I dont look at it as a Tamil; I look at it as a Member of the Parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition, and also look at it as the Leader of the TNA, thats inevitable. But there is no confusion the way I look at it as the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the TNA, it is the same.
Q: Following the co-sponsoring of the UN resolution on Sri Lanka, there has not been much progress. How do you think the country should progress in resolving the National Issue What type of influence can you exert in this sense
A: The government has co-sponsored the resolution; the resolution has been unanimously adopted by the UN Human Rights Council, the present government has been able to persuade the international community to revise its opinion about Sri Lanka.
That is because they are not pursuing the rather rigid closed door policy of the Rajapaksa government. At the same time Sri Lanka being a co-sponsor of the resolution, we have to honestly implement the resolution. Our objective must not be to promote further conflict, our objective must be to ensure that justice is done, without promoting further conflict.
Q: Do you see a lot of hurdles in the path to achieving these goals
A: It all depends on what happens. The UN High Commissioner on Human Rights is expected to come to Sri Lanka within the course of the next few weeks. What happens eventually will have to be positive. It may not be positive for all individuals, but it will be positive for this country.
Q: Earlier the TNA was supportive towards LTTE politics. What was the reason for this
A: One has to be careful about the choice of words, when talking of these things. I was never supportive of LTTE politics. But the LTTE was an important player in the national question.
Successive governments held talks with the LTTE whether it was the UNP or the SLFP. The international community talked to the LTTE. They all did so because the LTTE was a relevant factor in the evolution of a political solution. The TNA also talked to the LTTE for the same reasons. There was no difference between the TNA talking to the LTTE and the government talking to the LTTE, they all talked of a political solution.
I was never a part of the military apparatus of the LTTE, I still dont know how to load a gun. I have talked to Prabhakaran, I spoke of a political solution, I did not ask about which camp he was going to attack next!
Q: The Chief Minister of the Northern Province, TNA member C. V. Wigneswaran has been very outspoken and has taken a very hard-line view regarding the post war issues. This has been a deviation of the current political approach of the TNA. How do you view the current conduct of Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran
A: Wigneswaran was elected the Chief Minister of the Northern Province as the nominee of the TNA and as the Chief Ministerial candidate of the ITAK. The policy of the TNA is enunciated in the TNA manifesto. It has been the same policy enunciated to the people at all elections; at national or provincial or local authority elections. It was on the basis of these policies that Wigneswaran became the Chief Minister. He is bound by these policies.
Since January this year, there had been a radical change in this country. When there is the opportunity of the national issue being addressed positively, which did not exist at all during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, this opportunity must be utilized and must not be missed.
Unduly rigid and strident postures are not helpful. Any resolution has to be adopted by two thirds majority in Parliament; it must be approved by the people at a referendum, which means in a constitutional resolution of the national question we should be able to carry along the majority of the people with us.
Resolution must be reasonable, acceptable, workable and durable. If this can be achieved without adopting rigid and strident postures, which efforts should be made. Political parties had adopted strident and rigid postures, during elections particularly the last parliamentary elections held in 2015 had been rejected by the people, which really means that their policies have been rejected by the people.
We are prepared to listen to any ones views on a political solution. But unfortunately Wigneswaran seems to be entangled with political parties and policies which had been rejected by the people. This is not acceptable. Developments are being kept under observation. But we are strongly of the view that the people are sensible, and are solidly behind the Tamil National Alliance.
Q: In a meeting in Batticaloa, you stated that you are willing to step down from the leadership of TNA. Does that still stand
A: What I said was, I am leader of the TNA, the main political parties in the TNA have chosen me as their leader and the people have accepted this. I am not in competition with any one for this post and if it is the wish of the TNA and the wish of the people that they want to change, I am certainly prepared to move out in a moment.
Q: Dont you fear that if you do move out there would be a departure from the relatively liberal approach the TNA follows at present
A: It is up to the people to make the decision. It is up to me to guide the people to make the decision. Ill guide my people to make the correct decision, but the people must make that decision.
Q: Recently you held discussions with Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran. How were the discussions
A: Talks were cordial, I told him that his conduct during the last Parliamentary election was not acceptable to either the TNA or the ITAK, that he did not support the TNA, on the contrary, the statements made by him were interpreted as supportive of the forces that he is now aligned with, and that was unacceptable. We discussed several other issues and we agreed to meet again.
Q: How do you view the recent formation of Tamil Peoples Alliance by C. V. Wigneswaran as opposed to TNAs role as the main representative of Tamil community
A: We respect and recognize the right of Tamil civil society and Tamil public to express their views regarding matters of great concern for them like a political solution. But unfortunately particularly political alliance comprises of people who are generally opposed to the TNA, who have propounded very strident policies before the people and who have been rejected by the people and also some people for various reasons have developed some ill will towards the TNA; persons who have not been given seats in the national list, it comprises largely of such people.
Q: In this regard, is there any disciplinary action to be taken on the conduct of the Chief Minister
A: There was a proposal at a meeting of the ITAK that the conduct of the Chief Minister during the parliamentary elections needs to be scrutinized and appropriate action taken. But there has been nothing further. We are watching the developments.

TO DO OR NOT TO DO

Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn responds Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind to Scarlett OHaras question, Where shall I go What shall I do
Three hundred and sixty five days later, here we are at the dawn of yet another new year. Asking ourselves the same question, and secretly jotting down our own to-do lists
NEW seems to be a word at the tip of every tongue. The New Year comes with new hopes, new dreams and a chance to turn your life around by aspiring to become a better person. The secret resolution lists jotted down in your diary, is bound to make the new 365 days more productive as well as adventurous. By planning a to-do list, you are egging yourself on to turn into the complete person that you were meant to be.
It our chance to re-evaluate life choices, and to retrospect. And an opportunity to UT aside the procrastination, and get on the right track. Forgot something last year Why not add it to this years resolution list and have a chance at making a few much needed lifetime changes.
But can you really stick to it Can you pu t the words into action and actually make an effort, or are you just addicted to making lists
A History of Resolutions
Recently I came across a collection of interesting lists, maintained by certain important personalities, in order to keep track of themselves, as they step into another year, full of possibilities. As human beings, each and every one of us have hundreds of hopes and dream piled away in our head, whether it is in a quiet little corner of our heat, scribbled among our diary pages or written in caps half across your bedroom wall. Making lists depend on the people. Here is a look at some of historys more uncommon resolution lists from the journals, letters, and private effects of cultural icons.
Jonathan Swift the author of Gullivers Travels gathered a list of 17 goals for his far future, titled When I come to be old. Focusing on intelligence, humility, endurance, and fairness. Some of which I found quite interesting, enough to add to my own list.
Not to scorn present Ways, or Wits, or Fashions, or Men, or War, &c. Scorning at things that you dont agree with in life, would not get you anywhere, Swifts witty resolution must have saved him from quite a load of unnecessary hate.
He also aspired to Not to talk much, nor of myself. This could indeed come in handy in the modern times. Where we find people posting the ingredients of their breakfast on social media.
The Singer-songwriter Johnny Cash was in love with the fellow country star June Carter, in 1968, 13 years after first meeting her.
Their relationship stood the test of time and they remained together until her death, 35 years later. In a famous to-do list, he aspired To kiss June and Not kiss anyone else. Cough, Eat, Not eat too much, were among his other things to be accomplished.
Funnily enough I came across a TO DO LIST or a list of CONDITIONS, that Albert Einstein wrote to his wife, that he assumed to sustain the wreck that was their 11 year marriage.
Among the things he had things that You will makes sure, Things that you will forgo and the Things to obey in the relationship between the two. In his note he goes on to say You will renounce all personal relations with me insofar as they are not completely necessary for social reasons.
Which made me wonder if anyone today must be writing lists of the sort!
Einstein and Milena did not survive with the help of the demanding to do list, and divorced a few months afterwards.
To NOT to Do
To do lists often go unnoticed, and forgotten after the hype. It has been proven that abstaining from things are easier than starting new things all over again. So why not go ahead and make a not to do list, to at least quit all those unhealthy habits that got you into heaps of trouble last year
When making a resolution start with two questions: Why am I not doing this already and Why should I f need to do this It is quite practical as the first question seeks the barrier, and the second gives you the necessary motivation, to get yourself together and initiate enough desire to overcome the obstacles.
Be more specific with your resolutions. Instead of saying I will read more books this year, make a list of the books that you plan on reading or buying this year and save up and get ahead and tick each out of the list. It does not have to be a physical list that we are talking about. It could all be in your head, but as long as you are keeping everything under control, your resolutions would not go down the drain like the last years one did.
Set healthy and achievable goals. I will lose all my Christmas weight can be rephrased as I will try my best to workout 20 minutes a day and eat healthy. It isnt about the resolution itself, it is about how you plan to achieve it without being a procrastinator.
If you have a passion, allocate more time for it this year, make art if you are an artist, write if you are a writer, dance if you are a dancer! Follow your passions no matter what they are, you would need a little love and hope to get by in the fast pacing world among all the work and busy lifestyle you would have to lead. So give yourself some love!!!!
A little something to TRY
Resolutions are about making a difference. I came across this list online, and modified it a little, so as to suit my expectations. If you need a little spice in your life and something to look forward to. Here is a list of 52 things to try. A one for every week.
Write a handwritten note to an old friend and post it.
Bake a cake for someone
Volunteer for a day
Take a bus or train to a town youve never visited. Just go to the station and get on the next one that comes in.
Practice meditation
Make a scrapbook
Sleep under the stars.
Learn to play a musical instrument.
Spend a whole day in bed watching movies.
Do something nice with your family
Make a new friend.
Forgive someonewho has hurt you.
Plant a tree

Govt policy to protect heritage, expand daham pasal - Amunugama

The Sunday daham pasal system in Sri Lanka should be further expanded. That it is the policy of the government, Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
He made these comments at the opening of a newly built relic chamber at the Sri Nagabodhi Purana Viharaya in Doranuwa, Ruwanwella.
"At a time when various ideologies are spreading in our country our Sunday-school system should be further expanded. We as a government pledge to promote the daham pasal system. We will take all the steps necessary towards that end," the minister said. He said the distinguishing mark of Sri Lanka is Buddhism: "We should not forget that Buddhism is intimately tied up with Sinhala-ness. The world recognises us as a Buddhist country. If we go to Thailand, Cambodia or Burma our country is recognized as one with good Buddhists. Therefore we must safeguard that situation," Dr. Amunugama said.
"We should not forget our heritage while our society changes. Not only must we not forget it, we should also protect it for the future generations. I must state that the President and the government are committed to that task," the minister said.
Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province, Minister of Power and Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and several Provincial Council Members participated at the ceremony.

Hiddink gets first Chelsea win, Spurs held

LONDON, SUNDAY: Chelsea overwhelmed Crystal Palace 3-0 in the Premier League on Sunday to give interim manager Guus Hiddink his first victory, while Tottenham Hotspur drew 1-1 at Everton.
Oscar, Willian and Diego Costa scored the goals at a sodden Selhurst Park as champions Chelsea recorded their first win since Hiddink took charge following the sacking of Jose Mourinho.
It was their first win away from home since a 3-2 victory at West Bromwich Albion on August 23 and elevated them to 14th place in the table, six points above the relegation zone.
"The very talented players, they start working also, to invest in the dirty work and not just the beautiful game they can play, because this league is very demanding," said Hiddink, who is managing Chelsea in an interim capacity for the second time.
"And if you think you can do it just on your quality, what's more given by talent than nature, then this league will kill you."
Chelsea lost Eden Hazard to a groin problem in the early stages, but took the lead in the 29th minute when Costa cut the ball back for Oscar to sweep home.
Willian made it 2-0 on the hour, crashing a superb shot into the top-right corner from outside the box, and six minutes later he teed up Costa to tap in his third goal in two matches.
Chelsea are now unbeaten in four league games since Mourinho's sacking -- their longest run since last season -- and captain John Terry credited Hiddink for lifting the mood at the club.
"This was the Chelsea of last year," Terry told Sky Sports.
"Guus has been great since he has come in. It was unfortunate what happened, but he has come in and picked everyone up.
"We are where we are. We have not dwelled on it. If we can put together a run of games, who knows Hopefully we can go a long way."
While Chelsea are now 13 points below the Champions League places, with 18 games remaining, Palace finished the weekend five points off the top four in seventh place.
"It is one of those games where we just wipe our nose and move onto the next game," said manager Alan Pardew, whose side had lost only one of their previous nine league games.
"I have every confidence in this group that we will be in and around the top 10." AFP

India panel proposes BCCI revamp after scandals
New Delhi, Monday: A panel appointed by India's Supreme Court on Monday proposed sweeping changes to the country's scandal-hit cricket board and said gambling should be made legal.The panel headed by former chief justice Rajendra Mal Lodha was appointed after a string of corruption scandals at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
It also suggests legalising betting after a popular Twenty20 tournament run by the BCCI, the Indian Premier League (IPL), was rocked by allegations of corruption, match-fixing and crooked umpires.
Its report, seen by AFP, recommends barring politicians from the sport's governing body and introducing time limits on holding office.
Gambling is mostly illegal in India, but betting on cricket matches thrives through networks of underground bookies.
"As far as betting alone is concerned... it would serve both the game and economy if it were legalised," the report suggests, with several riders.
In July it suspended the Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) teams, triggering the resignation of former BCCI chief Narayanaswami Srinivasan.
Lodha's panel was formed in January last year to recommend changes after the top court found two IPL franchise owners guilty of betting on the outcome of matches in 2013.
The panel exonerated IPL chief operating officer Sundar Raman, citing lack of evidence, after it was tasked to investigate match-fixing allegations against him.

It's the Wet Indies as rain soaks Sydney Test
SYDNEY, MONDAY: Carlos Brathwaite provided some fireworks in a lively cameo as rain washed out all but 11.2 overs of the second day of the third Australia-West Indies Test on Monday.
The Barbados all-rounder clouted two massive sixes off one James Pattinson over on his way to a dynamic 69 after lunch at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Brathwaite smashed Pattinson over cover for his first powerful blow before flicking another off his pads for an effortless six over backward square leg.
But Pattinson had the last laugh, bowling the hulking all-rounder in his next over. Brathwaite's 69 runs came off 71 balls with seven fours and four sixes and further enhanced his reputation after his 59 on debut during the second Test in Melbourne.
"I just went out there and tried to play my game, thankfully I got from 30-odd overnight to 69," Brathwaite said.
"I'm not satisfied that I didn't carry on to get three figures or firstly to see out the day but I'm still happy in sense that I got my highest Test score."
Brathwaite, who gave the 14,266 bedraggled fans some entertainment on a frustrating stop-start day, said he was disappointed to get out.
"I was very, very upset. Not on the dismissal because I think it was a good nut (ball), but I was upset that once again I got a start and couldn't carry on and one of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximise," he said.
"Then reaching halfway off and hearing the crowd's applause and I even saw some people standing, I just took a step back and said, 'You know what, just enjoy the feeling' raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling."
Steve O'Keefe, one of two recognised spinners along with Nathan Lyon in an Australian team for the first time in a decade in a home Test, said there was still time for Australia to get a result. "I think so. I think there's still a hell of a lot of cricket to go," O'Keefe said. "If you can get three days in then that's close to 300 overs.
"Hopefully, if the skipper sees that spin will play a big role then we might get more overs in towards the back end of the match if the wicket keeps spinning, it's spinning already."
Only four overs could be bowled in the first session and 7.2 in the second before another heavy squall forced the players to leave the field for a third and final time.
There was no further play after tea with large tarpaulins covering the pitch and wicket surrounds.
The West Indies were 248 for seven with Denesh Ramdin on 30 and Kemar Roach yet to score. "It (the rain) is annoying. It's hard for the guys to continually switch off and get back up," O'Keefe said. AFP

Joint Opposition's Black Flag protest an utter failure - Kiriella
The people of this country have given their verdict to the Joint Opposition who attempted to show the Government their protest by hoisting black flags.
Today, green flags were hoisted congratulating the Government," said Leader of the House/Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Minister Lakshman Kiriella. The minister expressed the following views at an inauguration of a few road projects in the Gampola area yesterday (3). The minister further said further: "This country at present has an ethical government. Under the 19th Amendment, the Judiciary is now independent. The Police and State Services are functioning without any political interference. Law and Democracy is operational. It is because of this type of a ruling system that a certain MP is against. He urged people of this country to raise black flags on January 1st.
The people of this country have given their verdict to the Joint Opposition who tried showing their protest to the Government by raising black flags. So, did the people raise any black flags Not one black flag was raised. Finally, those who said that they would raise black flags went to Facebook to raise black flags. Even that was unsuccessful. Today, green flags were raised congratulating the Government, instead of the black flags. The Opposition has no news at all to giveaway these days. But there was a lot of news during the previous government's rule. White vans kidnapping people, officers being tied to trees, sentencing General Sarath Fonseka to jail and the killing of journalists were some of the the news headlines during the previous rule. But today, there are no such things.
Today the country has a free and peaceful environment. "Last week a group of journalists had told an Opposition MP that there were no news items to write and for him to call a press briefing and say something. Two MPs agreed to do so. But one MP backed out. The other MP finally had nothing to say as well." Today the country is following the 'Dasarajadharma Principle'. What we wish was to create a civilized country. What we wish was to create a country we could be proud of. Everything should not be measured with a price tag. The greatest victory we could bring to our country is to safeguard our democracy through law and justice." Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathna and many provincial politicians attended this event.

Kuznetsova comfortably into second round in Auckland

Wellington, Monday: Two-time Grand Slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova had an easy first round win in the WTA Auckland Classic Monday when German opponent Mona Barthel retired early in the second set.
Kuznetsova, the tournament fourth seed, headlined the opening day with the top three seeds -- Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Ana Ivanovic -- not scheduled to appear until Tuesday.
The Russian was rarely troubled in her brief appearance and was ahead 6-2, 1-1 when Barthel withdrew with a stomach complaint.
Despite only a short time on court, the 30-year-old former world number two was satisfied with the way she played, particularly holding serve in the blustery conditions.
You dont try to play your best in these conditions its very hard, she said.
It was important to keep my serve, I was some break points down and it was tough to play with the wind.
Of the other seeds in action on the first day, number five Sloane Stephens from the United States had a comfortable win over Slovakian Polona Hercog 6-3, 6-3, while eighth seed Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium was beaten by Alexandra Dulgheru from Romania 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.
Latvian Jelena Ostapenko, 18, justified her wildcard entry to the main draw with an upset win over Johanna Larsson from Sweden 6-1 7-5.
However, the road ahead gets difficult for the 2014 Junior Wimbledon champion with a likely second-round match against Ivanovic.

Lights, camera, aliens ... what we'll be talking about at the movies next year

In 2016, space invaders will take over from zombies, we shall laugh at international conflict and see Michael Bay finally getting serious.
Aliens land
Aliens were curiously absent from big screens in 2015. Even The Martian was a deceptively titled tale of human ingenuity. But with zombies and vampires becoming very old hat, space invaders are set to make a comeback. Twenty years after most of the world was decimated in Independence Day, the landmark-exploding baddies are back to finish the job in the sequel, with Jeff Goldblum returning to fend them off. A more cerebral take on a similar set-up is explored in Sicario director Denis Villeneuve's Story of Your Life, with Amy Adams playing a linguist tasked with discovering whether extraterrestrials have come to earth to make nice or nasty. There's less confusion in young-adult tale The 5th Wave, which has Chlo Grace Moretz trying to save her brother as alien attacks hit. Finally, Hedwig and the Angry Inch director John Cameron Mitchell adapts Neil Gaiman's short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties about a visitor from outer space lost in Croydon, with Nicole Kidman. Benjamin Lee.
Pop directors get political
There comes a time for every director to put away childish things. In 2016, Michael Bay and Peter Berg will make the leap from kids' stuff to chewy adult politics. Bay is tidying away his Transformers to make room for a film about Benghazi. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi follows the six-man team that defended an American diplomatic compound after radical Islamic terrorists attacked, killing the US ambassador to Libya. Bay has angered some Libyans, who say his jingoistic take diminishes the role that local people played in defending the Americans. Meanwhile, Berg, who has already chalked up an Afghanistan war thriller (Lone Survivor, starring Mark Wahlberg), is swapping battleships for oil rigs with Deepwater Horizon, his take on the 2010 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and raised questions about the rigs owners' safety record.
Like Stonewall director Roland Emmerich before them, both Bay and Berg have suffered and will suffer critical approbation for daring to step outside their big, dumb comfort zone. Not everyone can be Spielberg, but then it's tough to be taken seriously after you've made millions framing close-ups of Megan Fox's bum. More likely to be taken seriously for getting serious is Rob Reiner. The director of The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally has flirted with gravitas (A Few Good Men), but his recent dramas have lacked heft. LBJ, starring Woody Harrelson as Lyndon B Johnson, is being talked up as a sincere return to form. Henry Barnes.
We start laughing at the news
Leftie Hollywood has long gone gaga for the international conflict comedy. M*A*S*H, Good Morning Vietnam, Three Kings, In the Loop - the absurdities of war have always appealed to the liberals. It's nice to know that, despite the chain of command and beyond the standard operating procedure, there are people, and people will always screw up eventually. This year's clutch of satires come straight from the frontline in Afghanistan. Tina Fey is fronting Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, based on the book The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan by embedded US journalist Kim Barker. And Animal Kingdom director David Michd is escorting Brad Pitt through War Machine, another high-profile Netflix acquisition. Pitt plays General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan whose scathing assessment of the Obama administration, reported by journalist Michael Hastings in a Rolling Stone profile, led to McChrystal being relieved of his command. Michd's film will follow Hastings as he ingratiates himself with McChrystal's people and finds out how they really feel about their commander-in-chief. Stoical archness in situations the military would deem "Fubar" will be the order of the day here. Just let's not forget there's a war on. The Guardian

Martin Guptill ton leads New Zealand to 294-5
The most prolific international one-day batsman of 2015 hasn't required a New Year's resolution.

Martin Guptill's run of form in the limited-overs arena continued in Mount Maunganui on Tuesday as he made 102 in the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka.

The opener's century guided the Black Caps to 294-5 from their 50 overs as they sought to seal a 3-1 series victory.

Guptill made 1489 ODI runs in 2015, with four centuries and eight 50s. In the current series against Sri Lanka which began on Boxing Day, the opener has compiled scores of 79, 93 not out, 30, 27 and 102.

His composed knock - albeit with a couple of miscues - came from 109 balls and featured nine fours and three sixes. It saw him become the third New Zealander to break into double figures for ODI centuries - Guptill now has 10, behind only Nathan Astle (16) and Ross Taylor (15).

Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and somewhat surprisingly put the hosts into bat.

While the Bay Oval wicket is a vast improvement from the old dunger at Blake Park used late last century, the wise word is to utilise what pace and bounce there is initially, then bowl when the deck is slower and more variable.

After losing opener Tom Latham to the last ball of the first over, Guptill and Kane Williamson began to establish the sort of dominance New Zealand built earlier in the series.

While the Sri Lankan seam attack was generally accurate, any delivery too full or too short was rapidly pounced on by two in-form batsmen.

In doing so, they picked up their share of boundaries in the first 10 overs and then accumulated with little risk, forcing Mathews to further rotate his limited bowling line-up in search of a breakthrough.

Having omitted rookie leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay, the visitors had to employ a pair of part-timers tweakers in Tillakaratne Dilshan and Milinda Siriwardana. Guptill brought up New Zealand's 100 and the century partnership for the second wicket with a six off a rank full-toss from Siriwardana and Williamson wasn't far behind in reaching the same personal mini-milestone.

He'd produced the shot of the innings with an inside-out boundary over extra-cover, so it came as a massive surprise which silenced the crowd when he gloved a poor delivery down the leg-side from Dilshan that wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal snatched at the second opportunity.

Williamson's 61 came off 72 balls and featured seven fours, as he and Guptill put on 122 for the second wicket.

Ross Taylor then put on 81 for the third wicket with Williamson as he compiled a valuable 61 off 67 balls, including four fours and a six.

Nuwan Kulasekera took 3-53 off his 10 overs while young paceman Dushmantha Chameera went for just 41 off his nine overs.

Neville's Valencia fight back to deny 10-man Madrid

VALENCIA, SUNDAY: Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez endured an unhappy return to Mestalla as Gary Neville's Valencia twice came from behind to salvage a point in a pulsating 2-2 draw on Sunday.
Benitez needed a win amid doubts about his future at the club and Madrid had got off to a flying start thanks to a brilliant team goal finished off by Karim Benzema.
However, Valencia levelled through Dani Parejo's penalty just before half-time and the visitors were left to play the final 20 minutes with 10 men as Mateo Kovacic was shown a straight red card.
Gareth Bale's brilliant header restored Madrid's lead for barely a minute before Paco Alcacer rescued a point for Valencia eight minutes from time.
A draw leaves Neville still looking for his first La Liga win in four games since taking charge of Valencia last month.
Madrid, meanwhile, are now four points adrift of leaders Atletico Madrid and two behind Barcelona having also played a game more than the European champions.
Benitez has been publicly backed by Madrid president Florentino Perez, but media reports in recent weeks have suggested French legend and the club's reserve team coach Zinedine Zidane could be promoted to the top job at the Bernabeu if results don't improve.
Colombian star James Rodriguez was dropped to the bench by Benitez days after he was pursued by the police to the club's training ground accused of speeding at up to 200 kilometres per hour.
But in contrast to his recent receptions at the Santiago Bernabeu, Benitez was given a hero's welcome on his return to the Mestalla after guiding Valencia to two La Liga titles in three years over a decade ago.
And Benitez couldn't have wished for a better start as Benzema was fed by a lovely interchange of passes between Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo to slot home his 16th goal in 17 appearances this season.
However, in keeping with many games this season, Benitez's men failed to maintain their early intensity and allowed Valencia to take control as the first half progressed.
Joao Cancelo headed wide a golden chance from Rodrigo de Paul's inviting cross before Aymen Abdennour fired a loose ball inside the area just wide.
Madrid had been awarded three controversial penalties in their last two matches, but were left feeling hard done by just before the break when Bale thought he had been chopped down inside the area.
Valencia immediately broke up the other end and were awarded a spot-kick when Pepe dived in on Andre Gomes and former Madrid midfielder Parejo converted the resulting penalty.
Madrid were left with a mountain to climb 20 minutes from time when Kovacic recklessly took out Cancelo and was shown a straight red card.
Despite their numerical disadvantage Bale's brilliant looping header from Toni Kroos's free-kick put the visitors back in the driving seat.

Pixars painterly panache

What if you would rather feel like watching the background of the movie rather than what the characters are doing This is exactly how you would feel when you are watching Pixars latest animation The Good Dinosaur.
What if the asteroid which is believed to have killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago missed earth The dinosaurs would continue to flourish as the dominant species on earth. Humans too would make it to the picture but falls in second place.
The film zeros in on an Apatosaurus family who had become farmers overtime. Arlos father, Henry, tells his children they should strive to make their mark, before pressing a mud print onto a silo hes built to protect their crops. Arlos mother, Ida, also makes a print, saying that, one day, the children can do the same. The siblings are instantly able to fulfill their chores, earning their marks. Arlos success is routinely undone by fear.
Comic element
A captivating quality in the movie lies in its simplicity. This is especially evident in the manner in which Arlo is animated. He is an anonymous blob with round, white cartoon eyes, rendered with pointedly little of the painstaking detail that often abounds within even the most fleetingly glimpsed of Pixars creations. The other dinosaurs too are basic in design. T-rex has a square shaped head that seems to jut out from his neck. This adds to the comic element of the film.
The films landscapes are striking. Director Peter Sohn has put in a lot of effort to bring out the beauty of the surroundings. One fine example is the riverbed which Arlo wakes up in. This is detailed in such a manner that you almost feel like you can reach out and grasp the rocks on the screen! This is Pixars painterly panache at its best!
Another strength in The Good Dinosaur lies in the bond between Spot and Arlo. Though they get off to a start similar to that found in How To Train Your Dragon their relationship strengthens as the story develops.
Effective gestures
Theres one sequence in the movie that is awesomely captured. Here Spot and Arlo communicate about their lost families. Spot doesnt speak Arlos language, or have one of his own, so they have to communicate with symbols and body language.
The gestures they choose are effective, cutting straight to the heart of the profound grief that unites them.
The Good Dinosaur is interesting in theory than in reality. Though the film gets off to a great start, the story falls back on similar lines of most Disney tales: an eccentric child who matures with the story, learns to act as a grown up and tackles issues with their parents. Lessons in bravery, loyalty and self-sufficiency come to the fore.
The manner in which Arlo needs to prove his salt to his family reminds us of other animations like Finding Nemo and City Slickers.
This is a straight forward adventure of a dinosaur lost in the forest with no one for company but a dog-like boy named Spot has a lot of heart.
However it is no match for productions like the recent Disney movie Inside Out which carried an out of the box theme.

Readers Poll: The 10 Best Albums of 2015

Adele may have been the artist to recharge record sales in 2015's last quarter, but across all genres, the year had a strong showing for album-length projects. From Courtney Barnett's witty garage-rock to Madonna and Adam Lambert's EDM turns, here is a look at the year's best releases, as voted by our readers.
10. Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp a Butterfly': The most politically-charged release of the year, Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly served as the music world's conscience. For the LP, the Compton-raised rapper went old-school, fusing funk and soul samples into his music as well as guest spots from artists like George Clinton, Thundercat, Snoop Dogg and Ronald Isley. The final product is not only one of the year's most musically consistent releases but also one of its most lyrically powerful as Lamar grapples with his growing fame within a climate growing tense with racial injustice.
9. Adele, 25': Not a murmur was heard from Adele until October of this year, and within only three months she's dominated 2015. Single Hello promised big vocals and even bigger feelings for her third and long-awaited album 25. On her latest, Adele proved that she didn't have to write straightforward break-up songs to tug at the world's heartstrings; she channeled remorse, nostalgia and all the most intricate aspects of falling in love and then losing it.
8. Chris Cornell, Higher Truth': Over the course of his solo career, Soundgarden and Audioslave's Chris Cornell has always teased the flexibility of genre lines  the grunge icon even went Timbaland-assisted dance-pop on his 2009 effort Scream. With Higher Truth, Cornell found comfort in Seventies folk, channeling Led Zeppelin at their most tender for tracks like lead single Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart. The new direction for the powerhouse vocalist worked: Higher Truth contains some of his most intimate and soul-bearing music in years.
7. Muse, Drones': On Drones, space-y arena rockers Muse proved that they don't need EDM tricks to channel the future. The concept album tackles modern warfare and has the band channeling Rush and Pink Floyd; the latter influence especially comes across in the Drill Sergeant interlude that recalls the aggressive teacher from Another Brick in the Wall.
6. Tame Impala, Currents': Psych-rockers Tame Impala moved away from the head and focused on the entire body for fourth album Currents, which saw Kevin Parker have a little fun and even get dance-y.
The synth-heavy LP takes a strong turn into disco territory and is one of Tame Impala's catchiest and most soulful efforts yet. The shift works surprisingly well for Parker as he settles nicely into his pop zone.
5. 5 Seconds of Summer, Sounds Good Feels Good':
5 Seconds of Summer proved to be more than just One Direction's opening act this year, solidifying their fervent fanbase and releasing a strong sophomore LP that revived the fun, irreverent pop-punk of the early Aughts.
With the help of Goldfinger's John Feldmann, Good Charlotte's Benji and Joel Madden and All Time Low's Alex Gaskarth, the Australian quartet became the new princes of style, mixing their irresistible hooks with emotional lyrics and chunky riffs. Singles She's Kinda Hot and Jet Black Heart showcased the powerful dichotomy the band represents to fans, balancing boyish cheekiness with strong messages.
4. Courtney Barnett, Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit': Aussie Courtney Barnett's debut album Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit was this year's most refreshing rock breakthrough, featuring the singer and guitarist rambling smartly above tough riffs. Barnett's performance of her songs was as raw and emotional as the lyrics, and, most important, she proved unafraid of having a little fun in the process. Searing single Pedestrian at Best is the perfect summary of the album's greatest attributes; it's a fiery dose of stream of consciousness lyrics that bursts open with energy.
3. One Direction, Made in the A.M.': If Made in the A.M. is One Direction's final LP, the album is a strong finish for the boys. With four remaining members, 1D went full classic rock on the LP, channeling the Beatles, the Stones and Fleetwood Mac all over the pop-rock collections. It may be their most passionate project yet and is definitely the most cohesive showcase of their identity yet, solidifying the folk-rock path the band launched with 2013 album Midnight Memories and honed further on 2014's Four. Even when channeling their inner Seventies rock gods, One Direction are still pop savants: Single Perfect is a choice slice of bubblegum and perfect response to the Harry Styles-inspired Taylor Swift single Style.
2. Madonna, Rebel Heart': The Queen of Pop went trap and EDM for her latest, which had a rough launch due to an early leak of several tracks. Despite the setback, Rebel Heart was a strong turn for Madonna and had her teaming up with Diplo, Avicii, Kanye West, Travi$ Scott and Ariel Rechtshaid, to name a few, and getting guest features from the likes of Chance the Rapper, Mike Tyson and Nicki Minaj. The album not only gave Madonna a space to experiment with multiple genres at once, but she also assessed her own identity and iconography, as best showcased on playful single Bitch I'm Madonna.
1. Adam Lambert, The Original High': Three years after his excellent dance-pop sophomore effort Trespassing and fresh off a run as the lead singer of Queen, American Idol alum Adam Lambert returned on a high note  in every sense  with his house- and funk-inflected album The Original High.
The singer, whose vocals are as massive as his performances, teamed up with elite pop producers Max Martin and Shellback on the LP and got assists from Talking Body singer and newcomer Tove Lo as well as Queen's Brian May along the way.
Led by singles Ghost Town and Another Lonely Night, Lambert achieved a balance of club fun with raw emotion on the solid album.

Respect the people's mandate, JVP tells govt
It is abundantly clear today that the government is trying to kick the people's mandate and portray a new constitution as a panacea for all ills in the country, JVP publicity secretary, parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said.
"This is all an attempt to deceive the masses of this country," he said.
Herath expressed these sentiments addressing a press conference at the JVP headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
He said framing of a new constitution was a timely need.
"Executive powers of the President should be totally abolished in the new constitution. But we see all this as an attempt to postpone solutions to people's problems by sweeping them under the carpet by narrowing everything to the conclusion that a new constitution would solve all burning problems," Herath said.
"Therefore, we request the government to understand the people's mandate given against political prostitution in this country and fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people who returned it to power," he said.
"The JVP would therefore organise a massive people's protest rally at Nugegoda on January 8 to pressurise the government to honour the people's mandate given in support of good governance," Herath said.
He said all civil society organisations, intellectuals, artistes and others who were responsible to bring this government to power will join hands with the JVP to hold this rally.
Herath said the JVP requested all to participate in the rally to reverse the wrong course of action taken by the government.

On the road to democracy

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan visits Sri Lanka at a time when Pakistan has emerged from out of the dark clouds that once encircled it. From 2004 onwards Pakistan faced attack from Taliban forces. Militants ruled the tribal regions, seized Dir and Swat, and threatened the writ of the state across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The invasions were by militant units big enough to assault military outposts. It was only by mid 2011 that Pakistan was able to secure itself against Taliban. But serious violence continued until the Peshawar School attack that killed over 150 persons most of whom were children and Jinnah International Terminal of Karachi Airport, which resulted in the killing of 28 airport security personnel in 2014.
When I visited Pakistan three years ago in 2012, to Karachi to attend a conference at the university there, the sense of a fragile society continued to exist. The foreigners taking part in the conference were advised not to leave the campus premises on their own. However, even during that difficult period, the academic community in Pakistan was prepared to discuss the concept of federal government along with politicians and share it with their students.
One of the issues discussed was the transfer of powers from the central government to the provincial governments. The pride of Pakistan at that time was the 18th Amendment to the Pakistan constitution which was passed into law in 2010. This amendment reduced the powers of the presidency, including the President's power to dissolve Parliament unilaterally. This was like Sri Lanka's own 19th Amendment that came five years later in 2015 under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and which reduced the powers of the presidency.
18th Amendment
Senator Mian Raza Rabbani who is considered as the architect of the 18th Amendment addressed the conference in his capacity as chief guest and said, "We can learn and understand various concepts. We looked at several constitutions of countries with a federal system including Switzerland, Germany and Canada when drafting the 18th Amendment. But at the end of the day it came down to home-grown solutions." Senator Rabbani said the amendment had given rise to federalism in Pakistan. "Seventeen ministries have been devolved. After 1947 it is perhaps the biggest structural change in our governmental machinery. It is not a perfect document - it has its ups and downs."
Other changes made by the 18th Amendment in Pakistan, were that courts would no longer endorse suspensions of the constitution, a judicial commission would appoint judges, and the president would no longer be able to appoint the head of the Election Commission. It is therefore ironic that the 18th Amendment in Sri Lanka, which was also passed in 2010 by the former government headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and which centralized powers in the presidency was very much the reverse of the 18th Amendment in Pakistan.
Democratic governance
As a country that continues to battle terrorism that comes from beyond its borders as well as within the country, Pakistan has more reason than Sri Lanka to fear the weakening of its central government. But the more enlightened political leaders of Pakistan realized that the powers of government are meant to be shared at the level of the provinces and not centralised and that it is the legitimacy that accompanies the system of shared governance that will best keep Pakistan together.
When I visited Karachi again in December last year, the security situation was much better than when I visited in 2012. This time I was able to visit the city without a sense of insecurity. I had a university student accompany me. But this was as a translator and guide. Walking the streets of Karachi was not too dissimilar to being in any big Indian city. I could not speak the language but felt at home in a similar cultural milieu especially in the bazaars and shops. I experienced the cordiality that Pakistanis, and indeed most South Asians, feel for Sri Lankans. Whenever I said I was from Sri Lanka, I felt more warmly treated. In the university I found an interest in Sri Lanka's transition process, both from war to peace, and from authoritarian to democratic governance.
Like Sri Lanka, Pakistan too has a democratically elected government where the former government handed over power to the new one in 2013 after a tightly contested election in which the elections were still fair enough for change to happen. But unlike Sri Lanka this democratically elected government has to share power with the military.
This was evident even within the University of Karachi premises. Units of the Pakistan army rangers, who are responsible for law and order in Karachi, are housed within the university campus in the hostels. The students have to find their housing outside of the university, while the army is inside.
However, credit for Karachi's improved security situation is given to the Pakistan army rangers. The fact that the army is not governing the country directly, and is ensuring security, has improved the military's image amongst the people.
Those in government are the ones who have to make political compromises and take decisions that benefit some at the expense of others. Where there is poverty and scarcity of resources those who are in government will tend to become unpopular. This applied to the army when it directly ruled the country.
There was a confidence in those I met that Pakistan is too strong a state to fall to ISIS or Taliban or any party with an extremist ideology. The system of public administration and democracy left by the departing British colonial power is very strong in all of the South Asian countries, including Sri Lanka that the British once governed.
The Pakistani elite, and also its military, are strongly networked with the Western-led international community. This is also the international community that Sri Lanka has rejoined after the change of government.
Economic projects
The visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Sri Lanka comes at a time when Pakistan's relations with India show signs of improving. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goodwill visit to Pakistan last week to meet with Prime Minister Sharif was symbolic of the acceptance by both countries that they need to improve their relations. Both are democracies, both have a common South Asian ethos, and both have vast numbers of poor people whose lives could be transformed if all the money that is spent on weaponry against each other is devoted to improve the lives of the masses. Both of these countries have warm ties with Sri Lanka.
While they improve their own relations with each other, and are willing to give their people visas to visit each country more freely, Sri Lanka can offer its services as a venue for meetings, conferences, people-to-people exchanges and, hopefully also, joint economic projects that can benefit the masses of people.

Season to be silly and Santa- mentally merry

It is the season to be silly and Santa-mentally merry. And there isnt any reason why we all must be permitted to display a bit of asinine over-indulgence. Yes Christmas and the New Year may have bypassed us but the jolly seasonal spirit lingers on.
Those of us who celebrated both major events would have probably been knee-deep in wrapping paper. The best of all gifts around any Christmas tree is the presence of a happy family all wrapped up in one another. Very unlike those folks who get all wrapped up in themselves, who sure do make insignificant packages.
Besides, on the subject of wrapping you have got to hand it to the ladies. Anyone who believes that men are the equal of women has never seen a man trying to wrap a seasonal present. Christmas, I say is an occasion that divides itself in two parts. The one is the divine part and other, the wine part. However, the real spirit and fun solely depends on what you fancy more.
As for me it seemed all rather conducive for a bit of annual meditative thinking. I was contemplating philosophically about the four stages of man during the holiday season. My truth-seeking mission and sedate mind conjured it all up with brilliant perception, even if I say so myself. There are of course some clauses attached to my theory of the successive ages of mankind which logically goes like this: (1) You believe in Santa Claus. (2) You dont believe in Santa Claus. (3) You look like Santa Claus. (4). You are Santa Claus.
Even so it seems as if I have had a hard day at the office every time the holiday season comes round. I do all the durable work and start giving with all the altruism I can muster. But for what earthly reason may I ask
Because the mythical fat slob with the ridiculous hot red suit, the red extended beanie -style hat, with pom -poms gets all the credit. The holiday season is a time of rich meals and decadent treats, and the continuous seasonal music that assails you wherever you go. And every Christmas without fail my friend Boyd sings this twisted parody of Its the Most Wonderful Time of the Year to the hilarious Its the Most Fattening Time of the Year.
People can be so unfair at times even during the season of good cheer. The cops especially have no sense of fair play or humour either. If you are singing Christmas songs on your neighbours lawn at night with your church group, its called carol singing. But if youre doing it alone on the street wearing a Santa outfit, or no outfit at all, its called drunk and disorderly or indecent exposure.
And they have the temerity to say that Santa has gone nuts. And that he is displaying naked aggression.
That hes hallucinating. They call it the Santa Insanity Clause. So they frog-march you to the cop-shop while you switch to baila with the popular local hit Ralahamy Mung polisiyay, Ralahama Mung. Ok I will admit that the cops do throw a blanket or a rain-cape around you when you are nabbed in an unclothed state in public.
But they dont actually do so through compassion or to keep you warm from the cold snap of the Christmas breezes either. I suspect they do it because they dont want to suffer an inferiority complex for the rest of the season.
Personally speaking, I have found that the holiday season is a time when everybody I know wants his past forgotten and his present remembered. Every time during the season to be silly, a good many usually sedate people are transformed into supreme swingers whose excesses transcend a lifestyle wilder than those enjoyed by decadent rock stars all set for a raucous roll.
For instance for the last 40-years on the day before Christmas my friend Joy wakes up with a monumental hangover and annoys his buxom wife Eve with the exasperating greeting: Its Christmas..... Eve! And the same Joy at the Christmas lunch never fails to talk turkey. He makes this public plea to Father Christmas: Dear Santa, please can I have a really fat bank balance and a slim woman. Please dont mix these two up just like you did last Christmas.
In Christmas past, during my teenage years, I recollect that a cheeky girl wrote on a balloon, Will you propose to me I immediately popped the balloon and question with a single flourish of my lighted cigarette. Bang! Sorted!
Christmas makes me happy no matter what time of year it comes around. Now that is the true spirit of Christmas. But on Christmas Eve I had presents all beautifully gift-wrapped, even for people I need to get even with this season. Last year I gave one to my exasperating bald-headed colleague Eustace. It was a comb. He opened his gift and didnt even flinch. All he said was: Thanks! Ill never part with it!
And there was my bachelor friend Paulie who stood at the main entrance and asked a woman doctor he has fancied for several years: What would it take to make you kiss me under the mistletoe She brushed past him adroitly with the cutting scalpel-like answer: An anaesthetic!
In my estimation there is nothing as mean as giving a little child something useful for Christmas. I mean who needs educational toys unless they are fun to boot. Gifts such as clothing are not considered gifts, they are basic parental obligations.
Now you might ask what the Dickens Im talking about. Let me enlighten you that its about those modern day Scrooges, the selfish tightwad misers in our society. Our kids have a notoriously famous granduncle named Kulasinghe.
They have nicknamed him Kunu-singhe and with good reason. He once bought them a set of batteries for Christmas with a note on it explaining: Toys not included!
Remember, if Christmas isnt found in your heart, you wont find it under a tree. To all you readers out there lets get a tad nonsensical! Im still under the mistletoe wearing a reindeer Rudolf head-dress. So kiss me on the flaming nose! A Merry extended Christmas and New Year everybody!

Sri Lanka Youth netball skipper Gayani does Danture proud
Gayani Dissanayake from the remote village of Danture in the electorate of Yatinuwara did her village proud when she captained the Sri Lanka netball team which won the Asian Youth netball championship for 2015.
She stands at 6 feet two inches having the ideal height for a game like netball where high passes could bemuse the defence in addition to the advantage of shooting or collecting the rebounds. Her dedication to the game is so much that she even shifted from a Kandy school to a Colombo School to continue her netball and also to attend national practices as she found travelling from her village to Colombo very tedious.
Gayani Dissanayake is just 21 years and took to netball when she was attending Girls High School and caught the eye of the selectors as in school matches she towered above the rest. She felt that she had a future in netball. At the age of 15 she attended Visakha Vidyalaya which won many schools netball titles and she played a key role in them.
While still at school she had to play for the junior and later for the Senior National team. She humbly admitted she was not the tallest in the team and there was others like Tharijini Sivalingam standing at 6 feet 8 inches who did the shooting. She also did the shooting at times. Shooting is not only height. You will have the most important at all- football and she paid more attention to this. Our girls have the speed and skills to upset any opponent. Regional we are one of the best or if not the best.
Just see me I am from the village of Danture and I made the mark because I attended schools in Kandy and Colombo and of course my coaches honed my skills and the credit should go them as well. There is talent in the villages which must be tapped to fill our larder.
Gayani Dissanayake plays in the dual position of Goal Keep and Goal Defence in netball parlance it is known as GA and GD. Playing as goal defence she defends her territory by stopping the high passes and also collecting the rebounds.
She played for the national team from 2010 onwards including the World Cup 2015 played in Sydney, Australia. Some of her other national representations are Asian Championship played in Singapore in 2012 and 2014. She has played in 3 Junior Asiads  2012 in India, 2013 in Brunei and 2015 in Hong Kong. The year 2015 was an unforgettable one as under her captaincy won the championship title.
She also represented Sri Lanka at the Nations Cup netball championship from 2010.. to 2013. This was when she was preparing for GCE O/L and A/L Examinations. At the 2013 Nations Cup she was adjudged the Most Valuable Player. Fully immersed in netball she rose higher and higher and produced some sparkling displays and she was awarded World Ranking No 4 in Defence at the Conclusion of World Cup 2015 in Australia.
Just imagine a village girl from the remote village of Danture getting a World ranking. This means if there is a world team she could make it. She is very young and agile with age and height on her side she has the potential to bring more honours to mother Lanka with the passage of time.

Toulouse beaten as Nonu's Toulon edge Smith's Pau

PARIS, SUNDAY: Champions Stade Francais scored a dramatic late try in an 18-17 win over Toulouse in France's Top 14 on Sunday after Ma'a Nonu's Toulon had beaten Conrad Smith's Pau earlier in the day.
The defeat denied Toulouse a chance to go clear at the summit of the Top 14, although they left Paris with a losing bonus point that leaves them locked in a three-way tie on 38 points at the top of the table with Racing 92 and Clermont.
Stade Francais' New Zealand-born fullback Paul Williams was the man of the moment after touching down in the 78th minute in what was a stunning turnaround.
Hugo Bonneval had brought the Parisians back into the running with a fine try in the 63rd minute on a blustery night in the capital.
But Toulouse will be kicking themselves after going ahead through Alexis Palisson as early as the fourth minute.
Sebastien Bezy scored four penalties in all for the visitors but Jules Plisson's two penalties and a conversion helped secure an unlikely victory for Stade, who have struggled to repeat the form that saw them win the Top 14 last season.
"I would be lying if I said I wasn't relieved and extremely satisfied to win that match," said Stade manager Gonzalo Quesada.
Title contenders Toulon recovered from last week's chastening defeat at Toulouse with a nervy 21-17 victory at home to Pau.
Wallaby wing James O'Connor scored tries in both halves with Georgian lock Konstantin Mikautadze also crossing for Toulon, while full-back Tom Taylor added a pair of penalties.
However, the three-time reigning European champions were forced to stave off a late Pau comeback inspired by World Cup-winning All Blacks pair Smith and Colin Slade as the visitors scored 14 unanswered points only to fall just short.
With three pivotal European Champions Cup games, two against Bath and a home tie with Wasps, to come later this month, it was a welcome win that pushed Toulon back up to fourth as Pau claimed a losing bonus point.
"We're going to try to be positive and remember the win but we're certainly not happy with parts of our performance," said Toulon head coach Bernard Laporte.
"Two years ago that's a game we would have lost. We won and that's the most important thing. We have an important month of January, starting next Sunday against Bath. It's up to us to deliver."
Toulon, routed 31-8 at Toulouse last time out, fell behind early as fly-half Slade sent over a third-minute penalty for Pau, who entered the weekend in 11th place and drop below Stade Francais to 12th.
But Taylor, another ex-New Zealand international, responded moments later with a penalty of his own to level at 3-3.

Wawrinka gets ready for Australian Open in India's Chennai

CHENNAI, SUNDAY: French Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka is looking to give himself the best possible preparation for the first Grand Slam of 2016 in Melbourne later this month by winning the ATP Chennai Open, which starts on Tuesday.
The Swiss is bidding for his third consecutive Chennai Open title and hopes a victory in India will help propel him to another major win, just as it did in 2014 and 2015.
Two years ago Wawrinka clinched his first Slam when he won the Australian Open just weeks after triumphing in southern India. Last year, Wawrinka followed up victory in Chennai by taking home the trophy at Roland Garros in June.
"I've always enjoyed coming to Chennai. The tournament is a nice way to start the season, the fans are great and I like the atmosphere in the stadium," the 30-year-old said in comments released by organisers.
"2015 has been an amazing year and 2016 is already around the corner. I want to continue to do well, win tournaments, and go deep at the Slams. And hopefully I get a great start into the season in Chennai again," he added.
Wawrinka, ranked fourth in the world, also won in Chennai in 2011 and is the top seed in the $480,000 tournament.
His closest challenger is likely to be number two seed Kevin Anderson. The big-serving South African has a 4-4 record against Wawrinka but says he's not thinking too much about his opponents.
"I typically try to focus on my own game and I know if I do that and execute, I can beat anyone," said the world number 12.
The final of the Chennai Open takes place on Sunday.
The Australian Open in Melbourne runs from January 18 to 31.
Seedings:
1. Stanislas Wawrinka (SUI)
2. Kevin Anderson (RSA)
3. Benoit Paire (FRA)
4. Roberto Bautista Agut (ESP)
5. Guillermo Garcia-Lopez (ESP)
6. Gilles Muller (LUX)
7. Vasek Pospisil (CAN)

Williams out of Hopman opener with swollen knee

PERTH, MONDAY: World number one Serena Williams suffered an early season injury setback on Monday as she withdrew from her opening Hopman Cup tie with inflammation in her knee.
Williams, 34, was scheduled to play Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the women's singles on Monday morning in Perth, Australia, but she pulled out just minutes before the start.
The match at the mixed-teams tournament was to launch Williams' preparation for her title defence at the Australian Open in Melbourne later this month.
Williams, who has won 21 Grand Slam singles titles, sat out the tail-end of last season saying she needed "time to heal" after narrowly missing out on a rare calendar-year Grand Slam.
But she said the knee problem was only minor and hoped to be fit to play in the United States' second tie against Australia Gold, one of two teams representing the hosts, on Tuesday evening.
"I'm disappointed to not take the court in Perth today," Williams said. "I had every intention to play this morning.
"Unfortunately due to inflammation in my knee I need to rest and am confident to be out there against Aussie Gold tomorrow evening."
Williams won her sixth Australian Open last January and was on target for the coveted calendar-year Grand Slam until she suffered a shock loss to Roberta Vinci in the semi-finals at the US Open in September.
She was replaced on Monday by fellow American Vicky Duval, 20, who returned to tennis in August after overcoming Hodgkin's lymphoma and has a career high ranking of 87.
