Spieth predicts victory while McIlroy eyes key win
CHASKA, FRIDAY: Jordan Spieth predicted victory alongside Patrick Reed over Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson in Friday's opening Ryder Cup match while Rory McIlroy said a win would carry extra importance.
The 41st biennial US-Europe team golf showdown begins Friday at Hazeltine with four morning alternate shot foursomes matches, with Spieth and Reed out first for the Americans.
We believe in ourselves and we will go out there and get our job done and put a point on the board for the United States, Spieth said. So we have got a huge match ahead of us.
Olympic champion Rose of England and British Open champion Stenson of Sweden went 3-0 in 2014 to spark Europe's third victory in a row, sixth in seven tries and eighth in the past 10 Cups.
We've got a great pairing and they put a lot of faith in Jordan and Patrick, Rose said. They are incredibly tenacious competitors. It's going to be one of our strongest pairings versus one of theirs.
Rose has the first tension-packed shot off the first tee. It's a moment to try and enjoy the best you can, Rose said. It's clearly nerve-wracking and it's not a moment you can really prepare for.
Reed and Spieth went unbeaten together in 2014 Cup debuts and sparked each other.
I'm pumped. It's just so exciting, Reed said. I have so much adrenaline going through myself right now I just can't wait to get started.
McIlroy, coming off a Tour Championship victory and US PGA playoff crown, joins handpicked partner Andy Sullivan, a Cup newcomer from England, against US favorites Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler. You've got the two most popular Americans out there. Tough match, McIlroy said. It's an important match. That match is worth nearly more than one point for Europe, because if we can beat their two most popular players, that's an early blow for them.
If we play the way we've been playing, stick to our game plan and execute the way we know we can, that will be huge.
Sullivan doesn't lack for confidence, saying, When you've got someone like Rory McIlroy standing next to you, you feel like $1 million.
Fowler says his and Mickelson's games mesh, despite only one Cup match together.
We bring out a really good energy in each other, Fowler said.
We tend to bring out each other's best more times than not. That's what you want, especially in alternate shot.
Other matches send Americans Zach Johnson and Jimmy Walker against Spain's Sergio Garcia and Germany's Martin Kaymer while Americans Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar meet England's Lee Westwood, making his 10th Cup start, and Belgian Thomas Pieters, making his first.
It evoked a 2012 four-ball pairing where Westwood and Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts beat Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker 1 up.
I like playing with these Belgians that shoot 10-under, Westwood said. No pressure.
Among those sitting out the first session is Masters champion Danny Willett, the Cup newcomer from England whose brother wrote an internet article insulting US fans. AFP

Hamilton fights back in Malaysia
SEPANG, FRIDAY: Lewis Hamilton turned the tables on world championship leader Nico Rosberg, giving himself a badly-needed boost with the fastest lap in second free practice Friday for the Malaysian Grand Prix.
Rosberg has been in dominant form over the past three races, winning them all to turn a 19-point deficit into an eight-point lead in the title race.
But his Mercedes team-mate and the reigning world champion Hamilton lapped the 5.543km of the Sepang circuit in 1min 34.944sec on his soft-tyre qualifying simulation run, 0.244sec quicker than the German.
With the sun heating the newly laid track to a blistering 58 degrees Celsius (136 Fahrenheit), Hamilton proved most adept at getting the best from his tyres in the harsh conditions. Hamilton surprisingly also went faster on the hard tyres that must be used for at least one stint during Sunday's race than Rosberg managed on the supposedly quicker medium compound.
After losing more than half of his set-up time to mechanical problems in practice two weeks ago in Singapore, Hamilton would have been delighted to get two almost completely untroubled sessions under his belt on Friday.
He managed to clock up 35 largely untroubled laps during the afternoon with Rosberg running for one lap further.
Ferrari were the next best in the classification, with last year's winner Sebastian Vettel third fastest in 1:35.605 followed by Kimi Raikkonen.
Birthday celebration
Late in the session birthday boy Max Verstappen, who turned 19 on Friday, gave himself something to celebrate by pushing up to fifth behind the Ferraris with a lap of 1:36.037.
But the other Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo was relegated to eighth place as the Force India of Sergio Perez and the McLaren of Fernando Alonso went sixth and seventh fastest respectively.
Alonso was using an upgraded engine package from Honda which means he will incur penalties that will drop him to last on the grid in Sunday's race.
He will use his old engine for the race, saving the more powerful new unit for next week's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, the home race of McLaren's Honda engine suppliers. Earlier Rosberg had been quickest in morning practice on soft tyres but Hamilton did not manage a clean flying lap on the same set-up and was 0.494sec adrift, though that lap was set on the slower medium compound.
The morning session had been brought to a dramatic halt after just 11 minutes when Kevin Magnussen's Renault burst into flames in the pit lane.
Magnussen, who had returned with smoke coming from his engine cover after just one lap, was forced to leap to safety when fire broke out outside the Renault garage. Pit crew were quickly on the scene with extinguishers but the session was delayed for 15 minutes.
Renault engineers managed to get the Danish driver back out for the afternoon session after frantic repairs, and he came in 19th fastest. AFP

Ibrahimovic gets Man Utd moving in Europa League
MANCHESTER, THURSTAN: Zlatan Ibrahimovic headed in a 69th-minute winner as Manchester United got their Europa League campaign off the ground with a laboured 1-0 home win over Zorya Luhansk on Thursday.
Beaten 1-0 at Feyenoord in their Group A opener, Jose Mourinhos side struggled to break down their unadventurous Ukrainian opponents until the introduction from the bench of Wayne Rooney.
The England captains mishit shot was headed in by Ibrahimovic to leave United a point behind group leaders Fenerbahce, who visit Old Trafford on October 20.
It was difficult, said Mourinho. We had our chances in the first half. We could have scored and it would have been a different match. But we didnt.
They kept organised and had plenty of players behind the ball, but with players ready to do something on the counter-attack. It was difficult and we needed to win.
One week, three defeats. One week, three victories. But I was not depressed by the defeats and I am not over the moon with three wins.
It was a far from fluent United performance, but it maintained their upturn in form following the recent run of three straight defeats that had destroyed their early-season momentum.
Zorya, UEFA group-phase debutants, became Uniteds 100th continental opponents and they threatened to create a sensation when Zeljko Ljubenovic ballooned over from Ivan Petriaks cut-back.
In the main, though, they sat back, packing men behind the ball in a 4-5-1 formation, and United struggled to play through them.
Ibrahimovic had a shot deflected wide by Dmytro Grechyshkin, but as in last Saturdays 4-1 win over league champions Leicester City, the hosts looked most threatening from corners in the first half.
With Daley Blind rested, Juan Mata took over set-piece duties.
From one of the Spaniards deliveries, Paul Pogba flicked on and Marcus Rashford rattled a shot against the bar, the ball bouncing down a foot short of the line.
Paulinho chances
From another, Marouane Fellaini headed into the ground and over. In between, Mata headed off-target from a Pogba cross and Jesse Lingard saw a header blocked by Rafael Forster. Just as he had in the first half, Ljubenovic set Uniteds hearts fluttering early in the second when he narrowly failed to make contact with a cross from Olexandr Karavaev.
Indeed, it was the visitors who registered the matchs first shot on target, substitute Paulinho obliging United goalkeeper Sergio Romero to leap to his left and palm the ball behind.
Mourinho turned to Rooney, who had started on the bench for the second game running, and within two minutes the United captain had played a part -- albeit an unintentional one -- in the decisive goal.
Released by Mata, Timothy-Fosu Mensah cut the ball back from the byline on the right towards Rooney. The United number 10 miscued his volley, directing the ball into the ground and away from goal, but Ibrahimovic rose at the back post to nod a close-range header over the line.
It was the Swedes sixth goal in 10 United appearances. AFP
