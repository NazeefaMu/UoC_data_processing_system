No fighter jet deal with Pakistan

The Sri Lankan government has denied reports that it has struck a deal with Pakistan for the purchase of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
The matter did not even come up for discussion during the talks with the Pakistani government, Karunasena Hettiarachchi, Defence Secretary, told adding that his government was still considering the purchase of fighter jets.
Terming the reports as incorrect, Mahishini Colonne, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responded, saying that if there arises a requirement for Sri Lanka to procure aircraft of this nature, in keeping with the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka to maintain transparency, expressions of interest will be called for, from all concerned. According to the reports, Sri Lanka has been under pressure from the Indian government not to go ahead. Sections of the press, in the last few months, also carried reports that India had offered to Sri Lanka Tejas, a variant of Light Combat Aircraft, to counter Pakistans bid to sell JF-17 fighters, which were developed in collaboration with China.

Big B was initially offered the role by director Shankar
Rajinikanth and Amitabh Bachchan are both very big names in the Indian film industry. While Rajinikanth rules Kollywood, Big B has inspired a lot of people in B-town. What is as awesome as their cine careers is their great friendship and it seems that an epic opportunity to see these two veterans together on screen was thwarted.
Amitabh Bachchan has revealed that he was approached by the Kollywood big-shot director Shankar to play villain opposite Rajini in the 2010 film Enthiran. But Big B was advised against playing the role by the Superstar.
Here is what the yesteryear's angry young man was quoted as saying,"Shankar had come to me and he wanted me to play the villain (in 'Enthiran'). I called Rajini.

Birthday girl Deepika Padukone is the most bankable actress in Bollywood
She has ruled 2015 and with 2016 starting Deepika plans to scale more heights. The box office queen has come a long way since she has debuted in 2007.
Eight years and 21 films down the line, Deepika Padukone has achieved a lot. She has delivered amazing performances in many films, won many awards, has been critically acclaimed many times and also been tagged as the top actress of the year for two years in a succession. And as she turns 30, she has now achieved the prestigious tag of being the most bankable actress from the present generation of actresses. We analyse her career graph and this is what our trade expert had to say!
Talking about how she has evolved as an actress, exhibitor and distributor, Akshaye Rathi mentioned, "I must admit that when she started off in Om Shanti Om, Chandni Chowk To China and Lafangey Parindey, going by the performances in a couple of films earlier down in her career, I never thought in my wildest imagination that she would become the actress and the star that she is.
If you see her performances, then and now, you see a mark and clear difference in the efforts she has taken to raise the standards of her performance. She has now brought it to a level where she is nothing but the best."
But it's just not about evolution, it is about her performance, her choice of films and her box office appeal too. Ranveer Singh's ladylove has delivered 10 hits from Race 2 (2013) to Bajirao Mastani (2015).
As Akshaye added, "In terms of performance, in terms of bankability, she is the actress currently. You have to give credit to her as she has become the best superstar amongst the ladies that we have in the industry currently.
There are a lot of people who are talented and there are a lot of people who work really hard and she is a combination of both. This is what makes her the true superstar that she is because every film that you see now, be it Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani or a complete contrast film like a Bajirao Mastani, to a completely different zone like Race 2 to a Finding Fanny, in that sense if you her versatility and box office appeal, the combination is lethal.
If she continues to tap in to films like these, which are a fantastic balance of performance-driven films and box office appeal, I think she is going to maintain her position as the reigning superstar among the ladies!"
She has ruled 2015 and with 2016 starting Deepika plans to scale more heights. We wish her all the best and we hope that she continues her hit-run at the box office.

England get scare before Test ends in draw
Le Cap, Wednesday: England were given a scare before the second Test against South Africa ended in a draw on the fifth and final day at Newlands on Wednesday.
On what had been expected to be a low-key day after high scoring in the first innings, England lost six second innings wickets by mid-afternoon, when they held a precarious lead of 118.
Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali negotiated the rest of the afternoon and England were on 159 for six when play was called off for bad light 15 minutes after tea and abandoned 45 minutes later.
England will take a one-lead into the third Test of the four-match series, starting in Johannesburg on January 14 but South Africa will take heart from a strong fightback with both bat and ball after taking a battering in England's first innings.
Inspired by Ben Stokes' 258, England made 629 for six declared but South Africa batted solidly to reply with 627 declared, led by captain Hashim Amla's 201.
The flurry of wickets on Wednesday was in complete contrast to the first four days when both teams scored more than 600 runs in their first innings and 1272 runs were scored for the loss of only 13 wickets.
After four days of unrelenting sunshine, the sky was partly overcast on Wednesday.
The fast bowlers, led by Morne Morkel, gained some movement, while off-spinner Dane Piedt obtained some turn from a pitch which had previously offered no assistance to the bowlers.
Piedt was the most successful bowler, taking three for 38.
Alastair Cook and Alex Hales fell within the first three overs of the day, both without adding to their overnight scores of eight and five respectively, while Joe Root was bowled just before the mid-morning drinks break. Nick Compton fell shortly before lunch. Cook, who has scored only 42 runs in four innings during the series, was caught down the leg side by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off Kagiso Rabada and Hales fell to an outstanding catch by Chris Morris at third slip, diving low to his right, off Morne Morkel.
Root made 29 off 29 balls before he was bowled by Morris' first ball of the innings, a full delivery which swung late to take out his off stump.
Root had an escape on 17 when he edged a catch to AB de Villiers at second slip off Morkel, only for a television review to show it was a no-ball.
Compton dug in and played a solid defensive innings in making 15 off 60 balls.
It came as a surprise when he went on the drive against a full delivery from off-spinner Dane Piedt and hit a catch to Faf du Plessis at a short mid-on position.
England seemed to be heading to safety after lunch as Taylor and Stokes added 30 for the fifth wicket, with Stokes following up his first innings of 258 with some more solidly-hit strokes. AFP

Indonesian passengers stung by delay due to bee on plane
INDONESIA: A bee delayed an Indonesian passenger plane for four hours after getting stuck in vital equipment and causing a problem with the aircraft's controls, the airline said Wednesday.
The flight, operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda, was scheduled to take off Tuesday morning from the western island of Sumatra and head for Jakarta.
But the pilot of the Boeing 737, which was carrying 156 passengers, decided not to take off after noticing a problem with the controls, according to Garuda.
"An investigation found that the incident occurred because the plane's electronic engine control suffered a technical problem after an insect got into a pitot tube," airline spokesman Benny Butarbutar said in a statement.
"Due to safety concerns, Garuda Indonesia decided to delay the flight."
Another Garuda official confirmed it was a bee that became trapped in the pitot tube, a vital piece of equipment which measures airspeed. The airline did not say whether the bee survived the ordeal. After being repaired, the plane took off and landed safely in Jakarta on Tuesday afternoon. Butarbutar insisted the incident was beyond the airline's control, but said that passengers had nevertheless been given money as compensation.
It is not the first time an errant bee has caused an aviation incident.
Last June, British budget airline Flybe was forced to abandon a flight shortly after take-off when a bee became lodged in an instrument. The latest bee delay emerged as beleaguered carrier Malaysia Airlines announced it was reversing a decision to restrict check-in luggage for some Europe-bound flights due to "unseasonably strong headwinds".
The U-turn came after the move, nnounced Tuesday, baffled aviation analysts, with one describing it as "ludicrous".

Kusal's absence was the biggest blow - Jayaratne
The absence of impulsive opener Kusal Perera from the Sri Lankan batting line-up had an adverse effect on Sri Lanka's overall performance in the five-match One-Day International series which they lost 1-3 to New Zealand.
"The biggest blow I believe for the country and myself was Kusal's absence. I did not get much of the explosive starts," said Sri Lanka interim head coach Jerome Jayaratne.
"Kusal brings a new dimension to the game. He just hits bowlers off their line and then even if he gets out we tend to continue that momentum going forward from that point. That's how we won against West Indies and he became the man of the series."
Not only was Perera missing from the Lankan one-day line-up but also one of the most destructive one-day fast bowler's Lasith Malinga.
"I would believe their absence was badly felt. However there was no looking back we had to move forward and had to do our best to compete with what was available to us," said Jayaratne.
Perera was sent home after being tested positive for a banned drug prior to the commencement of the Test series and Malinga failed to recover from a knee injury and never made it to New Zealand.
Kithuruwan Vithanage and Thisara Perera replaced Perera and Malinga respectively in the ODI squad.
Perera and Malinga will not be available also for the two-match T20 Internationals commencing at Mount Manganui today.
Having lost the first two ODIs to New Zealand, Sri Lanka bounced back to win the third at Nelson on a pitch that suited their bowling style. Unfortunately for them the fourth game also scheduled at the same venue was ruined by bad weather and Sri Lanka required to win the fifth and last ODI played at Mount Maunganui.
They came in with a chance of doing so but only to lose by 36 runs with 17 balls to spare.
"To be honest we could have sneaked a win and squared the series if we played smarter cricket with a little patience," said Jayaratne.
"We always seem to lose wickets early on. We lost three wickets in the first ten overs. The three matches we were defeated in this series we lost 3 to 5 wickets in the first 10 overs with the new ball.
"This was never the plan, the plan was not to lose wickets in the first 10 overs with the new ball even if we don't have much runs. The plan always was to build a good foundation, keep wickets in hand and then assess the situation and accelerate or launch as per the requirements of the match demands," he said.
"We knew we could be competitive in the series as we have many natural stroke players however the mental skill of many still seems below of what is required at international level.
"Also the question comes up have these players been in situations enough like they faced in the current series and have the experience to see the game to the very end."
Jayaratne said what the national team lacked in New Zealand was 'maturity'.
"Does our domestic cricket harness and produce International material to compete at this level," queried Jayaratne. "International competition is not a playground to learn the game you need to perform like what other countries produce or else like this tour one would have to pay the price in most instances."
Rating the overall performance Jayaratne said, "To be honest in our current situation we have a long way to go if we are to compete with countries such as Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, India and Pakistan.
"At present our inexperience is showing at this level. In both the Tests and ODI's on this current tour we showed that after being in very good situations many of our players could not land the final blow and nail the game".

New Zealand score tight win over Sri Lanka in Twenty20
New Zealand held their nerve to beat Sri Lanka by three runs in their Twenty20 international against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui on Thursday.

Chasing the Black Caps' 182-4 in front of a full house of 7845 spectators at the Bay Oval, the visitors finished at 179-9 in the first game of a two-match series.

Left-hander Milinda Siriwardana looked poised to steer Sri Lanka home but fell to a sliding catch on the mid-wicket boundary by Mitchell McClenaghan off Trent Boult after reaching 42 off 31 balls at number six.

The tourists needed 19 off the last two overs before paceman Mitchell McClenaghan went for just six off the penultimate over. Grant Elliott was then entrusted with the final over and did the job.

Boult took 3-21 at his home ground for the victors to take Man of the Match honours.

Earlier, Martin Guptill's dominance of the Sri Lankan bowlers continued apace as the New Zealand opener thumped 58 off 34 balls.

Guptill, who made 331 runs at an average of 82.75 in the just-completed one-day series, struck four sixes and four fours before being run out in the 11th over as the hosts piled the pressure on Sri Lanka from the outset.

He and stand-in skipper Kane Williamson put on 101 for the first wicket in 10.5 overs as Williamson made 53 off 42 deliveries, striking five fours and a six.

Sri Lanka's spinners had marginally more success in slowing New Zealand's run-rate but the visitors missed a chance to get rid of Guptill when he should have been run out when on 32 after being stranded by his batting partner. Williamson also had a close shave when he french-cut a delivery off Suranga Lakmal when on 30.

Williamson and Colin Munro scored singles off 22 consecutive balls before the usually explosive Munro broke the sequence with a six and a reverse-hit for four prior to Williamson's dismissal.

Corey Anderson's return to action after a long spell sidelined by injury lasted only three balls but Munro made 36 off 25 balls (two sixes and two fours) while Ross Taylor added 22 off nine balls.

Nuwan Kulasekera was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers with 2-26 off his four overs.

New Zealand were sent into bat by Sri Lankan T20 skipper Dinesh Chandimal, as his team-mate Angelo Mathews did in the one-dayer won by New Zealand at the same Bay Oval venue on Tuesday.

In Sri Lanka's chase, Boult picked up two early wickets with leg-side strangles as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi caught dangerous veteran opener Tillakaratne Dilshan and rookie Shehan Jayasuriya.

And while opener Danushka Gunathilaka was making hay at one end, he couldn't find a steady partner - when Mathews swatted Matt Henry to short cover, the tourists were 42-4 after five overs.

Gunathilaka perished when he tried to turn leg-spinner Ish Sodhi into the on side and got a leading edge to backward point after making a threatening 46 off only 29 balls, with three fours and two sixes.

SCOREBOARD: New Zealand 182-4 (Martin Guptill 58, Kane Williamson 53, Colin Munro 36; Nuwan Kulasekera 2-26) beat Sri Lanka 179-9 (Danushka Gunathilaka 46, Milinda Siriwardana 42; Trent Boult 3-21) by three runs.

North Korean nuclear test condemned as intolerable provocation
KOREA: North Korea's neighbours lined up on Wednesday to condemn Pyongyang's claimed hydrogen bomb test, saying it posed a grave threat to regional security.
Several governments promised a firm response as tensions soared again in northeast Asia, many calling for further action by the United Nations against the hermit nation, which is already subject to heavy international sanctions.
"The nuclear test that was carried out by North Korea is a serious threat to the safety of our nation and we absolutely cannot tolerate this," Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Tokyo.
"This clearly violates UN Security Council resolutions and is a grave challenge against international efforts for non-proliferation," he said, adding his country would seek to coordinate efforts among UN members to deal with the action.
South Korean President Park Geun-Hye called the test a "grave provocation" at an emergency meeting of the Country's National Security Council (NSC) convened immediately after the news broke.
"The test is not only a grave provocation to our national security but also a threat to our future... and a strong challenge to international peace and stability," she said, calling for strong sanctions on Pyongyang.
In an earlier statement, Seoul said it would "take all necessary measures including additional sanctions by the UN Security Council... so that the North will pay the price for the nuclear test". In Washington, the White House would not confirm the test, but vowed to "respond appropriately to any and all North Korean provocations". There was no immediate response from China, North Korea's key diplomatic protector, but in a report from Pyongyang, the official Xinhua news service said that the "test apparently runs counter to relevant UN resolutions" and "is set to cause repercussions".
Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop said her country "condemns in the strongest possible terms" the test, which "confirms North Korea's status as a rogue state and a continuing threat to international peace and security", adding that Canberra would express its concerns to Pyongyang directly and call for stronger UN sanctions.
The test, which came just two days before leader Kim Jong-Un's birthday, was initially detected by international seismology monitors as a 5.1-magnitude tremor next to the North's main Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the northeast of the country. Last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un suggested Pyongyang had already developed a hydrogen bomb.
The claim was questioned by international experts and there was continued scepticism over Wednesday's test announcement.
Whether an H-bomb or not, it was North Korea's fourth nuclear test and marked a striking act of defiance in the face of warnings that Pyongyang would pay a steep price if it continued pursuing its atomic weapons programme.
The three previous tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 triggered waves of UN sanctions. Their failure to prevent a fourth detonation will see calls for more drastic Security Council action this time around.

Rugby Sevens is our future
Aloha rugby hearts and proud Sri Islanders who follow the union game it's all about survival in the league. The decisive factors - player injuries, mental toughness, supervised rehabilitation, active recovery, energy management, legal nutrition, and carbohydrate loading etc ...that saves the muscles from depletion, and frees them to motor the full 80mins to much reward ..especially the ability and confidence to run from inside their own 22m.
Good sides can punish mistakes as tired lactic saturated muscles and minds stutter, make bad decisions and list up simple errors that cost massive!
Let's take the opening warrior weekend for 2016 ... perfect examples of playing the full 80mins, playing to the whistle and punishing mistakes. Kandy grafted a win against an opportunistic Havelocks, who certainly did not lack possession or decent ball, given the quality of their injury hit team. Danushka Ranjan sorely missed midfield and hoping for recovery or greener pastures He is easily the country's best finisher and looks to get bigger, better, faster, as he grows and gains experience.
Havies just couldn't finish despite the Muthuthanthri effort, efficiency, work rate and coach Laggas strategy to deny Kandy decent ball.
All the planning in the world comes down to the 15 in the middle, who need to get the job done. Scrums and lineouts must be owned, mauls controlled and rucks dominated at pace ... on the day despite all Havies had, KSC simply did the small things really well... and were strong enough to deny Havies the magical try line, jealously guarded by some solid defence.
Shenal Dias is almost back to his multiskilled best, dominating lineouts and working hard in the loose. Kevin Kutty Dixon is another on that special list ...with a rare burst of pace and a genuine side stepper off both feet.
Kandy's two try advantage grunted all the way and only a snap individual Marija magic, sealing the deal at full time ...much relief for coach Sean and missed chances for Tavita Lagga.
All roads now point to the hill capitol, the KSC flag proudly marking the club colours, and still unbeaten on top of the Dialog league. Havelocks at no 2 with a little less confidence in nudging the top ...unless Navy or CR causes some serious upsets at Nittawela.
Navy rubbed a little more salt into the CR bruises, when they shocked Longden Place with a 21/20 win in the dying minutes ... to give Danushka 'Gertha' Perera a well deserved man of the match award, and massive celebrations for the thousands of naval supporters crowding the terraces on the day.
The leader board - Kandy 34 points, 2. Havelocks 27p, 3. Navy 25p. 4. CR 19p. 5. Army 18p.
The buzz among rugby fans is news from the blue shirts contracted players, who have fallen short despite Bilal Hassen, Terrance Henry, Achala Perera, Reza Mubarak skill levels and experience etc ... Park management have not seen the results and there is much speculation about the rest of the season and the composition of the playing XV.
I believe that there is much need for strict guidelines to be enforced, so that players are protected at all times. We must have player representation, we must encourage former national players to contribute their wealth of knowledge, gained over hard years of international rugby ... like the cricket example, years of playing for Sri Lanka, must be regarded, and a criterion established to reward those who bravely matched the best in the rugby world. A hall of fame and a list of tours and honours to mark how we islanders survived the pressures of the hardest sport in the world - this is our history!
Sri Lanka Rugby needs to guard its pride of place and begin to broadbase this phenomenal game. We need to adhere to the IRB's principles for world rugby and look to make our mark.
The rugby union is currently between legal issues and hopefully sorted in the first quarter of 2016 ... the game needs careful investment and efficient administration to evolve and secure its slot on the Asian Rugby platform.
Sevens is our future ... we have medal prospects on several levels ... Asian series, Asian games, Commonwealth games, World Cup, World Series, and this year the 2016 Olympic games ... how many fantastic opportunities for our island warriors to showcase their talent and fly the flag, beyond conventional ambitions - what a fabulous future for our men and women.
Domestic rugby needs the inspiration from our national players on a weekly basis. We need the names, we want the crowds back to club rugby ... we need skills and magic to entertain and thrill the fans ... it's all down to how much the warriors step up and wow their fans.
Week 7 matches to carry that unique possibility of intense confrontation on many levels - 9 Jan: Army v Police @ Diyagama. 4pm kick off. 10 Jan: Kandy v Navy @ Nittawela, 4pm kick off.
National rugby needs club rugby to set the highest standards and the most careful consideration with insurance for players. The players are the lifeblood of progress, skill, performance, reputation and magic in the middle ... in 2016 we need to contract all national players and set in place a facility that enables Sri Lanka to hit up as contenders, initially in Asia ... then Asia Pacific and finally on that world platform. I believe ... I dream ... I breathe.
Bula bula Sri Islanders... the future is in our own hands to evolve - let's start with the 7s. Cheers!

Shakespeare 400th anniversary marked with 'Wonder Season'
UK: Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London is marking the 400th anniversary of the bard's death with a "Wonder Season" of some of his most famous plays.
"I'm really seeing the 400th anniversary, the whole season, being a celebration of wonder and reminding us how brilliant Shakespeare was," said Emma Rice, the theatre's new artistic director and the first woman to hold the post.
The English language's foremost playwright died aged 52 on April 23, 1616 and the anniversary is being marked with a host of events in Britain.
The Globe season opens on April 30 with "A Midsummer Night's Dream", directed by Rice.
"It brings great joy, great acceptance, and is about everything I care about: magic, identity and love," she said.
The Globe is the re-creation of Shakespeare's circular, wooden theatre on the banks of the River Thames.
Opened in 1997, theatre-goers can stand in the open air to watch the plays.
From September 17, associate director Matthew Dunster will be staging "Imogen", a "reclaimed and renamed" version of "Cymbeline" telling the story from point of view of the eponymous king's daughter.
Acclaimed actor Jonathan Pryce will reprise his role as Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" in October.
The season also features "The Taming of the Shrew", "Macbeth" and "The Two Gentlemen of Verona".
The wider celebrations include "The Complete Walk" on April 23 and 24, featuring 37 screens along a 2.5-mile (four-kilometre) stretch of the Thames riverbank in London.
Each of the 37 separate short films on show will feature some of the world's top actors performing scenes from Shakespeare plays, shot in the place they were set in.
"Imagine Cleopatra in front of the Pyramids, Shylock in Venice's Jewish ghetto, Hamlet on the rocks of Elsinore. The Complete Walk will be an interactive journey through Shakespeare's life and work," The Globe said.
A two-year world tour of "Hamlet" will be coming home to perform at The Globe on the anniversary weekend, after a final run of shows in Tehran, Lahore in Pakistan, San Marino and Vatican City.
Meanwhile The Royal Mint will issue three different 2 coins to mark 400 years of Shakespeare's literary legacy since his death.
The coins celebrate his tragedies, comedies and histories with a designs featuring a skull, a jester's hat and a crown and dagger respectively.

Sri Lanka bowl in first T20I, New Zealeand 182 runs for 4 wickets

Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal won the toss and chose to bowl first on a dry Mount Maunganui track, simply citing a preference to chase. He expected the pitch to take turn, but did not think it would change in character over the 40 overs. Kane Williamson said he would have chosen to bat first anyway.
Matt Henry, Trent Boult and Mitchell McClenaghan made up New Zealand's pace battery, with the legspin of Ish Sodhi also available. Grant Elliott and Corey Anderson, who will not bowl, play in the middle order and Colin Munro is likely to bat in the top order. Williamson is likely to open the innings alongside Martin Guptill.
Danushka Gunathilaka made his T20I debut for the visitors, following one good innings during the ODI series. Spin-bowling allrounder Shehan Jayasuriya was also in the XI and was likely bat in the top order. Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay was the sole frontline spinner, but Sri Lanka had Milinda Siriwardana and Tillakaratne Dilshan's finger spin to call on. Thisara Perera was also selected, which meant there were only three specialist bowlers in the XI.
Conditions were expected to remain cloudy but dry for the duration of the encounter.
New Zealend scored 182 runs for 4 wickets at the end of 20 overs.

Sri Lanka needs one win to retain No. 1 T20 ranking
ICC World Twenty20 champion Sri Lanka goes head to head with host New Zealand in a two-match Twenty20 International series onThursday, 7 January, in Mount Maunganui fully aware that it needs to either draw or win the series to retain its number-one position on the ICC T20I Team Rankings.
Sri Lanka (125) leads eighth-ranked New Zealand (108) by 17 points, which means it is expected to win the series comfortably. This, in turn, means if the series ends in a draw, the difference will reduce to 14 points, but more importantly, Sri Lanka will retain its number-one position.
In contrast, if New Zealand wins both the matches, then Sri Lanka will join the West Indies and Australia on 118 points but will be ranked behind the West Indies and Australia in third position when the points are calculated beyond the decimal point. In this scenario, New Zealand will rise to seventh position on 114 points and will reduce the gap with Sri Lanka to just four points.
The last time eighth-ranked New Zealand played Sri Lanka was in the ICC World Twenty20 in 2014, when it lost by a big margin. This year, Sri Lankas record in T20Is reads as one win out of four while New Zealand is marginally better with two wins out of four.
There is plenty to play for as both the sides head into the final phase of their preparations for the ICC World Twenty20 India 2016, which will take place from 8 March to 3 April.
