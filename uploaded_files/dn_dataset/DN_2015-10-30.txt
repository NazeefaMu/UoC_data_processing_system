39 students released on bail
Thirty nine students attached to Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) arrested in connection with committing offences at a protest rally opposite the Higher Education Ministry were yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
Accordingly, each suspect including two Buddhist monks and five females were ordered to be released on a personal bail of Rs.100,000 by Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya. Producing the suspects before Court, the Cinnamon Garden police alleged that the students could be charged over several offences including assaulting police officers, causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow while being members of an unlawful assembly.
Police stated that a group of students commenced the protest from the Colombo Fort railway station towards the Higher Education Ministry premises urging that several their demands be fulfilled.
Police told Court that they prevented the protestors from marching towards the ministry premises informing them that they cannot meet the Minister of Higher Education since he was not in the ministry. Police complained to the Chief Magistrate that the students who behaved in an unruly manner ignored the police warning-not to be members of the unlawful assembly. Police stated that they were compelled to use minimal force to disperse the unlawful assembly using water canons, tear gas and police batons. Police further said that six police personnel were injured during the skirmish with the protesters and eight students were also injured during the incident. Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake and Sanjaya Gamage appearing for the suspects informed Court that the attack by police could be considered as a tragedy day of the Good Governance regime. They stated that their clients had been illegally arrested by police while they were engaged in a peaceful protest. The Defence Counsel told that the students were preparing to lodge complaints with the President, The Prime Minister and the Police Commission over the incident.

Lawyer MR is confused on the law
Anti-Geneva forces now respect foreign expertise
The initial opposition to the recent Geneva Resolution on Sri Lanka was largely based on what was said to be foreign interference in the internal affairs of this country. There were concerns expressed about the participation of foreign experts in the fields of law, investigation, and the judiciary, which critics said would be a major threat to country's the sovereignty.
The new trend emerging from these critics of the Geneva resolution, especially those who follow the Mahinda Rajapaksa line, be they politicians, academics or media personnel, is a recognition of the importance of such foreign personnel and their contribution to aspects of accountability; and loud calls for their statements, reports or observations made to the Paranagama Commission on Missing Persons, to be released.
This is a strange twist of both events and strategy, with those who opposed any foreign involvement in our internal affairs, especially on matters of accountability and judicial action with regard to the ending of the battle to defeat the LTTE, are now the keenest to have the inputs from foreign personnel, in their battle to oppose and hopefully defeat the Government's position on Geneva 2015.
MR's predicament
Let us first discuss the predicament of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is clearly moving against the leader of his own political party, the SLFP and its alliance the UPFA, President Maithripala Sirisena, with regard to Sri Lanka's co-sponsorship of Geneva 2015. His latest statement made at the MR political arsenal, the Abeyaramaya, following his failure to participate in the parliamentary debate on the Geneva Resolution, is certainly a package of confusion, hardly expected from one who was Head of State until just ten months ago.
He is very much concerned about the change of laws and the Constitution, too, enabling the presence and participation of foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and, especially lawyers, who will act to punish the war heroes who defeated the LTTE, bringing to an end a bloody conflict that went on for 30 years. "War Heroes" have now come into the parlance of political rivalry that one has serious doubts about how much of genuine respect those who claim to defend or speak on their behalf have for them today. One question in this regard is whether MR considers the Army Commander who led the ground battles against the LTTE in its final stages, giving leadership and direction to the heroes of those battles, as a war hero or not
The 15th UNHRC session held in Geneva recently
Was the treatment of Gen. Sarath Fonseka, immediately after his defeat in the contest for the presidency in 2010, and other heroes who were with him, an act of honour and respect for a war hero or heroes, the complete negation of such respect We can leave this for MR to chew on as he considers his next political moves against the trend of the SLFP moving away from him in the days ahead.
Confusion most confounded
To get back to the foreign personnel and experts that were once unwanted and now most wanted by his supporters, MR shows confusion most confounded on the matter. He poses the question that if we change the law to enable foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators to serve in our legal system, what would happen "after they finish jailing our war heroes" His statement asks: "If the amendments to the laws continue to remain even after jailing the war heroes, foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and especially lawyers, will, continue to work in Sri Lanka, and that may pose a major problem for the legal profession. There are many lawyers in Parliament and I too am a lawyer."
Confusing as it may be, the antics are interesting. It is a an effort to obtain the support of lawyers, including those in Parliament, being a member of the same fraternity, as he now has to remind both the profession and the country. The other tactic is to use the war heroes for political gain, when it is very clear that there is no move against the troops who were heroes in battle, but only against those who may have violated the rules of combat and engagement in battle.
Even though he may not have practiced law (while busy making law) for many years, his education in law would have told him that laws can be enacted for specific purposes and goals, and they could be repealed with the conclusion of the allotted tasks, at the very time they are passed. Any foreign judges, prosecutors, investigators and lawyers, who may be brought down for special work, would certainly be required by to leave once their work is completed. This is a simple legislative act, and should not bother a former Head of State, and would certainly not have any adverse impact on our legal profession.
It is necessary to ask MR and those who share this Abayaramaya thinking, about the so-called far reaching and adverse nature of the proposed changes to the Constitution, as they see it, whether they did not think of such adverse situations and in fact the dangers to the State, democracy and the sovereignty of the people, when MR introduced the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. It repealed the 17th Amendment, which provided for the independent commissions, and also extended, ad infinitum, the term of office of an executive president of this country. This amendment certainly had very harmful effects on the judiciary, the administration of law and certainly did affect the legal profession most adversely, and was proposed and adopted by a government led by this same lawyer.
Foreign expertise
To come to the current affection, endearment and regard towards foreign experts, we now see Gammanpila and others of that political ilk, including the double or treble turncoat professor of law, see the importance and necessity of the observations made by eminent persons from abroad who were brought by MR to advise the Paranagama Commission.
There is glowing praise today, not undeserving, but surprisingly, of Sir Desmond de Silva QC, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, Professor David Crane, Mr. Paul Newton and Major General John Holmes. What is interesting is that all praise for the observations by these personalities to the Paranagama Commission, comes almost wholly from those who saw the biggest dangers in having foreign experts get involved in our own matters of peace building, reconciliation and accountability.
The demands keep increasing for their observations to be made public, and charges are made against the Government for not tabling these observations in the Parliament, and also for the Paranagama Commission Report not including these observations.
As for the Paranagama Commission, it is up to that Commission to decide what it does with observations and recommendations made to it from experts and other personnel who assisted it.
The final report indicates these have been studied by the Commission. There are strong views expressed that, were these observations made known in Geneva, we may not have had to face Geneva 2015. No doubt these are interesting opinions, regrettably soured by their involvement in the politics of power and not politics for national progress.
Whatever these recommendations and opinions may be, the fact is they were made by foreigners who did come here to be of service to this country, in our need to know the truth about all those thousands who went missing during the prolonged armed conflict. They are similar to what MR calls the "judges, prosecutors and investigators" who may come here later. Their recommendations, if they are as good as many claim them to be, gives a fillip to those in Government and its supporters among the public, who realize the value of obtaining foreign expertise to help resolve the situation we face with regard to the missing and dead in the prolonged armed conflict, the issue of those held without trial or much delayed trial, and the relief that can be given to the families of those who have been the victims of a reign of terror by the LTTE and in the battle to defeat its violence against people of all communities.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesighe's request for assistance from Japan for such expertise, and the opportunity now being opened to obtain services from the Commonwealth member states on this matter, is certainly a move in the right direction, underscored by the praise showered upon these foreign experts who made recommendations to the Paranagama Commission. This is the meaning of Sri Lanka being a participatory member of the United Nations and a responsible member of the international community.
One important matter that requires emphasis, arising from both the Paranagama and Udalagama Commission Reports, is that this country is not wholly barren in the expertise we need. We have many who are very capable, in their special fields of expertise, if given the freedom from political interference, and would certainly benefit from assistance from similar expertise coming from abroad. This is no threat to national sovereignty or to the war heroes who brought peace to this land.

N. J. Jayarajahm:
Gentleman par excellence
Nicholas Joseph Jayarajah, (Justice of Peace, Retired Assistant Director of Sri Lanka Customs was called to rest at 85 years on October 23 after a brief illness in Colombo.
The husband of late Regina Lilymalar was his inseparable companion and guardian.
Always one could find the couple together in the church at functions and parties seated next to each other. God found his inability to live separated and called him to join his beloved to praise and thank Him in the land inherited by them.
The demise of senior Patrician Jayarajah gives great pain of mind and sorrow to all Patricians. He was tall and handsome with a loveable personality, loved by all for his noble qualities, humility and simplicity. Jayarajah never missed SPC meetings or the get-together organized by Patricians in Colombo.
They were always the first couple to arrive at Christmas parties - a source of encouragement and inspiration for young Patricians.
At the Customs Department, he was a respected and recognized senor officer with vast knowledge of Customs regulations and formalities. Many were seeking his advice and guidance.
Retired Assistant Director of Customs, never looked for monetary benefits but always helped the genuine consignees.
He enjoyed a lucrative position in life and contributed lavishly for charity. When I fail to approach him in time he often calls me, reminds me of his annual contribution for Cancer Hospital charity and S.V.P Christmas party donations etc. He was energetic and moved freely with the young and old and won their hearts. He was a man of God with a sensitive heart to help the needy. He was very religious and virtuous. He was a Catholic and his faith in God sustained him in his triumphs and trials. A gentleman par excellence with adorable qualities helping his nephews and nieces and many others in their adversities. His services to the society were recognized and the government honoured him with the title of Justice of Peace.
Jayarajah having cherished his fruitful life, left for his glory to join his beloved without incurring much delay.
Times of grief come to us all. The hurt is too much to bear but always remember God's everlasting love and mercy which is always there to console and comfort us.
Prayers are assured for the repose of his soul and may his nephews and nieces feel God's love and be comforted at this saddest time of loss.
May God of love forgive all his remission of sins and grant him eternal bliss in heaven.
Sorrows tried him,
Faith sustained him,
Earth has lost him,
Heaven gained him,
Conquered victory over death.

A City poised for change
Fifty years ago, when Singapore obtained independence, it was barely more than an Asian backwater and founder Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had gone on record saying he wanted Singapore to be like Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in terms of development. But in those intervening 50 years, Singapore has become a global economic powerhouse, while Sri Lanka witnessed a couple of insurgencies and a devastating war that hampered its economic prospects and growth. Now that the war is no more and peace has returned, Sri Lanka could potentially become another Singapore, given its strategic location, investment opportunities, skilled workforce and adequate infrastructure facilities.
It is therefore no surprise that the Sri Lankan Government has looked to Singapore for inspiration and expertise as it seeks to create a Megapolis in the Western Province, on much the same lines as Singapore. It will be a celebration of the City - the City of Colombo - which will be transformed in a massive way along with many other hub towns in the Western Province.
Today, (October 31), the UN-designated World Cities Day, the focus will very much be on the future of the city under the theme "better life, better city - designed to live together".
The challenges of rapid urbanization figure prominently in the UN's newly adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development where Goal 11 embodies a commitment to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable".
LeeKwan Yew
Megapolis programme
This will thus be an ideal day to reflect on the future of Colombo, our biggest city which is poised for a great change under the proposed Megapolis programme initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Singapore urban planning consultants Surbana will help design a plan to turn the capital Colombo's metropolitan region into a modern 'megapolis'. With the help of local experts and agencies, they will complete the design for the Western Region Megapolis Plan covering the entire Western Province from Negombo in the north to Kalutara in the south. Collection of data, preparation of basic designs and legislation have already been completed.
Thus it will have a range of inputs and insights from experts in many fields.
As the World Cities Day theme exemplifies, better cities help people to lead better lives. We hope that the Megapolis project will be able to tackle some of Colombo's biggest problems. The biggest problem is traffic congestion, which has literally choked life in the city. At current rates of vehicle registration in the Western Province, we will soon be crawling along at around 3 km/h on Colombo's congested roads. Since it is virtually impossible to discourage private vehicle ownership in the absence of a good public transport system, that should be a priority for megapolis planners.
Again, we do not have look much further than Singapore for inspiration. It now has a world-class public transport system with a Metro Rapid Transit train system, a very good bus network and a fleet of proper car-based taxis that are all coordinated. In fact, The Land Transport Authority of Singapore expects the number of daily public-transport trips to hit 10 million by 2020. Singapore does have various restrictions on car ownership due to extremely limited space (which may not necessarily apply to Sri Lanka which around 100 times bigger), but there are other measures such as encouraging car pooling which may work well here. The recent entry of Uber, the shared ride service, to Sri Lanka is good omen because it will encourage lone drivers to take a few other passengers along for a fee. Moreover, if the three wheelers in at least the Colombo City limits are taken out of circulation, the traffic flow will be much better and in the alternative, we should have a proper taxi service. The Megapolis plan calls for new railway lines in the Western Province, which is a commendable idea.
Singapore's success story
The other biggest problem is human settlements. Colombo still does have a large number of shanties despite the efforts of all successive governments to build more housing complexes. Singapore's success story in terms of housing is remarkable with more than 80% house ownership. Housing should be a priority area for the Megapolis initiative. While these two aspects of the Megapolis proposal have received wide attention, there should be a bigger focus on energy generation for the Western Province, which consumes much of the country's power output at present. Renewable energy is the wave of the future and the authorities should encourage more such projects, including solar net metering systems for households.
Transport, habitats and energy - all these are ultimately for the benefit of the city dwellers, who should rightly be at the heart of any urban renewal effort. It is thus essential to seek the maximum public participation in the Megapolis project, which has the potential to become a path-breaking project in the whole of Asia.

Germany agonises over 'Mein Kampf'
GERMANY: With only two months to go before the copyright of Hitler's "Mein Kampf" expires, debate is raging over whether the anti-Semitic manifesto should again be published in Germany, where all reprints have been halted since the defeat of the Nazis.
Authorities in the southern Bavaria region were handed the copyright by Allied forces after World War II. For seven decades, they have refused to allow it to be republished out of respect for victims of the Nazis and to prevent incitement of hatred.
But as "Mein Kampf" -- whose title means "My Struggle" -- falls into the public domain on January 1, differences have emerged over how it should be treated in future.
Some scholars want reprints of the original text to be allowed, saying they would serve to demystify the notorious 800-page document.
Others including Jewish groups want to maintain the ban, likening reprints to opening Pandora's box.
Historians at the Institute of Contemporary History of Munich (IFZ), meanwhile, have gone for the middle-ground -- producing an annotated version of the two-volume tome to be made available in bookstores in January. - AFP

Govt laying foundation for peace and reconciliation - Mangala
The government is now beginning to lay the foundation for peace and reconciliation through truth-seeking, accountability, reparations and non-recurrence, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking at a ceremony held to mark the 25th anniversary of the expulsion of Muslims from the North, the minister said the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, the Resettlement Ministry and government agencies are taking steps to assist in this process.
Samaraweera said he also met the civil society, including representatives of the Muslim community, to discuss the consultations process necessary to design the mechanisms to implement this process.
"Muslims will be an integral part of the truth, justice, reparations and non-recurrence process. Muslims' grievances and concerns will be a part of the consultations, design and operationalisation of the domestic mechanisms; including the Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence, the Judicial Mechanism, the Office of Missing Persons and the Office of Reparations. Together with the Ministries and government agencies, these mechanisms, will provide much needed relief to the daily struggle of the thousands of Muslims who remain in IDP camps, are struggling to return to their homes or are dealing with the losses of loved ones," he said.
The mechanisms will not only address the suffering and grievances of members of the Muslim community, they will also address the grievances and concerns of members of the Sinhala and Tamil communities and the concerns of other minority groups, he said.
"At this historic moment, let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers, heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of future generations. Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations, and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream," the minister said.
"At this critical moment in Sri Lanka's history the lessons of the expulsion have much to teach us. Since Independence we have failed to establish a society where all citizens feel equal and free and, as a result, instead of peace, conflict has prevailed," he said.
"The end of the war presented a historic opportunity for all our communities and leaders to demonstrate true leadership by breaking away from the past and beginning the task of building a truly united Sri Lanka. Just as Muslims and Tamils lived together as brothers and sisters in the North for centuries; prior to Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka had many centuries of ethnic amity and peace," the minister said.
The TNA recently announced that it would be leading its own community in a process of introspection. The SLMC, welcoming this statement, indicated that it would do so as well. The National Government comprising of both the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party have committed themselves to guiding the entire country in this difficult process of dealing with the past," he said.

President Maithripala Sirisena said the new government's objective is to take the ideas and proposals of scholars and intellectuals to utmost consideration for the forthcoming programme to build the country.
The President said so addressing the 30th annual summit of the Sri Lanka Economists' Association, held at the auditorium of the Center for Banking Studies Sri Lanka, today yesterday.
He commended the 30 years course of the Economists' Association and expressed his confidence over its close connections with the government in the future too.
President Sirisena pointed out that the knowledge and experience of the scholars are important in the economic, political and cultural reforms of the country. "It is everyone's responsibility to join the programme carried out by the new government to build the country by transforming it to the expectations of the people," he said.
"We should not be elated over our proud history of thousands of years. We should be committed to preserve it for the future generations," the President said.
He stated that the new government's aim is to take the country once again to a self-sufficient economy by developing the indigenous economy. "The government expects to make use of the knowledge, wisdom and experience of the economists in preparing related plans and policies in this regard," the President further stated.
Minister of Public Enterprise Development Eran Wickramaratne, President of the Economists' Association Prof. A. D. V. de S. Indraratne and Secretary of the Economists' Association M. Sumanadasa also participated at the occasion. Courtesy President's Media Divisio

Henry V's sword on show at Agincourt ceremony in London
UK: King Henry V's sword was carried through London's Westminster Abbey on Thursday as England celebrated the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, one of its greatest-ever victories in war.
A service was held in the royal church where the king is buried, six centuries on from the day when news of the victory arrived in London, triggering joyous celebrations.
The battle on October 25, 1415 saw a heavily-outnumbered and exhausted English army inflict a catastrophic defeat on the French that altered the course of the Hundred Years' War.
King Henry was 28 and two years into his nine-year reign. His longbow archers routed the French nobility. Westminster Abbey holds king Henry's "funerary achievements" -- the personal items carried at his funeral, namely his sword, shield, saddle and helmet. His sword was carried through the church once again and placed on the altar next to his helmet.
Queen Elizabeth II's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, joined around 2,200 people at the service, many of whom were history buffs who snapped up the tickets.
The choir sang "The Agincourt Carol" in its original 15th-century English.
It begins: "Owre kynge went forth to Normandy / With grace and myght of chyvalry / There God for hym wrought mervelusly / Wherefore Englonde may calle and cry / Deo gratias!"
Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, gave a sermon in which he praised king Henry's leadership and "clear and simple vision". - AFP

Look into issue of resettling Muslims with more concern - Hakeem
The government should look into the issue of resettling the Muslims with more concern, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He was speaking at the commemoration ceremony of the 25th Anniversary of the Expulsion of Muslims from the North held in Colombo yesterday.
The resettlement issue of the Northern Muslims evicted in 1990 still remains unresolved, he added.
Hakeem said the Lesson Learnt Reconciliation Commission is of the view that durable solutions should be found to address this long-standing IDP issue concerning the Muslims evicted from the North.
"When measures were taken to resettle the Muslim IDPs back in their original villages, landlessness was identified as a serious setback for resettlement."
He said the government needs to have a uniform policy to deal with the issue adding that reconciliation will be a success based on trust and respect.
The plight of the displaced Muslim also should be addressed in the truth seeking process, Hakeem said.

Migrant workers submit budget proposals
A Dammam-based umbrella organization called the 'Sri Lankan Migrant Workers Alliance' (SLMWA) has submitted a 20 page national budget proposal to the Finance Ministry ahead of the annual budget to be presented in Parliament next month.
The set of proposals was focused on the welfare of migrant workers which includes issues related to monthly payments for migrant workers, as well as in relation to retired, deceased, disabled, harassed, injured and repatriated (for valid reasons) workers. Other issues addressed by the budget include the BOI (Board of Investments) grade investment plan for migrant workers (with tax holidays, import concessions & state land lease),
concession permits for commercial vehicles, industrial machinery, equipment, and concessionary personal vehicles for professionals (in order to maintain their living standards back home), education investment funds to establish community schools for migrant workers and standardised air fares for migrant workers.
There are nearly two million Sri Lankan migrant workers whose families live in the Middle East and other parts of the world - a number that is increasing daily.
Around 60 percent of Sri Lanka's total foreign exchange earnings are contributed by migrant workers, and approximately 70 percent of them come from the Middle East alone.
Rakeeb Jaufer, Chief of the SLMWA in Saudi Arabia, said: "This proposal was drafted with the support of 25 Sri Lankan professionals living across the world."

National planning for inclusive development, social stability
There cannot be any doubt about the fact that the development challenge facing Sri Lanka today is enormous. Any serious economist knows that macro economic fundamentals of the country have not been good for quite some time now. And these fundamentals cannot be changed overnight, just because there is a change of regime. One can identify many aspects of the economy that are not very encouraging. I.e the sectoral composition of the economy, composition of the labour force, tax base, indebtedness, growing budget deficit, composition of exports and imports, widening trade gap, etc. A serious and rigorous analysis of these and other aspects is a prerequisite for figuring out how the country can move out of the present economic crisis.
The country's prospects for ensuring social and political stability, improving the quality of life of the people and addressing a whole range of other social issues such as social and regional disparities, poverty, crime, environmental health and the lack of social protection for the vast majority of people depend to a great extent on sustainable economic development.
Yet, the policy makers do not seem to be eager to work towards a national plan to help achieve a set of clearly articulated development goals. On the other hand, if we fail to overcome the development challenge, political instability is more than likely to follow, leading to disastrous results.
As is well known, pressing economic and social issues encouraged many people to look for opportunities outside the country for employment and permanent migration. This exodus has provided unsustainable, short term solutions to such problems as unemployment, poverty and the widening trade gap. Yet, such solutions have undermined long term development prospects of the country due to brain drain, rising labour costs and labour shortages in critical sectors of the economy, besides creating many other problems.
Affluent consumers
The flooding of the local market with all sorts of consumer goods such as motor cars and agricultural and industrial products perhaps has made the affluent consumers happy but a majority of people face serious difficulties due to indebtedness and increasing cost of living.
It was recently reported that Sri Lanka is the only country in the region that did not reap significant benefits from falling price of petroleum due to increasing imports coupled with stagnant exports. It was amusing that some of our so-called law makers wanted the government to pass on to the consumers the benefit of falling oil prices. And the government responded by reducing the price with disastrous result which we observe in Colombo on a day-to-day basis. Increased importation of oil and car no doubt reduced the revenue that the government would have collected from higher fuel taxes.
As is well known, there is a serious structural imbalance in the economy which is increasingly dominated by a consumption driven service sector. So, it is not surprising that the import bill cannot be contained within reasonable limits.
There is only one way to contain the import bill in line with export earnings. It is by strengthening the productive sectors of the economy, both industrial and agricultural. But this is easier said than done. There is a need for a serious economic analysis of the present structure of the economy which our economists are fully capable of. There are several sectors that need equally rigorous analysis: they are education, research and development, human resource planning, etc. in other words, what is urgent is inter-sectoral planning. This could be done through a high level national planning body.
The draft 19th Amendment to the constitution had a national planning commission in the list of independent commissions to be appointed but this had been dropped in the amendment finally passed by the parliament. But this can still be done, initially by appointing an interim council under the Ministry of Planning.
Given the highly significant nature of national planning, this cannot be postponed any further. It is true that such a measure is not going to bring quick results due to the long term nature of national planning but we cannot ignore long term policy development.
As is well known, successful East Asian countries took two to three decades to steer their economies on a path of sustained development to achieve their national goals. This has not been possible in Sri Lanka partly due to the populist nature of our democracy as against the technocratic nature of many East Asian states and partly due to the mismanagement of our national question resulting political conflict. As is well known, the latter led to skyrocketing of defense expenditure at the expense of vital social sectors such as education, public transport and R and D.
When a country is confronted by an economic crisis, it is natural for those who are responsible for economic management to concentrate more and more on short term or day to day management issues. But this does not eliminate the need for articulating a long term vision and formulate strategies to realize that vision. In fact, both should happen simultaneously.
Economic diversification
The economic crisis that the United States faced in 2008-2009 no doubt consumed a major part of the time, money and energy of the US government but the leaders there were equally keen to find out what went wrong. While de-industrialization, among other things was identified as a major issue and many initiatives were launched to deal with it. An article in the Time magazine in 2013 reported that the outcome of such initiatives was quite significant.
As is well known, capital investment, both public and private is critical for economic development. While the country has no capacity to make many large-scale public investments due to already accumulated public debts and serious budgetary constraints, it is private investment, in particular foreign investment that can be the main catalyst in the process of much needed economic diversification. Even if you create an optimal investment climate, this is not going to happen overnight. It is also necessary to create a conducive environment to attract and retain foreign investment and human resources. While brain drain has to be stemmed, an effort should also be made to attract skilled Sri Lankans based in other countries through a proactive incentive scheme.
We need urgent education reforms to make education holistic with an emphasis on scientific literacy, computer literacy, critical thinking, logical reasoning, comprehension, language skills, communication skills, problem solving skills, etc. We need to strengthen scientific institutions and research centres that can facilitate innovation and product development in diverse fields.
So, while facing the development challenge requires a multi-pronged approach, and a well-constituted, multi-disciplinary forum at the highest level of government in order to plan the way forward.
If we take this step today, we may see some results in a few years. If we fail to do so, we may have nothing much to look forward to even after another decade.

Palau creates huge ocean sanctuary the size of Spain
PALAU: The tiny Pacific island nation of Palau created a vast marine sanctuary the size of Spain on Wednesday, banning fishing across the bulk of its waters to preserve the ocean for future generations.
At 500,000 square kilometres (193,000 square miles), the new sanctuary is one of the largest in the world and covers an underwater wonderland containing 1,300 species of fish and 700 types of coral. Palau President Tommy Remengesau said the sanctuary, comprising 80 percent of the nation's maritime territory, would allow the ocean to heal after decades of industrialised fishing which has driven some species to the brink of extinction.
"A small island nation can have a big impact on the ocean," he said ahead of a ceremony Wednesday to officially sign off on the reserve. "Island communities have been among the hardest hit by the threats facing the ocean. Creating this sanctuary is a bold move that the people of Palau recognise as essential to our survival."
The archipelago, part of the larger island group of Micronesia in the west Pacific, has a population of just 18,000. The sanctuary will be phased in over five years, eventually leaving only a relatively small area of Palau's waters open to fishing by locals but not the foreign trawlers which dominate the Pacific industry.
The no-fishing plan prioritises tourism -- which contributes about US$160 million or 50 percent of gross domestic product annually -- over the tuna industry, which contributes around US$5.5 million a year. - AFP

'Policy changes affect national economy'
Policies relating to the economy keep on changing from time to time. The policy adopted at the time of signing an investment agreement has changed by the time funds are released. This has a negative effect on the country's economy, said Former Presidential Advisor Mano Tittawella.
He was addressing a press conference themed "what is expected of the Budget" at the SLFI recently.
He said constantly changing policies created many problems. Attention should be drawn towards adopting policies for a long time.
Tittawella said if there are policies to promote industries and services, investments could be raised from within the country. It is by expanding such policies that we should attract foreign investments. An environment should be created to draw funds from foreign countries and invest them in Sri Lanka. This required sustainable policies which do not change at every turn. Policies should remain intact at least for 10 years, he said.
"We should certify that policies would remain the same without changing unless there was a guarantee that investors would be reluctant to come here. If the policy is sustainable, there was no need to provide tax relief to attract investors. The foundation must be made in this direction from the budget," he said.
Tittawella said the budget should take steps to transform loss making state institutions into profitable institutions. If state owned ventures were not made profitable, it was the people who had to pay to make up such losses. Nearly Rs. 300 billion was spent to maintain loss making ventures. If this sum is saved, expenditure on education could be increased by another two percent.
Executive Director CAFFE and Sri Lanka Human Rights Centre Keerthi Tennakoon said under the present government, environmental policies have changed in recent times.
"There was no proper policy regarding fuel. We could not attain economic development unless there was a sustainable policy on environment. There was a wide sector connected to it and that was transport," he said.
Vehicle speed in Colombo city has dropped to 12 kmph. If the problem was not resolved, it may drop to 8 kmph within the next two years according to specialists who had paid attention to the issue, Tennakoon said.

Two's a crowd for many Chinese after policy change
CHINA: Chinese citizens greeted the announcement of a "two-child" policy warily Friday, as high costs, career aspirations and rising urbanisation in an increasingly wealthy society mute expectations of a baby boom after the historic change.
China's previous "one-child" family planning regime, which Beijing announced Thursday would end after some four decades, has seen arbitrary and often brutal enforcement, including forced abortions and sterilisation of some.
Most families were restricted to only one offspring, but CHINA: various exemptions applied, and violators who could afford to pay the fines were able to have a second child, or even more.
The plan was supposed to save China from a looming population explosion, but now it contributes to a greying of society that will exacerbate labour shortages as the world's second-largest economy fights to maintain growth.
The policy is thought to have prevented an estimated 400 million births in the world's most populous country, where 1.37 billion people live today. Chinese media Friday portrayed the decision to loosen the policy as a victory for both the economy and the people, who have long expressed anger at the controversial policy and its myriad abuses.
"The new Five-year Plan should be regarded as a triumph of the people's will, as many policies have echoed long-term appeals," the Global Times, a paper close to the government, wrote following the announcement.
But the change may have been too little too late as many young Chinese, who grew up as single children, see more costs than benefits in having a second child. The announcement was met with a collective shrug by social media users, with the topic in eighth place among trending topics on popular micro-blog site Sina Weibo -- well behind other entertainment news.
The site's users were far more interested in celebrity actress Angelababy, who held the number one spot, than making their own.
A survey of more than 150,000 people on Chinese media site Sina Friday morning found that less than 30 percent of respondents would have a second child.
The sentiment was widely echoed by social media users, who questioned whether one was truly the loneliest number.
While once there may have been pent up demand for more children, experts say that as the country has grown wealthier, couples have increasingly delayed having even one child as they devote more time to other goals, such as building their careers. - AFP

Working Masses' moment
There are several ways to contain the import bill in line with export earnings. Socialists or those who want state intervention in the economy will suggest direct control of import and exports. On the other hand, those who believe in open economy will claim it is by strengthening the productive sectors of the economy, both industrial and agricultural, that one could avoid a crisis. But all these are easier said than done. However in Lanka today there is no need of foreign advisers for a serious economic analysis of the present structure of the economy, because our economists are fully capable of such work. Under the power of the Democratic revolution pressure must come for the right direction.
There are several sectors that need equally rigorous attention: they are education, research and development and human resource planning in relation to food production, paddy, vegetables, fruits, milk, and spices. We already have a market oriented management structure in relation to industries; but plantations are lagging behind; both large and small. But there is almost anarchy in the areas mentioned above in relation to food production. Most labour and other resources are wasted by this anarchic situation. It is a tragedy because still majority of producers are involved in the anarchic sector.
Democratic revolution
In other words, what is urgent is inter-sectoral planning to give the attention for most needed. Those who were in the think tank of the Democratic revolution proposed a high level national planning body. The Draft 19th Amendment to the Constitution had a National Planning Commission in the list of Independent Commissions to be appointed but this had been dropped in the amendment finally passed by the Parliament. That shows the inability of the petty bourgeois intellectuals that conducted the discussion. However this can still be done, if the committees of the revolutionary movement such as Samagi Balaya appoint an Interim Council to pressurize the Ministry of Planning. Given the highly significant nature of national planning problem, this cannot be postponed any further. It is true that such a measure is not going to bring quick results due to the long-term nature of national planning but we cannot ignore the fundamental change we are proposing that will influence long-term policy development. As is well known, whether it is Cuba or "successful" East Asian countries, it took two to three decades to steer their economies on an independent path of sustained development to achieve real development of human living conditions.
This has not been possible in Lanka partly due to the corrupt fascistic nature of Mahinda regime which failed to absorb the appropriate technology and partly due to the chauvinist mismanagement of Tamil national question that created the misery of war. As is well known, we were pushed into a river of blood and tears with sky-rocketing of defence expenditure, at the expense of vital social sectors such as education, health, public transport and Rural Development. When a country is confronted by an economic crisis, it is natural for those who are responsible to look into the basic problems of economic management to concentrate on fundamental solutions.
US Government leaders
The economic crisis that the United States faced in 2008-2009 no doubt consumed a major part of the time, money and energy of all concerned to look deep it the mechanism of economy. In fact triumphantly, the Marxists pointed out that the rule of deprecation of rate of profit has made profit come to near zero, with the development of electronic technology. However the US Government leaders were equally keen to find out what went wrong and answered that the fall of rate of profit was due to de-industrialization, among other things. It was identified as a major issue and many initiatives were launched to deal with it.
It is clear as an under developed country we are not affected by the problem of de-industrialization, less by that. Our problem is acceptance of inappropriate technologies due to excessive corruption and bribery. We are told that while the country has no capacity to make many large-scale public investments due to already-accumulated public debts and serious budgetary constraints, it is private investment, in particular foreign investment, that can be the main catalyst in the process of much needed economic diversification. Then they logically conclude it is also necessary to create a conducive environment to attract and retain foreign investment and human resources. That means we have to cut our consumption and create cheap labour climate for the investors. This IMF advice has not worked and it only created a situation for rebellion and terror. We have to look into a different direction. While brain drain has to be stemmed, an effort should also be made to attract skilled Lankans based in other countries through attractive incentive schemes.
Scientific institutions and research centres
We need urgent education reforms to make education democratically accessible to every body. While an emphasis on scientific literacy, computer literacy, critical thinking, logical reasoning, are very important artistic abilities and sensual communication should be extended in all directions. Comprehension, language skills, communication skills, problem-solving ideological thinking should be improved with the practice of empirical methods.
It is necessary to give importance to scientific institutions and research centres that can facilitate innovations and product developments in diverse fields. In other words, facing the development challenge a multi-pronged approach, a well-constituted, multi-disciplinary forum at the highest level of Government is critically important to plan the way forward.
Democracy must make this programme their campaign document while exerting pressure on the government. We have to mobilize trade unions, civil societies that participated in the anti fascistic struggle to mobilize masses. Mere demand of salary increases and economic benefits are not sufficient. It should be a political campaign where working people play the leading role.
