Adivasi youth joins Navy
The Sri Lanka Navy created history by recruiting an Aadhivasi youth into its 223rd intake. The passing out parade of the intake of 366 recruits was held under the patronage of Southern Naval Commander Rear Admiral J.J. Ranasinghe at Sri Lanka Navy Ships Nipuna in Galle on Saturday.
Among the large crowd present at the passing out ceremony was the great grandfather of Naval recruit H.M. Prasanka Pradeep Jayawardana, the Aadhivasi youth. Unaapaana Varige Heenbandiyala aththo of Dambana, Mahiyanagana had come from Badulla to watch the skills and talents of his great grandson.
Jayawardana's father, H.M. Jayawardana, 54, is a farmer and his mother J.M.Priyanaka Kumari ,44, is a house wife. Heenbaddiyaala eththo is Jayawardana's parents' grandfather.
We are from Dambana, Mahiyangana. We have three children. Our eldest son is employed as a security officer. Prasanka Pradeep who joined the Navy is our second child.
Our youngest daughter is studying for her A/L examination. Since his childhood, our second child wanted to join the Navy. He passed G.C.E.O/L at Orubendiwewa Maha Vidyalaya. I think he is the first to join the Navy from our region, Kumari told the Daily News.
Adivasi Heenbanddiyala aththo said he was happy and proud as his great grandson has brought prestige to their tribe by becoming the first to join the Navy from their community.

Agriculture development programme to enhance farmers income
The government's intention is to implement the agriculture development programme to enable the farmers to enhance their income, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said. Dissanayaka said, Simultaneously the farmers are being encouraged to ensure and prioritize the qualitative character of their farming, storing and marketing practices.
The minister said so participating at the state sponsored World Food Day national ceremony at the Institute Post Harvest Technology, Anuradhapura on October 16, aiming to eradicate malnutrition and hunger in the world.
The programme was organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Food Programme in collaboration with the Agriculture Ministry.
The minister said the farmer community has been focusing more attention on gaining profits as much as possible from cultivation.
It has been a tradition on the part of officials too responsible for upgrading agriculture to educate the farmers in achieving an unprecedented harvest from whatever they cultivate, such as paddy, maize, soya, undhu, etc. But in the past our agriculture depended on its qualitative nature.
Dissanayaka indicated that at present the Agriculture Minister has been encouraging the farmers to take to grow traditional native paddy which are consisting herbal value, sans artificial fertilizer and poisonous agro chemicals thus showcasing and reflecting qualitative agriculture.
President Maithripala Sirisena has a far sighted national agriculture policy to ensure lucrative income to the farmer and qualitative aspect of the national agriculture development exercise. On this basis under the guidance of the President a three year food production national programme was initiated recently.
The main objective of this project is to gain self-sufficiency in every food crop that could be locally cultivated successfully. Following this precedent we have been implementing an 83,000 hectares large maize cultivation project in Anuradhapura district in the 015/2016 maha cultivation season aiming to stop importing of 1,500 mt of maize annually, the minister said. He said that the country was self-sufficient in paddy. Also in the efforts to become self sufficient in maize, a micro interest loan facility was being offered to maize farmers at Rs. 1,500 per acre, he revealed.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Sri Lanka Residential Representative, Beth Crawford said that Sri Lanka has received the membership of the FAO around 60 years back. Where as the FAO commemorating the 70th anniversary in 2015.
It is a fact that 75 percent of the world population suffer from poverty. They shall be educated regarding social security. The poverty level in Sri Lanka which stood at 10 percent in 2002 has dropped up to 6.7 percent which is a good omen, she said.

Antarcticas Ice Shelves worry scientists
ANTARCTICA: When it comes to climate change, Antarctica is one of the worlds major places of concern, mostly because of the sheer amount of ice it contains - enough to theoretically cause about 200 feet of sea-level rise if it were all to melt - not that anyone thinks that will happen anytime soon. Still, smaller parts could be destabilized, and understanding how the Antarctic ice sheet will react to future climate change is a big priority for scientists.
One important key to building this understanding is studying Antarctic ice shelves, which are large, floating platforms of ice - sometimes spanning hundreds or thousands of square miles - that form where where an ice sheet meets the ocean.
They play an incredibly important role in constraining the flow of this land ice into the ocean, says Luke Trusel, a postdoctoral scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, comparing ice shelves to the cork in a champagne bottle. If an ice shelf breaks off, it can unleash a flow of ice into the ocean from the ice sheet behind it, which can contribute to sea-level rise in a major way.
Indeed, without ice shelves to provide buttressing, glaciers behind the ice shelves flow faster, pouring more and more ice into the ocean.
In order to get a better grip on how climate change could affect Antarctic ice shelves, Trusel and a group of other researchers conducted a study to see how rising air temperatures might affect surface melting in Antarctica. This is a process that can directly influence the destabilizing of ice shelves.
Past observations have shown that as ice melts on a shelfs surface, the melted water starts to pool, or pond, and trickle down into imperfections in the ice, causing the cracks to deepen and widen - which can eventually cause ice shelves to collapse, unleashing the flow of land ice behind them.
Increases in air temperature, and surface melt and ponding, has led to the abrupt and catastrophic collapse of a number of ice shelves, says Trusel, lead author of the study, which was published Monday in Nature Geoscience. These collapses have mostly been observed on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the thinning and retreat of ice shelves has been particularly pronounced, thanks to higher-than-average warming in the area. The concern, though, is that more ice shelves that ring around Antarctica, including its colder regions, will start to give way as temperatures continue to rise and that other more inland parts of Antarctica will then follow suit.
The researchers used models to investigate the potential future impacts of two different climate scenarios: a business-as-usual trajectory, in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the century, and a more middle-of-the-road trajectory, in which emissions start declining before mid-century and theres less associated global warming.
They found that under both scenarios, Antarctic-wide surface melt doubles by the year 2050, with the amount of meltwater produced coming close to 200 gigatons per year (a gigaton is a billion metric tons).
This is a troubling finding, said Nerilie Abram, a researcher from the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at Australian National University who was not involved with the study, in an e-mail to The Post.
But, she said, I think that the more interesting result is to look at the huge divergence in predicted Antarctic ice melt during the second half of the century.

[APPRECIATIONS - (19-Oct-2015)]
INDRA WICKRAMASINGHE :
He was a jack of all trades
I write this in appreciation of a man, who ably supported by my mother, instilled in me the values that guide my role in society, and in my resolve to honour his memory. Three years had crept by, the pain lingers, but the lessons learnt over many years still serve as pathway lights in my journey into the future.
My father was a public servant, an officer of the Ceylon Administrative Service, and a strict disciplinarian even with the four of us children. Looking back, I feel it has held us in good stead. Any task he undertook was accomplished with passionate fervour.
He was a stickler for detail and a stringent observer of punctuality. He valued hard work, self-reliance, integrity, and bid us do the same. He was a jack of all trades, and ensured that my three brothers in particular learnt skills they would find handy later in life. Being the only daughter in the family made little difference, although I could never master the intricacies of fixing a brake plate in the car despite acting as his "junior mechanic" on numerous occasions.
Idealism, disillusionment, and also as my mother opines, his stubbornness in refusing to consult his influential friends resulted in his early retirement from the public service at a turning point in his career when he could have continued to reach its zenith.
The most profound memories of my father are stories of how he never abandoned people at risk of facing danger. On travels between his outstation posts and Colombo in the 60s and 70s, he had on several instances personally intervened to stop a violent street brawl and carry seriously injured men to the nearest hospital in his car, going way beyond his call of duty.
His personality was such that when the occasion required he could severely intimidate the most notorious thugs into meekness merely with his booming voice and courageous bearing and an attitude that could only have been driven by a powerful sense of righteousness. Even in his mid-70s, I was once momentarily at a loss when he attempted to scale an iron gate in a house to rush to the aid of its elderly occupant, a stranger to us, who had tripped and knocked his head on the paved garden.
An incident during his funeral remains etched in my mind. A string-hopper seller in the neighbourhood visited our home in Dehiwela to pay his respects and lamented that he had come to know only too late about my father who had served in his village in Baddegama many years ago.
He recounted seeing my father - who could not swim a stroke - braving the rage of Gin Ganga floods to lead food distribution operations in boats, ensuring that all government supplies reached the hapless families. While listening, I suddenly recalled an event my father related, how during these floods when the divisional office had to await boats from Colombo, he had sat through an entire cold night under a makeshift hut lit by a few kerosene lanterns helping an engineer fix a damaged boat so that it could be used to distribute relief supplies the very next morning.
In his public service career, he was never one to wait for things to happen, but the catalyst who made things happen. The string-hopper vendor said he remembered these events from 45 years ago as a young boy because the image of a young, energetic civil servant immaculately dressed in white trousers and long sleeved shirt in the thick of things had deeply impressed the flood-ravaged villagers as being genuinely empathetic towards them. As the daughter of a public servant, myself being one, I could not have been prouder.
A week after his passing, I picked up the last book he had been reading, from the exact spot it had been left on the cane stool when the illness overcame him and it was no longer possible to indulge in his cherished pursuit. It was a two-volume leather-bound book titled The Spirit of Laws by Montesquieu and the Social Contract by Rousseau.
A few pages into the book and tears welled in my eyes, partly out of regret for not heeding my father's exhortations to delve into such classics so that we may spend hours dissecting and discussing the complexities and nuances of their wisdom.
I shall despair these lost opportunities monumentally, for I am yet to come across a person who could offer the same intellectual succour or possessed the remarkable ability to impart life's lessons as appropriate, to people of various stations, young and old, who sought his counsel.
Thaththi, in his student days, was an accomplished scholar and an athlete,and had won the Wesley College coveted Hill Medal in 1951. My mother's efforts to preserve the number of trophies he had won were futile, as he had the habit of using them in his various carpentry and motor mechanic hobbies only to be discarded when their utility value waned.
He was a fine orator in both English and Sinhala languages and had held many an audience spell bound during his career days. Despite his tough personality, he was greatly sensitive towards unfortunate circumstances of ordinary people as well as animals. As children, we kept many pets but learnt they needed their own space as well. Even a few little fish had to have a large tank so that their movements were not restricted. On two occasions, in a feat that amazed our neighbours, he rallied my brothers to trap poisonous cobras that had stealthily moved into our garden from the thicket behind our home and release them safely into the wild.
Having no experience with snakes of any kind, and relying solely on his wits to formulate a humane way of trapping them, his only desire would have been to prevent unnecessary harm to these creatures of nature while protecting us as well. Growing up, it was these experiences that shaped my views on the liberties and freedoms of beast as well as of man.
My father was proud when each of his four children scored achievements in life. And having resolved early in our childhood not to spoon feed us, he was prouder when he knew that behind these achievements lay great personal effort and initiative on our part. It was his philosophy to expect us to make best use of whatever resources my parents gave us to shape our destinies. Years into my future, inadvertently or not, I will continue to draw inspiration from the beliefs and convictions of my father.
Thinking of him, I am reminded of a quote I read somewhere, sometime: "There are men; and then there are lions among men". One such was our father.
May Thaththi attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana !

EARDLEY PERERA, PC:
His generosity was limitless
October 20, 2015 marks the 90th birth anniversary of President's Counsel Eardley Perera. He was an outstanding criminal lawyer with a brilliant mind.
He was also a warm, generous and a sincere human being. He had a magnetic personality that drew people to him.
All who knew him, loved him. I had the privilege of knowing him as a friend. Today as I reflect on his life, I wish to pen a few thoughts about Eardley from the perspective of a friend.
My friendship with Eardley began in 1950 when he visited my filling station to seek my advice on a matter regarding a car.
I felt a rapport with him right away which I later recognised as one of Eardley's many unique qualities. He could effortlessly connect with people from all walks of life. From then on, our acquaintance developed into a friendship that lasted for over 50 years.
Though we were poles apart in academics, sport and fame, our friendship flourished. When I was admitted to St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa in 1942, Eardley had already left to join St. Joseph's College, Colombo to pursue higher studies, and as such, I cannot claim to have known him at school. Having obtained a first division in the London Matriculation Examination, he joined the Law College in Colombo and passed out as an Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon in 1948. Though an old Joe, he preferred to call himself a Sebastianite for as long as I remember.
Eardley married Shirley in 1956 and I married Ruth in 1959. Our wives cemented our friendship even further. Although Eardley and Ruth are no longer with us, I make sure to visit Shirley from time to time and talk about our good old days. This cheers us both. Both Shirley and Ruth loved to sing. This meant that our parties were highly memorable occasions with music and dancing. Eardley and Shirley were great hosts; they had an open house where all were welcome.
They often included us even in their family functions. We in turn had countless parties that often lasted till the wee hours of the morning with dancing and singing around the piano.
Eardley loved every minute of it.
Eardley's generosity was limitless. He was someone who shared even his friends. Ruth's job required her to go on circuit, and being a woman traveling to different parts of the island, she didn't always feel comfortable to stay overnight at outstation hotels. Eardley solved the problem by introducing us to many of his lawyer friends from all over the country where Ruth could feel comfortable and safe.
As a result many of their good friends became our friends too. Similarly, when our children started school, Eardley insisted that they travel with his own children in their car rather than taking the school bus. Eardley's children who were equally large hearted, happily took our children on board when their car was already full, not just with Eardley's children but also his sisters' children.
Eardley was also humble enough to receive help from others when he needed it. He instinctively knew the right person to go to on any matter, even when it involved legal affairs. I recall an instance from the early 60's when Sri Lanka nationalised the oil industry. During this time, the oil companies were required to hand over all stock for valuation. A depot superintendent of one of the companies was found to have a large shortage.
The company dismissed the man and filed action against him without thorough investigation. Eardley defended the superintendent. Me being in the oil trade, Eardley asked for my advice. I suggested that he ask the person who carried out the investigation whether he realised that the soil in that area was sandy. This being the case, the tank containing the oil could shift, and that could lead to a wrong reading. As a corrective measure, I advised that they use a spirit level to confirm whether the tank was perfectly horizontal. I do not know to what extent Eardley used this advice, but subsequently, the defendant was acquitted.
Both Eardley and Shirley were extremely mindful of the poor. Shirley went to great lengths to make life a little better for the poorest of the poor.
It was common practice on the last Sunday of the month for beggars who came for alms to be given a scrub and a bath. One domestic would hold the hose while another gave a scrub. Following the bath, they were given a new set of clothes and a scrumptious lunch. Shirley also had the practice of donating wheel chairs to needy individuals and organisations.
Eardley had a remarkable ability to make others feel important. People felt comfortable and at ease with him. It was always a pleasure to be around him. Not just his family, friends and colleagues, but even the domestic staff and chauffeurs were treated with respect and dignity. It seemed that his Catholic faith had a very real grip on him. His life demonstrated the famous words that many people remember from the American Declaration of Independence that are sometimes attributed to President Thomas Jefferson, that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."
Today we remember Eardley for many things. He was an inspirational figure who profoundly impacted all who came into contact with him. He worked extremely hard, yet he loved his work so much that it didn't seem like work to him. He excelled in his craft. He lived a life of generosity. It might even be a good day for those in his field, to visit the Colombo Law Library and view the bust that stands in his honour, and be inspired. Eardley Perera died on December 30, 2004. The children invited me to be one of the pallbearers. As I stood with my hand on the casket I was acutely aware that this was the passing of a Sri Lankan legend who I had the privilege to call friend.

LIONEL GANGE:
A simple man with a big heart
Lionel Gange, the social and religious worker, humanist and down to earth personality is no more.
He breathed his last about two weeks back after a brief illness. His demise was sudden and never expected by his family members and close friends.
He was a very popular and prominent personality in and around Boralasgamuwa and the vast crowd that thronged his residence and Nedimala cemetery was testimony to his popularity.
He was a charming and simple man whose life was dedicated to various associations and welfare activities, specially his alma mater Sri Sumangala Maha Vidyalaya, Hikkaduwa.
He was a live wire at school activities, be it the Old Boys' Association events, prize givings, sports meets and school development activities.
He was also a follower and ardent supporter of cricket. He was a regular writer of articles for daily newspapers on cricket and a mobile library on cricket history.
He was very enthusiastic to take part in social activities of relatives, neighbours and friends. The vacuum that has been created due to his sudden death can never be filled. His death was sudden, but his life was not faint.
His memory will always be with us and his legacy will continue through his children. A great friend of many, we are grateful for having known you.
As for me I have lost a relative, a good friend and above all a simple man with a big heart. May his sojourn in Sansara be short and be blessed with the supreme bliss of Nibbana.

L.D.Dickman:
Loved by everyone
L.D. Dickman, Senior Town Planner and Fellow ITPSL passed away recently after having been ill for some time. Despite being ill, Dickman never lost his spirits or his sense of humour and entertained everyone who visited him at his residence to inquire after his health.
Dickman was extraordinary in many ways. He continued to work despite his physical disability. Anyone else would have taken complete rest from work but not Dickman. What inspired Dickman to be different A historical sketch of the family indicates that the young Dickman accompanied his mother to the temple every poya day and observed sil along with her on every such occasion.
His religious upbringing perhaps enabled him to let go the past and live very much in the present- one of the cardinal principles of the Buddhist philosophy.
Dickman seems to have entertained socialist ideas very early in life. He turned out to be a firebrand socialist during his university days and continued to voice the plight of the economically under privileged. Dickman was a willing participant in all demonstrations against social injustices and never hesitated to show his protest against such real or perceived atrocities.
I came to know Dickman when he joined the then Katubedda Campus of the University of Sri Lanka to pursue a course of study leading to the M.Sc.in Town and Country Planning in 1975.
Dickman at that time possessed a B.Sc. degree in Public Administration from the then Vidyodaya Campus of the University of Sri Lanka. Prior to joining Moratuwa he worked as a research assistant at the Marga Institute where he worked from 1972 to 1975.
Dickman was a very enthusiastic participant in the M.Sc. degree programme but retained his strong views on politics. Responding to a question from the British external examiner at the final M.Sc. dissertation examination he strongly criticised what he referred to as imperialism and hegemony to the amusement of everybody. However he passed the final examination hands down.
After obtaining the M.Sc. degree in Town and Country Planning (1997) Dickman joined the Colombo Master Plan Project under the UNDP as a physical planner and acquired valuable experience in various aspects of physical planning. Identification of new town projects, action programmes on town improvement projects, preparation of a regional structure plan and action programmes for metro schools were some of his assignments.
After completion of two years on the job, he joined the Board of Investment (BOI) as a manager in 1979 and continued in the post till 1986. Thereafter he continued to hold several top posts in the BOI- Additional Senior Manager 1986/90, Director Regional Development 1990/99 and Executive Director1999/2005. Thereafter he was promoted as Deputy Director General Infra structure in 2005 and continued in that post till the end of 2009.
He thereafter left the BOI and joined Lanka Mirigama Special Economic Zone (PLC) as Deputy General Manager in2010/11 and thereafter served Vallibel (PLC) as General Manager 2011/14. Dickman indeed had a marvellous career as a planner, manager and administrator in planning related assignments.
Dickman was also keen to pursue his academic interests and found time off his busy schedule to work with the universities. He functioned as a visiting lecturer in Town Planning in the Faculty of Management of the Sri Jayawardenapura University and also in the Department of Town and Country Planning of the Moratuwa University. Additionally he was a Council member of the Chamber of Construction Industry.
Dickman visited many countries and attended meetings, conferences, workshops and forums on a number of issues related to his profession. These inter-alia comprised investment promotion, industrial zones, IT parks and urban property development.
As a town planner he made available his services to the Institute of Town Planners at all times. He was the inaugural Treasurer of the ITPSL and continued in that position for a number of years. He also served the ITPSL in many other positions at different times. These comprise council member, Assistant Secretary 1989/90, President Elect 2007/09 and President 2009/11.
Throughout his career, Dickman had been a very dedicated worker. He had been noted for his intelligence, diligence and hard working nature. He had in fact received letters of commendation from two different Director Generals of the BOI in 1994 and 1998.
Despite his numerous professional obligations pertaining to his profession he was indeed totally devoted to his family. He was in fact a very affectionate husband to Puspha. She in turn was a very courageous and devoted wife who did everything in her power to save Dickman's life.
Their son Binuka and daughter Paba were very fond of the father who doted on them throughout until his untimely death. He was proud of his children who did well in their studies and advanced as young professionals. Both children are now happily married.
Dickman was indeed a cheerful person and loved by everyone. May he attain the bliss of Nibbana.

Desmond Dharmarajah :
A big brother to his friends
"Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave behind us, footprints on the sands of time." Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
We were deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing away of our dear friend Desmond Dharmarajah on October 6, 2015.
Desmond had his education at St. Peter's college. He was an outstanding sportsman and represented his college in both cricket and rugby football. He also represented the mercantile sector in hockey and basket ball.
He was a big brother to his friends and was looked up to with a lot of love and affection. He always stood tall, standing by his principles and in more recent times spent many a Sunday morning together reminiscing on the days gone by.
What strikes me most when I remember Desmond is that he was a man of God. I'm not saying that because he was a church goer and held office at the Mirihana church but because of the life he lead.
And as we read in Micah 6: 8 ...what does the LORD require of you.. but to do justice, and to love kindness and to walk humbly with your God  amply describes Desmond. He was a devout family man, a proud grand father and a true and loyal friend. He will be missed not only by his wife Violet and children Darrel, Dalrene , Russel and their families but by all of us who knew him. And how we wish that he would have been there to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary in January. But it was not to be and he was gone before we knew it. And yet he was ready to meet his maker.
"For when the One Great Scorer comes to write against your name, He writes - not that you won or lost - but how you played the game."
May the turf lie gently on you and may the holy angels welcome you to your heavenly abode.

Clinton outspends all rivals in building campaign juggernaut
US: Hillary Clinton spent $26 million over the summer building up her 2016 campaign, more than any of her rivals either within her own Democratic party or the Republican side, as she sought to build a formidable organization to help her capture the White House. The former first lady and secretary of state who lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign poured money into television advertising, the amassing of polling data and building a digital operation to reach as many voters as possible. Her biggest expense was the payroll for the 511 people her campaign employs, figures released Thursday show.
Clinton is attempting to strike a delicate balance. She's willing to spend the money to build an operation that no one else vying for the White House can compete with. At the same time, she wants to keep spending in check so that the campaign's budget doesn't spiral out of control.
It's a challenge rooted in her first run for the White House in 2008, when her campaign grew so large that she spent her way into debt and internal power struggles among her large staff exploded into the public view.
Campaign aides this time around have made a big splash about their frugal ways - top officials ride the bus instead of the train, staffers share rooms in low-budget hotels.
Take for example her Des Moines, Iowa office - responsible for ensuring she wins the crucial first state. The three-room suite sits atop a hair salon. No two pieces of furniture match. Duct tape holds a sign up in the makeshift kitchen. And the curtains appear to be older than anyone working there.
But even if the campaign has been mindful of trimming costs, that doesn't mean they aren't spending money.
After Clinton, the two campaigns that spent the most during the quarter were those of Republicans Jeb Bush and Ben Carson. But their spending combined matched the spending her campaign racked up on its own during the three-month period.
Clinton's spending included $560,000 on private jets and she owes the charter company another $65,000 in billing that is still being processed. In that same time period, she spent more than $71,000 on office security. She spent more than $31,000 on licensing for music and other media. She spent just over $4,000 on sign-language interpreters.
The expenditures came as she raised a hefty $28 million in the third quarter of this year and managed to build up a war chest of cash that her campaign has on hand for the coming months, according to fund-raising reports filed Thursday.
But Clinton's so-called "burn rate" - the pace at which her campaign spent money in the three months ending September 30 - was 86 percent, a number that far outpaced rivals like Bernie Sanders, who spent only 43 percent, or Republican Ted Cruz who spent 57 percent. Her burn rate was nearly identical to that of Republican Jeb Bush.
Having enough money in the bank became a significant problem for Clinton in 2008. She ran her campaign into $12 million in debt as she tried unsuccessfully to defeat Obama in the primary. Plus, she loaned her campaign $13 million more to keep it running.
When Clinton began to flounder in 2008, the large staff was plagued by infighting. The internal rifts went public and quickly defined her campaign.
Clinton's campaign officials say they are on the right track when it comes to fundraising. They point to the number of small dollar donors - 93 percent of donations in the previous quarter were less than $100. Clinton's aides also say the campaign remains on target to raise its goal of $100 million, a figure that is being used to craft the budget.
Her campaign argues that the large staff is an investment in infrastructure that will pay dividends later. The campaign has hired a data analytics team, which a campaign official said will be key to improving the ability to contact voters. "We have put a premium on organizing and built a formidable team early," a campaign official said.
Between her existing sizable fundraising haul and personal wealth, it's unlikely Clinton's campaign will run out of money. But if campaign cash starts to become tight, such a large staff could become an albatross. Candidates are always loath to cut staff or scale back infrastructure for fear of creating an impression of a troubled campaign

Director of film on Sri Lankan journalist moves High Court
A Bangalore-based film director has moved the Madras High Court, challenging the order of Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, refusing certification to Porkalathil Oru Poo, a Tamil film based on the life of LTTE journalist Isaipriya.
Director K. Ganeshan submitted that he directed the film based on the telecast made by London-based Channel  4 on the war between the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE.
I came to know about the Tamil News Reader Isaipriya through the telecast and I thought I could direct a Tamil film based on her real life, Mr. Ganesan said.I completed the production of the film in May 2015. By that time, the Tamil Nadu government adopted a resolution for an impartial, international and independent probe into the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, the petitioner added.
The resolution was moved by Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa. Since it reflected the stand of the State government on the Sri Lankan issue, I wanted to include the video of passing of the resolution by the Chief Minister in my film, Mr. Ganesan said.
On May 6, the petitioner applied to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Chennai, for certification, which was rejected on the ground that the film is against friendly relation with a foreign State, contending that it carried scenes degrading women. (The Hindu)

Family divided by Koreas turbulent past seeks comfort in reunion
KOREA: The members of families split and then permanently separated by the 1950-53 Korean War carry many sad memories and stories, but few that are as unique and dramatic as Park Yun-Dong's.
One of the lucky South Koreans selected to take part in a rare family reunion to be held in North Korea next week, the 90-year-old is bracing for an emotional meeting with the family of his younger brother, who died four years ago.
There won't be another time. I'm old and I know we won't be meeting each other again, Park told AFP in his small, neat apartment in Ansan, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of Seoul.
I want to tell them how important it is that the two sides of the family don't forget about each other, he said.
And I want to them to know about the family history, about what happened to us.
Millions of people were separated during the three-year Korean conflict, which sealed the division between the two countries.
Most died without having a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the border, across which all civilian communication is banned.
But Park's family history is very particular.
He is what is known as a Sakhalin Korean -- a community whose ordeal began in the 1940s and outlasted both the Korean War and the far longer Cold War that followed.
Park was born in 1925 in Pyeongchang, now a well-known ski resort in the east of South Korea which will host next year's Winter Olympics.
At the time, the Korean peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule and when he was 18, Park was among 150,000 Koreans forced to relocate to Sakhalin -- an island off the far eastern end of Russia -- to work in coal mines and lumber yards providing raw materials to fuel Tokyo's World War II efforts.
In the end his entire family relocated, including his parents, three brothers and younger sister.
Days before the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Soviet troops took over the island, and Park and his family suddenly found themselves -- and their fate -- under new administration.
The Japanese on Sakhalin were repatriated and nearly two thirds of the Koreans on the island joined them in the hope of finding opportunities in Japan's post-war reconstruction. The roughly 43,000 Koreans who wanted to return home faced a dilemma as the Korean peninsula was now divided along the 38th parallel into the Soviet-controlled North and US-controlled South.
As the division hardened and then cemented with the Korean War, the plight of the Sakhalin Koreans became starker.
The Soviet Union had no diplomatic ties with the South Korea and -- with the Cold War gathering pace -- Seoul was wary of allowing back thousands of people whose loyalties might not be guaranteed.
So, the only return option was to North Korea, said Park. And that was the option his younger brother took, moving to the North in 1960 to study medicine.
In the hope that the political winds would shift, the rest of the family stayed, embarking on what would turn into half a century of stateless exile on Sakhalin.
We felt totally abandoned, he said. Our one desire was to go home, but our homeland refused us.
Only when the Soviet Union collapsed did things begin to change and Park, along with his two remaining brothers and sister, finally moved back to South Korea in 2000.

PM tells The Straits Times
Final phase war deaths fewer than thought
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday estimates of death during the final phase of the war in Sri Lanka might be fewer than thought.
In an interview with The Straits Times yesterday, the Prime Minister said while no firm estimates of deaths are available, his own sense was that the numbers may be fewer than thought.
The governments top priority now is national reconciliation. President Sirisena had called an All-Party Conference on the issue and the government was considering setting up a Missing Persons Office, the Prime Minister said.
However, he indicated, allowing foreign judges to join Sri Lankan judges in special courts to try war crimes, as suggested by a UN human rights report, may be trickier.
Already, foreign judges have participated in our commissions of inquiry. In the last two commissions foreign judges actually formed the panel that advised the councils. So, the question is, do we go up to that point or do we go further and have a foreign judge sitting on the Bench that will go on for some time, he said.
The next priority was to restore the democratic institutions that, he said, had suffered under Mr Rajapaksa. This was one of the reasons why the government was pushing to end the executive presidency with a Cabinet system of government.
The Chief Justice was unceremoniously thrown out by him, Mr. Wickremesinghe said. The rule of law had suffered. We had a proud record of democracy. Ours is the oldest parliament in Asia -our legislative council was formed in 1835.
Sri Lankas economy has accelerated since the end of the civil war and Mr. Wickremesinghe said he thought average growth rates of 7 per cent are achievable. At the same time, the economy is also feeling headwinds from the China slowdown and the prospects of interest rate hikes in the West, which could impact on his countrys ability to repay loans. Beyond that,the government is considering the next steps for economic reform, THE PM said.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is going to make a change in the Asian regional economy. All countries have to take note of TPP,he said.
And then,there is China and India. We are looking at our own location, and our natural resources and human skills. We are doing an Economic and Technological Cooperation Partnership with India. A Free Trade Agreement with China will follow and hopefully, also with Singapore after that.
Commenting on Sri Lankas bilateral relations, the Prime Minister said, We have put out the criterion for visits by naval ships. Under that, ships including submarines from all countries can visit Sri Lanka.
As far as we are concerned if it is a friendly visit we will inform the neighbouring countries and we will spread out the (frequency of the)visits.
The problem with the last visit by a Chinese submarine was that India claims it was not informed. So far, from what we found out, that seems to be correct. he added.

"Good Governance " has not dawned yet - Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday noted that the "good governance" which people expected has not dawned yet as the present government has failed to fully defeat the corrupt political elements of the past regime.
Speaking to the grass roots organizers of his party in Batticaloa, Fonseka said that as the person who defeated former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was no big deal for him to defeat the Rajapaksa followers.
He said that those who surrounded Rajapaksa in the past were aligning themselves with the current rulers and added that as long as the trend continues the government will find it difficult to usher the good governance which it promised to the people.
He also said that his Democratic Party will contest the forth coming Provincial Council election alone.

President Sirisena added that the country's development plan may change from time to time due to political decisions which is not healthy situation for a country which is driven by development. Therefore, it is a timely need to bring the country forward with a common mechanism, which is free from political background.
The President while highlighting the need of identifying development priorities said that several four way carpet-roads constructed in the last regime are not properly utilised since the failure of identifying the development priorities prior to commencing those development projects. The government is engaging in building a peaceful environment suitable to live peacefully and happily for every ethic in a brotherly manner.
No room will be left to have conflict again. He said that unlike the past no room is also left for ethnic hatred, he stressed.

Pope to visit mosque, slum, refugee camp in Africa: Vatican
VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis will visit a refugee camp and a mosque in the Central African Republic as well as a slum in Kenya during a trip to Africa next month loaded with potential security risks.
The pontiff will be in Kenya from November 25 to 27, spend the next two days in Uganda and travel on to the Central African Republic (CAR), where the trip will end on November 30, according to a Vatican itinerary published Saturday.
The three countries have significant Catholic communities and have been troubled by civil conflicts and violence, which will increase concerns surrounding possible attacks during the visit.
In Nairobi, Francis will tour the Kangemi slum, home to some 100,000 people who live in shacks without sewerage systems, including 20,000 who belong to the local Catholic parish.
Though he regularly visited slums in Buenos Aires in his native Argentina before becoming pope, Francis's tendency to head off unannounced from secured areas to mingle with the crowds will be a headache for his bodyguards.
Islamic rebels have staged a string of attacks in Kenya, including the April massacre at Garissa university in which 148 people -- mostly Christians -- died, and the 2013 assault on the Westgate shopping mall that killed 67.

She said, "looking forward UN Secretary- General Ban Ki- Moon has described 17 goals in the SDGs as a "To Do List" for the people and the planet ."
"Sri Lanka is enthusiastic and optimistic in this regard," she said.
Remembering President Maithripala Sirisena's participation at the the UN General Assembly last month, she said," speaking at the Assembly, President Sirisena assured world leaders that the government of Sri Lanka hopes to fully achieving these goals fully by 2030.
"In particular, the President said that Sri Lanka will act with determination as a pioneer of Eco-sensitive civilization that is emerging in the 21 st century,." she said and added " the President also said that Sri Lanka will give special attention to poverty alleviation, which is SDG one, achieving food security -SDG number two, energy-, Education SDG-4 and minimizing income disparity ten and Urban Development -SDG eleven."
" Sri Lanka has served as a model for other countries in terms of demonstrating the importance of policies such as free education and free health to promote human development. Sri Lanka has performed strongly against the Millennium Development Goals or the MDGs. At international levels Sri Lanka has achieved most of their MDGs,"she pointed out.
"2015 is a land mark year for the UN as for it marks the the deadline for the MDGs," she said.
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha De Silva said "It is a special year for Sri Lanka in terms of its foreign policy as we join the world community in celebrating the 70th anniversary of the UN, we also celebrate the 60 th anniversary of Sri Lanka's membership to the UN."
"What is significant here is that these twin anniversaries coincide with Sri Lanka's renewed engagement with the UN and its systems and procedures as well as the intentional community at large under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe," he said.
"For long years, Sr Lanka has been playing an important role in the UN, abiding by the principals of the UN Charter and contributing to its work.
Similarly, Sri Lanka has immensely benefited from the work of the UN and its agencies, including the FAO,"he said.

and the international community as a whole. It was an unfamiliar position for us and for the international community,"he said.

"The government's policies including the 100-Day Work Programme is aligned with the UN Charter principles. And as people of our country has so clearly demonstrated at two elections this year in January and in August, the vision that people of Sri Lanka have for their country is also in line with
those principles," he pointed out.
"They voted for strengthening the rule of law and democratic institutions, for reconciliation, for development of the country, for equality, for human rights and against the the politics of of ethnic and religious division."
"Although the modern international system is based on the concept of sovereign states and borders defining them we all know that we all have only one planet to call home," he stated.
"Our world more than any other era in history is today interconnected. No one country irrespective of its size can succeed on its own. In this context it is a fact that nations succeed when the pursue an inclusive
peace and prosperity within their their own countries and work cooperatively with countries beyond their borders."
" It is impossible to create all the jobs and produce all the food and commodities required if we do not trade with each other, invest in each others economies,and share knowledge, expertise and technologies," he said.
"The government is determined to ensure peace that has been achieved through eradication of terrorism is a durable peace which guarantees prosperity to all," he said,"For this purpose, we will work to ensure
democratic norms, good governance, rule of law, human rights, universal value of equality, justice and freedom are upheld by fostering the reconciliation between communities and securing a political settlement."
"Just five years after becoming a member of the UN on December 14, 1995, Sri Lanka , obviously then Ceylon, was elected as a non permanent member of the UN security council. Many distinguished Sri Lankans have held important
positions in the UN and its various agencies. Many Sri Lankans have chaired many important UN confereces, such as the Conference of the Law of the Sea, the historic NPT Review and Extension Conference in 1995, "Conference on Iliicit Trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons," he stated.
"Sri Lanka has held the position of the President of the General Assembly and Vice President of the International Court of Justice."
"In 1971, Sri Lanka initiated the declaration of the Indian Ocean as the Zone of Peace. In 1999, the UN General Assembly unanimously endorsed the resolution moved by Sri Lanka to mark Vesak as a UN Day of observance," he said.

The programme was conducted centralizing the Madurawela, Dankanda, Madakubura and Dambagolla Grama-seva divisions. The villagers were educated regarding a natural disaster which may occur in the area and they were trained on how to save their lives in such a situation.
Assistant Director of Disaster Management Unit - Matale, Chaminda Amaraweera said the training is vital regarding the natural disaster. "When a natural disaster occurs, we should be determined to save our lives. The people would organise to face such incidents in groups. It is very important," he said.

Tricky issue of gender pay gap surfaces in White House race
US: The persistent pay gap between women and men in the United States -- right up to Hollywood stars -- is emerging as a 2016 campaign issue, but experts say its root causes are complex.
Working American women took home 21 percent less than men in 2014, according to a recent Census Bureau report.
Sexual equality at work is a subject of constant debate in the United States, where President Barack Obama speaks often of the future of his teenage daughters and the unfairness of gender stereotypes.
Of all the issues facing working women in the United States, four out of 10 Americans say equal pay is the most pressing, according to a 2014 Gallup poll.
A string of recent studies and high-profile lawsuits including in Silicon Valley have highlighted a persistent gender pay gap.
One of Hollywood's top movie stars Jennifer Lawrence just penned an essay hitting out at sexism in the industry, after discovering she was paid less than her male co-stars.
But the pay gap cannot be blamed on sexism alone, according to Cornell University economics professor Francine Blau.
Discrimination probably plays a role, she said, but it is hard to quantify.
What is certain, is that male domination of certain industries and the lack of affordable child care are factors in explaining why many women are unable to reach high-paying jobs.
The disparity has become a hot-button issue as election season heats up, especially among Democrats, who are hammering home the point that women earn less than their male counterparts.
According to Blau, however, the census figure suggesting a 21 percent pay gap is misleading.
When controlling for variables such as work experience, education, occupation and industry, the real gap shrinks to as low as nine percent, she said.
Education no longer tips the scales in men's favor, Blau said, because women on average now have more education than men.
The male advantage in pay terms stems mainly from dominance in lucrative professions such as law, engineering, and highly skilled factory positions, Blau said. Lower paid jobs such as teaching and nursing have traditionally been considered female jobs.
Still, activists say that even a small pay gap harms women.
Women are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their lifetime, said Vicki Shabo of the National Partnership for Women & Families.
Lisa Maatz, the top policy adviser at the American Association of University Women, said she does get frustrated with people who say it's only seven percent, it's only 10 percent.
Anybody who is working and trying to make ends meet, ten percent more is a huge deal, said Maatz, AAUW vice president of government relations.
Though the pay gap has narrowed over the past 30 years, progress has largely stalled, adding fuel to the Democratic Party's call for legislation to bring women's pay into line with their male colleagues.
It is unconscionable that women earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to men who perform the same work, fumed Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail earlier this year.
With an eye on women's votes, Democrats have railed against Republicans blocking legislation in Congress that would strengthen federal anti-discrimination policies.
California, under Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, recently moved to address the gender pay gap with a law reversing the burden of proof in discrimination complaints: Now employers must prove there was no discrimination, instead of the employees.
But conservatives say that focusing on discrimination diverts attention from more complex social factors holding women back, as well hard-to-quantify individual career choices.
You can't hold your employer responsible for larger cultural norms over which he has no control, said Andrew Biggs, an economist at American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
Cornell's Blau points to research suggesting that women tend to shy away from competition, which could lead them to avoid high-paying sectors and jobs. Women also typically engage less in salary negotiations than men -- although this leads back to the debate about discrimination and gender stereotyping.
Disturbingly, there's increasing evidence that women get more negative responses when they negotiate, Blau said.
Even the Oscar-winning Lawrence admits hitting a wall in negotiations, saying she failed to press for higher pay for fear of being labeled difficult or spoiled.
I don't think I've ever worked for a man in charge who spent time contemplating what angle he should use to have his voice heard. It's just heard, she wrote.
Another key issue -- repeatedly raised on the campaign trail -- is the state of child care in a country where public education does not begin until a child is five years old. Unlike many developed countries, the United States has no subsidized universal child-care programme. Women raising children tend to avoid companies that do not offer flexible hours or telework, narrowing their employment options. Making workplaces more flexible would be a good starting point for more equal chances, activists and economists agree.

UN's Blue Helmets to protect world's heritage from IS: Italy
SYRIA: Italy said Saturday that UNESCO has approved its suggestion to have the United Nation's famous Blue Helmets protect heritage sites around the world from attacks by Islamist militants.
"UNESCO has said yes to the Cultural Blue Helmets," Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said in a statement, adding that 53 countries voted in favour after the destruction of sites including Palmyra in Syria by the Islamic State group.
"Faced with IS terrorist attacks and the terrible images of Palmyra, the international community cannot stand back and watch," he said, adding that the permanent members of the security council had supported the idea.
United Nations peacekeepers, known by their distinctive blue helmets, would be able to profit from the expertise of Italy's cultural and heritage police, "who carry out training missions around the world", he said.
The idea is aimed at "important sites at risk from terrorist attacks, or in war zones, or zones hit by natural disasters, where the international community will be able to send Cultural Blue Helmets to protect them or defend them before they can be destroyed".
Franceschini called for the UN to "immediately define the operational aspects of this international task force".
IS seized control of Palmyra in May and has realised international fears by destroying some of the most prized sites in the UNESCO World Heritage listed ancient city. The militants have carried out a sustained campaign of destruction against heritage sites in areas under their control in Syria and Iraq, including the important Iraqi sites of Hatra, Nimrud and Khorsabad, an ancient Assyrian capital. Islamist militants are also accused of being behind attacks on ten religious and historic monuments in the Unesco World Heritage city of Timbuktu in Mali. - AFP

US, South Korea ready to negotiate nuclear deal with North Korea
US: US President Barack Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye said they were open to negotiations with North Korea on sanctions but Pyongyang needed to show it was serious about abandoning its nuclear weapons program.
Asked if he saw the possibility of a deal with North Korea like that reached with Iran, Mr Obama told a joint news conference after talks with Ms Park in Washington on Friday that he saw no indication that North Korea envisioned a future without nuclear weapons.
At the point where Pyongyang says we are interested in seeing relief from sanctions and improved relations and we are prepared to have a serious conversation about denuclearisation, I think its fair to say that well be right there at the table, he said.
We havent even gotten to that point yet, because there has been no indication on the part of the North Koreans as there was with the Iranians that they could foresee a future in which they did not possess or were not pursuing nuclear weapons.
Kim Jong-uns nuclear arsenal consists of about 20 warheads  twice as many as had been thought, according to Chinese experts.
Ms Park said it was important to have concerted international efforts towards a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue and said she had agreed with Mr Obama on the need to strengthen diplomatic efforts.
However, she said in language certain to infuriate North Korea: There is a saying: You can take a horse to the trough, but you cant make it drink water.
North Korea said in June its nuclear weapons are an essential deterrence and it has no interest in a deal like that reached with Iran.
Mr Park said she would seek to strengthen co-operation on the North Korean issue at a three-way summit with China and Japan that she will host in Seoul early next month.
The United States has been keen to encourage better relations between South Korea and Japan, its two biggest allies in Asia, given concerns about North Korea and an increasingly assertive China.
Ms Park has worked to warm up ties with China and raised some eyebrows in Washington when she attended Beijings military parade to mark the end of World War II last month.
Mr Obama said the US wanted to see a strong South Korean relationship with China, just as it wanted such a relationship itself, but Washington wanted to see Seoul speak out when Beijing did things that weakened international rules.

Zimbabwean elephant killed legally, says wildlife authority
ZIMBABWE: The hunt that killed one of the biggest elephants seen for years in Zimbabwe was legal, the wildlife authority said Saturday.
The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) said the elephant which was killed last week in the southeastern part of the country had tusks weighing 54 and 55 kilogrammes respectively adding that proceeds from the hunt would go towards wildlife conservation.
On the 7th of October 2015, an adult male elephant was hunted as a trophy by a foreign client through a locally registered safari company in Malipati Safari area, the ZimParks statement said.
It said the area was allocated sustainable quotas and hunting permits for all wildlife species including elephants on annual basis.
Malipati is adjacent to Gonarezhou national park and the two game parks hold 11,452 elephants, ZimParks said, dismissing reports that the elephant hunt took place inside the national park.
Zimbabwe subscribes to the principle of sustainable utilisation of its natural resources, including consumptive and non-consumptive utilisation of wildlife, the statement said.
Wildlife utilisation programmes and projects generate revenue that is used to develop local community areas and contribute to the improvement of living standards of local communities and to support conservation programmes.
ZimParks could not name the hunter who killed the elephant or give details how the huge mammal was killed.
However, wildlife groups reported that a German hunter paid $60,000 to shoot the huge male elephant, reviving the fierce debate over trophy hunting after the shooting of Cecil the lion.
Emmanuel Fundira, chairman of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe (SOAZ) Friday said the elephant was so huge its tusks were almost hitting the ground while it was standing.
He said SOAZ believed that the elephant should have been treated as a national treasure rather than killed.
The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force (ZCTF) condemned the elephant hunt. It's wrong to kill an iconic animal like that, said Johnny Rodrigues, chairman for ZCTF.
The last time one was seen (of such size) was more than 40 years ago. The hunter should not have shot it.
In July, American dentist Walter Palmer incensed animal rights activists worldwide when he shot and killed Cecil the lion with a powerful bow and arrow.
Cecil was a well-known attraction among visitors to the Hwange National Park and was wearing a tracking collar as part of an Oxford University research project.
Zimbabwe this week abandoned its bid to press charges against Palmer, saying his papers were in order and that he did not know he was committing any offence.
The Zimbabwean Parks department recently vowed to increase patrols after at least 26 elephants were poisoned to death by poachers in separate incidents over the past month.
