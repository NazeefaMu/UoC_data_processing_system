Former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris yesterday said the Supreme Court has the legal right to take final decision with regard to the parliamentary seat of Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The Supreme Court has the legal right to take the final decision with regard to the parliamentary seat of Geetha Kumarasinghe, he said.
He said a parliamentarian can make an appeal before the Supreme Court if his or her parliamentary seat is abolished by the Court of Appeal within 41 days.
Prof. Peiris said Geetha Kumarasinghe had informed the Speaker and the Parliament Secretary General in writing that she would make an appeal before the Supreme Court against the verdict of the Court of Appeal.

14th United Nations Day of Vesak 2017
For the first time in Sri Lanka the 14th United Nations Day of Vesak 2017, Conference will be held in Colombo and Kandy from May 12 to 14 with the participation of a large number of local and foreign delegations. The main theme focuses on Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace.
Vesak is the main Buddhist religious festival in Sri Lanka. During this time, people celebrate the triple anniversary of the Buddha - his birth, attaining of Enlightenment and attaining Nirvana. It was a big achievement for Sri Lanka to have the UN willingly approve the holding of this sublime celebration in Sri Lanka.
It is a matter of great delight for us to hold this significant event in a befitting manner with the guidance and counselling of Most Venerable Mahanyake Theras of the three Chapters and also with the able and astute participation of the President, the Prime Minister o and Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, world leaders and leaders from diverse organisations.
Sri Lanka is the most noteworthy contributor to International Vesak Day. Prof. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera initiated and inspired a meeting of global Buddhists in 1950 CE (Buddhist Era 2493) in Sri Lanka resulting in the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) on May 25, 1950 (2493BE) at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy. This meeting was attended by 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries in Asia, Europe and America.
At this meeting, the Buddhist Flag was formally accepted and Ven. Piyarathana recommended that Vesak Day should be accepted globally as a Buddhist celebration, a proposal which was accepted and followed by the Global Buddhist fraternity. Buddhism during its existence over two millennia had developed into 3 schools  Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayna, all disciples and believers of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Prof. G.P. Malalasekera could unite all three schools of Buddhism within the World Fellowship of Buddhism and became the first president of WFB from 1950 to 1958.
Lakshman Kadirgamar too was a pioneer in making Vesak Day as an Optional Holiday at the United Nations for the first time under its resolution 69/250/ at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1999, requesting for the adaptation of Vesak Day on September 23, 1999 and at the 79th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on December 15, 1999.

Alves special sends ruthless Juve into final
Turin: A stunning Dani Alves volley helped Juventus stroll into their second Champions League final in three years on Tuesday, a 2-1 win on the night completing a 4-1 aggregate victory over outclassed Monaco.
Brazilian wing-back Alves's 25-yard strike followed Mario Mandzukic's opener for the treble-chasing Italian champions as any semblance of a contest was snuffed out by half-time.Teenage star Kylian Mbappe pulled a goal back for the principality club after the break, his sixth of the competition.
But there was never any realistic prospect of them threatening to overturn a 2-0 deficit from last week's first leg.
It will be the ninth time Juventus, runners-up to Barcelona in 2015, have contested the final of Europe's elite club competition.
And on this evidence, Massimiliano Allegri's sinewy, battle-hardened squad stand a good chance of adding to the club's meagre return of two triumphs when they meet either Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid in Cardiff on June 3.
"I think we have a good chance of winning the trophy," Allegri said. "We have all grown since 2015, including myself, and getting to the final is no easy thing. The Champions is a serious competition. "Now we are in the crucial phase of the season because we have not won anything yet. In order we have the championship, the Italian Cup and the Champions: there is no time for slacking, we have to take care of the details and we have a month to get ready for Cardiff."
Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim batted off suggestions that Tuesday might have been the last big night for his talented young squad before its brightest stars are lured away.
"I am going to stay and I think all the players are going to stay. In three years time this squad will be 25, 30 percent better."
Jardim said he expected Juve to be facing Real in Cardiff and said the Italians would be anything but underdogs.
"This Juve is stronger than it was in 2015. There are many of the same players but with more experience of this level.
"The final is two teams with many quality players and experience of matches like that - it could go either way. I don't think there are any favourites."
Allegri made only one change from last week's first leg line-up but was soon forced to restore it as Germany midfielder Sami Khedira, returning from suspension, lasted only 10 minutes before limping off to make way for Claudio Marchisio.
For Monaco, the loss of Nabil Dirar to injury in the warm-up meant a hasty return for Benjamin Mendy as coach Leonardo Jardim opted to match Juve's 3-5-2 set-up.
The results were initially encouraging and Mbappe squeezed a fifth-minute shot past Gianluigi Buffon from a tight angle and held his head in his hands as it came back off the inside of the post, although the offside flag had come up.
The home supporters had to wait quarter of an hour to see their side emerge meaningfully from their own half.
But they were soon being treated to some slick entertainment that at times left the visitors looking like spectators.
Paulo Dybala made amends for slicing Gonzalo Higuain's knockdown wide from the edge of the area by deftly playing his fellow Argentinian into a one-on-one with Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. AFP

Beautiful joy
All the restrooms for pilgrims have been fully booked. M P Dharmasena and his family could not find a single room. He felt utterly miserable, but did not lose his faith. That left enough room for courage. Dharmasena came all the way from Colombo with his wife, Priyanthi and two daughters, Sanduni and Kushanya, and he cannot go empty-handed just because there is no room to rest. If everything else failed, they decided to spend the night on road.
They would somehow consummate the pilgrimage to the Ruwanwelisaya. Strangely, it occurred to me that I should check on the nunnery located close to the Ruwanwelisaya. This was strange because I knew fully well that we are not supposed to stay with the nuns. But believe it or not, the head nun let us in. She had a separate room arranged for us, Dharmasena recalls that fateful day.
The almost-miraculous incident does not end here. The following day, the head nun prepared a dairy offering for Ruwanwelisaya.
It is as if she had read our minds. She had used the sandalwood to prepare the offering. I do not forget that incident to this date, Dharmasena explains.
Dharmasenas life is full of such miraculous events. Well built in physique, Dharmasena nevertheless commands a soft-spoken nature. He knows neither rush nor haste in speech. You should be a bit patient to hear his words flowing in a slow-paced rhythm.
Employed at Fonterra, Dharmasena makes pilgrimage at least once a year. He drives his own vehicle, a three wheeler never used for the purpose of hire, several kilometers from Colombo to remote sacred sites such as Katharagama and Anuradhapura.
Although he believes in Dedimunda devatha, he gives priority to the temple before devale. At Katharagama, his family offers dairy alms to the Kiri Vehera.
I don't follow a rigid practice if lighting the lamp for Dedimunda Devatha regularly at one set time. But I light the lamp whenever I am home and pass the merits of good deeds I have done to the devatha," says Dharmasena.
Driving a three wheeler for about over 200 kilometres is a tiresome journey. The journey takes a bit longer as his family stops over in various places, to refresh, before reaching the destination.
True it costs a lot, but the gain is quite rewarding. It gives me pure joy, Dharmasena explains.
Dharmasena's project for 2017 was the most ambitious of all. He gathered all his relatives, about 40 in number, to make a pilgrimage to Anuradhapura and Somawathi on a luxury bus which can accommodate about 50 passengers. The whole journey was about 700 kilometres. Together with his family and relatives, he offered a robe to the Somawathiya.
The Somawathiya is home to the Sacred Right Tooth of the Buddha. Offering a robe to the stupa is like offering a robe to the Buddha himself, Dharmasena explained. The robe was wrapped around the stupa as a gesture of custom. Before the robe is offered to the stupa, it has to be carried in a reverential procession to the temple. The procession had to begin a kilometre away from the stupa. Most pilgrims abandoned carrying it because they could not stand the scorching heat they felt under the feet. But Dharmasena was not to give in. The spiritual happiness he was feeling was much more powerful than the heat-ache felt under feet. His family and relatives followed him.
Despite sweat trickling down the spine due to the glaring sunshine, Dharmasena felt satisfied looking at the robe wrapped around the stupa.
I have no words to explain that happiness. It is joy simply beyond words. I wish I could watch over the stupa with the robe wrapped around for ever, Dharmasena says. Occasionally a drinker, Dharmasena nevertheless makes it a point not to touch alcoholic liquid and stay vegetarian for a week before the pilgrimage. Plus, he would stay devoted to that vow until a day lapses following the pilgrimage. His wife, Priyanthi, was a Catholic turned Buddhist. Dharmasenas soft nature was one of the reasons that made her choose the Buddhas teachings. I used to lose temper easily. My husband would always talk to me calmly, asking me to calm down. That soft-spoken tone is quite contagious. I feel so cool when he speaks. It is simply like listening to a Buddhist sermon, when he frequently asked me to calm down, Priyanthi analysed the influence of her husband.

## Title: Benefits of Loving-Friendliness Meditation
## Supertitle:

Benefits of Loving-Friendliness Meditation
We dont need an ideal society or a perfect world to practice loving-friendliness. We arent practicing to save the world or make it perfect. We practice for ourselves, for our own peace and well-being. Any effects beyond that are byproducts. If the focus is outside ourselves, we will never succeed. But fortunately, our own well-being is intimately bound up with the well-being of others; so truly practicing metta (loving-friendliness) for our own benefit does benefit others.
In the Discourse on the Benefits of Loving-Friendliness (Metta Nisamsa Sutta), the Buddha lists 11 benefits derived from practicing mettaand I might add that many of these benefits are being confirmed by contemporary scientific research!
Here is the Buddhas list:
1. You sleep well.
When you go to bed feeling loving-friendliness toward yourself and others, you will be relaxed and will sleep peacefully.
2. You wake up feeling well.
When you get a good nights sleep, you wake up feeling rested and relaxed. With a relaxed mind and body, you are able to connect with family, friends, relatives, neighbors, and even strangers in a genuine and centered way. You feel fresh, uplifted, and joyful all day.
3. Youre not likely to have nightmares.
When you practice metta, you become solid enough to face whatever arises. And in fact, the Buddha said its unlikely youll have nightmares when you practice metta.
4. Your body relaxes and your face is joyful.
Your body reflects your mind. When you feel love for all beings, it shows on your face. Seeing your honest, relaxed face, others will gravitate toward you and enjoy being around you.
5. Even animals and celestial beings feel drawn to you.
When you practice metta, your mind generates a peaceful field around you. Children especially are tuned in to this energyand non-humans feel it too!
One day I was walking my dog, Brown, and a couple came toward us. The woman kneeled down to Browns level and talked to him.
He wagged his tail and became affectionate with her. The man was frightened, and Brown growled at him.
6. Spirits protect you.
There are times we feel guided and protected by beings beyond our sight. Recognizing this as a kind of grace is a source of serenity. Whether its literally true or there is some other energy that gives us this sense of guidance and protection, the Buddha included this among the benefits of practicing metta.
7. Fire, poisons, and weapons will not harm you.
When we read stories of old, many of the elements are symbolic or mythic. The Buddha shared tales of adepts who practiced metta and were protected from fire, poisons, and weapons. He explained that greed, hatred, and delusion are the fires, the poisons, and the weapons against which metta protects us.
In a well-known story about the power of metta, Uttara, a devoted follower of the Buddha, was bereft. She had been given in marriage to a man who did not have high regard for the Buddha, and so she hadnt seen the Buddha or his disciples for two and a half months. She was feeling forlorn, and her father suggested she hire a courtesan to serve her husband while she joined the Buddha and his community for the final two weeks of their rainy-season retreat. Uttara agreed and was able to serve the Buddha and his disciples as a cook and attend his teachings.
One day as he was looking out the window of his mansion, Uttaras husband saw her working in the retreat kitchen wearing a stained apron and thought it pathetic she was attending the retreat rather than indulging in the luxuries of life with him. Noticing his disdain for his wife, Sirima, the courtesan, began plotting to harm Uttara so she herself could become the mans wife. Sirima boiled some ghee and left the house to splash it on Uttara.
When Uttara saw the courtesan coming to harm her, she meditated on loving-friendliness and remained completely at peace.
At the same time, Uttaras maidservants also saw this foul deed unfolding and ran to stop Sirima. The maids tackled Sirima and began to pummel her but Uttara intervened to save her attacker.
After that, Uttara bathed Sirima in warm water and massaged her body with herbs and oil to soothe her wounds. Sirima fell to the ground and begged Uttaras forgiveness. Uttara said she would forgive Sirima if the Buddha advised it.
The next day, Sirima asked the Buddha to forgive what she had tried to do. The Buddha asked Uttara how she felt as Sirima was pouring boiling ghee on her, and Uttara responded, I was grateful to Sirima for serving my husband so I could spend two weeks with the noble community. I had no ill will toward her, only loving-friendliness. The Buddha commended her, Well done, Uttara. By not bearing ill will, you were able to conquer the one who abuses you. By being generous, you conquered the one who is stingy. By speaking the truth, you conquered one who lies. Upon the advice of the Buddha, Uttara forgave Sirima, and Sirima took refuge in the Buddha.
In another story, the Buddha told of Culasiva Thera, who was not at all affected by poison because of his profound practice of metta. A Dhammapada commentary tells of four novice monks whose practice of loving-friendliness was so profound they were unaffected by a weapon. Not only were disciples of the Buddha protected by metta, but in one story a cow was spared being shot with an arrow because of her love and affection nursing her calf.
8. Your mind immediately becomes calm.
Metta stimulates a friendly feeling that makes us calm and happy. It truly is a wonderful way of life!
9. Your complexion brightens.
Metta shows in your face. As you practice metta, joy arises. At first it is barely noticeable, but as the joy increases, it begins to pervade your whole mind and body. Metta does not rely on any particular time, place, or condition. Once aroused, it can remain present in you the rest of your life. Your face cannot hide what is going on in your mind. When you are angry, it shows on your face. When you are peaceful, everyone notices. The energy of metta spreads through your bloodstream and nourishes your whole being. You look bright and clear, calm and peaceful.
10. Youll die with a clear mind.
The thought of dying peacefully can be comforting. When we have unresolved conflicts, death can be difficult. Loving-friendliness can make dying easier for the one passing away and for those around her.
There is a difference between true peace and the appearance of peace. You may seem cheerful; you might even make people laugh. But when you are approaching death, if greed, hatred, and delusion are still lurking deep down in your psyche, that joviality will vanish. Practicing loving-friendliness sinks into the depths of your consciousness and makes your mind genuinely calm. With metta, you will die peacefully, without confusion.
11. Youll die in peace.
If at the time of death you do not yet comprehend the highest truth, you will still go to a realm of great peace.
If you have not completed the path of awakening before you die, the peaceful mental state generated by metta will still allow you to be reborn in a heavenly realm.
Regardless of whether we consider heaven a real or figurative place, this portends well and encourages us to practice loving-friendliness while we can.

A boost for reconciliation
As the nation celebrates Vesak, we heard the great news that the long-awaited National Policy on Reconciliation has been approved by the Cabinet. This ties in with the very message of Vesak  peace and compassion for all beings and is just what the country needs as it rises anew from the embers of a conflict.
Chairman of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who announced the Policy said it will be the policy on national reconciliation and co-existence, which will serve as a guideline for carrying out national reconciliation programmes throughout the country for all stakeholders, including ministries, government institutions and NGOs. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took a personal interest in the project and gave it all encouragement.
The National Policy on Reconciliation is set to fill a long-standing vacuum due to the absence of a consolidated National Policy on Reconciliation. The National Policy on Reconciliation will aim to satisfy the need of the country for an over-arching vision on reconciliation and a broad, coherent framework to steer and direct the process of national reconciliation.
The national reconciliation policy was drafted after an year-long and wide array of consultations with institutions, persons, ministries and NGOs. The former President is the ideal person to helm this project  even after losing an eye in a LTTE suicide bomb attack, she did not harbour any animosity towards the Tamil community which the LTTE claimed to represent, and always stood for amity among the various communities.
This is the first time that such a comprehensive policy has been adopted by any Government. It is the policy of the State of Sri Lanka on reconciliation, which means that future Governments too will be committed to implementing it. We hope that this will be the first of a series of national policies on other critical aspects such as agriculture, health, education, defence and foreign affairs that do not change with each Government. In most well-established democracies, the core policies do not change regardless of the political entity in power and this should be the case in Sri Lanka as well.
ONUR must be congratulated on this endeavour because some of the main objectives of the Policy Document have already been implemented even before the official unveiling. They include religious festivals and events, cultural programmes, and conflict awareness programmes to be participated by schoolchildren across the island. In keeping with these programmes the children of other religions belonging to various ethnic communities are to take part in at least one main religious events of another religion. The next step will be creating more awareness among adults where they will be able to discuss the conflict, harmony and co-existence at workshops around the island. Art, drama and music, which are universal in nature, are also being used to promote amity.
The Government also deserves plaudits for involving the Security Forces in the reconciliation moves. They are very much involved in the de-mining and resettlement processes and many lands previously used by the Forces have been handed over to the civilian owners. Newspapers reported recently that a soldier has married an ex-Tiger woman cadre and that women soldiers had taken Avurudu presents to a group of rehabilitated women Tiger cadres in the North. These are heartwarming stories that show reconciliation in action.
The Reconciliation Policy will focus on Equality, Human Rights, Justice and the Rule of Law, Transitional Justice, Inclusivity and Diversity, Sustainable Development, Civic Consciousness and several other factors, some of which will also be enshrined in the new Constitution that is taking shape.
Conflict Sensitivity, Cross-Cultural Awareness, Victim-Centredness, Gender Responsiveness, Foresight and Innovation, Leadership and Sustainability, Efficiency and Effectiveness, Coordination and Complementarity and Clear and Consistent Communication are among the other cornerstones of the Policy. All these are of crucial importance for long-term reconciliation.
Together, the National Policy on Reconciliation and the new Constitution are expected to lead to a Sri Lankan identity that has evaded us all these years. Still, the first question that we ask someone who we meet for the first time is are you Sinhala Tamil Muslim. It is time we identified ourselves as Sri Lankans. A Singaporean, for example, will not identify himself or herself as Chinese, Malay, Tamil or Eurasian. Likewise, we should firmly project a Sri Lankan identity within and outside our shores. That will show the world that we are all united under one nation, one flag.
Trust is the very basis of reconciliation. The loss of trust between the major communities in Sri Lanka, mostly engineered by self-serving politicians, led to a 30-year-war that took the country back by several decades. We are still struggling to emerge from the dark abyss of war. The restoration of mutual trust will be the key to long-term reconciliation. This Vesak, we must take the Buddhas words to heart as we begin the drive for lasting peace and reconciliation  hatred does not cease by hatred, it ceases by love alone. Truer words have never ever been spoken.

CBK does not want divided or crooks-run SLFP
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday said she does not want to see her party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), divided just as much she does not want to see well-known crooks leading it.
In reply to a question posed by the Daily News whether she wanted to see a division in the SLFP, Kumaratunge said,  No,
But I also dont want to see well-known crooks and murderers leading the party,she said.
People voted for us because they wanted a clean-up of the political system. They voted for us against corruption, lack of freedoms, lack of decency and against the corruption of the former regime under the former President, his brothers and children, she said.
She said even if some people had to go out of the party; it will benefit because it will have better people and not well-recognised crooks and murderers.
Therefore, It will be stronger, she said.

CIA sets up unit to deal with North Korea

The CIA has established a Korea Mission Center to address "the nuclear and ballistic missile threat posed by" North Korea and its unpredictable leader, the US intelligence agency announced Wednesday.
The creation of the center focusing on specific threats from the Korean peninsula will allow the CIA to "harness the full resources, capabilities, and authorities of the Agency" to deal with North Korea, according to the agency's statement.
The center will put the forces of CIA analysts and officers side-by-side in one location to tackle the threat from Pyongyang.
"The new Mission Center draws on experienced officers from across the Agency and integrates them in one entity to bring their expertise and creativity to bear against the North Korea target," the statement reads.
Former CIA senior analyst John Nixon told CNN he expected the center to issue "sitreps" -- situation reports for the intelligence community and the Trump administration -- possibly twice daily, indicating an around-the-clock watch by an office of significant size.
In the statement, CIA Director Mike Pompeo says the creation of the center focuses the CIA's efforts against the "serious threats" emerging from North Korea, which has in recent months ramped up both nuclear and missile tests in an effort to enhance its military capabilities.
"Creating the Korea Mission Center allows us to more purposefully integrate and direct CIA efforts against the serious threats to the United States and its allies emanating from North Korea," Pompeo said, adding its creation "reflects the dynamism and agility that CIA brings to evolving national security challenges."
The timing is unlikely to be linked to any recent events but rather to better position the agency against a very real and growing threat to the US, justifying the allocation of enough resources to a dedicated center, according to Bruce Klingner, former CIA Deputy Division Chief for Korea and senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center.
"Although there aren't many details, a restructuring of the bureaucracy is something that takes quite a while to prepare, review, and go through multiple levels of approval," Klingner told CNN.
There are 10 such existing centers in the CIA, and the new addition will be the most focused in terms of geographical area and remit -- the Korean Peninsula currently falls under the jurisdiction of the Mission Center for East Asia and Pacific.
The new office will "work closely with the intelligence community and the entire US national security community," the CIA statement said.
Nixon, the former analyst, said he also expects significant cooperation with South Korean intelligence services going forward.
"I think (cooperation with the South Korean National Intelligence Service) will be very high. Also with the (Korean Central Intelligence Agency)."
He added that the announcement of the center, coinciding with the election of a less-hardline South Korean President who is likely to pursue at least some form of diplomacy with Seoul's belligerent neighbor to the north, was "interesting."
"I think its very interesting that this happened and now we have (newly elected South Korean President Moon Jae-in) who says he want a different relationship with Pyongyang. I think that's very helpful, hardline never works."
Nixon said the creation of the mission would send a message from the CIA to the Trump administration that his foreign policy priorities were being acknowledged.
"It's not an easy regime to collect information on, but we're not getting the information out of there that we should. It's a sign that, 'OK folks, we're going to get serious about this,'" he said. "(This center will) show the administration that this (issue) is going to be front and center.
"One thing that's interesting about Trump is that he's getting briefed up about North Korea. He's absorbing this stuff. It's another sign that North Korea is the top of the list."
He added that the CIA is looking to "beef up" its Seoul station, including the appointment of a new, high-profile station chief in Seoul.
"They're going to look for somebody with serious gravitas, who has connections and knows the players," he said.

A robust set of Electoral reforms to ensure Good Governance
It is learnt that Constitutional reforms prepared by the various sub-committees of the Parliament will be made public shortly. At the outset, we have strong reservations about parliamentarians as representatives of people being given the sole responsibility of handling their own-governance which is tantamount to Conflict of interest. Therefore, we doubt whether even the so called recommendations of the Public Committee on Constitutional Reforms were seriously addressed by the aforesaid committees which have different priorities bordering on Empire-building and self-interest.
The writer for the last several years has been addressing the attention of the academia, civil rights organisations, public and the politicians on the captioned subject through the blessings of the Press prior to appearing before the aforesaid Public Committee. Whether my recommendations were highlighted by the Committee is yet again another matter of concern.
Be that as it may, as a citizen with country at heart, I wish to reiterate the following recommendations on Electoral reforms which are pre-requisites for a people based system of governance.
1) Abolish optional Preference Voting mechanism and introduce District-wise nomination lists in merit order.
2) All parties/Alliances should be required to select and nominate patriotic, professional candidates based on a transparent, structured interview system.
3) Abolish National list and apply a simple, proportionate arithmetic method to determine the number of seats allocated to each Party/Alliance on a District basis.
4) Select MPs strictly from District-wise merit order lists to represent the seats allocated to each Party/Alliance. Voters will mark their vote only for the party/Alliance thereby simplifying the entire vote counting process.
5) Completely stop Crossovers and allow District merit list to operate automatically to fill vacancies created by Death/Expulsion etc.
6) Make Party/Alliance Election Manifesto a legally enforceable document as voter decision is mainly based on the pledges given in this document.
7) Reduce President's powers.
8) Make President a statesman and prohibit him from participating in party politics during his term of office.
9) Provide for an all-party Cabinet, applying proportionate arithmetic to national election results.
10) Hold Presidential election and Parliamentary election on one specified date.
11) Hold all Provincial Council elections also on one specified date.
12) Depoliticise and elect independent members to LG bodies.
We earnestly appeal to all concerned civil organisations, academics and genuine politicians to ponder again on this matter without regretting later.
The writer is willing to clarify further if requested by concerned readers though he has already dwelt at length through the press on the above-mentioned recommendations.

Degeneration of a sacred profession
Letter to GMOA President from a SLMC member:
Dear Dr Anurudda Padeniya,
Having observed the various developments in the health sector and medical education in the past few years, I thought of writing to you on my appraisal of the current situation. I hope it is not too late in the day to write to you.
I write as a senior physician, a medical teacher, a member of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) for ten years, and a former vice president and a long serving committee member of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) in the past. I have been in the fore front of many GMOA trade union activities, occasional strikes, and was a part of the public face of the GMOA in TV discussions, press conferences etc.
You were considered a great asset by all in the GMOA as a man who new his facts and studied the issues in depth before coming for any discussions. I still remember how in our negotiations over salary issues, you had at your finger tips all details of the comparative salary scales of all categories in the health sector. I remember congratulating you when you were elected the president on the first two occasions.
Let me clarify my position regarding SAITM at the very outset. I do so as a member of the SLMC who took part in the initial discussions with Dr. Neville Fernando on the establishment of SAITM, took part in many relevant discussions in the SLMC until 2012 and also was part of the UGC team inspecting the medical school.
I have no doubt that the SAITM authorities ignored all advice and guidance given by the SLMC on numerous occasions. Instead they have relied on political patronage to get the approval in a surreptitious way. How three cabinet ministers keep agitating for the sake of this private enterprise raises many questions as to what their obligations are.
I have little sympathy for the students and their parents as they have been adequately warned regularly by the SLMC over the years on the fact that this institution was not recognized by the medical council. I fail to understand why even some experienced doctors took the risk of admitting their children to a medical school lacking SLMC approval.
That being said, I accept that any solution to the current crisis should recognize the necessity of allowing those students to continue their medical studies. Once that is done, this fraudulent medical school should be closed down. It is not practical for the state to take over every private medical school getting into difficulties. With plans in the pipeline for establishing medical schools elsewhere in the country, there is no necessity for one in Malabe at state expense. I accept that there is room for a properly constituted private medical school in Sri Lanka, guided and recognized by the SLMC.
Let me now examine the role of the GMOA in the SAITM affair. It has expressed its opposition to the existence of SAITM in no uncertain terms. However I feel there is no justification for repeated strike action to achieve its aims. The hardship caused to the public is really saddening. I would not hesitate to label these strikes as a crime against society.
Perhaps you may remember that we had definite guidelines in undertaking harsh trade union action in the past. It was generally accepted that strike action should not be used for salary issues and others of a more personal nature. We confined strike action as a last resort to protest against irregular transfers and appointments to keep the health service out of political interference. We succeeded in achieving the latter aim to a great extent. We had regional strikes if a member of ours was obstructed by any one during work and police did not apprehend the offenders. I feel all those short lasting actions were justified as they were inevitable.
We also had a general understanding that we should not seek the support of trade unions in other fields for any reason. That would have made us under obligation to join them in their struggles. This was considered unacceptable as our service of caring for the sick cannot be mixed up with or compromised by any of their fields of activity.
What happens now is totally unacceptable. GMOA officials publicly calling general strikes is a bad trend. Doctors going on strike for general political issues like the ICTA are also unwarranted. For the first time in the history, you have allowed a political party leader to address the GMOA membership. As I already indicated to you personally, this should never have happened.
The net result of all this is that in the public eye, the GMOA has become equivalent to any other trouble making union in the public sector. The public has lost all respect for the GMOA and medical profession in general. It is inevitable that many suspect that your actions are a part of a larger campaign to create political instability.
I know you are a very caring paediatrician and a medical teacher doing your duty properly in the health service. You are respected by your members for the service rendered in getting their emoluments and other benefits on par with other comparable services.
The fact that, as president of the GMOA, you have done much work including publishing booklets and conducting workshops guiding doctors to better professional standards, is little known to many in the society.
Yet I believe that you have been the president of the GMOA for too long. You now lack new thinking and when in power you tend to ignore the general feelings of the membership. This is why even in the field of politics, I believe no one, however good he may appear, should not be allowed to remain in power for more than two terms.
You should plan to step down when your current term expires. You can render a much greater service to society if you now devote full time to being a clinician. After all, paediatric neurology is a relatively new field that needs people like you with imagination and leadership qualities for further development.
I sincerely hope that you will take my advice in the same spirit that I give them.
Thank you.
Yours Sincerely,
Dr. Sarath Gamini De Silva

Djokovic surives scare to start new era
Madrid: Novak Djokovic staved off a huge upset in his first match since splitting with his long-time coaching team to beat Nicolas Almagro 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 in the second round of the Madrid Masters on Wednesday.
After a blistering start, Djokovic had to battle back from 3-0 down in the deciding set to book his place in the last 16 on Thursday against Feliciano Lopez or Gilles Simon. Djokovic is without a coach in the Spanish capital after bringing to an end a 10-year relationship with Marian Vajda in an attempt to reverse his dramatic slump in form over the past year.
The early signs were positive for the 12-time Grand Slam champion as despite losing his service in the opening game, he broke straight back to start a six-game streak to romp through the first set.
Almagro had taken just one set from four previous meetings with Djokovic, but willed on by a partisan home crowd, he held on to his serve despite more pressure from the Serb in the first game of the second set.
The Spaniard had to save two break points to hold for 4-3 and then took his chance to break with Djokovic serving to stay in the set.
The world number 75, who dipped down to the challenger tour after losing in the first round of the Australian Open earlier this year, then looked set for a monumental upset as he raced into a 3-0 lead in the decider. However, a mixture of Almagro nerves and Djokovic upping his intensity saw the world number two react immediately to level at 3-3.
More Almagro errors flowed to give Djokovic another break for 6-5 and he served out for the match.
Djokovic could meet Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals. AFP

Echoes of 2015 as England get tough World Cup draw
Kyoto: England and France were drawn against each other and Argentina as they were handed a tough assignment for the 2019 World Cup on Wednesday.
Holders New Zealand were bracketed with South Africa and Italy, while hosts Japan got a kinder draw against Ireland and Scotland.
England's assignment in Pool C alongside age-old rivals France, and 2015 semi-finalists Argentina, evoked memories of their nightmare showing four years ago.
On home turf, the 2003 champions embarrassingly failed to reach the knock-outs after landing in a group with Wales, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay.
"It's all very exciting isn't it" said England coach Eddie Jones. "We've got two Tests against Argentina in June so we can practise a little bit."
When asked about France, Jones said: "They've really improved over the last two years and they're certainly a dangerous team."
Twelve teams of an eventual 20 learned their fate at a glitzy draw ceremony in Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, more than two years before the tournament starts.
In Pool D, two-time winners Australia were drawn against Wales and Georgia. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said their match-up against South Africa in Pool B would now give their annual Rugby Championship games extra meaning. "Everyone will get excited by it, and we know each other pretty well so we'll just continue to get to understand each other before we get here," Hansen said.
The dozen teams were included in Wednesday's draw by virtue of finishing in the top three of their groups in 2015.Another eight teams from Oceania, Europe, the Americas and Africa will be added after qualifying games.
Hansen's New Zealand are striving to complete a hat-trick of World Cup victories, while England, up to second in the rankings under Jones, are dreaming of ending the All Blacks' dominance. Japan will become the first Asian country to host the World Cup, a move which aims to ignite rugby passions around the region.Games will be played at 12 venues including Kamaishi, which was ravaged by Japan's 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.
"I have never felt so fired up as I do now about my role in picking Japan's group," Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said before the draw.
"This is even more of a thrill than when I played Super Mario at the Rio Olympics," he said, referring to his closing-ceremony appearance dressed as the popular video game character.
Abe added: "Soon the Rugby World Cup will bring bring the greatest rugby players in the world to Japan... it will be the perfect chance to showcase this sport to the rest of Asia, which holds over half the world's population." AFP

## Title: Emperor Dharmasokas contribution to Buddhism

Emperor Dharmasokas contribution to Buddhism
King Dharmashoka was an ancient Indian Emperor who ruled the entire Indian Sub continent from 268 BC to 232 BC.In about 240 BC Asoka waged a relentless and bitterly contested war against the State of Kalinga which he captured with the military acumen and immense skills he possessed.
The Kalinga war took place 8 years after his coronation. The battle caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and about 200,000 people. He earned the name Chanda Ashoka as he was a ruthless king who spared no pains in inflicting torture against those who defied. When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest rejoicing in, he was mentally shaken and wanted to appease his mind from the atrocities unleashed during this war.
Discussion
He was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved. After seeing the pious figure of Bhikku Nigroda( who was already an arahant) who was going about looking for food as usual with his bowl, the king was moved by the serene gait of the bhiKku and invited him to the palace. Bhikku Nigroda who had already attained the state of Arahantship at the age of seven ,visited the palace for his morning Pinda Patha with the bowl in his hand not knowing why the king beckoned him to the palace.
The discussion he had with Nigroda Samanera was the turning point for the transformation of his psyche from one of hostility to compassion for the humankind..He was enlightened about the meaningless wars he waged and the untold misery he brought upon the people at large. The king decided that he should henceforth lead a riotous life and dedicate himself to the spread of Buddha Dhamma.
Beginning about 263 BC he embraced Buddhism and provided state patronage for the propagation of Buddha Dhamma across Asia and established monuments referred to as famous Asoka pillars marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha. He regarded Buddhism as a doctrine that could serve as a vehicle to usher in peace around the world which will ultimately lead to political and cultural unity and stability.
kindness
One of the more endearing legacies of King Ashoka was the model he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and state and he was seen as a role model to leaders with in the Buddhist community. The edicts of Ashoka inscribed in the Ashokan Pillars indicate the faith he had in Buddhism. In one edict he condemns rituals and Vedic animal sacrifices. In another he proclaims himself as an upasakabereft of mundane desires and expressing kindness and well being for all.
As a Buddhist Ashoka believed that Buddhism is beneficial to all human beings fauna and flora. So he embarked on a programme to build Sangaramayas, viharas, chetiyas and temples for the Buddhist monks all over south and Central Asia. He had ordered the construction of 84000 Asokan pillars to coincide with the 84000 Dhamma sermons of the Buddha. Asoka also sent many prominent emissaries to modern Kashmir, Afganistan, Syria, Persia, Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Turkey, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam to spread the message of Buddhism.
His devotion to Buddhism is amply demonstrated in banning the killing and hunting of animals for food.
The above meritorious acts of king Asoka towards the cause of Buddhist revival are ample evidence for the faith he developed for the Buddha Dhamma and this background only propelled him to send his son and daughter to Sri Lanka to propagate the noble Dhamma. Questions may be asked if King Dharmashoka declined to send his son and daughter at that time what would have happened to the religious awakening that followed.
His cordial relationship with King Devanam Piyatissa would no doubt have been a binding force to send the two children. Nevertheless we must not forget that King Dharmashokas kind and magnanimous gesture only paved the way for Mahinda Thera followed by his sister with a Bo sapling to land in this country.

FIFA corruption fight setback by purge of ethics team
Manama: FIFA's decision to remove its ethics team was a "setback in the fight against corruption", one of those dismissed, investigator Cornel Borbely, told a press conference in Bahrain on Wednesday.
World football's governing body has recommended that Borbely, along with the ethics judge who helped bring down Sepp Blatter, Hans-Joachim Eckert, not be re-elected at the FIFA Congress which takes place on May 11 in the Gulf.
Borbely also said there were "several hundred cases" of corruption pending.
"The removal means nothing else but the end of the reform process," said Borbely.
"The ethics commission is the key institution of the FIFA reforms.
"We could bring back some trust in FIFA, the ethics committee... was the role model for the whole sports world.
"As it seems now, the work of the ethics committee was inconvenient for functionaries, for FIFA officials.
"The removal of the ethics committee is not in FIFA's best interests... and it's a setback for the fight against corruption," said Borbely.
The dramatic recommendation was taken by the all-powerful FIFA Council on Tuesday.
The decision not to re-elect Eckert and Borbely comes as they have both served their four-year terms. The Council recommended replacing Eckert with Vassilios Skouris of Greece, a former president of the European Court of Justice. Similarly, ethics investigator Borbely is to be replaced by Colombia's Maria Claudia Rojas. Skouris served as president on the ECJ from 2003 until 2015. The decision is set to be ratified by FIFA at its annual Congress, which convenes in Bahrain on Thursday.
Personal motive
The decision is controversial as critics have accused FIFA president Gianni Infantino of having a personal motive to replace Eckert and Borbely, as an ethics investigation was launched against him last year. Eckert was the judge who opened proceedings against Blatter and Michel Platini in November 2015.
"It's not a great day for FIFA," Eckert told the same hastily-arranged press conference, held in a downtown hotel in Manama. AFP

Indias Manohar to remain ICC chairman till 2018
NEW DELHI, Wednesday: India's Shashank Manohar will stay on as chairman of the International Cricket Council until the end of his elected term in June 2018, the game's world governing body said Wednesday.
Manohar, who resigned from his post citing "personal reasons" in March, was coaxed to stay on until the board met in April to vote on a series of major reforms.
As chairman he spearheaded a broad restructuring of the body aimed at curbing the dominance of cricket's wealthiest nations -- India, Australia and England -- since being appointed ICC boss last year.
His efforts came to fruition last month when the ICC overwhelming endorsed a plan to more equitably share revenue among all members -- a decision that cost India a large chunk of its funding.
The restructure -- described by Manohar as "another step forward for world cricket" -- was agreed in principle in February by the majority of Test playing nations, including England and Australia, but was opposed by India.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India stands to lose $277 million in revenue over the next eight years under the changes, with more flowing to minor Test nations and associate members like Ireland and Afghanistan.
India resisted naming its Champions Trophy squad in protest, missing a key deadline and threatening to pull out of the tournament in England, but relented and named a side this week.
The new financial plan and governance structure will be ratified at the ICC's annual conference in June. - AFP

"This hospital has some shortcomings due to lack of urgent medical equipment and doctors. We are negotiating with the Health Minister to resolve them," said the New National Organiser and Province Councillor S. Sridharan. CPC Director of Health K.A. Shanthi Samarasinghe also confirmed this.

Indian shooters stopped at airport for carrying guns
New Delhi:India's national shooting team have been forced to spend the day at an airport after customs officials refused to allow them back into the country carrying guns and ammunition.
The embarrassing gaffe left top shooters, including Commonwealth Games gold medallist Gurpreet Singh, stranded for over 12 hours at Delhi's international airport until their paperwork cleared, National Rifles Association of India spokesperson Rajeev Bhatia told AFP.
The shooters returning from competitions abroad were told the appropriate customs official required to clear their firearms was not available, despite the team insisting they had followed standard procedures.
They were finally allowed through after spending most of the day languishing at the airport, leaving them exhausted and athletes demanding an explanation. "We had the necessary documents with us yet they failed to give us clearance. We had to wait for the customs commissioner for hours," one of the shooters caught up in the delay told AFP on condition of anonymity.
"Look we lost a day's training, with the World Cup in Munich starting on May 17. It is sad that these things happen to the country's sportspersons."
Olympic gold medal shooter Abhinav Bindra slammed India's firearms association for leaving the team stranded at the airport.
"They are our countries ambassadors and should not be treated like this. Would this ever happen to our cricket team" he posted on his Twitter account. AFP

Jhulan Goswami highest wicket-taker in womens one-day internationals
New Delhi: India fast bowler Jhulan Goswami has become the highest wicket-taker in women's one-day internationals after overtaking former Australia star Cathryn Fitzpatrick with her 181st dismissal.
Pace spearhead Goswami achieved the feat against hosts South Africa in the 50-over quadrangular tournament in Potchefstroom on Tuesday.
The 34-year-old Goswami, who took three wickets in India's victory, got past Fitzpatrick's long-standing record in her 153rd ODI. Fitzpatrick took 180 wickets in 109 matches between 1993 and 2006.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) congratulated the former captain for her incredible service to women's cricket since making her debut as an 18-year-old in 2002.
The Bengal cricketer led India in 25 ODIs from 2008-2011 and has represented the country in 10 Tests and 60 Twenty20 matches. She was named women's cricketer of the year in 2007. AFP

Kandy schools rugby round-up
In last weeks Singer schools rugby second round matches played by Kandy schools in the Cup, Plate, Bowl and Shield competitions Trinity defeated St. Joseph's 17-15 last weekend to climb to the top in the Cup competition and keep their dreams of winning the title alive.
On Saturday Kingswood sealed victory over St. Anthonys thanks to some good run and pass rugby, where the Kingswoodians took complete control of the game. On Sunday Dharmarajah fashioned a good win over the youthful Vidyartha side. St. Sylvesters went down to Thurstan in their second match. Sri Sumangala was to play Lalith Athulathmudali MV but this match did not come off. Sri Rahula playing in Division II Cup competition on Monday beat President's College. Other than Trinity all other schools are badly affected without a venue to play their rugby games and this has become a major issue where the Sports Ministry nor the rugby controlling body the Sri Lanka Rugby Union has not taken any notice at all.
Today, most of the schoolboys enjoy playing rugby, and also they are sure of job opportunities after school. Today there is quite a difference between club and school rugby. Where the clubs get good coaches and tend to be well qualified and experienced in the game and the players are on contract basis. Children play voluntarily, give them the skills and keep them in the game. Schools have to pay a big packet for the coaches, and today a school has about four coaches. A school needs big money to play a match with all expenses being very high.
School level rugby is one of the most popular ball games, but today most of the schools are finding it difficult to keep the game going and the Schools Rugby Association has apparently no control.
Trinity who were smarting from the defeat they suffered at the hands of St. Peter's in the first second round game enjoyed a win against Joseph's after trailing in the first half. Their key game will be against Isipathana College on Saturday in Kandy. Isipathana are sure to pose a threat after their home victories, there is a real sense of momentum behind their Cup championship challenge and Trinity know that they will have to be at their best. The Trinitians need to put up a giant killing performance. Despite performing away from home they rallied around beautifully to turn the game against St Josephs in their favor. The game from the kick off was poised for an exciting finish with both teams making a determined effort to take the lead. Trinitians did a good job through their forwards, the back line was somewhat affected following the absence of regular fly half in the first half. The scrum half made the difference with a spectacular effort under tremendous pressure.
Kingswood who went down to their rivals in the first game in the Plate competition bounced back into recognition with an equally good performance at Bogambara. They pulled off a good 22-0 victory over high riding St. Anthonys, while proving their true capabilities. In this game they performed to expectations with the forwards combining beautifully. They played with a real purpose and certainly with determination - they also enjoyed more possession. The Antonians never got their act together making several errors at vital stages. The three quarters also fumbled on a number of occasions. In the next game Kingswood play Lumbini MV away, most probably on Saturday and will be full of confidence. St. Anthonys will play Prince of Wales at Pallekele on Sunday.
Dharmaraja maintained their impressive record while overcoming home town school Vidyartha by 36 points to 16 in their second match in the Plate competition. The Rajans playing with good understanding came back to the game in the second half. As usual Vidyartha who are playing in the top division after five long years did extremely well and fared creditably in the first half to lead. After the half time, with rain coming down after a long spell Rajans pressed strongly to win the match. Vidyartha ruggerites, failed to drive home their advantage in the second half. The next outing for Dharmaraja is with Science on Saturday at Nittawela and Vidayartha will play D.S. Senanayake away.
St. Sylvesters in their second outing in the Bowl competition were beaten by Thurstan 35-10 at Pallekelle rugby grounds. Thurstan gave a good display of rugby. Sylvestrians tried hard to score but Thurstan held them down. In the next game Sylvestrians will play Richmond on Monday at Bogamabara.
Sri Sumangala in the Shield competition played their second game against Lalith Athulathmudali MV but this match did not come off due to the Wesak holiday. They will play CWW Kannangara on Saturday at Rajagiriya.
Sri Rahula the only school from Kandy playing in the Division II Cup Competition, are blessed with a good side. In their first match of the second round they beat President's College Maharagama 26-10. Their next game is with Vidyaloka in Galle.

Making the Dhamma our own
In Buddhism, we gain a type of experientially acquired knowledge that grows in our hearts through what we call practice. We use the word practice in Buddhism much more than we use the word belief. We dont say to each other: Hows your belief going Instead, we ask, Hows your practice going Its a different way of learning.
Intellectual learning gives us intellectual knowledge. Having an intellectual knowledge of Buddhism is akin to memorizing instructions on how to cook rice. Just because weve read or memorized the instructions doesnt mean were going to be successful at cooking rice.
To put it simply, we wont really know how to cook rice until weve done it ourselves. To be successful at it, we need to put into practice the knowledge weve gained.
This second, more experiential way of learning is called implicit learning, which gives us implicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge is not the kind of superficial information that we can jot down on an examination paper as a result of having memorized it.
Its much deeper and harder to put into words than that. Implicit knowledge is something we learn for ourselves through practice, through trial and error. Implicit learning involves a particular type of process for acquiring knowledge.
For example, we might read a set of instructions and then want to apply them.
So we proceed to try to follow the instructions in real life, but then discover that things arent working out well. Consequently, we go back and reread the instructions to figure out what we may have done wrong. Eventually, theres that Aha! moment when were able to carry out the instructions successfully. But to reach that point, we have to keep putting the instructions into practice until we get things right.
We develop insight into the Dhamma, or the truth of the ways things are, in the same way: through the implicit knowledge we acquire through practice
Therefore, we try to apply our understanding of the teachings to our lives. As we do this more and more, different types of insights into the truth of the way things are start to arise that are very personal; they represent the kind of implicit knowledge weve been talking about
As your practice deepens, the implicit knowledge you attain into the nature of what-is becomes even more profound. And even if you cant articulate this knowledge, you certainly have it. You have it because youve done the work of observing your inner world, which has enabled you to glean insights into the workings of your mind
Without insight into how things really are, life can appear to be little more than a series of random experiences of suffering from which were constantly trying to escape. But as our understanding and implicit knowledge of the Dhamma become more profound, we begin to make the Dhamma truly ours.

Message to the modern man
Some scholars with a little knowledge of Buddhism are of the opinion that there is no socio-economic and political philosophy of Buddhism. A well-known scholar, Max Weber, who is considered 'The Father of Sociology of Religion', explaining the socio-political aspect of Buddhism says: "Buddhism had no tie with any social movement, nor did it run in parallel with such and it has established no social and political goal."
He further says that Buddhism is a social and anti-political, and it can be considered to be an "other-worldly religion." This is a misleading and distorted concept of Buddhism. It is very clear, for this misleading idea that Max Weber has not deeply analysed Buddhist teachings. Buddhism is in no way another-worldly religion. It includes a well-defined socio-economic and political philosophy.
Professor D.D. Kosambi and Professor Rhys Davids accept that there is a socio-economic and political philosophy of Buddhism, and they disprove the above mentioned idea. Another misconceived idea of Buddhism says that Buddhism is such a sublime system that ordinary people cannot practise it.
One has to retire to a monastery if one desires to be a true Buddhist. This is a partial view. The doctrine of the Buddha is meant not only for Monks but also for ordinary men and women living in their homes with their family members. The Noble Eightfold Path, observing precepts, meditation on loving-kindness and the Ten Perfection are meant for all. They can be practised in anyone's daily life.
Celestial beings
It is incorrect to say that Buddhism is asocial. Addressing the first sixty Arahants (Perfected Ones), the Buddha says: "O Monks! Walk on tour, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, for the welfare of the many, good and happiness of human beings and celestial beings."
This shows that the Buddha has laid much emphasis on the members of society and their welfare. Therefore, the old Buddhist monasteries became spiritual centres and the centres of learning and culture. The Five Precepts are meant for the whole human society. Any person can observe them and lead a spiritual life, and that would be of great benefit to this competitive society.
The Sigalovada Sutta explicitly explains the family and its social relationships. It gives a set of instructions and ethical teachings that pertain to man's socio-economic and spiritual progress.
Modern man can lead a very happy and prosperous life if he understands the significance of these social relations explained in the Sigalovada Sutta.
Some scholars are of the opinion that Buddhist philosophy is interested only in higher morality and it ignores the social and economic welfare. This is also another misconception of Buddhist socio-economic philosophy.
The Kutadanta Sutta explains the way of developing a country with proper planning and the nature of socio-economic progress. We should not forget that the Buddha expounded these words in the sixth century BC, but even today they are of great value.
The Chakkavattisihanada Sutta explains the poverty, revolution, poverty-related crimes and the chaotic situation of a country and the reasons for those social ills. Today, our competitive global society experiences these socio-economic and political tribulations that are well-explained in the Chakkavattisihanada Sutta.
In the Agganna Sutta we find a theory of the origin of social classes. There the Buddha explains the arising and evolution of vegetation, the origin of state, the evolution of human race and social grades, the changing nature of moral values, and the relationship between moral degeneration and the deterioration of environmental elements.
The Sutta explains how the beings (Satta) were becoming less hard-working, less honest, less ethical and how they lost their physical and mental qualities. Fundamental unreasonable concepts relating to social organisations were radically transformed by the Buddha. The Buddha explained the nature of those concepts and their connection with the Ditthis or dogmatic views of certain religious traditions.
Functional role
The socio-economic and cultural transformations by the Buddha can be seen explicitly even in the present time in our Buddhist societies. Making a comment on the socio-cultural upheaval of Buddhism, Narendranath Bhatthacharya says: "The rise of Buddhism was certainly to serve some social purpose. It had some distinct social and functional role.
But very few attempts have been made to understand all these." It is true that Buddhism is capable of doing a drastic transformation of the present day competitive and war-like society. But it needs and appropriate knowledge and correct understanding of the teachings of the Buddha.
The first significant work in the Buddhist social field was Die Religion des Buddha (1957), written by C.F. Koppen. In his book Koppen explains: ".... the Buddha was viewed as the emancipator of the oppressed and a great political innovator."
Here, it is very interesting to note that Koppen was a close friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.
Karl Marx ruthlessly criticised religion and the widely accepted concept of omnipotent God. Buddhism is completely free from that criticism, for it does not have any concept of God. Trevor Ling in his work 'Buddha, Marx and God' explains that Buddhism is free from his critique. French scholar La Loubere says that Buddhism is totally different from other religions as it does not have a doctrine of God and it teaches rebirth (re-becoming, re-changing, re-transformation of Punabbhava) without accepting the concept of a soul.
Addressing the 'Berlin Science Academy' in 1856, Albrecht Weber explained that Buddhist teachings were so helpful for social reformation and it had accepted the equality of all human beings.
The equality of all human beings is explained in the Vasetta Sutta, Ambatta Sutta, Assalayana Sutta and some other places.
Karl Marx, writing a letter to his daughter Laura Marx, on March 20, 1866, said: "Most of my time I'm walking and breathing fresh air. I read nothing and write less. I go to bed at 9.00 p.m. Generally, I subside into the emotional state of non-existence that Buddhism considers to be the height of human delicacy."
This statement clearly suggests that Karl Marx tried to practice Buddhist mindfulness and meditation in his final days. A well-known political philosopher who wanted to change the world society with revolutionary measures apparently changed his mind and came to the spiritual path.
Buddhism is the most socially-oriented religion. Therefore, the early Buddhist monasteries were celebrated seats of learning which functioned to a great extent like the modern universities.
Buddhist education paved the way for righteous (dhammic) existence and welfare of various societies. A more favourable socio-economic system for the world has been shown by the teachings of the Buddha.
Immeasurable kindness
The contribution of Buddhism in the field of art cannot be explained in words. It is inexpressible. Millions of pagodas and statues speak volumes for the immeasurable kindness and pure motivations of the human heart. Those statues were able to tame the minds and change the hearts of human beings. This is a silent revolution for the welfare of all living beings.
The very great and astonishing creations of Buddhist art can be seen in India, China, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and in some other countries.
The Borobudur Tope Complex in Central Java is a very wonderful creation of the Buddhist mind. Today, modern architects try to explain how they built it.

Mexico fireworks blast kills 14, including 11 children
MEXICO: An explosion at a fireworks warehouse killed 14 people, including 11 children, in a poor Mexican village as it celebrated a religious festival.
The blast struck Monday night in San Isidro, a remote farming village of some 40 houses in central Puebla state, the regional government said.
It came just five months after a similar tragedy killed 42 people in explosions at a fireworks market near Mexico City, in a country where fireworks are often used to mark saints' days.
Villagers in San Isidro were setting off fireworks as part of preliminary festivities ahead of the feast of the village's patron saint on March 15.
One of the fireworks landed in a house where pyrotechnic material was being stored for use on the day of the celebration, causing an explosion which brought down the roof of the dwelling, the Puebla state government said in a statement on Tuesday.
It said that 11 of those killed were minors aged between four and 15. Nine people were killed on the spot and five others died later in hospital.
The explosion left 22 people injured, including three children who were in serious condition, an official in the state governor's office, Javier Lozano, told reporters.
It is a tragedy. Most of them died due to the collapse of the building they were in, he said.
Most of them were killed by being buried.
Army troops and government officials cordoned off the blast site as ambulances rushed in to collect the wounded.
Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto expressed on Twitter his condolences for the families and neighbors of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident. State governor Antonio Gali Fayad said he had ordered the authorities to see to the wounded and give the village of San Isidro all the help necessary. The state government said it was sending food, water and coffins to the families affected.
When our house blew up, it was collapsing and we all ran, but the kids already were under the rubble. My three little grandchildren were killed there, and another is wounded, Carmen Rosas Tentle told AFP softly as paramedics tended to her leg. - AFP

Minister calls for crossborder cooperation to finance e-waste management
Crossborder cooperation among manufacturing and consuming countries and establishing a Global Fund with the support of manufactures and voluntary contributors, through which e-waste management in those end-user countries be financed sustainably is highly important, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
Minister Premajayantha made these remarks on May 5 presenting his concluding observations of the Ministerial Round Table during the High Level Segment of the 2017 meeting of the Conference of Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS) Conventions held in Geneva from May 4-5.
He noted that financing e-waste management solely through imposing taxes at the importers level (upstream) or consumers level (downstream) could have negative effects on the access to technology by citizens in developing countries. He called for increased awareness raising efforts among the public on sustainable waste management.
The ministers engaged with each other on 10 broad-based themes. The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions (BRS) covers regulations on management of industrial chemicals, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants and hazardous wastes, and Sri Lanka is party to all three conventions.
During the Ministerial Roundtable, Minister Premajayantha noted that President Maithripala Sirisena being the Minister of Environment of the country is a clear testimony to Sri Lankas political commitment for sustainable management of environment and implementation of the BRS Conventions.
"On the instructions of the President in 2016, six dedicated divisions were set up in the Presidential Secretariat to deal with environmental issues," he said.
The Minister noted that the President has also taken a personal interest in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and a number of goals are related to fulfilling the commitments under the BRS conventions.
The minister pointed out that in addition to regulations imposed by governments to ban certain hazardous products, it should encourage research and development to produce environmentally friendly alternatives.
In this context, he noted the achievements of the Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology (SLINTEC) as a national example, which has fostered publicprivate partnership for research and development to produce environmentally sound alternative products.
The Sri Lanka delegation to the meetings of the Conference of Parties (COPs) of BRS Conventions held from April 24 to May 5 in Geneva included Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, PRUN/Geneva, Udaya Seneviratne, Secretary, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Jayathilaka, Director, Environmental Pollution Control and Chemical Management, Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri Ranhotige, Chairman, Central Environment Authority, Jayakody Sumith, Registrar of Pesticides and the officials of the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka.

The community living in the Musali administrative area in Wilpaththu were not asking for a different state during their peaceful protest, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha.
He said so while addressing a public gathering held on May 8 at the mosque where the 43-day protest was held.
The protest was due to a gazette notification published saying that Marichchikatti Pallakkuli and villages in Musali administrative area in Puttalm, belonged to Wilpaththu National Park.
"This is a non-violent struggle to gain their heredity, so I request everyone not to comment on this matter in a political view. We should dedicate ourselves to support them as we all are Sri Lankans," the minister added.
He also said that during the past years, Sri Lankans had to face bitter experiences. Especially people in the North and Eastern Provinces experienced the worst. The war left them with nothing. As the war was over, they have the right to come back to their lands which they left in fear.
The minister said, "There is enough evidence to prove that these lands belonged to these people. They have even given tuskers for the Temple of the Tooth Relic. It is very unfair that these people are considered as outsiders."
"We have discussed this matter with the President. We believe that he will give a fair solution to this. The Muslim community played a huge role in building the present Yahapalana Government. We believe that this government will ensure national reconciliation, he added.

New Perth stadium not ready for third Ashes Test
Perth: Perth's new stadium will not be finished in time for the third Ashes Test between England and Australia, with the Waca set to host instead.
Cricket Australia confirmed delays to the new 60,000-capacity stadium will mean the match from 14-18 December will revert to the city's traditional venue.
The five-Test Ashes series starts in Brisbane on 23 November, with Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney also hosting. "It's good now we have some certainty," said CA chief James Sutherland.
CA confirmed the change after meeting with the Western Australia government and Western Australian Cricket Association representatives.
"We knew that everything needed to come together but it was still disappointing," said Sutherland.
"We were really hoping that the Test match could be played at this magnificent new stadium."
The regional authorities hope the fifth one-day international between Australia and England on 28 January will take place at the new venue.
Sutherland added it was "probably unlikely" that any of the domestic T20 Big Bash League or Women's Big Bash League matches in the 2017-18 season would be played at the new stadium, with the Perth Scorchers franchise to host matches at the Waca.
England have not beaten Australia in Tests at the Waca ground since 1978. BBC

Nibbana smooth and trouble-free Make your journey forward
Following is a talk given by Ajahn Suchart Abhijito. He is one of the living Arahant disciples of Ajahn Maha Boowa:
If we continually contemplate on the truth of the three characteristics of existence such as anicca (impermanence), dukkha (stress) and anatt (not-self), we would not dare to cling to anything or wish for things to be as we would like them to be, but instead wed let them be as they are and will be, and be ready to see them depart even if they are our possessions.
If we could really do it, then we wouldnt be consumed by pain and sorrow because we have paa(wisdom) and vipassana (insight) to eliminate the kilesa from our mind leaving it peaceful, content and blissful. Wed have achieved the supreme bliss that the Buddha had pointed out to us by declaring that the happiness of this world can never equal or surpass the supreme bliss that arises out of a mind permanently subdued by the total removal of the kilesa from the mind.
The bliss that results from the development of samdhi (concentration) is not this supreme bliss because of its temporary nature. Once the mind emerges from this samdhi, the kilesa which were also subdued by the power of samdhi would also emerge to wreak havoc on the mind again, which is not the same as the supreme bliss that results from the work of paa(wisdom) that has completely eradicated the kilesa from the mind, not allowing them to ever return again, like the minds of the Buddha and his Noble disciples.
If we truly aspire to this supreme bliss, we must develop both samdhi and paa. Do not be content with just samdhi because its like a piece of rock sitting on a patch of grass preventing the grass from growing. But when the rock is removed the grass would eventually grow again, because it was not uprooted, just like the kilesa, which cant be uprooted by samdhi alone. We need paa (wisdom) or vipassana(insight) to do the job.
Therefore after we have developed samdhi we must then turn to the development of paaor vipassanaa by continually contemplating on the characteristics of all conditioned phenomena such as the five khandha or the five physical and mental components of our existence namely, rupa (body), vedna (feeling), sa (memory or perception), sankhara (thought), and via (sensory awareness) as being impermanent, stressful and not-self.
By continually contemplating on these three characteristics of conditioned phenomena paa(wisdom) would gradually transform from conceptual to practical. Conceptual wisdom is contemplation of the truth while practical wisdom is the application of the truth in our daily life like when we get sick and become anxious. We must let go of our attachment to the body if we want to eliminate our anxiety. We should always be vigilant by constantly developing paaand vipassana after we emerge from samdhi.
After contemplating for a while, the mind gets tired. We must then return to samdhi for a rest, after having rested we would then do more contemplation. This is the way to develop samdhi and paa - they go together like the left and right foot we use for walking, taking turns stepping. Dont listen to those who say skip samdhi, develop paa straight away, or those who say once you have developed samadhi, paa would automatically appear.
These views are not correct. In fact both of them have to be cultivated and developed, one at a time alternatively. They perform different duties. Samadhi is for resting and recharging the mental energy, while paa is like a knife for cutting our attachment to things that agitate and vex the mind.
We must watch what we are getting into in our practice. If we are devoting all our time to samadhi even after we have already mastered it, we should turn to developing paa or vipassana by contemplating on the three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena such as our body, feeling, memory, thought and sensory awareness. But if we are engaging entirely in contemplating without the support of samadhi, we could become more deluded by our contemplation, by thinking that we have become enlightened when no such thing has actually occurred.
We should therefore rest and recharge the mind from time to time to keep it in balance. Samadhi and paa are interdependent; they support and assist each other. Cultivating both would make our journey toward nibbana smooth and trouble-free.

Presidents sudden stopover fulfils schools long-felt sanitary facilities
The sudden stopover of the President Maithripala Sirisena at Talawakele en route to Nuwara Eliya resulted in the construction of a new set of wash-rooms for students at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya by the Army and donation of an ambulance to a rural hospital in the Kotagala area.
The President took time off to mingle with members of the public during his tour to Nuwara Eliya who rushed to the location in Talawakele on hearing the news of the Presidents arrival there. Among them was the principal at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya. The President, who had a friendly word with the principal and others at that point, inquired into shortcomings in the school and the area.
The principal promptly requested the President to get some new wash-rooms done for his school students as wash-rooms available in the school are not at all adequate for so many students.
On being informed of the Presidents pledge, the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Crisanthe De Silva instructed the Security Force Headquarters - Central (SFHQ-C) to undertake the construction of six more new wash-rooms as early as possible to fulfil the Presidents assurances given to the principal.
On May 6, the Army-built six new wash-rooms at the Kotagala Tamil Maha Vidyalaya were vested in students during a brief ceremony attended by Brigadier Administration and Quartering (BAQ) of the SFHQ-C on behalf of Major General Upul Vithanage, Commander, Security Forces - Central.
Army troops under the SFHQ-C comprised of Corps of Engineer Services (CES) and 19 Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) completed the construction project at a cost of Rs 5 lakhs. The troops laid a new water supply pipeline directly to the new wash-room complex by bringing it to match with necessary hygienic standards.
The principal, teachers, students, several army officers and civilians participated in the brief ceremony.

## Title: Promising future for dairy industry

Promising future for dairy industry
Dairy continues to play an integral role in Sri Lankan culture, from being a regular feature at meal times and cultural occasions, to being a vital component of the local rural economy. With the demand for dairy increasing annually, a significant gap still exists between consumption and local supply, and there has been an observable refocus on enhancing and improving the local dairy industry to be more sustainable and profitable. For example, the 2017 Budget outlines many proposals targeted at supporting the local dairy industry, including a Rs. 400 million allocation to assist Sri Lankan dairy farmers. In this context, a critical and practical understanding of the industry and its needs are required to effectively move it forward.
Contributing to the economy
Dairy farming is a source of extensive employment opportunities. Currently, the local dairy animal population of 1.3 million produces approximately 38-42 percent of the total annual dairy consumption of Sri Lanka. Smallholder dairy farmers dominate the livestock industry with an estimated 300,000 registered farms, and of this, 72,400 people depend solely on dairy as their main source of income.
The local dairy sector is currently growing at a rate of 7.5percent, and this will need to double to about 15 percent annually for the next eight years, while total consumption remains static, to meet complete consumer demand. This is a challenging task, given the current state of the industry.
Small holder dairy farmers who supply about 94percent of the milk collected in Sri Lanka are mostly from rural and plantation areas, and often run their dairy farms with inadequate dairying knowledge and training, and face difficulties in the following areas:
1. Insufficient and unproductive stock; and replacing these animals is very expensive compared to output.
2. Access to newer dairy related technologies that contribute to better productivity from the limited land available.
3.Lack of extension services especially regarding the nutrition of dairy animals.
4. Insufficient veterinary services have given rise to the formation of many quackers in the livestock sector, endangering food safety.
5. Food safety issues due to certain forage stores, especially in the up-country area, selling all veterinary items  including anti-microbial hormones  without a prescription.
6. Newly established livestock farms employing non-professional personnel to treat their animals, which creates an animal welfare issue.
In this regard, the companies that are involved in milk collection could play a large role in bridging this gap, as they have greater access to farmer communities. In addition to being involved in milk collection, these companies can provide their farmer suppliers with additional training and education to help address the issues outlined above.
Moving towards a sustainable industry
The Government has set an ambitious target to achieve an increase in self-sufficiency in dairy production by 2020, and it has put forward plans through the National Food Production Programme.
Moreover, the previous and current governments have implemented some important measures to develop the sector by increasing the farm gate milk price and giving tax concessions to dairy related machineries and equipment.
However, this in itself is not sufficient, and local dairy farmers need to develop better skills in dairy farming in order to build a profitable business and contribute to closing the gap between demand for dairy and local supply.
Importance of training and education
Since 2010, we have witnessed some improvement in the participation of the private sector in the dairy industry, where some of the leading companies have implemented training and development programmes which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the sector and on the economy of the country.
An example of an initiative that will have a positive impact on the industry is the establishment of a fully-fledged training farm in Pannala, Kuliyapitiya. At the farm, dairy farmers, extension officers and local veterinarians are exposed to various aspects of dairy farming including dairy farming as an enterprise, feeding practices, handling dairy related machinery and animal health. The most interesting aspect of the training sessions at the Pannala demonstration farm is the pragmatic approach which is tailored to suit the needs of local farmers, who can apply the knowledge they acquire using available resources to increase the productivity of their farms and the animals.
Milk is currently collected through a combination of private and public organisations working in tandem with each other. Total milk collection has increased by 22 percent in 2014-2015 largely due to the increased price paid for milk, which has risen from Rs.33.50 per litre in 2010 to Rs.65-70.00 per litre in 2015. An improved collection network has also played an important role.
Sanctioned by the government, institutions and companies in the dairy industry have formed public-private partnerships to conduct training programmes for those working within the sector, with a focus on educating farmers on the basics of dairy farming, animal nutrition and welfare, and running a sustainable farm business.
These initiatives have encouraged the industry to flourish in a number of ways:
1. There are examples of farmers who have increased milk production from 4-6 litres of milk per cow to 10-12 litres per cow per day, through the introduction of Good Management Practices (GMP) such as feed management, animal nutrition, animal welfare, milk quality management and so on. However the average still hovers around 5 litres.
2. Similarly, some dairy farmers with indigenous breeds of cattle that yielded 2-3 litres of milk per day, have boosted their milk yield to 6-8 litres by replacing their cows with breeds of cattle with stronger genetics.
3. Greater investment and the introduction of new technologies have seen an influx of new entrepreneurs into the dairy sector.
These results demonstrate just a hint of the abundant potential of the Sri Lankan dairy industry, and what is achievable through proper farm business practices.
It is vital that all those involved, including the Government, dairy farmers, milk processors and dairy producers, work in partnership towards the unified goal of a progressive and sustainable dairy sector, and ultimately close the gap in meeting the countrys demand for dairy.

Public visiting crowded places during Vesak festivities warned against A(H1N1)
Persons who suffer from even a simple cold should not go out and move in crowded places during the festive season since they may suffer from A(H1N1) and could spread it unknowingly, Health Services Acting Director GeneralDr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday.
Bandara said persons with cold should stay away from public places. If they go out, they should cover their face, especially when they sneeze. People should not touch their faces with unwashed hands during and after moving in crowed places.
The public can protect themselves by covering mouth and nose with a handkerchief or a tissue paper when they cough and sneeze. Refraining from touching eyes, nose or mouth, avoiding spitting in public, washing hands regularly with soap and water or cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rubs, discarding used tissues/handkerchiefs properly and washing used handkerchiefs with a germ killer soap/liquid before re-using will prevent people from contracting the disease, he said.
Influenza A (H1N1) is an ordinary seasonal disease, but elderly people, very young children, pregnant women, post-partum mothers, people who underwent kidney transplant surgeries, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases may develop complications if they suffer from A (H1N1), he said.

In pursuit of happiness
Buddhism continues to acquire immense popularity in the West, despite the old misunderstanding of the ancient religion. In Sri Lanka too both creative and academic writing now focus on Buddhism. In addition, the people are exposed to a wide range of Buddhist sermonsover media  television, radio, press and the Internet that is  and have been seemingly attracted to the religion they are born with.
Still and all, the essential question remains unanswered: are we happy
Prince Siddhartha left his luxurious life, as he noticed the grief hidden underneath. When he saw the first three ominous signs, the sick, the old and the death, he could grasp the grief embedded in one go  no one else would have had the capacity to see things that way in such simple events of life. All signs but the last must have been one whole sorry sight for him. The serenity of the robed figures face, the fourth and the last sign, gave him an indication where happiness could be traced.
This was a good lesson for Siddhartha to get disillusioned with the temporary happiness in the palatial riches. He left the palace in search of truth. Simply speaking he was out looking for happiness.
And the rest is history, what we have been learning by rote since our childhood. Siddhartha Gothama was enlightened under the Bo tree. What he said and did have been recorded in a colossal document called Thripitaka, thePali Canons.
We listen to and appreciate the monks trying to teach us something almost everyday, especially Poya and Sundays. Both monks and laity publish books in simple, easy-to-understand and creative language. Some books such as Saddharma Ratnavaliya teach us inspiring stories. But are we happy
On the other hand, how can we be happy when the Buddhist philosophy is so pessimistic Yes, this philosophy is pessimistic, as some old westerners misunderstood. Under the Bo tree the Buddha realized the world is based on impermanence.
Little do we know that is the path to happiness. When you realize the actual nature of grief, you have nothing to worry. This is precisely why arahants, except for monk Ananda, did not lament the Buddhas great demise. Arahants are happy beings, and they see no point in lamenting something inevitable.
Thats a speck of what happiness is. One can well argue then happiness is confined to sublime humans such as arahants. Arahants are happy beings certainly, having given up all the worldly pleasures. But that does not mean happiness is something the laity cannot afford.
The laity too can afford happiness, but its going to be a little harder. Just to think Im happy because you may have got what you need temporarily does not work. It needs practice and patience far more than reading or listening to heaps of Buddhism.
First off we need to get back to basics  what we already know. The Buddha delivered how he discovered happiness especially in the very first discourses, Ananta Lakkhana and Dhamma Cakka Pavattana. Its but one major teaching, the Four Noble Truths, he discovered on that decisive day: that the world is suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of that suffering and the path to the cessation of suffering.
See the irony. Realizing the world is suffering itself means you can discover happiness. If you know the real nature of death as it is, you would not have to mourn the death of your loved one.
If you know the majority is driven under delusion, you wont get angry when your workmate does something really blunt.
As for Noble Truths, its a journey from the last to the first. A Buddhist should first concentrate on the path to the cessation of suffering, noble eight-fold path: right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration.
These eight factors are divided into three major categories: virtue (speech, action and livelihood), concentration (effort, mindfulness and concentration) and wisdom (view and intention). This is importantly linked with the three-fold fundamental teaching of any Buddha: stay away from evil deeds, busy yourself with meritorious deeds and maintain an excellent mindset.
Virtue is the first step of any procedure, whether its enlightenment or any other achievement. The Buddhist interpretation of lowest possible virtue means ten kinds of merits (generosity, morality, meditation, respecting those worthy of it, activities such as tidying the temples, sharing your merit, rejoicing in others merits, passing on the teachings, listening to the teachings and straightening your opinion about basic teachings) and five precepts (abstaining from slaughter, theft, sexual misconduct, false speech and alcohol). This kind of behaviour, in a sociological perspective, leads to a righteous and safe society. It will as well lead to your personal purification, which is more important than a righteous society.
Personal purification sets groundwork for concentration. A parable will serve to explain this.
A frustrated novice monk once wanted to disrobe. His teacher did not stand his ground, but had one wish the disciple could not evade. He cleaned the main hall of the temple just like his teacher wanted. The seats were arranged properly. Unwanted things were thrown away. And after a lapse of a few hours, the main hall looked quite neat. The novice monk was happy for himself as the teacher praised what he had done.
You must be tired now that you have tidied the whole main hall. Why dont you stay the night in the main hall and leave early tomorrow morning Disciple had no issue obeying the teachers request. He liked to spend one more night himself in the hall. The novice monk took a shower and stepped into the main hall. He was feeling so happy for what he had done. He realized his mind, like how the hall was a few hours ago, too was in quite a disarray. My mind can be streamlined too this way, he realized. As minutes turned into hours, his mind gradually got used to concentration. Apparently he didnt leave the monastery the following day. The only way to concentration is meditation, which is of course not a piece of cake for an untrained mind. Cultivated virtue is a prerequisite for meditation. You can contemplate the cultivated virtue as well as shunned evil before meditation  that is the neatly arranged temple-hall which set a proper environment for the monk to meditate.
This is, in a way, an act of truth.

Radical path to spiritual joy
Buddhism comes West as a vast body of teaching, and we who receive it are often awed by its abundance, its complexity, and its subtlety. Where is the center, the real thing we should fix on Or is there a real thing at all to be apprehended History shows that Buddhism can and will accommodate itself to new cultures, and will flourish according to the perceptiveness and energy of its new adherents. Now in the West our perceptiveness and energy are put to the test to grasp the "real thing" by which this religion lives  its radicalism.
Suffering
The Buddhas only point the way, and the way they point is a difficult one through the perfection of morality, concentration, and wisdom to the freedom from suffering called Nibbana. It is a way of action. A path is useless without the will to follow it, and good intentions alone are futile. To make the journey, the roots of mental defilement must be torn out entirely; the old illusions we live by must be shattered; the mind must seek the light. It is a radical way, because the Buddha enjoins us to give up what is before, give up what is behind, and give up what is in between. Then and only then will the wheel of birth-and-death be knocked from its axis.
Rebellion
Those of us in the jaded and desperate West who hear the resonance of truth in the teachings of the Buddha must hear also that urging to act, to start an inner rebellion against our ancient sloth and stupidity. Yet the more we ponder the more we recognize the enormity of the task, and an understandable reaction is to set about re-defining just what has to be done and just how prudent it might be to fling ourselves into action. The danger here  so typical in our comfortable and seductive society  is to forget the radical imperative of suffering and try to make over Buddhism into a tame amalgam of platitudes suitable for pleasant contemplation  praising it in order to avoid practicing it. Indeed, Buddhism is rational, patient, deep in wisdom, but should we then just bask in its reflected light
Delusion
Complacency is death. If, out of custom and timidity, Western Buddhists turn their religion into a museum piece, or worse, a hobby, they lose the essence. It is easy enough to settle for an undemanding status quo, a modicum of calm, a pleasant sense of harmonious living, and it is easy enough to postpone or forget any effort to break the shackles of old delusion, believing that one need not strain when the road will likely be long. But in accommodating too much to personal or societal expediency we cheapen our ideals and slide further from the disturbing implications of the Noble Truth of Suffering.
Endurance
We may even take the Buddhist vision of kamma as an indication that "everything is as it should be." But everything is not as it should be. Everything is in fact miserable. If we are complacent we blind ourselves, and there is no safety in blindness.
In the radical view of the Buddha, Samsara is no cosmic merry-go-round, but a terrible juggernaut of birth and death dragging beings through endless cycles of woe. "Free yourselves!" says the Buddha. All lives and events are variations on the theme of suffering. All are without substance, endurance, permanence  merely a web of emptiness, void upon void. The "self" that everyone spends so much time defending and nurturing is pure fiction. Dismiss it, says the Buddha. The world will not conform to our wishes and to presume otherwise is folly; the disciple must cease clinging to it and proceed along the path to the end of suffering. The root problem is craving, and the radical solution is the destruction of craving through wisdom.

Reaching for unselfish joy
One who begins the development of unselfish joy should not start with dearly beloved person, a neutral person or hostile person. For it is not the mere fact that a person is dearly beloved, which makes him an immediate cause of developing unselfish joy, and still less so neutral or hostile person. Persons of the opposite sex and those who are dead are not suitable subjects for this meditation.
A very close friend, however, can be a suitable subject. One who is called in the commentaries an affectionate companion; for he is always in a joyous mood: he laughs first and speaks afterwards. He should be the first to be pervaded with unselfish joy. Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being happy, cheerful, and joyous, unselfish joy can be aroused thus: "This being, verily, is happy! How good, how excellent!" For this is what is referred to in the Vibhanga: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart imbued with unselfish joy Just as he would be joyful on seeing a dear and beloved person, so he pervades all being with unselfish joy" (Vibhanga 274).
But if his affectionate friend or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and unfortunate, then unselfish joy can still be aroused by remembering his past happiness; or by anticipating that he will be happy and successful again in the future.
Having thus aroused unselfish joy with respect to a dear person, the meditator can then direct it towards a neutral one, and after that towards a hostile one.
But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him, he should make it subside in the same way as described under the exposition of loving-kindness.
He should then break down the barriers by means of impartiality towards the four, that is, towards these three and himself. And by cultivating the sign (or after-image, obtained in concentration), developing and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the absorption to triple or (according to the Abhidhamma division) quadruple jhana.
Next, the versatility (in this meditation) should be understood in the same way as stated under loving-kindness. It consists in:
(a) Unspecified pervasion in these five ways:
"May all beings... all breathing things... all creatures... all persons... all those who have a personality be free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety, and live happily!"
(b) Specified pervasion in these seven ways:
"May all women... all men... all Noble Ones... all not Noble Ones... all deities... all human beings... all in states of misery (in lower worlds) be free from enmity, etc."
(c) Directional pervasion in these ten ways:
"May all beings (all breathing things, etc.; all women, etc.) in the eastern direction... in the western direction... northern... southern direction... in the intermediate eastern, western, northern, and southern direction... in the downward direction... in the upward direction be free from enmity, etc."
This versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption (jhana).

Real homeland of Buddhism
Nepal is the birthplace of the Buddha and India is the birthplace of Buddhism. But what would have happened to Buddhism if it had not found a secure and permanent home in Sri Lanka since its introduction in the third century BCE Would Buddhism have attained the degree of acceptance and recognition in the world today if not for Sri Lanka These are the two main questions I wish to ask myself in the course of this presentation.
In no other country has Buddhism had an unbroken presence extending to over twenty-three centuries. While the mere presence for such a long time is a record by itself, Sri Lanka has established a claim to be called the Home of Buddhism on account of a distinct series of remarkable contributions to the promotion and spread of Buddhism in the world. In a well recorded history in a number of chronicles, corroborated by the histories of several other nations and evidence from archaeological monuments, these contributions extend right up to present times.
sapling of the Bodhi tree
Of the nine places to which Arahant Moggaliputtatissa sent missions after the Third Buddhist Council under the patronage of Emperor Asoka, Sri Lanka had two distinct advantages. First, none of the two missions of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis under Arahants Mahinda and Sanghamitta, unlike the bhikkhus of the other eight missions, returned to India after the establishment of Buddhism in the target region. They continued to serve the Island right up to their passing away. Second, Arahant Mahinda and his sister Arahant Sanghamitta were children of the Emperor and their mission was continually supported from Pataliputra with the dispatch of bhikkhunis, the sapling of the Bodhi tree, relics, and skilled artisans. The involvement of as many as ten uncles of Arahants Mahinda and Sanghamitta in the administration of the Island, establishing thus the hereditary civil service of the Lambakannas, could have been a further source of support. These advantages would have contributed to the two major literary activities which promoted the study of Buddhism.
massive literary project
It is to Arahant Mahinda that credit is given for the first production of commentaries on the Tripitaka in Sinhala, the language of the Island. It was a massive literary project and had continued unabated until about the first century of the Current Era. There had been many recensions as Mahatthakatha or Mulatthakatha, Mahapaccariya, Kurindi and Andhattha, attributed to the Mahavihara. It is possible that the Abhayagiri Monastery had a similar tradition as suggested by the term Uttaraviharavamsatthakatha.
These comprehensive commentaries, known as Sihalatthakatha, were characterized by their exegetical authenticity as well as the reliable historical and social information that they recorded. At least one of them  most importantly the Commentary on the Vinaya  had reached China in the fifth century. The Chinese translation provides us about the closest look that we get into the contents and structure of a Sinhala Commentary and gives adequate proof of scholarly quality, coverage and educational value of these commentaries. More of it later.
The second major literary enterprise of the Sri Lankan Sangha was the reduction of the Pali Tripitaka and the Sinhala Commentaries to writing in the first century BCE in the reign of King Valagamabahu at Aluvihara, Matale. The significance of this activity is to be assessed in relation to the survival of the different Buddhist Canons in several languages up to the modern times. With the exception of the Sanskrit Tripitaka, which is available more or less intact in the Chinese translation as Agama Sutras, none of the other Canons have survived in full. We have only a few fragments to show that Canons similar to the Pali Tripitaka once existed in Sanskrit, Khotanese and some other Prakrit languages. Without the written Tripitaka in Pali, which was preserved in Sri Lanka and distributed to various parts of Asia by the Sri Lankan Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, the world would have lost access to the most reliable record of the Buddhas original teachings. Over the last two centuries no Buddhist studies of any depth and quality have been accomplished without reference to the Pali Tripitaka.
Mahayana doctrines
The addition of a second monastery in Anuradhapura by King Valagambahu in the form of Abhayagiri  also in the first century BCE - paved the way for the expansion and diversification of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. This monastery was more open to the new developments taking place in India and was receptive to Mahayana doctrines and practices, including scriptures in Sanskrit. As a result it became the focal point of international Buddhist relations. The third monastery, the Jetavanarama, established two centuries later by King Mahasen, followed a similar eclectic tendencies and all Buddhist traditions  Theravada, Mahayana and even Vajrayana (mentioned in the Nikayasangraha as Nilapatadarshana) co-exited and flourished as can be seen from the artifacts discovered in recent excavations of these two monasteries and elsewhere in Anuradhapura.
The wealth of coins, Intaglios, jewelry and glazed tiles hitherto discovered show the variety of international visitors to these monasteries. The existence of a most noteworthy Mahayana scripture, the Prajnaparamita, engraved on gold plates, as well references to some texts in Mihintale inscriptions is proof that the Sanskrit Mahayana literature was not only preserved but held in esteem. Bactrian coins discovered in Situlpavva in the south show a close relationship of this monastery with the land of King Menander (Milinda). It is possible that Sri Lankan Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were involved in the development of Buddhism outside the Island in a fair portion of the then known world.
trade relations
This they could do because the strategic situation of Sri Lanka at a central point in the Maritime Silk Route between the West and the East, with connecting routes from both sides of the Indian subcontinent. As far back as the fourth century BCE, judging from Greek and Roman records even if our own records are not detailed enough, Sri Lankan ports of Mahatittha (present Mantai) and Godavaya near Ambalantota had been centres of international maritime trade with both Greek and Roman regions of the West and the Chinese and southeast Asian countries of the East. The variety of goods discovered in the course of the recent excavations of the port of Mantai from Greece, Rome, Persia, Venice, Southeast Asia and China are themselves adequate proof of the international trade to which ancient Sri Lanka was exposed. As far back as the fourth century BCE, Anuradhapura is said to have had a Greek enclave and Kautilya, the author of Arthashastra, knew that pearls came from a place called Mayura of the land of the Sinhalas. Cinnamon got the Sanskrit name Sinhalaka about the same time. As trade relations were further expanded with the discovery of the monsoons in the first century, Mahatittha was recognized by Cosmas Indicopluestes as the emporium mediatrix, serving as the entrepot for Western and Chinese ships. The Chinese pilgrim Fa-Xian in the fifth century had been impressed by the luxurious mansions of traders form the Middle-east, thus establishing the fact that trade relations lasted right through history.
Onesicritus knew details of the Sri Lankan ships plying between the Island and the Indus Basin in what is now Pakistan. Emperor Asoka sent his daughter Sanghamitta by ship down the Ganges and from the Port of Tamralipti (Tamluk) on the Bay of Bengal to Jambukola in the Jaffna Peninsula in the third century BCE.

## Title: Star-studded dual drama!

Star-studded dual drama!
Last week, political circles buzzed with the news that Galle district parliamentarian and famed actress Geetha Kumarasinghe was declared ineligible to be a Member of Parliament, as she was also a dual citizen. This followed a decision by the Court of Appeal, where a petition was lodged challenging her election to Parliament.
It is well known that Kumarasinghe, though elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) is loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). Many interpreted the legal action against Kumarasinghe as one more instance of sniping against the JO by the government.
Kumarasinghes ouster from Parliament is a sequel to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which, ironically, was finally endorsed by the JO as well and was passed with a two-thirds majority in the legislature.
Article 91 of Sri Lankas Constitution specifies disqualifications for election as a Member of Parliament and lists under clause 91 (1) (d), twelve circumstances under which individuals may be disqualified from functioning as a Member of Parliament. The 19th Amendment added a thirteenth, a citizen of Sri Lanka who is also a citizen of any other country.
Kumarasinghe, who is also a Swiss national, maintains that she had revoked her Swiss citizenship by writing to the Swiss embassy. However, the Court of Appeal held that revoking citizenship is a far more complex process than merely writing a letter to the embassy of the relevant country and disqualified Kumarasinghe of her parliamentary seat.
More drama was to follow. Kumarasinghe, known for defiant, outspoken roles on the silver screen was equally rebellious in real life. She proclaimed her innocence and maintained that she will continue as a Member of Parliament for the Galle district.
This was Kumarasinghes second attempt to enter Parliament. She first contested the general elections in 2010 nursing the constituency of Bentara-Elpitiya, when fellow actress Malani Fonseka entered Parliament on the SLFP National List.
Court of Appeal verdict
Kumarasinghe however was not as lucky as she did not poll sufficient preference votes, despite the UPFA electing seven out of the ten parliamentarians from the Galle district. In Kumarasinghes own constituency of Bentara-Elpitiya, the UPFA polled 68 per cent of the vote. At the time Kumarasinghe cried foul, saying election irregularities deprived her of a win.
At the 2015 August general elections, Kumaratunga was more fortunate. She polled 63,955 preference votes and was placed fifth, second only to Chandima Weerakkody, Ramesh Pathirana, Nishantha Muthuhettigama and Manusha Nanayakkara. However her citizenship issue has now led to the current controversy.
After the verdict of the Court of Appeal was announced, more drama was to follow. When the matter was raised in Parliament by United National Party parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was to declare that he had not been officially informed of the court decision.
However, Speaker Jayasuriya also said that he would act according to the court decision when it was conveyed to him. Kumarasinghe attended Parliament that day, met with Speaker Jayasuriya and informed the latter that she would be lodging an appeal in the Supreme Court. Kumarasinghe was planning to do so within the forty two days which is stipulated as the time period to lodge such an appeal.
That was when Kumarasinghe and the JO missed a trick. Perhaps caught up in the euphoria of its success in attracting a large crowd for its May Day rally, the JO was found napping, not lodging an appeal against the Court of Appeal verdict. That was because the verdict had then been conveyed to the Speaker and Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dissanayake had consulted the Attorney General for advice on the most suitable course of action.
Having received advice to the effect that a vacancy had been created in Parliament, Dissanayake then communicated this to the Elections Commission. That was when the mainstream SLFP swung into action and announced that Piyasena Gamage would be nominated instead of Kumarasinghe.
Holding a media briefing, UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera made the announcement. Supporting him was Chandima Weerakkody, a former Deputy Speaker and also a candidate from the Galle district at the last general elections. Weerakkody was to explain that, when the Secretary General had conveyed to the Elections Commission that there was a vacancy in Parliament, Kumarasinghe had not lodged an appeal. Hence the UPFA was obliged to fill the vacancy, he said.
Kumarasinghes dual citizenship
Kumarasinghe rushed to lodge papers for an appeal in the Supreme Court and then hurried to the Elections Commission in Rajagiriya to inform the Commission that an appeal had been lodged but how the issue unfolds remains to be seen. Legal analysts say she may have to seek an injunction preventing the appointment of Piyasena Gamage until the determination of her appeal, if the government presses ahead with Gamages appointment.
As the drama over Kumarasinghes dual citizenship played out in courts and in Parliament, there were other concerns. There was speculation that there were other Members of Parliament who were also dual citizens. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna parliamentarian Vijitha Herath raised the issue in Parliament requesting a list of names of the dual citizens who were parliamentarians. There were reports that a government minister and another JO parliamentarian were dual citizens, he claimed arguing that the law should be equally applied to all parliamentarians and not only to Kumarasinghe.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila went one step further and formally requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of parliamentarians who held dual citizenship. Gammanpila made the request under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
The first to react to these claims was Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe who emphatically doused speculation that he was a dual citizen. Samarasinghe declared that he was not a dual-citizenship holder and invited those who make such allegations to request the Foreign Affairs Minister or the Speaker to check who among the parliamentarians held dual-citizenship certificates.
Im 61-years-old now and never in my life ever thought of applying for dual-citizenship. I personally believe its immoral for a politician to be a dual citizen because a person has to pledge to uphold the Constitution of another country, Samarasinghe stated at a media briefing.
However, for most political observers, the real impact of the verdict against Kumarasinghe is not the fate of the Galle district MP or even that of other legislators in the current Parliament. The most significant fallout from the court decision is the fate of the Rajapaksa brothers - Gotabhaya and Basil, both of whom are dual citizens, holding citizenship in the United States. Indeed, there have been accusations that the dual citizenship clause was introduced to the 19th Amendment to specifically target the Rajapaksas.
It will be recalled that, in the lead up to the 2015 Presidential Election, the then opposition made it clear that the dual citizenship clause would be introduced. It was argued that it would prevent individuals leaving Sri Lanka after corrupt practices and avoiding justice by seeking refuge in another country.
19th Amendment
With Mahinda Rajapaksa now aged seventy one and in any event debarred from running for President again because of the 19th Amendment reinstated the two-term limit for an individual, the JOs campaign relies on another leader to take it forward. Many feel that either Basil or Gotabhaya are contenders for such a role- but the 19th Amendment effectively nullifies those prospects.
In fact, Basil Rajapaksa, the former all-powerful Minister of Economic Affairs in the previous government was asked about this. He categorically stated that he would remain a dual citizen as his family were all United States citizens and he did not wish to renounce that citizenship. He was more ambivalent when asked about Gotabhaya Rajapaksas plans, stating they remain to be seen.
Thus the dual citizenship has created a conundrum for the JO it could have done without in a week where it was elated after the large turnout for its May Day rally. There will, no doubt, be many more episodes to this drama- which could well be as entertaining and memorable as the many movies Geetha Kumarasinghe has starred in.

## Title: The Taste of Freedom

The Taste of Freedom
The clarion call of our present age is, without doubt, the call for freedom. Perhaps at no time in the past history of mankind so much as at present has the cry for freedom sounded so widely and so urgently, perhaps never before has it penetrated so deeply into the fabric of human existence.
In response to man's quest for freedom, far-reaching changes have been wrought in almost every sphere of his activity  political, social, cultural and religious. The vast empires which once sprawled over the earth, engulfing like huge mythical sea-monsters the continents in their grasp, have crumbled away and disintegrated, as the peoples over whom they reigned have risen up to repossess their native lands  in the name of independence, liberty and self-rule.
Old political forms such as monarchy and oligarchy have given way to democracy  government by the people  because every man demands the right to contribute his voice to the direction of his collective life. Long-standing social institutions which kept man enthralled since before the dawn of history  slavery, serfdom, the caste-system  have now disappeared, or are rapidly disappearing, while accounts of liberation movements of one sort or another daily deck the headlines of our newspapers and crowd the pages of our popular journals.
The arts, too, bear testimony to this quest for greater freedom: free verse in poetry, abstract expression in painting, and atonal composition in music, are just a few of the innovations which have toppled restrictive traditional structures to give the artist open space in his drive for self-expression. Even religion has not been able to claim immunity from this expanding frontier of liberation. No longer can systems of belief and codes of conduct justify themselves, as in the past, on the grounds that they are commanded by God, sanctified by scripture, or prescribed by the priesthood. They must now be prepared to stand out in the open, shorn of their veils of sanctity, exposed to the critical thrust of the contemporary thinker who assumes himself the right to free inquiry and takes his own reason and experience for his court of final appeal. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of action have become the watchwords of our public life, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience the watchwords of our private life. In any form in which it obtains, freedom is guarded as our most precious possession, more valuable than life itself. "Give me liberty or give me death," an American patriot exclaimed two hundred years ago. The succeeding centuries have echoed his demand.
As though in response to mankind's call for wider frontiers of freedom, the Buddha offers to the world His Teaching, the Dhamma, as a pathway to liberation as applicable today as it was when first proclaimed twenty-five centuries ago.
"Just as in the great ocean there is but one taste  the taste of salt  so in this Doctrine and Discipline (dhammavinaya) there is but one taste  the taste of freedom": with these words the Buddha vouches for the emancipating quality of His doctrine.
Whether one samples water taken from the surface of the ocean, or from its middling region, or from its depths, the taste of the water is in every case the same  the taste of salt. And again, whether one drinks but a thimble-full of ocean water, or a glass-full, or a bucket-full, the same salty taste is present throughout. Analogously with the Buddha's Teaching, a single flavor  the flavor of freedom (vimuttirasa)  pervades the entire Doctrine and Discipline, from its beginning to its end, from its gentle surface to its unfathomable depths. Whether one samples the Dhamma at its more elementary level  in the practice of generosity and moral discipline, in acts of devotion and piety, in conduct governed by reverence, courtesy, and loving-kindness; or at its intermediate level  in the taintless supramundane knowledge and deliverance realized by the liberated saint, in every case the taste is the same  the taste of freedom.
If one practices the Dhamma to a limited extent, leading a house-hold life in accordance with righteous principles, then one experiences in return a limited measure of freedom; if one practices the Dhamma to a fuller extent, going forth into the homeless state of monkhood, dwelling in seclusion adorned with the virtues of a recluse, contemplating the rise and fall of all conditioned things, then one experiences a fuller measure of freedom; and if one practices the Dhamma to its consummation, realising in this present life the goal of final deliverance, then one experiences a freedom that is measureless.

Why you are addicted to phone
Buddhist perspective of technology dependency :
About two years ago, I lost my phone. Waiting at Newark International Airport, I heard the cancellation of my Chicago flight, closed down by a blizzard. I took out my phone to call home, but then I learned about another plane, soon departing from a different terminal. Stampeding down the concourse with the crowd, I must have dropped my aging Samsung.
In the weeks that followed, I added Buy a phone to my list of undone tasks, but as each list replaced the former one, something held me back. Gradually, I understood: losing the phone felt liberating.
Living as I do in central New Jersey, I wouldnt have the same sense of relief if my Toyota disappeared. And Id surely miss my Kenmore washing machine, still running after 20 years. But cell phones differ from technologies like theseand in ways we might not appreciate.
Unconnected
Pinging, ringing, and vibrating all the time, phones can be annoying, but thats not what sets them apart. Lying in my bed at the end of a day, I dont feel so overwhelmed by anxiety that I cant relax unless I run downstairs to do another load of dirty clothes. But anxiety, guilt, loss, lonelinessthese emotions can arise when Im unconnected to my phone, and Im not the only one this happens to. The mystery is why.
Most of our machines have been designed to replicate or enhance our bodies functioning. A hammer is a prosthetic hand; bicycles are prosthetic legs. But cell phones, iPads, and PCs are prostheses for our minds.
People often talk about the mind as though its a computer when the relationship is just the reverse: computers imitate our mental processing. Our grandparents didnt need Steve Jobs to watch the screens behind their eyes. Theyd admire mental snapshots of their patios or replay movies in their heads, adding sound to the images.
Computers and their spinoffs are machines designed to simulate these capacities, and like all tools, they soon become extensions of ourselves.
The mind is no computer, but our consciousness still merges with our phones and tablets as seamlessly as a painters hand fuses with her brush or musicians vocalize through their instruments.
This fusion can happen, Buddhist teaching holds, because consciousness is formless and adopts the qualities of everything it touches. Once weve immersed ourselves in our screens, they become our whole realityand thats why texting drivers look up with surprise when they rear-end the car in front of them.
Nave
Wed like to believe theres a clear boundary between the real and the virtual, but if screens have become extensions of our minds, that assumption could prove fatally nave, especially now that IT visionaries claim an implant linking our brains to the Web is less than a decade away.
Prapanca
Long before the Internet, early Buddhists coined a termprapanca in Sanskritto describe the tendency of our thoughts to proliferate like entangling vines, as Zen teachers say.
Mahayana Buddhists expanded the term to include not only words and ideas but also images, memories, and other mental fabrications.
Now, the time has come for us to add everything streaming into our heads from our new prostheses: YouTube videos, online news, music, selfies sent from far away.
The trouble with prapanca, the Buddha taught in the Madhupindika Sutta, is that the nonstop novelty prevents us from uncovering the sources of our suffering. We shuttle from one screen to the next, trying to allay our nagging sense that somethings missing or not right. But nothing we find satisfies for long, and so we start Googling again.
Instead, we need to turn our devices off. When the screens in front of us go blank, we have a better chance to become aware of another screen behind our eyes, the screen of the mind.
Then, if we sit quietly, watching the breath or reciting the Buddhas name, that inner screen will empty out until it appears formless and radiant.
And once we make contact with this bright, empty mind, our craving for fresh screens comes to a stop. No matter what displays we encounter when we switch our devices on again, all of them will convey the same one taste.
Unproduced
The Samdhinirmocana Sutra describes this one taste as a timeless now that is unproduced, unceasing, quiescent from the start, and naturally in a state of nirvana (trans. John Powers). In that state, where you have nothing to achieve and nowhere left to go, it wont hurt to make an occasional call or look up a restaurant on an app because the mind behind your eyes hasnt changed.
Still, Im not planning to buy a new phone.
Phones come in handy if your car breaks down or you get lost in Brooklyn.
But when Ive found myself in those predicaments, Ive had to reacquaint myself with two often overlooked dharma practices. The first is giving a person on the street the chance to offer me assistance.
The other practice goes to the very heart of our real, not virtual, connectedness. That practice is asking for help.
