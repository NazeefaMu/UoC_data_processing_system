Intelligence is important in combating organised crimes
Once you become a Presidents Counsel, you should have some ethics. Such a person should not appear for a drug addict or z drug smuggler. When the PC appears, he brings up some technical problem or evidence gathering problem and the case is dismissed. This is one of the main problems that law enforcement officers face, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunawardena said.
He said he had spoken even to the President in this regard.
He was speaking at a seminar on organised crimes held at the BCIS,
The big drug offenders are still at large and intelligence is an important factor in combating organised crimes and the offenders cannot be arrested without proper intelligence, he said.
Referring to the incident where an Iranian trawler with over 100 kg of heroin was caught, he said the offender should have been given the death penalty because anyone caught with even 2mg of heroin gets the death penalty. But the case is still going on, he said.
When we started the special forces in the Navy, they said the navy was going to get killed. When we knew that the LTTE is bringing arms and ammunition on ships, renowned researchers said the Sri Lanka Navy does not have a single officer who can trace the LTTE network. But as in the Pandora Box, there was something at the bottom and we hoped for the best, he said.
The Chief of Defence Staff said that in Sri Lanka, possession of 2mg or more of heroin warrants the death penalty. Under these circumstances, we can assure that over 20,000 would have to face the death penalty, he said.

Let technology be an opportunity,  not a challenge - Rachel Grimes
President of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), Rachel Grimes called on Chartered Accountants to embrace the technological revolution as an opportunity instead of looking at it as a challenge.
Speaking at a forum organised by CA Sri Lanka during her four day visit to Sri Lanka last week, Grimes said that as part of her presidency, she has focused heavily on technology, because there has never been a more exciting time to be an accountant than right now. Technology is opening doors and I have set out to assist everyone on how to utilize technology, she said.
Grimes said that accountants must own technology as an opportunity instead of seeing it as a challenge, and for this reason she has also taken steps to create a technology advisory group at IFAC, which is the global body for the accountancy profession with a representation of 175 member bodies from 173 countries.
Speaking further on the role of the IFAC technology advisory group, Grimes said that the group has representatives from around the world, and the task of the group was to focus on the new A, B, C and D which is related to the accountancy profession.
Elaborating further, she said A stands for Artificial Intelligence, B stands for Block Chain, while C stands for Cyber Security and D for Data Analytics.
We believe that these skills will form the foundation of the accounting profession as we move into the future, Grimes said.
She also said that a strong government, and a strong economy only comes with strong member bodies, and therefore congratulated CA Sri Lanka for making tangible contributions to the development of Sri Lanka. Everyone looks at awe in terms of Sri Lankas growth which is in the area of 6.5% over the last ten years and this is a very proud place to be.
Many economies around the world look at your country with great envy as you move up to the middle upper class in your development, and I congratulate all of you for being part of this development, she told the CA Sri Lanka members at the forum.
Grimes also noted that she was dealing with regulators to ensure that the accounting profession continues to have strong audit and ethical standards throughout the globe.
We are having continuous discussions with them on this, Grimes said. She also highlighted the importance of ethics for the accounting profession, and how ethics underpins the profession.
Speaking at the forum, President of CA Sri Lanka, Jagath Perera emphasized the need for chartered accountants to change and equip themselves with new tools and skills if they are to remain relevant amidst the technological revolution.

SL needs to address concerns voiced by private sector
The White Paper on FDI Landscape and Investor Sentiment in Sri Lanka 2018, presented by American Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka (AMCHAM) yesterday highlighted that Sri Lanka will need to address concerns voiced by the private sector.
Particularly concerns relating to policy instability and labour constraints needs to be addressed if the country looks to position itself as an attractive FDI and trade destination in its pursuit of economic reforms.
If the concerns of the private sector are not addressed, the report revealed that vision of Sri Lanka being an attractive FDI and trade destination will likely remain a pipe dream.
Nevertheless, the white paper highlights that there are many positives to look forward to over the coming years in Sri Lanka as reform procedures are also being implemented to improve investment promotion and business conditions within the country, while negotiations are underway to improve Sri Lankas trade relations.
Making a presentation on FDI Landscape and Investor Sentiment in Sri Lanka 2018, in Colombo, yesterday, Stax Founder and CEO Rafi Musher also noted that, for Sri Lanka to become an attractive FDI and trade destination, it is essential to ensure transparency and corporate governance, improve policy stability, bring in capital across all the industries and also to invest in education and vocational training to match the industry needs and potential.
Noting that foreign investors have a tepid view about overall economic conditions in Sri Lanka, Musher says it is also important to identify current FDI trends, perspectives of investors in the private sector, as well as the economic outlook for Sri Lanka if Sri Lanka looks to position itself as an attractive FDI and trade destination.
While speaking on measures, need to be taken to attract more FDI into Sri Lanka, Musher stressed the need to have an umbrella organization for FDI while capitalising on Sri Lankas geo political positioning, economic conditions, quality of infrastructure, high literacy rates and Sri Lankas ability to access to key markets. According to Musher, improving the quality of data relating to FDI in Sri Lanka will also have a signaling effect on potential new investors and will lead to high FDI inflows.
The report states that while FDI into Sri Lanka has historically been low, FDI inflows began further declining from 2011-2015, with a -30% drop within this period , the largest decline being in 2015 which stood at USD 680 million.
FDI inflows into Sri Lanka suffered during 2011 2015 period, with regulators attributing the drop to uncertainty caused by the removal of existing tax concessionsalthough the introduction of a new concession scheme appears to have contributed to a rebound over the last couple of years.
FDI inflows into Sri Lanka primarily originate from Asia although USA is among the top 10 countries of origin, they accounted for only -4% of Board of Investment (BoI) investments in 2017 .
In 2016, Malaysia, India, Netherlands, China and UAE were among top five sources of FDI in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka primarily attracts FDI from Asia, with telecommunication, tourism, and manufacturing being key areas.
With FDI in Asia increasing, and economic competitors such as Bangladesh and Vietnam showing continued growth.

Addressing a media briefing held at the UNP headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday, the Minister said that former minister Prof. G.L Peris has said that we also should withdraw from the United Nations Human Rights Council. This is an invalid statement.
We had to face many injustices due to US involvement in the Council. But we faced these challenges successfully. However, the previous government did not face these challenges and failed to uphold our cause. Now we are facing all these challenges successfully and overcoming obstacles gradually. Therefore, we should fight for our cause while remaining in the Council, he said.

ADB to assist Maldives to Improve Environmental Protection
ADB will also provide a $500,000 technical assistance (TA) grant to strengthen the capacity of the Waste Management Corporation Limited, the state-owned operator tasked to manage solid waste in the project area. The TA is financed from ADBs Technical Assistance Special Fund.
The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $33.07 million grant to improve environmental protection and sustainability efforts in the Greater Mal capital region and its surrounding islands in Maldives through the establishment of a sustainable solid waste management system.
With Maldives continued urbanization and popularity as a tourist destination, there is a need to address the growing issue of solid waste, said ADB Senior Urban Development Specialist Mr. Ron H. Slangen. ADBs support will help provide a healthy living environment in the Greater Mal capital area and its surrounding islands, boosting the countrys growth and tourism prospects.
Greater Mal and its inhabited outer islands lack an organized and sustainable waste management system for the 774 tons per day of mixed solid waste that the area currently generates.
This figure is expected to grow as urbanization and tourism increase. Open dumping and burning of garbage in the area also pose environmental and public health hazards, compromising air quality, as well as contaminating soil and groundwater.
The project will install an improved waste collection, transfer, and disposal system, including, trucks, transfer stations, waste vessels with rehabilitated harbor, and heavy equipment for dumpsite management.
The whole system will be made climate- and disaster-resilient through strengthened seawalls, raised floor elevations, enhanced drainage, and emergency planning and awareness raising.
Community-based island waste management systems will be enhanced on 32 inhabited outer islands covered by the project. The project is expected to benefit 216,000 people, or half of Maldives population.
As part of the project, ADB will administer a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, funded by the Government of Japan, to help construct community-based island waste management centers, provide skills and capacity building to island communities targeting women, and deliver environmental awareness campaigns on the inhabited outer islands in the project area.
ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.
Established in 1966, it is owned by 67 members48 from the region. In 2017, ADB operations totaled $32.2 billion, including $11.9 billion in cofinancing.

Bangladesh Bank sold $2.31bn in fiscal 2017-18
In the just-concluded fiscal year, Bangladesh Bank sold $2.31 billion to keep the currency market stable.
The figure is the highest in five years.
On Wednesday, the inter-bank exchange rate of the dollar stood at Tk 83.7 after an increment of 4 percent occurred from Tk 80.59 which was the rate a year earlier.
The foreign currency market has remained unstable since the beginning of the last fiscal year.
According to a BB report released last year, the consistent depreciation of the taka against the dollar is quite unusual.
The banks charged Tk 2 more for selling one dollar from businesses than the rate declared for the settlement of letters of credit, the report found.
As a result, the import cost increased and the foreign currency market became unstable despite the rise in inward remittances and export earnings.
Zaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies or BIDS, said equipment imports necessary to implement infrastructure projects and the last years higher rice import put pressure on the dollar price.
According to the BB, the overall import payment for goods increased by 25.18 percent in the first 10 months of fiscal 2017-18, of which capital equipment import accounted for 31 percent of the increment.
The central bank made a routine payment of $1.57 billion to the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) against imports during the January-February period of 2018. The import bill for Bangladesh has never been higher than this amount before.
For the May-June period, it will have to pay around $1.27 billion this week, said a BB official.
At present, the BB has more than $33 billion in forex reserves. After the ACU payment, the reserves will decline marginally.
Bangladesh has abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime in 2003 and now practises a floating exchange rate system. This means the foreign exchange rate will be determined by the market.
To keep the market stable, the BB interferes in the forex market sometimes by purchasing and selling the greenback.
In fiscal 2014, the BB purchased $5.15 billion, but did not sell any dollar. The following year, it sold more than $3.76 billion against the purchase of $375 million.
In fiscal 2016, the central bank did not sell the dollar. Rather, it bought $4.14 billion.
In the fiscal year of 2017, the BB sold $175 million in dollars against the purchase of $1.94 billion. (bdnews24.com)

BOI inks MOU with EDB, BUSINESS FRANCE
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka and Business France yesterday.
The BOI Chairman Dumindra Ratnayake said: This MOU is a very positive development since it will help to increase in the future investment in areas such as manufacturing and infrastructure. It also has to be seen in connection with the FTAs that Sri Lanka has entered into with India, Pakistan and Singapore and will sign in the future with China. These FTAs give market access to goods produced in Sri Lanka.
Another important development is Port City with many opportunities for construction and other investment in the future.
Ratnayake also said that the agreement will help to strengthen relations and facilitate trade and investment with France in the future.
Indira Malwatte Chairperson of the EDB stated France is the 6th largest market for Sri Lankan exports to the European union. She added Sri Lanka is to launch the National Export Strategy and this will also generate greater interest in our products. Currently we are promoting Ship and Boat building, spices to be used in the manufacture of perfumes and cosmetics and of course the IT sector. Sophie Clavelier, Head of Business France South Asia, stated We must ensure that this MOU must live and must work together in developing certain niche areas that Sri Lanka has to offer. One area which I would like to see develop is the Agro Sector where Sri Lanka has lot of potential.
She added that a country such as Sri Lanka should not look at competing with giants economies such as India but that Sri Lanka should be developing niche sectors that are quality orientated. We should not look at large but at quality and high end sectors.
Jean-Marin Schuh, Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said: The MOU will enhance the economic co-operation between Sri Lanka and France. We are currently focusing on expanding French exports as well as Sri Lankan investment in France.
There are certain areas where l see many possibilities. For example the French side could be interested in developing Sri Lankan ports as France has many leading shipping companies. I also see opportunities in the development of tourism.
This is an area where France has considerable experience and in 2020 our country will attract 120 million tourists in the course of the year. Other areas that very promising are co-operation in the financial sector and also we are currently involved in the development of mini dairies.
Under the Agreement the parties are to exchange information and provide mutual support for the benefit of their clients and also to promote economic growth in both Sri Lanka and France. In addition the MOU seeks to encourage each party to promote the image of the other country and support FDI from its nationals to the other country.
It is also important to note that each party is responsible for its own costs of operation. The agreement will be in effect for a period of two years and would be automatically renewed unless notice is given by one of the parties.
The MOU also covers intellectual property rights and the use of trademarks and logos of their signatories. There is also mechanism for consultation between the signatories of the MOU.
The MOU augurs well for future expansion of tourism, trade and investment from France to Sri Lanka.

CEB Unions cry foul over power buying agreement
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry officials have entered into an illegal agreement with a private power generating company to buy power for three years from a power plant in Embilipitiya causing a huge financial loss to the country, Joint Union Collective Convenor Ranjan Jayalal said.
Addressing the media Jayalal said the Sri Lanka Electricity Board had agreed with that illegal agreement to obtain power for three year period violating the directives of the Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).
The MOU had been signed between the private company and Ministry Secretary on April 5 this year. As per with the agreement, the Electricity Board purchases electricity from the private company at a cost of Rs 26 per unit and sells at Rs 16. The net loss is Rs 10 per unit, he said.
Owing to this transaction the private company receives a net profit of Rs 1,100 mn annually while the Electricity Board is run at a huge loss becoming a severe burden to the Treasury and the entire country.
Considering this situation, the PUCSL had recommended not to enter into this transaction as there is no justifiable reason to purchase electricity at this moment, he added.
As per electricity purchase regulations, electricity should be purchased only for a short period probably for six months from the private sector. But when it comes to this so called agreement, the Electricity Board had agreed to purchase electricity for three years continuously, assuming there will be a severe drought for three years in the country.
"Now electricity generating reservoirs are full and there is no need to purchase a single unit from the public sector, he noted.
Jayalal queried whether there were weather forecasters at the Electricity Board to assume that there will be a drought for three years.
CEB's former Power Purchasing Deputy General Manager Sujeewa Abeywickrama said there is a huge racket behind this transaction.As the result of him opposing this illegal transaction, Electricity Board authorities had suspended his services, he said.
Jayalal said the monetary loss to the Electricity Board will not be less than the bond issue losses.

Contempt of Court action filed against Minister Bathiudeen
A Contempt of Court action was yesterday filed in the Court of Appeal against Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for allegedly providing false information through an affidavit regarding a writ petition filed for allegedly installing human settlement in the Villattikulam Forest Reserve in the Mannar district.
The petition was filed by a public interest litigation activist and prospective candidate of the 2020 Presidential Election Attorney-at-Law, Nagananda Kodituwakku.
Filing the application in the Court of Appeal, Kodituwakku sought an order to charge the Minister on the offence of Contempt of Court under Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
The petitioner stated that the respondent minister had been a Member of Parliament and a Cabinet Minister of the previous regime under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa (2005-2015) as well. During the period the illegal encroachment of the Villattikulam Forest Reserve had initially taken place.
The petitioner stated that the respondent Minister had objected to the writ petition with a statement of objections against the issuance of notice which was supported by an affidavit dated April 6, 2018 furnished by him.
The petitioner stated that the crux of the issue in this case is about the abuse of power by the minister to encroach over 700 acres of the forest under the pretext, that they were reclaimed areas previously occupied by the Muslims until 1990. They were forced to flee by the LTTE during the civil war period, the petitioner stated.
The petitioner further stated that Google Satellite Images via Landsat, copernicus, DigiGlob, CNES and Airbus confirmed the petitioners stand that there had not been human settlement in the existence in the virgin of the Villattikulam reserved forests up to 2011. In this original writ petition, the petitioners had named former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, the Conservator General of Forests and several others as respondents.
The writ petition stated that the Villattikulam reserved forests has 2108 hectares of forest cover as per the regulations framed under section 3 of the Forest Ordinance and published in the Government Gazette No 1759/2 of 21 May 2012 and law prohibits abuse of any such reserved forest and the State is under duty to protect such forests from any form of exploitation.

Death penalty should be enforced on drug-traffickers: Kiriella
Leader of the House and Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said he was prepared to impose capital punishment on drug-traffickers in future.
The first step to build a nation free of drug-related crimes should begin at home; parents play a pivotal role in nurturing the future generations of this country, the minister said, I served in the Kandy courts as a lawyer for a period of 25 years, during which I had witnessed multiple cases that involved children addicted to drugs and alcohol.
When I listened to their stories, I understood that they became addicted to drugs and alcohol due to unstable domestic environments; there were even a few cases with children from upper-class families being addicted to drugs and alcohol, he said, adding that therefore, it was of utmost importance for parents to build a safe environment for their children, to avoid such unfortunate incidents from recurring in the future, he added.
The programme which was initiated by President Maithripala Sirisena in order to eradicate drugs and alcohol in this country, was designed to encourage and educate people against drugs; it is a great programme, Minister Kiriella said.
He added that Cabinet had held discussions regarding the matter, and that they were ready to enforce strict rules on drug-traffickerseven the death penalty. Although there were numerous rules and regulations in place at present, the unit which was family must be strong in order to fight the drug menace in the country.
Before 1815, there were no bars in Kandy; it was after the colonisation by the British Empire that our people were drawn to alcohol and drugs. In 1810, King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha drove back the British forces, he said.
But during the five years that followed, the king became addicted to alcohol and lost the trust and respect of his court and rulers. As a result, the British were able to claim power over Kandy once again. We must learn from the mistakes of our past to move forward as a country, he added.
A large number of ministers and parliamentarians were present at the event, which was chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena.

EECL and Ductor to invest US$ 50mn
Endevour Energy Corporation Limited (EECL) and Ductor Private Limited in Helsinki of Finland, will invest US$ 50 million to build South Asias first bio fertilizer and bio energy project in Bigiriya. The construction of the project is now in process and would be opened end of the year.
We have acquired technology for the project from the Ductor Corporation, is a company with a portfolio of proprietary and patented technology to improve waste management and produce energy and food production.
The main raw material used for the production of fertilizer and energy would be chicken droppings and Chicken litter. We will also convert municipal waste into energy and fertilizer.
Chairman of Endevour Energy Corporation Limited (EECL), an Australian based International Corporate Entity floated a limited liability company Kumar Perumal, said that the Plant would produce 10 MW of electricity. The bio fertilizer produced could be used to fertile the soil to grows paddy, tea, rubber and variety of vegetables.
The poultry farmers would also feel at ease, being able to move out the piling up of the unwanted chicken waste, a burden on their heads for the past decades.
Once this Corporation is established with the partnership with the Ductor Private Limited Company, of Finland, we hope to invest in other South Asian countries from 2020 with this concept.
He said that the project would also help Sri Lankas objective to free Sri Lanka, is free from harm caused by the chemical fertilizer. The agreement to build the plant was signed recently at Cinnamon Grand Hotel by the Economic Affairs and Employment Deputy Minister Petri Peltonen of Finland and Ductor Pte President, Marko Karkkainen and Kumar Perumal.
Perumal told Daily News Business that his Company has done a very meticulous study on poultry farms operating in the country, and has identified 698 poultry farms within both Western and North Western Provinces, producing at the rate 130 million broils within an year. With a view to ensure of unbroken supply of chicken droppings to the 10 MW plant, the company would also sign a MoU with the Poultry Farmers Association soon.
He said that his Company would be in a position to collect the much needed 130000 tons of chicken litter per annum to operate the plant intended to produce energy and bio fertilizer.
He also went on to say that with the passage of time, his corporation would stretch far and wide and go into other areas including North and East to collect chicken litter/droppings.
We have also learnt much about the piggeries operating in the country as well. We will venture to do a serious study on piggeries to see the feasibility of obtaining pig waste to manufacture bio fertilizer and energy, Perumal said.
Speaking about the process of obtaining energy and turning chicken waste into fertilizer, he explained that the ammonia found in the droppings/ waste, was injurious to the soil, and that ammonia content would be separated; add sulfuric acid and turn that into ammonium - salphate.
Statistics show Sri Lanka imports around 65,000 tons of ammonia and Perumal was of the view that the bio-fertilizer plant once installed, would be in a position to produce around 50 percent of the countrys requirement enabling the treasury to save a considerable amount of foreign exchange. As we will purchase specially manufactured trucks from China on a German design, to ensure that there would be no spillage or obnoxious odor, we assure the public, they need not entertain fear of bad odor when transporting of poultry waste from the farms to the plant.

Enjoining Order against National Film Corporation further extended
The Colombo District Court yesterday further extended its Enjoining Order preventing the National Film Corporation from carrying out the distribution of films in the country until July 25.
Colombo District Court Judge R. B. C. Ratnayake made this order pursuant to a lawsuit filed by four companies; E. A. P. Films and Theatres Ltd, Movie Producers and Importers Ltd, Lanka Films Distributors Company Ltd and Cinema Entertainment (pvt) Ltd.
The government had announced that a decision had been taken to handle the distribution of films only through the National Film Corporation and the private sector cannot handle any distribution of films.
The plaintiffs stated that the exercise of a stringent policy towards the private sector by the National Film Corporation reduced the margin of the private sector and reduced the revenue of the distribution companies.
They further stated that the monopoly over the local cinema industry by the National Film Corporation has not proved effective both in formulating policies to meet the new developments and in the management of the distribution of local films and other related activities.

FMM protests move to appoint board for Sri Lanka Press Council
The Free Media Movement (FMM) yesterday expressed regret over the governments decision to appoint a Board of Directors to the Sri Lanka Press Council. The FMM said that this decision is against one of the election promises of the present government.
Following is the text of the statement from the FMM:
Without considering the continuous appeal made by many media organisations in Sri Lanka, including the Free Media Movement (FMM), to abolish the Sri Lanka Press Council, President Maithripala Sirisena has decided to appoint a Board of Directors to activate the Sri Lanka Press Council Act and the FMM thoroughly condemns this action.
The FMM believes this decision as acting against one of the election promises of the present President by which he confirmed media freedom. One of the main agreements to which the FMM and many civil society organisations arrived at with the present President during the election was the abolishment of the Sri Lanka Press Council.
Besides this, the Free Media Movement handed over a set of proposals including the abolishing of the Sri Lanka Press Council to the President. The steps taken by the President can be seen as breaking an agreement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on his part.
As in the past, we promise we would continuously make society aware and activate a media voice about the inappropriateness, inapplicability and backwardness of the Sri Lanka Press Council and struggle against it until it is abolished.
Therefore, as this incident indicates the necessity of a broad media reform with media responsibility and media freedom, we request the media community in Sri Lanka and all those who love democracy to aggregate and fight against the establishment of the Press Council Act.

Ganesan says he is disappointed
National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said he was disappointed with the government for not providing houses to the Eastern and Northern Province people. He said the Indian Government and the Army built the houses, not the government.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry.
Minister Ganesan said the government promised to provide 300,000 houses for northern and eastern people but they did not provide even a single house for them.
The Indian Government built nearly 45,000 houses and the army also built houses. But the government did nothing, he said.
He blamed Minister Swaminathan for not taking any initiative to build houses and said the housing projects are stuck at the offices of the President and Prime Minister. Minister Ganesan said he would soon reveal all details about them to the media.
He said people in North and East are blaming Minister Swaminathan.
He said parliamentarians should know Sinhala and Tamil and these languages should be made mandatory for MPs.
He said MPs were provided classes to learn Sinhala and Tamil but no one attended.

Govt. must explain fuel price rise - MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a statement yesterday, said that the government should explain to the public why the retail price of fuel is disproportionately high today. He said that the latest price increase is being justified in terms of a pricing formula which nobody has seen.
Following is an excerpt from the statement:
Fuel prices have been increased yet again within a period of about eight weeks  a situation we have never experienced earlier. Now the price of petrol is Rs.145 and diesel Rs.118, while todays price of crude oil in the world market is around US$ 74 per barrel.
In 2008, when Sri Lanka was buying crude oil at the much higher rate of US$ 97 a barrel, petrol was sold at Rs.120 and diesel at Rs.70. During the nine years in which we ruled the country, world crude oil prices were always high. According to the Central Bank reports, when I first assumed office as President back in November 2005, crude oil was imported to Sri Lanka at around US$ 73 per barrel. Thereafter, the price of crude oil increased steadily and during the last four years of my government, in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the average price of crude oil imports was over US$ 109 per barrel. Hence, the present crude oil price of US$ 78 is very low compared to the prices that prevailed when we were in power.
The government should explain to the public why the retail price of fuel is disproportionately high today. The latest price increase is being justified in terms of a price formula which nobody has seen. It is quite clear that this government is aiming to collect more tax revenue from fuel by increasing and reducing fuel prices frequently, so that at the end of the year, more revenue would have been collected from consumers. This kind of price manipulation is a standard practice in the large-scale retail industry.
The public should also take note of the devious manner in which the government implemented the fuel price increase. The Indian Oil Company was first allowed to increase their prices while the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation held back. After a few days, when the people had reconciled themselves to a fuel price increase, the government increased the prices at the CPC stations as well. They sought to diffuse public outrage by such means.
Such practices are all part of a government strategy to fleece the public through the manipulation of fuel prices.

Horizon Campus pioneers genetic education in SL
With the growing role of genomics in healthcare, for patient diagnoses, treatment and disease prevention and as genetic-based technology develops, many opportunities have arisen in the food and beverage industry, health, biotechnology and research, bio-pharma and agri-industries
Positioning to be the leader in science education in the country: To investigate and delve further into the exploration of this cutting-edge field, and with their focus on offering the best science education in the country, Horizon Campus has currently made huge investments in new, spacious and modern teaching laboratories which provide excellent facilities for practicals and small group project work, alongside state-of-the-art computing facilities.
Genetics is slated to be the next trillion dollar industry. A spokesperson at Horizon Campus stated Genetics has undergone a rapid expansion that will have a decisive effect on health and society. Its range of applications is constantly widening and the biotechnology industry based on genetics shows great promise. In the future, doctors and scientists will use our genetic information to diagnose, treat, prevent and cure many illnesses. Commercialization of genomics is also going to change the lives of the vast majority of people. Today, health care is delivered with a very small degree of customization but that is going to change as genetic screening becomes less expensive and we better understand what to look for. The last trillion-dollar industry was built on computer code. The next will be built on genetic code.
With massive innovation in DNA sequencing technologies revolutionizing our knowledge and understanding of living systems, makes it a particularly exciting time to be studying this subject.
It is also important to prepare health professionals trained in genetics with skills and knowledge to manage the impact genetic and genomic technologies will have in future and to ensure that Sri Lanka is not left lagging behind in this arena.
Nilai as the selected partner university, plays a vital role in offering their expertise through a practically oriented curriculum with extensive insights into the subject that has a high industry acceptance internationally. This in turn enables students to gain an added edge to their portfolio of experiences and expand their global perspectives on the subject. Registrations for the Diploma and Bachelors of Sciences (Hons) in Biotechnology are now open

India becomes worlds sixth biggest economy, pushes France to 7 th place - WB
Indias economy rebounded strongly from July 2017, after several quarters of slowdown blamed on economic policies pursued by Prime Minister Narendra Modis government.
India, with around 1.34 billion inhabitants, is poised to become the worlds most populous nation, whereas the French population stands at 67 million.
This means that Indias per capita GDP continues to amount to just a fraction of that of France which is still roughly 20 times higher, according to World Bank figures.
Manufacturing and consumer spending were the main drivers of the Indian economy last year, after a slowdown blamed on the demonetisation of large bank notes that Modi imposed at the end of 2016, as well as a chaotic implementation of a new harmonized VAT regime.
India has doubled its GDP within a decade and is expected to power ahead as a key economic engine in Asia, even as China slows down.
According to the International Monetary Fund, India is projected to generate growth of 7.4 percent this year and 7.8 percent in 2019, boosted by household spending and a tax reform.
This compares to the worlds expected average growth of 3.9 percent.
The London-based Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, said at the end of last year that India would overtake both Britain and France this year in terms of GDP, and had a good chance to become the worlds third-biggest economy by 2032. At the end of 2017, Britain was still the worlds fifth-biggest economy with a GDP of $2.622 trillion.
The US is the worlds top economy, followed by China, Japan, Germany and Britain.

Indonesia to take majority stake  in massive gold, copper mine
Indonesia will take a majority stake in one of the worlds biggest gold and copper mines, the government said Thursday (Jul 12), as it moves to claw back control of its natural resources.
State-owned mining firm Inalum is to assume a 51 per cent interest in the Grasberg mine under an agreement to be signed later in the day, President Joko Widodo said.
Indonesia currently holds just under 10 per cent of the mine, which is owned and operated by a unit of US-based Freeport-McMoRan.
Freeport is expected to continue operating the vast complex in the jungles of Papua province - and keep the remaining ownership stake.
Widodo did not reveal financial details of the agreement, which he said came after very difficult, intense negotiations.
This is a leap forward, he told reporters. Its a done deal, we just need to sign it.
The deal means more tax and royalties revenue for the government, he added.
Ministers were set to hold a news conference about the deal later in the day.
The announcement comes after more than a year of see-saw negotiations over the future of Freeports operations in the Southeast Asian nation.
The company and Indonesias government have sparred over the ownership of Grasberg and its social and environmental impact, including how the firm manages mine waste known as tailings.
The mine is a frequent flashpoint in Papuas struggle for independence from Indonesia and has fuelled resentment over how much locals benefit from the regions rich resources.
Papua, on the western half of New Guinea island, has been the scene of a simmering independence insurgency since it was annexed by Jakarta in the late 1960s.
Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto has a joint venture agreement with Freeport for about 40 per cent of Grasbergs production.
Rio Tinto has previously said it would be willing to sell its interest in the complex, with earlier reports pegging a potential deal at around US$3.5 billion.
Foreign firms have been ordered to comply with new mining ownership rules launched by Widodo - who is seeking re-election next year - aimed at exercising more domestic control of Indonesias resources.
Despite sitting atop some of the worlds most abundant natural resources, successive governments have failed to take advantage of its vast riches, with critics blaming badly thought-out and nationalistic policies that make the country an uncertain place to invest.
A series of regulatory changes from the government in recent years have caused jitters among miners, with some foreign firms choosing to exit Indonesia rather than deal with such an unpredictable environment.

A mass grave with 38 skeletons has been discovered in Sri Lanka's former war zone where the government forces and Tamil Tiger rebels were engaged in pitched battles in 2009, officials said today.
Skeletal remains of around 38 people have been found during the ground digging to build a new construction at the old cooperative store site in the northeastern town of Mannar.
Following the discovery in late March, the site was kept under supervision of Mannar magistrate M Prabhakaran for further digging.
While the judicial medical officers are carrying out investigations, the skeletal remains are being kept at the Mannar hospital.
The construction site has been cordoned off, the police said.
The town was occupied by the LTTE during Sri Lanka's civil war between 1983 and 2009.

Mobile Money Offers Africans a Financial Future - IFC
Voahirana Mamy Ravelonoro was working at her small restaurant when a buzz on her phone caught her attention. It was a text message from microfinance bank Baobab Madagascar telling her that she had qualified for an instant, digital loan. I just went to a Baobab agent, showed them the message and my national identification card, put my finger on the biometric machine, and withdrew the money.
The extra few hundred dollars came in handy for the Christmas season as Ravelonoro used the cash to buy flour, sugar, and eggs for the restaurant she had recently opened in Madagascars capital of Antananarivo. With more stock, she could meet the increased demand over the holiday seasonand make a bigger profit.
For years, traditional banks shied away from serving many Africans because of the costs of physical branch expansion and the risks associated with serving low-income people. Small entrepreneurs like Ravelonoro found it particularly hard to access credit as they often lack the required collateral or credit history. But the launch and growth of digital financial services across the continent is changing that situation.
Weve understood that digitalization is the right solution for clients, says Jean Analdo Armand, chief executive officer of Baobab Madagascar. The companys goal is to be completely digital in the near future, and provide credit to even more entrepreneurs and under-banked people.
Since the breakthrough of the first mobile money services in Africa about a decade ago, new technologies and innovative business models such as agent banking (rather than branch-centered banking) have led to the creation of a mass market for affordable, accessible, and sustainable financial services for low-income people, small-scale entrepreneurs, and people in rural areas. This shift has helped lift the financial inclusion rate on the continent from 24 percent in 2011 to 43 percent in 2017.
Pioneers of mobile money and agent banking, like Baobab, have been strengthened by a joint initiative of IFC and the Mastercard Foundation. The Partnership for Financial Inclusion, launched by the two institutions in 2012, had delivered 7.2 million new digital financial services users, 45,000 new banking agents, and $300 million in monthly transactions as of December 2017.
Research by the Partnership for Financial Inclusion has demonstrated that it is 25 percent less costly to expand banking services through an agent network than through traditional bank brancheswhich should provide incentive for more institutions to follow suit. There is also growing evidence that financial inclusion is a catalyst for equitable development and inclusive economic growth. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study from 2016 showed that the use of mobile payments service M-PESA in Kenya helped lift 2 percent of Kenyan households out of extreme poverty, and that it was particularly helpful to households headed by women.
A Market for Affordable and Accessible Financial Services
The use of mobile money services generate data that can then be used to automatically assess the creditworthiness of the user, which opens up opportunities for lenders to give credit to people who otherwise lack collateral or a credit history. Greater geographical reach, lower cost, and speed also contribute to the expansion of these services. Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where more than 10 percent of adults use mobile money. In Kenya and Uganda, over half of the adult population uses digital financial services.
One of the latest projects of the Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a pilot to test the possibility of introducing digital merchant payments in Cote dIvoire, in partnership with mobile network operator and mobile money service provider MTN. Its promoters canvass restaurants, hardware stores, and gas stations to demonstrate how to use the simple point-of-sale device and accessories that accept and make digital payments. Should the model prove viable, the ability to pay for goods and services with mobile money may transform even street trade in Africa in the future.
Cte dIvoire is well-positioned for this innovation because the countrys mobile penetration rate already exceeds 100 percent (a situation that occurs when people own more than one phone). The nation is also one of the largest mobile money markets in West Africa, with over 12 million registered clients.
The efficiency of mobile money isnt its only draw. MTNs service MoMo Pay delivers a solution to a problem unique to Cte dIvoire: there is not enough small change in circulation. The situation is so extreme that a secondary market has sprung up in the wake of the shortage: Businesses and individuals sell change to stores that need it, often at a premium of up to 8 percent.
New Opportunities for Micro-entrepreneurs
Besides expanding access to financial services, the growing mobile money industry offers a new career path and additional income opportunities for many small-scale entrepreneurs as mobile banking agents. Agents are local retailers who double as lower-cost alternatives to bank branches, and provide the necessary points for cash-in and cash-out that connects the digital ecosystem with the still-dominant cash economy.
At these establishments, customers can make withdrawals, deposit money, transfer funds, and make payments. For the service, agents receive a fee from customers or commission from the service providers. Some small-scale traders increase their original business revenue by offering additional banking services, while others have become specialized aggregate super-agents with their own agents and employees. In 2016, there were about 1.5 million digital financial services agents in sub-Saharan Africa, working for 140 services in 39 countries and sharing over $400 million in commission income.
One of these agents is Constance Sampa, who in 2012 applied to be an agent for Zoona, a Partnership client institution in Zambia that provides mobile payment services. The 27-year-old bought a booth in Chingola, where she had worked, that became her first outlet. Six years later, she owns 37 outlets and employs close to 50 people, almost all of them women. Her new career has enabled her to go to school and buy a home. It has helped me so much in my life, she says.
Zoona is the market leading mobile payments provider in Zambia, and its success is due to its ability to understand the needs of the new customers that have been brought into the financial system via mobile money, according to co-founder and chief customer officer Brett Magrath. For providers, it may seem like a small thing to get a person to trust you with ten dollars, but for that individual it is a huge amount of money, he says. The key to success is to offer digital financial services in an empathetic way and to understand the development needs of the community to drive adoption.

Nestl launches Towards an Iron-Clad Nation
Nestl has launched an island-wide campaign, Towards an Iron-Clad Nation, to create awareness amongst families about the importance of iron in the diet. It will support the governments strategy for preventing and controlling micronutrient deficiencies in Sri Lanka.
The campaign will educate people about how to receive enough iron on a daily basis from food; highlighting iron-rich food and iron-fortified food, and also food and drink that can help your body absorb iron more easily. The campaign will be supported by educational videos, articles and quizzes, and also quick and easy recipes for cooking iron-enriched meals, hosted on Nestl Lankas website and social media channels.
A 24/7 dedicated hotline and a chatbot Nestl Lankas corporate Facebook page, will enable people who call or inbox the page to have real-time conversations and ask questions about iron in their diet.
The campaign also includes on-ground educational activities in towns and villages where iron-deficiency is high, via Nutri-Corners. These Nutri-Corners will provide information on iron and one-on-one nutritional counselling on-site.

Financial misappropriations:
New Corruption Court will expedite cases: Navin
UNP National Organiser and Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday that court cases with regard to financial misappropriations would be expedited once the New Corruption Court convened next week.
Addressing a media briefing held at the United National Party (UNP) Headquarters, Sirikotha, yesterday, the minister said the present government was accused of not apprehending culprits responsible for financial frauds and corruption, and that the said action would be an answer to those allegations.
We always abide by the law and we did not want to overstep the rule of law. That is why there was a delay in the process, Minister Dissanayake said.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who had obtained several interim injections on most of his cases, had requested that his cases should be taken up firstly by the Special Courts, he said, adding that it was a hypocritical statement. The current government does not wish to interfere with the medias freedom and the independence of the judiciary. We will not allow the white van culture to rise again, even if we were to be defeated at the next Presidential election, he added.

New lease of life for Mattala
An Indian company has agreed to an estimate put forward by the government for the lease of the Mattala International Airport (MIA), Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Ashok Abeysinghe said.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the Indian investor was selected after calling worldwide tenders and it was the only party that agreed to go ahead with the Lankan governments proposals. Accordingly, the Indian company and the Sri Lanka Civil Aviation Authority will jointly operate the MIA and the two parties will further discuss on a proper operational plan. However, Abeysinghe said, the partnership will be for 40 years.
The minister said negotiations are being carried out and once the plans were finalized it would be submit for Cabinet approval and then for the approval by parliament.
The MIA was opened in 2013 with an investment of US$ 252 million which was made out of a US$ 190 million loan from the China Exim Bank and China Harbour Engineering Company spending approximately US$ 40 million and the Lankan government spending US$ 22 million for the project.
The minister said at present, MIAs monthly average income stands at only Rs. 6.5 million against an average monthly expenditure of Rs. 290 million. Similarly, the airport has to pay debt servicing of Rs 1.7 billion per annum for 15 years to pay off the loan. Already the government has paid three installments for the period of 2015 to 2018 using funds generated from the Katunayake International Airport. Abeysinghe said the Chief Valuer has estimated the current value of MIA as US$ 320 million and the joint venture with the Indian party would be a win-win situation for both parties because the profits as well as the losses will be borne by the parties at a ratio of 70 to 30.

No project approved within Dumbara (Knuckles) Range
So far no approval for any project within the Dumbara (Knuckles) Mountain Range Forest Reserve has been granted, Central Environment Authority (CEA) Chairman Chandraratne Pallegama said yesterday.
However, he said that during a discussion on this matter it was discussed that the need has arisen to demarcate the Knuckles environment conservation area.
He added that the area above 3,500 feet as well as the 500 m Buffer Zone comprise this area,as suggested by the UNESCO.
Pallegama added that although the CEA has gazetted an area as thr Knuckles Environmental Conservation Area on July 3, 2017 under Environment Act, still there are issues.
He also added that no plot of land within this area has been leased for any project.
The CEA Chairman made these observations to the media yesterday following a discussion held among related officials on the Dumbara mountain range (Knuckles range) issue at the Central Environment Authority Auditorium in Battaramulla.
He said that Environment and Mahaveli Development Authority, Land and Parliamentary Reforms Ministry, Plantation Industries Ministry, Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Ministry, Forest Conservation Department, Land Reform Commission, State Plantation Corporation Chairman Thilak Mahanama District Secretaries, Divisional Secretaries also participated at the conference.
State Plantation Corporation Chairman Thilak Mahanama assured that Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella under whom the State Plantation Corporation comes has instructed not to implement a single project within the Knuckles Forest Conservation area.
He also instructed to cancel even a temporary agreement if such has been entered into for such a project. Hence, we cancelled an agreement to grant an area of 25 acres of Midland Estate for eco-tourism, Mahanama said.
There are 46 project to which Cabinet approval had been granted and we would direct them before another Committee to identify if they are to be implemented within the Knuckles Mountain Forest Reserve area before they are implemented. Their suitability would also be evaluated with the assistance of the Central Environment Authority, Forest Conservation Department, the Minister and the representatives of the environment associations. Central Environment Authority Assistant Director (Research and Development) Dr.Ajith R.Gunawardena said that some sections of Midland Estate, Kotagala Estate, Gillardsyown Estate, Hare Park Estate, Hunnasgiriya Estate, Kotagala Estate and Rangala Estate are located within the Knuckles Mountain Forest Conservation Area.

Opposition elements trying  to rouse communalism - Navin
UNP National Organiser and Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday that certain elements in the Opposition are trying to arouse communalism and separatism in a big way.
Addressing a media briefing at the UNP Headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday, the Minister said they (Opposition) are spreading false information that the government was trying to divide the country through a new Constitution, removing Army camps from the North and allowing the LTTE to have commemorations in the North.
These elements who represent the views and concerns of the Rajapaksa family also urge for a new leader for the country, the Minister said.
We vehemently reject all these allegations. We have not allowed to remove a single Army camp in the North. However, some LTTE supporters have suddenly held two or three LTTE commemorations without any prior announcements.
There is no state involvement and sponsorship for these commemorations. We stopped these activities as soon as we got the information. Since many UNP leaders including my father the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was killed by the LTTE, we will never allow LTTE to rise again so long as we are in the power, he added.
The Minister said the Parliamentary seat of former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran should be nullified for her pro-LTTE statement.
A party-level inquiry will be held by the three Member Committee appointed to probe into the controversial statement made by the former State Minister and disciplinary action will be taken against her accordingly. She may as well lose her MP position after the inquiry, he said.

PM says new Education Standard Act to be introduced shortly
The New Education Standard Act comprising all the changes that should be made to enhance the quality of the countrys education will be introduced in the near future, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister was speaking at the Subhaga Scholarship Awards Ceremony at Temple Trees yesterday.
Premier Wickremesinghe said during the past three years, the government had implemented several programmes for the improvement of facilities in schools. But, the qualitative development of education in Sri Lanka is not up to the mark.
Paying our attention towards quality education is an important factor. We have to provide scope and ensure quality education.
I have already instructed Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to take necessary measures to develop national standards for education, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister further said that the quality of education will improve the learning process. But, improving the quality of education is not an overnight development.
Qualified and trained teachers, better infrastructural facilities, up-to-date curriculum and regular assessments of the students are the main tools of ensuring quality education, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier further stressed the importance of giving legal power to education inspectors.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that education inspectors in England is considered as a very important profession and they care called Her Majestys Inspectors of Education. They are responsible for the inspection of public and independent, primary and secondary schools, higher education colleges, community learning, Local Authority Education Departments and teacher education.
The contribution of teachers is significant in ensuring the quality of the countrys education system. Therefore,it is essential to engage trained teachers in all schools to strengthen the teaching and learning process, the Prime Minister said.
The government has focused special attention towards all teacher requirements such as teacher recruitment to schools, training, national policy on teacher transfers, grading and promotions of teachers, teacher salaries and welfare services, the Prime Minister said.
Measures would be taken to make teacher training compulsory within the next four to five years. So the teachers who have not yet undergone training should complete their training by then, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said the present government would be able ensure a better education system by 2024-25. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that developing human resources is the best way to develop the country.
The Subhaga Scholarship Programme was implemented following a concept of former Education Director Sirisena with the intention of bringing about an innovative generation of youth complete with potential needed to meet the future challenges, the Minister said.
The Ministry of Education as per the 2017 Budget Proposals has taken measures to launch a Scholarship Scheme for talented students who have excelled in sports, arts and new inventions, he said.
As the initial step of the said programme commencing from 2017, 1000 scholarships were awarded to innovative and talented students on the occasion.
Each scholarship includes Rs.50,000 per month for a period of 20 months.
State Education Minister V. Radhakrishnan, Monitoring MP Imran Maharoof, Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarachchi, Provincial Education Officials, Principals, Teachers and scholarship beneficiaries participated to the event.

He had served as the Bar Association Secretary as well as the Legal Aid Commission Chairman for 10 years. He was thereafter appointed the Bar Associations Deputy President.
Appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2016, Warnakulasuriya had a short stint at the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission as well.
He had also served as Sri Lankas Ambassador to Italy during the same year he was appointed the Presidents Counsel.
His funeral will be held at the Borella Cemetery on Saturday (14) at 5.30 pm. His body now lies at his residence: No. 47, Norris Canal Road, Colombo 10.

Presidents decision justified
The decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to enforce the death penalty which has been in abeyance for over four decades in this country is bound to draw mixed reactions from both here and abroad. Amnesty International, as usual, is the first to jump the bandwagon in condemning the planned move. The Mahanayakes were yet to respond, at the time this is being written. However, support for the move has come from the most unlikely quarter. Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Dr. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith saw no issue in reintroducing the hangman if criminals continued with their criminal acts while in prison. Speaking to a Sinhala Daily, His Eminence said, a life once taken cannot be given back. However, if those convicted for crime and drug trafficking yet continue these acts while serving their prison terms, a decent society cannot be created.
Participating in the inaugural ceremony of Mathata Erehiwa Pasalen Javayak (thrust against drugs from the schools) programme at the Getambe playground on Wednesday, the President said he will use his powers to place his signature to execute the death sentence on those sentenced to death for drug offenses. According to the President, the death sentence will be enforced against convicts already serving life terms, who continue to engage in the drugs business while in prison. Although there are conflicting views about the death sentence in our society, Buddhist society in particular, if a society which listened to and preached an overdose of religious discourse is heading in the wrong direction, timely decisions should be taken to bring this menace under control, the President asserted.
This is not the first occasion that the hangman was to be resurrected from his enforced demise in this country. Arguments for and against the enforcement of Capital punishment had been a perennial topic down the years, since the suspension of the death penalty four decades ago. Whenever some gruesome crime takes place there is naturally a public outcry for bringing back the hangman. This was seen in the aftermath of the rape and murder of eight-year-old Seya in Kotadeniyawa, two years ago.
There was the cryptic photo caption in a newspaper of former Interior Minister John Amaratunga inspecting the hangmans noose at Welikada after the UNP government of 2001- 2004 made noises in favour of implementing the death penalty. This was after the gory massacre on the day of the 2001 December, General Elections, in Udathalawinna, of over half dozen Muslim youth who were supporters of SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem, who was backing the Greens at that poll. But the move was shelved for some reason or other, perhaps due to objections of the Buddhist clergy.
The last man who went to the gallows in this country was J.D. Siripala, alias Maru Sira. Before him Alfred Soysa, of Kalattewa fame, faced the hangmans noose. Jayalal Anandagoda, the main accused in the famous Wilpattu murder case, was also hanged in Bogambara. There was no public outrage when Ven. Talduwe Somarama Thera was executed for the assassination of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.
The Presidents decision to resume executions, we are certain, was not a precipitate one, but taken as a last resort, given the rapid escalation of drugs related killings. The public are given accounts in the newspapers of almost daily detections of large quantities of narcotics from some part of the country, or, while being smuggled into the country through the BIA. Three politicians were killed in the space of three months, their deaths linked to the drugs underworld. Today over 90 percent of the killings can be traced to disputes in sharing the spoils of drug money. The situation has reached such alarming proportions that moves are afoot to amend the laws to draft in the security forces to fight the drug underworld in this country. Hence, the President is fully justified in taking the step he has taken to introduce a strong deterrent to put an end to this mindless bloodletting and prevent the descent of the country into a state of anarchy.
Hemantha will be missed
The sudden demise of eminent Presidents Counsel and former diplomat Hemantha Warnakulasuriya would have come as a shock to those who knew him intimately. Hemanthas interests transcended the law and covered many topics such as politics, the arts and even cricket, just to name a few. He was also a maverick of sorts, and courted controversy by his utterings and his newspaper articles in which he was not shy of calling a spade a spade even if it meant offending those whose political patronage he enjoyed at some time or other. He was a live wire at Hulftsdorp and the go to man for junior lawyers at times of crisis. The legal fraternity has lost a dear colleague and a colourful figure in an otherwise drab profession.

Prison call calls tops 4000 in March
On average in an identified prison cell in Colombo during the month of March alone, 3,950 calls have been made from within the prison to locations even overseas while around 360 calls had come in, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police - Crimes, Organized Crime, Narcotics Range and Commandant - Special Task Force Sri Lanka M.R. Latiff said.
He said one of the main legal challenges faced by Sri Lanka in combating organised crimes is the lack of exclusive statutes. Addressing a seminar organised by the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies on Transitional Organised Crimes in Sri Lanka  Dark Side Of the Hub yesterday, he added that the lack of coordination between the law enforcement, prisons, rehabilitation and courts, is a major obstacle in combating crime.
He noted that simply sending a drug offender to prison is counterproductive and instead what we need is to have them rehabilitated. In a prison system that is designed to accommodate 8,000 prisoners, it accommodates around 600,000 prisoners which not only leads to the overcrowding of prisons but also leads to a whole plethora of administrative challenges. Referring to a study done by Dr. Nimali Wijegoonewardene earlier this month, he said nearly one third (31.1%) of prison officers were found to be suffering from a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress, known in medical parlance as burnout.
In in many countries, there are specific crime prevention laws that enable prisons to serve as correctional facilities, but, in Sri Lanka we follow a prison system where a drug addict who is sent to prison for a minor drug offence, eventually leaves prison with a PhD in narcotics having made alliances with other hardcore drug operators within prison, who would have recruited him into their wider network by the time he is released.
He said that in order to overcome these challenges, Sri Lanka needs an intelligence lead policing.
He went on to say that one of the social issues that hampers investigations is exclusive media coverage including social media, creating a public outcry or fear psychosis, CCTV footage of crimes being released hampering criminal investigations and even creating diverse opinions, lack of public cooperation, social - economic issues, morals and value based society.
Outlining the administrative challenges in combating organised crimes he said the lack of coordination and cooperation among the multi-stakeholders of the criminal justice system is also a major shortcoming.
DIG Latiff also said that Police officers carry weapons and in certain instances when they are forced to use a weapon against a criminal, that officer has to face issues during the inquest and legal proceedings. Even in a court the law enforcement officer is made to justify a killing done during a confrontation.
He also noted that restrictions in cash flows also hampers their operations in large scale drug operations and this is one main reason that only smaller quantities of drugs are being caught. However, he said that these obstacles are being addressed currently.
The lack of police officers in handling law enforcement effectively is a major obstacle, said DIG Latiff adding that in Sri Lanka the ratio of police officers and civilians is around one police officer per 246 civilians.
However, he noted that despite the lack of police personnel, the rate of crime, in comparison to the pre-conflict era has reduced in the post conflict period with police relationship with the public having improved significantly. However, he said in order to effectively combat transitional organised crime, it is mandatory for Sri Lanka to introduce and enact stricter laws that are specifically designed to curb organised crimes and drug trafficking.

Reforms likely to weigh  on growth: Fitch
Asias frontier markets are pushing ahead with banking sector reforms that should ultimately improve weak regulatory frameworks and strengthen banks buffers against shocks.
However, capital shortages, asset-quality problems and regulatory efforts to address these weaknesses are likely to constrain the growth of even stronger banks over the next two years, says Fitch Ratings.
Mongolia has completed an asset-quality review, followed by a stress test, as of part its IMF arrangement, which should raise the comparability of banks financial profiles after adjustments are formally booked into their end-June 2018 statements. New laws could further strengthen the authority of the regulator if consistently enforced. Moreover, the operating environment has become more supportive as economic growth has accelerated and government refinancing risks have declined.
Fitch upgraded its two rated Mongolian banks - Khan Bank and XacBank - in July 2018 to reflect these improvements. The transparency of the recapitalisation process and NPL resolution will test the credibility of the reform process. Banking system asset quality remains weak, with a high reported NPL ratio of 8.2% at end-May 2018.
Many NPL accounts have remained unresolved for some time. The government may inject capital into systemically important banks if they are unable to raise sufficient capital by end-2018. Fitch does not believe shortfall amounts would pose a significant funding challenge to the Mongolian sovereign if public funds are required. Vietnam has scheduled Basel II implementation for 1 January 2020, which will further pressure local banks already-thin capital buffers that were diminished by rapid lending growth.
We estimate Basel II will reduce banks capital-adequacy ratios by up to 4pp, with some state-owned banks likely to fall short of minimum requirements. These challenges are balanced by upbeat economic conditions, which are supporting the efforts of some banks to reduce or write off bad debt. Under-reporting of asset quality issues remains widespread, reflecting how regulatory development has trailed economic progress.
Nevertheless, the fall in major banks weighted-average problem loan ratio to 6.0% in 2017, from 9.2% in 2014, indicates some progress. Sri Lanka has moved faster than the other two markets in adopting international regulatory standards; it began implementing Basel III in 2017, and is scheduled to introduce IFRS9 in 2018. Fitch estimates some large banks will, in total, require an additional USD120 million of capital to meet full compliance by 2019.
The shift to SLFRS 9 could add to capitalisation pressure. Moreover, the countrys banks are likely to face a more challenging operating environment than those in Mongolia and Vietnam, which could place modest pressure on ratings unless sufficient loss absorption buffers are maintained.

Signing death  penalty warrant  is futile: BASL
It is not the solution to this, BASL President U.R. de Silva said reacting to President Sirisenas plans to execute 19 death-row prisoners convicted of drug trafficking.
De Silva explained his position to the Daily News, saying that first the President should discuss his decision to implement the death penalty with relevant departments: the Attorney Generals Department, the Prison Department, the Justice Ministry and the Bar Association. That does not mean the President cannot make the decision, he clarified, but it should be a well-considered thing.
After President Sirisena received information that prisoners on death row were engaged in illegal drug trafficking within the prison, the President informed his Cabinet that he would implement the death penalty to traffickers. If you are going to do that type of thing, there will be problems for our country.
De Silvas concerns were two-fold: with a seeming lack of process in making this decision, and with the effectiveness of such a decision. It is the duty, he said, of the Police Department to find out what happened.
De Silva made the case that authorities of the Police Department should be summoned and questioned, How did this happen He pointed out that these prisoners would have been confined to separate cells, prohibited from using mobile phones, that they would have had limited outdoor access, and even their meals would have been prescribed. How did they perform this act This is the relevant factor.
De Silva advocated for a series of stricter measures to curb drug-trafficking activities: preventing mobile phones from reaching prisons, tougher scanning on items entering prisons, better surveillance on goods entering Sri Lanka by air and by sea.
If we are not going to implement those measures and to sign the death warrantit is not the solution to this issue.
The other important factor is what we have agreed upon with other countries. De silva was referring to Sri Lankas international commitments, as a country that repeatedly and recently voted in favour of a moratorium on implementing the death penalty at the UN General Assembly.
U.R. de Silvas statements come after the Amnesty International made multiple statements yesterday, entreating upon the government of Sri Lanka to halt any plans to execute the prisoners, saying, Sri Lanka will do immense damage to its reputation. If the Presidents wishes are fulfilled, these will be the first legal executions in Sri Lanka in more than 40 years.

SriLankan Company Secretary to give more information on Regional Manager
Company Secretary of SriLankan Airlines Dalarene Thirukumar, giving evidence before the Presidential Commission on July 9, said she would inform the commissioner as to whether the SriLankan Airlines Regional Manager, who allegedly sexually abused an Indian woman in North India in 2014 and the officer who held various high posts in the Airline as revealed before the Commission, was one and the same person after perusing the relevant documents.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC in his submissions said the former secretary to the Treasury Dr. P. B. Jayasundara had appointed two new directors to SriLankan Airlines by letter dated March 18, 2008 but the Company Secretary's file had certified the appointment letters with the March 17 date stamp. Submitting the relevant documents in court he asked Thirukumar how this had happened.
Thirukumar replied that she could not comment on the matter as she was not holding the post of Company Secretary at that time.
Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC informed the commission that Treasury Secretary Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, through his relevant letters, had appointed Nishantha Wickramasinghe as Executive Director and Lalith de Silva as consultant but the appointment letters had entered the Company Secretary's file a day prior to the date of appointment mentioned in Dr. Jayasundera's letter.
He requested the commission to take this matter into consideration.

The STF has been deployed to combat the rising wave of crime in the Matara District, Matara SSP G. H. Marapana said.
Although there is a decrease in crime in the district, the severity of the limited crimes committed had led some people to think that the crime rate has increased. He said the untoward incident at Matara had led them to reconsider security lapses and deploy the STF to prevent threats posed to the Matara city by outside elements and protect life and property. SSP Marapana said the narcotic drugs menace had been curtailed and the price of drugs had escalated due to a decrease in supply.
The recent robbery at Matara caused due to lack in security had led them to rethink the security arrangements.

Transnational Organised Crime affecting stability of countries - Defence Secretary
Profits from Transnational Organised Crime (TOC) networks amount to 1.5% of the global GDP or 7% of the worlds exports of merchandise. Dire consequences of TOC are experienced by countries, while peace and stability of countries is affected by this, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne PC said.
It is estimated by the World Bank that around US$ 1 trillion is spent each year to bribe public officials causing economic distortion and damage to legitimate economic activity, Waidyaratne
making the keynote address at the seminar on Transitional Organised Crime in Sri Lanka organised by the BCIS yesterday.
He said the vast sums being bought can compromise the legitimate economies and have a direct impact on governance, such as corruption and even manipulation of elections.
The irony of TOC is that the major illicit trade routes emanate from major economies, meaning the worlds biggest trading partners which are also the worlds biggest markets for illicit goods and services.This not only reflects the correlation between TOC and global trade, but also the lack of regulatory and legal mechanisms to address the issue adequately.
This illegal trade is also facilitated through established and legal institutions such as banking financial centres, shipping lines and other related trade and communication networks.
He noted that the flexibility, adjustability and adaptability allows for the exploitation of the weak society segments to meet the selfish aims of the organised crimes syndicates. While the illicit trade grows, emanating from the developed countries, its effects are mostly penetrated to the developing and conflict ridden countries, due to its weak rule of law and state institutions.
Ties between the TOC cartels, government institutions and the high end business represent a significant threat to economic growth and democratic institutions. Weak governance mechanisms pave the way for the corrupt bureaucrats who facilitate TOC.
The Defence Secretary pointed out that alliances with political leaders, financial institutions, law enforcement, foreign intelligence and security agencies undermine free markets and economic stability.
Penetration of the TOC into governments aggravates corruption undermining the rule of law, judicial independence, free media, democratic institutions, transparency and accountability.
He said in order to combat TOCs it requires partnership at all levels such as governments, businesses, civil society, international organisation and people in all corners of the world have to play a part.

Trump: Brexit plan 'will probably kill' US trade deal

Donald Trump has said the UK will "probably not" get a trade deal with the US, if the Prime Minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.
He told The Sunthe PM's plan would "probably kill the deal" as it would mean the US "would be dealing with the European Union" instead of with the UK.
Downing Street has not yet reacted to Trump's remarks.
Theresa May has been making the case for a US free trade deal with Trump, on his first UK visit as President.
She said Brexit was an "opportunity" to create growth in the UK and US.
Trump also said that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson would make a "great Prime Minister", adding "I think he's got what it takes".
In his interview, he renewed his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan over last year's terror attacks in the capital, saying he had done "a terrible job".
The President and his wife were given a red carpet reception at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire on Thursday evening.
They were at a black-tie dinner with May as news broke of his interview with the newspaper, which said it was conducted while he was in Brussels.
After it was published, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the President "likes and respects Prime Minister May very much", adding that he had "never said anything bad about her".
Trump told The Sun newspaper that the UK's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was "a much different deal than the people voted on".
He said the Brexit proposals May and her cabinet thrashed out at Chequers last week mean it would be "most likely ... we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal".
He also said he had told May how to do a Brexit deal, but: "She didn't agree, she didn't listen to me."
"I told her how to do it. That will be up to her to say. But I told her how to do it. She wanted to go a different route," he said.
The US President also said he was "cracking down" on the EU because "they have not treated the United States fairly on trading".

## Title: THE TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMITS POTENTIAL NUCLEAR FALLOUT
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 13, 2018 - 01:00
THE TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMITS POTENTIAL NUCLEAR FALLOUT
The July 16 summit in Helsinki between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin presents a unique opportunity to reverse the dangerous nuclear competition between the United States and Russia and should be welcomed, despite its inherent risks. The opportunity to stabilize U.S.-Russian nuclear relations by extending New START, a key nuclear treaty that is set to expire in 2021, is paramount and worth the issues that come with any meeting between Trump and Putin.
Relations between the United States and Russia are at lows not seen since the end of the Cold War, and the risks of military conflict and even nuclear use remain high. Other irritants and dangers  including Russias interference in U.S. domestic affairs, illegal annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, intimidation of NATO members, and violation of numerous nuclear and other arms control agreements  all remain open points of conflict. But it is because of all of these risks, not in spite of them, that the summit could increase U.S. security if it extends New START.
NATO troops
Unlike other nuclear treaties, both countries remain in full compliance with the central limits of the New START agreement, which has proved a powerful tool for reducing the risk of nuclear warfare. Yet the United States and Russia retain the worlds two largest nuclear arsenals, and both are engaged in massive modernization programmes to enhance the military utility and longevity of their forces. Both are now pursuing doctrines and capabilities that would rely on the earlier use of nuclear weapons in more situations all while claiming they seek to avoid conflict and prevent the use of nuclear weapons.
For its part, Russia is also in violation of numerous arms control agreements, including the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which prohibits either country from possessing ground-based ballistic or cruise missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,400 miles. Moscow also retains perhaps as many as 2,000 tactical battlefield nuclear weapons, not only to compensate for its perceived conventional inferiority to NATO troops but also leaving it in a position to carry out its threat to use nuclear weapons first in a losing conventional conflict that threatens the survival of the Russian state.
Numerous observers have noted that the risks of conflict among the United States, NATO, and Russia remain unacceptably high.
Russia believes that NATO enlargement and U.S. expansion of missile defenses and advanced conventional capabilities are to blame for this state of affairs, while the United States believes that Russias violation of Ukraines sovereignty (and that of Georgia in the 2008 war), its reckless behaviour toward NATO, and its increasing reliance on nuclear weapons are to blame for the instability in Europe. Regardless, both states can and must take actions to reduce the risks of conflict, tensions that, given their own doctrines, could quickly escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. Risks that seemed long banished to the annals of history are now very real and require high-level attention to reverse.
Trump overpromised and, so far, underdelivered on nuclear issues with North Korea all while heaping undeserved and dangerous praise on Kim Jong Un. Theres understandable worries that Trump, with his largely unexplained obsession with having Putins approval, will embolden a state that is acting against U.S. interests.
The risk that Trump will give Russia multiple concessions on NATO, sanctions, Ukraine, or elsewhere is very real.
The ability to constrain his actions rests with Congress and perhaps some members of his Cabinet, although they have failed to exercise any real control on the president to date. The prospect of a private Trump-Putin meeting should give anyone paying attention great pause. But those risks must be weighed against the possible benefits of avoiding one of the greatest risks facing the United States today, that of nuclear conflict.
Nuclear launchers
Negotiated between the United States and Russia by then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, the New START agreements central limits went into effect on Feb. 5. It will remain in force until February 2021 but can be extended by executive agreement for a period of up to five years. The treaty contains effective verification and on-site access provisions that ensure both countries can monitor compliance with the deal by the other side and that both sides are meeting their obligations under the pact.
By capping the arsenals of both countries to no more than 1,550 offensive deployed strategic nuclear weapons and no more than 700 deployed nuclear launchers (missiles and strategic bombers), the New START pact brings a much-needed predictability to the long-standing nuclear relationship between Washington and Moscow. And, importantly, the agreements limits are built into the current U.S. nuclear modernization plan. The expiration of the deal might lead Russia and the United States to expand further their costly and dangerous expansion of nuclear forces and remove any ability of Washington to cooperatively monitor Moscows nuclear developments.
Both Russia and the United States benefit from the transparency, data exchanges, and inspection rights codified in New START. The predictability that the agreement provides has helped both sides prevent an even more uncertain and unstable nuclear relationship. As bad as things are, they can get worse. Just imagine how worst-case assessments of Russias nuclear arsenal would dominate the press and policy debate if U.S. inspectors were no longer able to verify what accountable nuclear weapons Russia has and where they are located. The history of mistaken overestimates of Russias nuclear power by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s is chilling and led to poor and costly decisions  and unnecessarily risked all-out nuclear conflict.
The treaty is not a panacea. The United States rightly wants to constrain Russias actions, including its ongoing violations of the INF Treaty and its pursuit of a suite of new exotic weapons, such as its newly declared underwater long-range nuclear torpedo. Russia, too, wants to address the risks posed by U.S. missile defenses, precision conventional weapons, and other systems. These discussions and potential agreements must be pursued but will take time. Both sides cant afford to risk the expiration of the New START agreement by waiting to solve all outstanding issues before locking in the benefits of the agreement.
Strategic stability
If New START can be extended at the summit, then the two sides should also consider elevating the long-moribund and desperately needed strategic stability talks to a high level. One option would be to start a 2+2 dialogue of the U.S. secretaries of state and defense with their Russian counterparts on a regular basis, with technical teams meeting even more frequently. Far from a return to business as usual, such a step is both appropriate and warranted given the very real dangers inherent in the relationship today.
It seems surreal that the nuclear dangers of the Cold War have returned so quickly. But it is dangerous to ignore them just because we dont want to admit that we have stumbled back into a pattern of competition and brinksmanship. While the contours of the tension may be different, the tools needed to reverse this dangerous pattern are proven and well know. New START is the latest example of such tools and should be extended without delay to give both countries the room to take broader and more productive action in the coming months.

Two docs at war over some spilt gravy
Two doctors attached to the Galle-Karapitiya Teaching Hospital had reportedly been at loggerheads over an incident that took place at the hospital canteen over which both medical practitioners made complaints against each other to the Galle police.
A doctor at the Intensive Care Unit and another at the Dental Orthopedic Unit of the hospital have thus charged each other of triggering death threats over one another, Galle police said.
According to the Police complaint, while the doctor of the ICU was having meals at the canteen, some gravy had accidently spilled over his body as the doctor of the Dental Orthopaedic Unit left the dining table.
However, the two doctors had met again near the Hospital Directors office where they had started a dispute over the same incident using abusive language against each other, the Police complaint revealed.
The Dental Orthopaedic doctor who alleged the other doctor was keeping a knife in his pocket had challenged him to stab him if he dared to do so to which the ICU doctor had threatened to kill his colleague, holding him by his shirt collar. Subsequently, the Dental Orthopaedic surgeon had taken a knife and a spray can out of his pocket and wielded the knife threatening to kill the other, the police complaint further states.
Meanwhile, Police investigations into the complaints reveal that both doctors had been students of the same school in Galle town and graduated from the same university.
Galle Police Miscellaneous Complaints Unit OIC Udaya Senavirathne has initiated investigations into the complaints.
