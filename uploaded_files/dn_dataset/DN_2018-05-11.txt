## Title: The Bullet Train that was KEHELGAMUWA
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C

The Bullet Train that was KEHELGAMUWA
This Bullet Train was made and delivered in Gampola. It had the making of hurtling through any obstacles, often times in unpredictable manners that made those in its path to scamper away. It would hurl through at blinding speed , bounce on the track and blind anything and everything that looked at it as it approached. In its infancy , as it was was being made, it had a distinguishing bounce that that even set the tracks on fire. Some called it the Gampola Express, others called it the Dharamaraja Express.
That train was better known as s TIKIRI BANDA KEHELGAMUWA.
The Bullet Train grew from a bouncing kid to a daring bowler in the junior teams and continued to realize his dream of hurling that ball at blinding speed and his coaches who watched him run up and bowl saw in him everything that went with the makings of a BULLET TRAIN in him.
Batsmen wobbling
And when he made it to the big league in inter-school cricket he made batsmen facing him in Kandy wobble at the legs. When he arrived downhill to play the Colombo schools the BULLET TRAIN unleashed his thunder bolts that had batsmen ducking and weaving and preferring to be at the no strikers end.
With a run up like former West Indian speed gun Wesley Hall, he would begin his run up and let fly the ball, that when it contacted with bat, it loosened the hold batsmen had on it. When it beat batsmen, it knocked the stumps and bails they get spread-eagled. Umpires had a time walking up and adjusting the wickets constantly.
It is history that KEHELGAMUWA was admitted to Dharmaraja College by a school teacher named Seneviratne Amaranayake who was amazed after seeing the boys speed at delivering even a the age of 8 immediately had him admitted into Dharmaraja College.
Fast bowlers alphabet
At Dharmaraja there was also another speedster in Sonny Yatawara who watching the 17 year old KEHELGAMUWAS frightening speed taught him the fast bowlers alphabet, with the bouncer and the toe crushing Yorker that Yatawara was famous for.
KEHEL as he came to be popularly called after a successful season was picked to tour India with the Ceylon Combined Schools team and then struck batsmen down long before; white lightning Allan Donald of South Africa came to the scene by striking lightning like deliveries knocking down the wickets of Combined College Indian batsmen 8 times and amazingly all bowled and was thus seen as the West Indian Wesley Hall in the making.
Reign as speed gun
In KEHELGAMUWAS reign as speed king and when matches against international teams were played few and far between most of it whistle stop ones, he bamboozled batsmen of Joe Listers team in 1968 which comprised mostly England batsmen returning figures of 6 for 67 which had the batsmen admiring and fearing his tremendous speed. His other best was 4 for 19 against Australia and his name and fame spread among the cricket world.
On KEHELGAMUWA a story England opener Geoff Boycot related to me and Sri Lankas BBC Radio Commentator Roshan Abeysinghe was this: while enjoying a cuppa in Wales during the tea break in the Sri Lanka-England Test, I reminded Boycott how he had his off bail sent skyrocketing from a delivery from a guy named KEHELGAMUWA.
He threw me out  Boycott
That question by me made him shudder and his reply. That guy - finding It difficult to pronounce the name said: He did not bowl me out, he threw me out. Meaning that KEHEL had thrown the second ball he faced before he could bring his bat to face ball. Abeysinghe will vouch for what he said.
Then he had another of the champion England batsman and one of he most graceful batsmen the world had seen in Tom Graveny. This Gloustershire ace dominated Englands batting in that era with Peter May, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington.
Graveny who was watching the terrific pace of KEHELGAMUWA from the non strikers end was seen fiddling about with his other batting equipment with unease, especially with his box making sure he would not be hit a stunning blow which could curtail his career. It was not long when Graveny had his leg stump sent tumbling from a snorter from KEHEL and it had relief on his face when making it back to the pavilion.
Slips stand deep
When KEHEL begins to bowl, the slips stand much deeper than they usually do because when if the ball is snicked it comes like a bullet from a gun and not easy clinging on to. He had a bowling action that was questionable, but in those days technology was not even thought of.
After stopping learning from books KEHELGAMUWA was taken into custody by the police. The Arresting officer was one of St.Josephs Colleges finest cricketers in Niel Weerasinghe in 1962. Kehel joined the police in 1962 when unlike now the services recruited sportsmen and women into their ranks. To these who went for sports people were Harry Goonetilleke the former Air Force Commander and former Municipal Commissioner B.A. Jayasinghe.
At the height of instilling fear on batsmen and when the Gopalan Trophy was much looked forward to, KEHELGAMUWA grabed the wickets of former Indian captain Ajit Wadekar, Buddhi Kunderam, Salim Durrrani and Milkha Singh.
Pockets 500 wickets
In Sara cricket he pocketed over 500 wickets during a 15 year period. In 16 first class games he took 55 wickets. Once he finished his career he was selector for a number of years and also was a manager.
In the police he led them from 1969 to 1971 and catapulting the Police from the Donovan Andree to the Sara Trophy. D.H.de Silva who was Charity Commissioner and a cricket fanatic formed and named a team called Nomads. Leading a set of talented cricketers with KEHELGAMUWA as his spear head they won the Sara trophy in 1965. Elated were Jayasinghe and D.H. de Silva, the captain.
I had the opportunity of facing this speed Bullet Train at his fastest when there was no body amour liker today. It was a Sara trophy game between Nomads and Saracens at the Nomads Ground which now stands the Nelum Pokuna.
Had no fear to face him
In that game I made a 60 odd and had no fear in facing the fast man and hitting him for fours. The more you hit him it showed anger on his face and he would come back to try and strike you. A four and the next ball will be blinding bouncer or a toe crushing Yorker. I could sense it and was ready and never cringed.
That Nomads team led by Dr. Sivanathan, had Daya Sahabandu, Skandakuar, Amresh Rajaratnam, D.S.De Silva, A.C.M.Lafir, D.P.de Silva among others and we beat them and to be a bit unassuming I was carried off the ground by the hundreds of elated Saracens supporters.
DS who is now domiciled in England visited me recently with his charming wife Sharmini and while talking of cricket we played recalled that knock that knocked the stuffings of that strong Nomads team that ultimately deprived Nomads of having a tilt at the Sara Trophy.

Summons issued to BBC journalist withdrawn:
Good decision by CID
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday that the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has withdrawn summons issued to BBC journalist Azzam Ameen to appear before it to make a statement over a tweet.
It was a good decision taken by the CID to ensure media freedom, said the Minister.
He was responding a question by a journalist at the media conference held yesterday at the Government Information Department.
He was not summoned as a suspect but as a witness to record a statement, said the Minister.
Ameen had re-tweeted: You are a wonderful speaker. But how do you ensure they turn into action. Show by doing! Advice to President Sirisena from his own @PMDNewsGov.
Azzam Ameen was asked to appear before the CID after he re-tweeted a tweet which appeared on the official twitter account of the Presidents Media Division. The Presidents Media Division claims that they have not tweeted it.
We are very much aware of some incidents of cyber terrorism. So the government will conduct an investigation with regard to this incident in order to find the source of this tweet, said the Minister. Responding to a question, Director General of Information Sudarshana Gunaratne said the original tweet is not available and that they have the re-tweet only as evidence for further investigations.
The CID recorded statements from officers attached to the PMD.
The Government Information Department intervened in this issue to ensure media freedom, he said.
The Director General asked journalists to inform of any issue faced by journalists, claiming that safeguarding journalists and ensuring their freedom of expression is the policy of the government.

Professional capabilities of  hoteliers have redefined
Celebrating outstanding achievements and new skill sets gained, the Certified Hospitality Finance and Management Accountants (CHFMA) professional qualification jointly offered by CHFMA and SLITHM held its Certificate Awarding Ceremony and new class inauguration ceremony recently. CHFMA Foundation and Certificate Level students gathered at the auditorium of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management to be felicitated and recognized for the excellent results they obtained.
Minister of Tourism Development, John Amaratunga together with Chairman, National Human Resource Development Council of Sri Lanka, Dinesh Weerakkody were instrumental in introducing the CHFMA professional qualification.
Speaking about the success of the programme, Minister Amaratunga noted that it was important for SLITHM as the countrys pioneer hospitality trainer to innovate and adapt to the changing requirements of the industry.
The Minister praised Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala, President, CMA Sri Lanka and Chairman, SLITHM, Sunil Dissanayake for acting on his proposal and making the programme a reality in a short period of time.
As management accountants, their skills have been harnessed to develop businesses in a variety of industries across the world. Preparation for the specific needs of operating with any given field, however, tends to be a matter of on-the-job learning and wisdom passed down from predecessors.
Jointly offered by the Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) and Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), the CHFMA qualification supports Sri Lankan professionals by pre-empting that process, giving them the skills they need to excel in finance and management accounting in the hospitality sector, even before they have spent years in the workplace.
As a result, CHFMA-qualified management accountants are well-equipped to handle the challenges they will face in the hospitality sector.
Chief Guest at the ceremony, Rohan Karr, Executive Vice President, John Keells Holdings  Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, stated that the hospitality industry demands a fascination with the sector, and deep and comprehensive knowledge, in order to establish a successful career.
Speaking on the lack of professional qualifications providing skills to support operations in the hospitality industry, he underscored the importance of obtaining a professional qualification in the specific area of finance and management accounting for the hospitality industry.

Rs. 17 bn for low-income houses in Colombo city
An investment of Rs. 17 billion will be made for a housing programme for Colombo city. The period where pay-offs had to be made to government contractors and politicians has now ended. An investment of Rs. 5 million will also be made on each low-income group family in Colombo, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony to mark the opening of a new housing scheme with 437 flats costing Rs. 1.748 billion at Aramaya Place, Dematagoda, Colombo, yesterday. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were the chief guests on the occasion.
Minister Ranawaka said past governments had made various efforts to provide decent houses to slum dwellers in Colombo city. The late minister Pieter Keuneman, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, as well as former Minister Indika Gunawardene and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had made efforts towards this direction.
Now we have made a firm determination to completely resolve this housing problem of low-income groups in the city by finding a 100 percent solution. We have achieved 100 percent success in defeating terrorism and bringing peace and providing electricity to every household. The mobile phone network too had achieved 100 percent success. Today we have shouldered the task of building a 100 percent house-owning population.
Ranawaka said the UDA would invest Rs. 25 billion on three office complexes in Battaramulla in addition to the task of house building. He was proud to state that the UDA was financially stronger and steadier than any private institution.
As much as late President Premadasa built a city within a city at Maligawatte, the present government would build five housing cities in Colombo, with each one almost 10 times bigger than Maligawatte. The five housing cities will include the one in Dematagoda and four others - in Henamulla, Maligawatte, Kolonnawa and Kirillapone.
Although the government was deeply involved in the development programme, the message did not go out to the people due to poor publicity. Their intention was to carry the message of development to peoples hearts and minds, the minister said. He requested the beneficiaries of the housing schemes to use their houses to ensure a bright and prosperous future for their children.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
#49 Hristo Stoichkov
0-1, 1-6, 0-0; 0-2, 0-3, 1-3; 2-3, 2-5, 1-1; 0-0, 1-1, 1-4; 1-1, 1-1, 0-2, 0-2; Five World Cups, Zero Wins. As Bulgaria got ready to take part in their sixth FIFA World Cup in 1994, no one gave much more than a casual glance... and that was just because theyd managed to make the trip by knocking out France, in France, during the last day of qualifying.
There were good players in the team, but nobody expected much and their first match didnt do anything but reinforce those pre-World Cup assumptions as Nigeria gave them a proper 3-0 hiding.
By the time they played the second, though, their captain had decided enough was enough. An angry man, never short of a few cuss words - or the odd punch* - Hristo Stoichkov was a brilliant, brilliant footballer.
Partnering Romario upfront for Johann Cruyffs Barcelona Dream Team, he was a strong man, impossible to dislodge off the ball, with a sharp burst of pace that could leave anyone rooted, and a magic wand for a left foot - part machine-powered jack-hammer, part deft paintbrush. He was their one truly world-class player, and hed decided enough was enough.
Recollecting the moment years later, Stoichkov told FIFATV, We told ourselves that wed give the Greeks a good hiding, a serious thrashing... and boy did they. With the Barcelona man dispatching two cool-as-cucumber penalties (he rarely, rarely missed), the Bulgarians thrashed the Greeks 4-0.
They then took on Argentina, a Diego Maradona-less Argentina. Stoichkov ran the match - scoring the opener with a sublime first-time finish just outside the box, and they won 2-0.
In the second round, Stoichkov gave Bulgaria the lead with one of the great World Cup goals... running onto a superb through ball from Daniel Borimirov, taking a touch and absolutely leathering one into the top, near, corner. The Bulgarians would win that on penalties and in the quarters would pull off their greatest ever victory.
Once again, it was Stoichkov at the heart of it all, equalising (after Germany had taken the lead through a Matthaus penalty, earned by a trademark Klinsmann dive) with a magnificent freekick that left Bodo Illgner gaping, rooted to the spot, in the German goal.
Bulgaria would win it thanks to a header from the balding Yordan Lechkov (who was brilliant in this WC) and Bulgaria would upset the defending champions in the quarterfinals!
Although Stoichkov despatched another dead-eyed penalty against Italy, that Buddhist firecracker Roberto Baggio proved too much to handle, and the Azzurri would win - but Bulgaria would always have this amazing, fairytale run to take home... and a World Cup Golden Boot for Hristo Stoichkov (6 goals, tied with Oleg Salenko of Russia) - their player of the tournament, their hero, their greatest ever.
In the subsequent tournament, 98, Stoichkov ran on fumes, and could not inspire anything more than a mere participation certificate for Bulgaria but for his exploits in 94, his goals, his swagger, and his unrestrained charisma... hes one of our 50 Greatest players in World Cup History. - sk
*The most Stoichkovy of anecdotes - He had been suspended for life in 1985 for instigating and taking healthy part in a brawl during the Bulgarian Cup final - but the authorities had a change of heart and reduced it to one month from a lifetime. Thats some change of heart.

Apparel export revenue  to hit US$ 5 bn in 2018
Armed with the GSP Plus concession, the Sri Lankan apparel sector will be able for the first time pass the US$ 5 billion export revenue target this year, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, addressing the launch of 8th AISEX and FASE apparel industry sourcing expo at BMICH, Colombo Yesterday.
He said 2018 will be a breakthrough year in its history of exports compared to the US$ 4.8 billion in 2017 and so far in first quarter 2018 total apparel exports had surged by 4% to US$ 1.26 billion compared to last years first quarter exports of US$ 1.21 billion.
The Minister however pointed out that though the revenue is close to US$ 5 billion, Sri Lanka invests nearly US$ 4 billion to import apparel and sourcing raw materials and steps should be taken to minimize this.
He said the best way to come out of this is to source raw material from the region and also look at new technology. Looking at manufacturing raw material too is a good option, he said.
The Minister also cautioned that though Europe is a key market it is undergoing changes due to increasing unemployment and policy uncertainties after Brexit. Sri Lanka should look at new markets. It will be difficult for us to move to the next levels without resolving these issues.
Secretary General of Joint Apparel Association Forum Tuli Cooray said that the GSP concession is for a limited time and the industry should be more productive and introduce new skills and technologies. Our industry should also be exposed to the new global trends, to move forward facing emerging challenges to advance to the next level.
Sri Lanka is at a critical stage as the country is moving for a very ambitious reform agenda.
Last year Sri Lanka earned $2 billion from apparel exports to EU, which was 42% of total apparel exports. In the first quarter this year, Lankan apparel exports to EU increased by 5.2% to US$ 526 million in comparison to US$ 500 million in first quarter of 2017. Chairman of Sri Lanka Apparel Institute Prof. Lakdas Fernando said that digitization is the key for exports and those who dont move in that direction would perish.
The winds of change are rippling across global industries and it is very much evident in apparel sector too-in CAT tech, digital printing and digital designs, Prof Lakdas said.

Army RSMs leave for Bangladesh interactive sessions
A significant breakthrough made in direct working relations between Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) of the Sri Lanka Army and the Bangladesh Army has enabled a set of Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) to leave for Bangladesh for a five-day long interactive familiarization session with their Bangladesh Army counterparts on Saturday, May 5.
The novel conceptual approach, mooted by none other than the Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake with the blessings of the Defence Ministry, is closely aimed at creating and promoting a platform for exchange of knowledge in all aspects of military logistics, dependable and fast responses to situations and sharing of Sri Lanka's battle experiences with their counterparts.
Lieutenant General Senanayake, taking an exceptional interest in the overseas visit project exclusively assigned to the SNCOs has already sought possibilities for such overseas openings from friendly armies in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Maldives and Bangladesh in the South Asian region in order to facilitate them to learn from each other.
Lieutenant General Senanayake considering the contribution of Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) in transforming the Sri Lanka Army to that of a capacity-based one, treats those SNCOs as a bridge between Officers and soldiers and believes the facilitation of them for an overseas exposure of this nature would inevitably stimulate development of their leadership, logistic and organizational skills while simultaneously enhancing military diplomacy among regional organizations and countries.
The five-member delegation of SNCOs, WO I J. A. Saminda (Sri Lanka Armoured Corps), WO I E. P. Sisira Kumara (Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment), WO I W. M. Wijerathna (Commando Regiment), WO I S. J. M. K. Senevirathne (Sri Lanka Army Medical Corps) and WO I K. D. S. Karunarathna (Sri Lanka National Guard), led by Captain D. T. R. Danthanarayana who acquired best results in the recent Captain to Major examination, met the brainchild behind the project at the Commander's office and received Lieutenant General Senanayake's blessings, prior to their departure for Bangladesh on Friday, May 4 night. Major Genaral Aruna Wanniarachchi, Director General Training at the Army Headquarters was also present during the meeting with the Commander of the Army.
During their stay in Bangladesh, those SNCOs will attend interactive sessions with Bangladesh Army Regimental Sergeant Majors in the 46 Independent Infantry Brigade Headquarters and other Sergeant Majors.
A visit to the NCOs Academy and to the Bogra Cantonment and several other interactive sessions have also been planned for those visiting Sri Lankan SNCOs in Bangladesh.
The Commander during his meet with Bangladesh-bound SNCOs urged them to make the maximum use of their stay to learn more and more about their modalities of work and how new innovative technology can be applied for their duties in Sri Lanka upon return.

Art and jewellery entwined
was recently responsible for yet another unforgettable experience when the brand teamed up with Kavan Balasuriya, one of the rising stars of the local art scene.
The collaboration saw Alankara use Kavans work as backdrops for jewelry display cases, as well as miniature display pedestals, at the pop up gallery at their shop in Odel Unlimited at Alexander place, Colombo 7. The pop up gallery caught the eye of jewelry and art connoisseurs alike.
Having graduated from the BA Fine Art course at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, University of the Arts, London, in 2014, Kavan now lives and works in Colombo where he has already held several exhibitions.
Director of Alankara, Roshini Sangani said We believe that it is vitally important for companies to support local artists. We were particularly interested in Kavan since his penchant for strong lines and textures that challenge space and form, made for ideal backdrops for our trademark classic jewelry.
The alternative gallery attracted many visitors. Speaking about the experience Kavan said This was an excellent opportunity, and I was delighted when Alankara approached me with the concept. Our country is rich in artistic talent, and all we artists need is exposure and encouragement.
Alankaras hope is that as the public becomes more exposed to the local art scene, more brands will seize the opportunity to align with these talented individuals There is so much talent out there and these artists deserve all the support we can give them.We will continue to work with these creative young people and we hope that other brands and companies will follow suit, Sangani said.

Because you are Irreplaceable
Every 40 seconds, a human life is taken by suicide, according to World Health Organization data. The projected global suicide rate for the year 2020 is one in every 20 seconds. Suicide has now become a silent epidemic that ruins lives and devastates families and communities. It is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15 to 44 years. More male suicide deaths are reported while more females attempt.
Suicide, or ending ones own life, is a tragic event with strong emotional repercussions for its survivors and for the families of its victims. In 1995, the WHO placed Sri Lanka among the countries that had the highest rates of suicide. However, since then suicide rate has greatly reduced from an alarmingly high rate of 47 per 100,000 population in 1995 to a rate of 16 (police statistics 2010). At present an average of 12 persons die by suicide in Sri Lanka every day.
In Sri Lanka harassment by the spouse and family disputes was the most common reason in 2014 while matters associated with love affairs ranked the second. Chronic diseases and physical disabilities, underlying mental illness, economic reasons were the next common underlying factors for suicidal deaths according to the police reports, Director Mental Health, Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Chithramalee de Silva said.
According to statistics of Sri Lanka Police the most popular method of committing suicide is hanging. In 2017, 1,508 males self harmed themselves by hanging while female deaths stood at 306. Consuming pesticide is the other mode commonly used by these persons.
Some mental health conditions like depression, schizophrenia, substance use disorders are major recognized risk factors for suicides and addressing these risk factors will result in suicide reduction. Many suicides are the result of an impulsive act, therefore identifying the persons who are at high risk and attending to their psychological, physical, mental and socioeconomic needs is of paramount importance, Dr. de Silva explained.
Suicide prevention
Sri Lankas recent decreasing suicide trend could be the result of national strategies instigated in the mid-1990s, which include: de-criminalizing of suicide, which eliminated the stigma attached to the psychological condition, restricting access to poisonous chemicals and assigning more medical officers with mental health training to provincial hospitals to provide psychiatric support.
However Dr. de Silva says those who attempted suicide or died of suicide and their families experience considerable stigma, and may not seek care which in turn affects the mental health of survivors and their families. Therefore, those who attempted suicide and their family members require continued support from health care providers for long periods of time as they face enormous difficulties in leading their life, she added.
Although the number of deaths by suicide has reduced gradually, the number of attempts which is 10 to 20 times more is steadily on the rise. This clearly indicates that there is still an acute national need to help those who need emotional support.
She recommends encouraging good social support for adolescents, youth and elderly who are at a higher risk, good parenting care especially for young persons, educational reforms with student friendly education system, establishing counselling services in schools, community and work places, establishing hotlines for counselling, educating identified gatekeepers like police, teachers, health professionals for suicide prevention, further restricting the easy access to means of suicides (safe storage of pesticides, chemicals and drugs at both individual and community levels) and strengthening good marital relationships as few actions to minimize suicides.
Suicides are preventable and require coordinated and sustained effort from multiple sectors of the society, both public and private, including health and non-health sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, industry, Justice, Law, defence, politics and the media, Dr. De Silva emphasised.
Role of media
Senior Consultant Psychiatrist and Kothalawela Defence Universitys Senior Lecturer, Dr. Neil Fernando said Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that possess a suicide prevention policy.
Presidential Task Force recommendations include reducing the availability of pesticides, reducing the lethality of pesticide, improve the quality of healthcare, changing the attitude of people, promoting mental health and responsible media reporting, Dr. Fernando said.
Media can play an effective proactive role in suicide prevention by minimizing the prominence given to suicide reports, informing public about sources of help and emergency helpline numbers, encouraging people to take action and seek care, conveying positive stories of people who have overcome suicidal thoughts and ideations, he added.
Risk of additional suicides increases when the story explicitly describes the suicide method, uses dramatic/graphic headlines or images, and repeated and extensive coverage sensationalizes or glamorizes a death. Suicide Contagion, or Copycat Suicide, occurs when one or more suicides are reported in a way that contributes to another suicide.
Covering suicide carefully can change public misperceptions and correct myths, which can encourage those who are vulnerable or at risk to seek help.
I think the Lake House group of newspapers has taken a policy decision not to report suicide which is very commendable. Not sensationalizing stories on suicide and not giving a heroic status is vital in reporting. Instead media should emphasize the usefulness of life and use investigative journalism when reporting suicide and contribute positively in suicide prevention, Dr. Fernando explained.
Talking Helpers
To achieve this mammoth task of preventing the loss of gift of life help lines such as Sumithrayo and CCC line puts in there valuable service.
At Sumithrayo we are aware that there seems to be a surge in attempts of self harm and deaths by suicide in Sri Lanka. Relationship issues, exams and other social pressures that result in lowering of self esteem, mental illness and the stigma that surrounds it, a steep rise in alcohol and other drug addictions are the leading causes. Sumithrayo was the first ever crisis centre in Sri Lanka when it was set up in 1974. We continue to work silently in helping people cope with distress, despair and hopelessness, volunteer at Sumithrayo, Jomo Uduman said.
He explained that the organisation has realised the importance of going out from the centre to spread awareness in suicide prevention. We regularly visit schools, factories and offices for suicide prevention programmes. It is very important that the media publishes contact details of help lines at the end of a suicide report. This will help others who are reading it and vulnerable to seek help and understand that there are other options than suicide, he added.
Support system
Uduman says everybody has gone through these feelings and moments of hopelessness. What have helped some of us are our coping skills and more importantly the support system we had around to help us cope and come through. Coping and problem solving skills can also evolve biologically and some are lucky to be born with resilience and courage but if coping skills are difficult to hold onto and there is no support system then the pain will become harder to bear.
Many live in an environment where it is a constant battle to cope. They must then depend on family, teachers and friends to teach them these skills but what if nobody has the time to teach or reach out to them, Uduman queried.
He said often such people are labeled, targeted and sidelined. They become vulnerable and prone to emotional pain and thoughts that can lead to self harming. Experts now recognize the importance of emotional intelligence which is  the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and recognize, and understand the emotions of others.
Uduman feels if emotional intelligence can also be a subject in all schools it can help children learn and understand coping skills early in life to deal with those difficult feelings when they come along.
Suicide is still a very serious issue in our country. In Sri Lanka, on an average, 10-12 persons die by suicide every single day of the year and for each person who dies by suicide at least 10 others fail in their attempt to end their life. This figure can be much more as it is very difficult to monitor attempts of self harm. So you are looking at least 110 people choosing suicide /self harm as an option to end their pain each day. 110/day is 40,000 per year, he emphasized.
Suicide is a complex problem for which there is no single cause or single reason. There is no simple explanation for why someone chooses to die by suicide and it is rarely due to one particular factor. Mental health problems are important influences, as well as alcohol and substance misuse, feeling desperate, helpless or without hope as well as impulsiveness. People who have self-harmed or made a serious attempt at suicide in the past are more likely to do so again, and are therefore at much greater risk of dying by suicide in the future. Taking a minute to reach out to someone  a complete stranger or close family member or friend  can change the course of their life. As members of communities, it is our responsibility to look out for those who may be struggling, check in with them, and encourage them to tell their story in their own way and at their own pace, Uduman added.
You can reach Sumithrayo on 011 2692909, 011 2696666, 011 2683555.
Courage Compassion Commitment
CCC line 1333 established by the Courage Compassion Commitment (CCC) Foundation in partnership with Lifeline in Australia and the National Institute of Mental Health in Angoda, Sri Lanka is another organisation which aims to prevent suicide in Sri Lanka through education, engagement and empowerment to break the stigma attached to mental illness and social issues.
CCC line Manger, Ranil Tillakaratne along with clinical psychologist Nivendra Uduman and the vibrant undergraduate in psychology Sara Nazoor is currently involved in Footsteps to Freedom - 72-day walk, covering a distance of 1460 kilometres along the coastline of Sri Lanka, conducting workshops and distributing material including significant and useful information on how people can recognise a mental health problem and support each other on a very basic level until professional help is sought.
Since its inception in December 2009, CCC line 1333 has been steadily moving forward towards its goal of being a credible, accessible and most utilised telephone counselling service in Sri Lanka. CCC line 1333 is a confidential and free telephone counselling service to encourage people to talk about their problems whether they are personal, relationship or family issues, schools or work worries, mental illness or suicide thoughts. CCC lines 1333 short code number is a toll free number accessible to all people of Sri Lanka. The service currently averages over 2,000 calls every month, Tillakaratne said.
We are passionate about this walk because information does not go out to remote areas. People dont know that these services are available in Sri Lanka. They dont know where to go to seek help. They dont know how to identify someone who has a mental health problem; if a family member or friend is on the verge of suicide they are unaware. We want to change that, he added.
The walk which commenced on April 1 will continue till June 12 with a series of planned and unplanned awareness raising sessions that will be held in organisations and schools as well as tea shops, bus stands and smaller village community gatherings throughout the period.
CCC line 1333 Telephone Counsellors are trained under the guidance of Lifeline Australia, the largest telephone counselling service in Australia.
Depression can come in any form and it should never be underestimated. Take a minute, talk a minute and help save precious life around you.

## Title: Benefits  of AI to outweigh  disadvantages

Benefits  of AI to outweigh  disadvantages
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very polarizing subject in that its one of the most overhyped subjects. Yet at the same time, AI has the potential to enact many profound developments in so many areas of business, and our lives.
Some people see AI taking over the world within a couple of years, while others think it isnt even real. As usual, the truth will lie somewhere in the middle. AI brings an incredible number of possibilities, but not everything will be possible in the near future.
AI has become a marketing term that is an over-hyped generalization. There is no such thing as general intelligence in any AI yet, and perhaps we dont need it to be either. If anything, today an AI function is more about teaching a lemur how to get food than a chimpanzee figuring it out for themselves.
Still, there are many AI functions that have been created that are very useful and valuable.
Defining artificial intelligence
AI is the theory and development of computer systems being able to perform tasks better than or as good as humans. We also discussed that although the future of AI might be general intelligence, todays version of AI is very much about specific intelligence, and thats where companies should invest. Can we take specific tasks in our business applications or processes and augment our users with AI capability to better perform their work An example here would be using AI technologies to help doctors interpret MRI or ECG images when diagnosing a patient. This is about augmenting the doctor, not about replacing him.
Within the field of AI, there are multiple sub-disciplines. Many applications involving AI utilize more than one of them.
These functions are typically developed for a very specific purpose, such as natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, search engines, gaming, predictions or specific features in self-driving cars. Being specialized often brings higher business value than being a generalist. If you go see a doctor for a serious life-threatening condition, who would you like to see leading your treatment
A general practitioner or the renowned medical specialist in the field
Until now, we have not even talked about the most important AI discipline: machine learning. It is one of those terms that are thrown around a lot, but what does it actually mean
Machine learning is a term to describe a set of algorithms that can learn by themselves. This is achieved by feeding the algorithm many examples (data) of the task it should perform so it can extract patterns to achieve its goal. Once the pattern is known, it can be applied to data the algorithm has not seen before. For example, to make predictions
AI, learns by itself
Even machine learning, being an important part of AI, remains relatively difficult to implement. Of course, there are easier and more difficult challenges, but in general, to implement algorithms that work well for your enterprise application or problem can be quite tedious.
Often, the actual machine learning algorithms are easy enough to understand. The challenge is in selecting the right algorithm for the problem and presenting the problem to the algorithm in the correct way. This requires a detailed knowledge of the problem as well as a relatively deep understanding of the capabilities and constraints of the available algorithms and models. Still, this is a problem thats relatively common throughout computer science.
Complicating matters further is that machine learning needs the correct amount of training so that the model remains general enough to be useful for new problems. Troubleshooting, if it doesnt work as expected, can be time-consuming since the models built by neural networks, for instance, can be very complex and difficult to understand.
Big data is everywhere
Yes! There is a lot of data out there. A single flight of a Boeing 787 generates 500 GB of data from the various sensors and instruments it carries. At any one time there are more than 170 Boeing 787s in the air, so thats a lot of data. But often with implementing machine learning algorithms, the question is do we have the right data and also can we make useful information out of all this data
An example that we worked on in IFS Labs is Sentiment Analysis. According to Wikipedia, sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source materials.
For example, can you use sentiment analysis on social media to improve the accuracy of predicted future demand, and there is a lot of social media data available, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, etc. In practice, it depends a lot on your actual use-case. If you would like to understand the sentiment on the newest iPhone, you can probably find sufficient data. But if you would like to understand the sentiment on peoples perception of the smart meter installations in a country, its already difficult to find sufficient, specific enough data to get meaningful results.
As with any type of analysis, the amount and reliability of underlying datasets are critical to the success of the machine learning and it just isnt always there.
For more than 12 years, IFS has been using machine learning algorithms and other smart techniques inside IFS Planning & Scheduling Optimization (PSO) to provide optimized schedules for our customers.
One of the major components in IFS PSO is the Dynamic Scheduling Engine (DSE). The DSE is a general-purpose optimization engine, which deals with goals and constraints, and seeks to find the best solution to a problem. It has no specific knowledge of field service, logistics, sales and operations planning, or staff restoring, yet it is used to optimize businesses in all these areas.
Jobs to be replaced by robots
So far in history, each and every technology revolution has created more jobs than it destroyed. Whether we look at the industrial revolution or the rise of the internet, in the end, more people had a job than before, and often better-paid ones as they were more productive. So, I expect that the benefits of AI will outweigh the disadvantages, especially if people are helped and encouraged to learn the new skills they will need to work alongside intelligent systems.
Also, technological developments often take longer than we initially predict and machines with general intelligence are probably many decades away from being developed if they are possible at all. Therefore, a more likely scenario is that humans and AI will work together, collaborating and enforcing each rather than the pessimistic, but headline-generating doom scenarios.
And although AI technology will provide us the opportunity to augment and partially replace human work while creating new jobs, those new jobs will require higher skilled people. Or, as Gartner is predicting, already in 2020, AI becomes a positive net job motivator, creating 2.3 million jobs while only eliminating 1.8 million jobs.
This is not everything of course. There are many more statements and quotes out there on AI worth looking into and perhaps most of them can be considered myth as well. As with most things, finding a balance between being optimistic and pessimistic works well for you in AI. Dont believe everything thats said, but invest in those opportunities that are actually feasible as they have the potential to change the way we do business.

Buys Daraz Group, plans to expand e-commerce in South Asia
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is spreading its wings further into South Asia by acquiring the regions largest e-commerce platform.
The buyout of Daraz Group, for an undisclosed amount, will make the company a wholly owned unit of Alibaba, following in its footsteps of recent purchases in shopping portals and digital wallets across the region.
We are excited for Daraz to become a part of the Alibaba ecosystem, said Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang. Together with Daraz, we can now empower entrepreneurs to better serve consumers in the region through our technology and expertise.
Zhang said the Daraz team is a natural fit, sharing Alibabas values and beliefs that long-term economic development in the region will depend on a technology-enabled commerce ecosystem.
Founded in 2012, Pakistan-based Daraz sells an array of products from consumer goods to electronics online. The retailer offers multiple payment options including cash-on-delivery, and is active in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal.
Together with Alibaba, we are ready to empower entrepreneurs in the region and to fulfill our promise to offer our customers the best selection of products with a high level of convenience, said Daraz Co-CEO Jonathan Doerr.
Daraz said its acquisition by Alibaba would help drive further growth in its key markets, home to 460 million people, 60 percent of them younger than 35.
Pakistans burgeoning youth has presented a great opportunity for Daraz, with the market projected to grow 8.2 percent a year through 2021 amid rising disposable incomes, according to data from Euromonitor International.
Alibaba is also penetrating into Southeast Asia, after topping up investment in Lazada that gives it control of the well-known Southeast Asian online shopping platform.
Ant Financial Services Group, Alibabas financial arm, also struck deals earlier this year to back Pakistans fintech firm Telenor Microfinance Bank, as well as team up with Bangladeshs payment platform bKash.
Alibabas strings of acquisitions are a vote of confidence in the region, said iResearch analyst Li Chao.
The Belt and Road Initiative impacts almost all crucial markets where Alibaba is making strides into, and its likely that businesses will benefit from the investments now, he noted.
Alibabas revenue from international business, which includes Lazada and AliExpress, grew 94 percent year-on-year in the fiscal year ended March 2018. (Chinadaily)

From 2010 to 2014:
CEB paid employees'paye tax
In a shocking disclosure, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) employees have been exempted from having to pay Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) tax, a costly move for which the CEB has incurred a sum of Rs.1,407 million between 2010 and 2014, which it paid on behalf of its employees. Highly placed sources say the CEB and other state-owned-enterprises such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, institutions which come under the purview of the Power and Energy Ministry, pay a cumulative tax on behalf of its employees.
This issue has been flagged by the COPE report as well. However the state had not been able to do anything about it. The issue was raised at Cabinet meetings but it didnt go beyond that, reliable sources told the Daily News. It is very unfair on the general masses who pay taxes and are double taxed.
According to the Auditor Generals Department, the CEB had paid Rs. 215,052,824 and 362,275,677 as PAYE tax in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The CPC paid Rs 58,058,980 and Rs. 166,283,989 as PAYE tax in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
Furthermore, a closer inspection of the Annual Report of the CEB shows that the PAYE tax payment is listed as irregular payments. The 2014 Annual Report says; the Board (CEB) had paid the PAYE tax on behalf of its employees contrary to the Cabinet decision taken on December 13, 2007 to shift the PAYE tax liability to employees since the next salary revision which should have been effected since 2009.
The PAYE tax paid by the Board since the year 2010 to December 31, 2014 was Rs.1, 407 million.
Elaborating further, the report cites that; the PAYE Tax liability of CEB employees has been borne by the CEB since its employees were made liable for PAYE Tax. This was informed to the Ministry of P & E and Salaries and Cadre Commission several times and discussions were held with Trade Unions. However no consensus was reached.
Meanwhile it has been brought to the notice of the publication that 39 different staff allowances had been paid from time to time to CEB staffers on the approval of the board of directors without Cabinet approval, as specified in the Public Enterprises Circular No 95 of June 4, 1994.
At the Audit test, checks revealed that such allowances amounting to Rs. 849 million had been paid in the year 2014 as compared with Rs. 642 million so paid in 2013. Sources told the Daily News that employees who continue to engage in strike action or work-to-rule campaigns cannot draw allowances however, CEB employees continue to accept disturbance allowances and others despite being on strike.

Observations from a bench
My house is overlooking the beautiful, serene, Bellanwila Lake and Jogging Track. To take away or forget the worries and troubles, both in domestic life and our country in political turmoil, all of us face, I go for a stroll every Saturday and Sunday evenings and sit on a concrete block gazing at the lake and enjoy the young and the old leisurely passing by and children cycling and roller skating.
It was last Sunday as I was enjoying the peaceful environment, a well built young man was passing me in a white T-Shirt, written in large bold red letters GO TO HELL seeing this, I smiled and pointed at the T-Shirt. He laughed and signalled with a Thumbs Up his acknowledgement, and went his way. This aroused my desire to observe more.
The next was a young couple, perhaps newly married, holding hands, in black jeans and black T-Shirts on which was written in white WE ARE ONE'. I hope their wish remains, the whole life through.
Trailing behind them was a young father, walking his toddler of about five years. When they passed me, I saw the toddlers T-Shirt had this message DADAS FUTURE HOPE'. I too hope this child will live up to the expectations of the father.
Behind them were two Muslim ladies, fully covered from head to foot in black purdah, with only a slit to see. What a pity, I thought. God made females of the human race beautiful, for us men to enjoy. How cruel to defy Gods wish, I thought. Behind them came an old Gent, in a yellow T-Shirt, in which was written in green large letters NEVER SAY DIE'
The best, for the day, was, not so old lady, who was wearing sun glasses and a light blue T-Shirt. On the back were a sketch drawn, a ship sinking and the lettering SHIP WRECK. I leave the readers to their own conclusions as to whether her life has ended in a wreck. The sun was now almost dipping over the trees in the Bird Sanctuary, which reminded me of a poem I learnt in school long years back ELEGY WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD by Thomas Gray and here is the first verse.
Curfew tolls the knell of parting day
The lowing herd winds slowly over the lee
The ploughman homewards plods his weary way
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Similarly, it was time for me to plod, not my Weary way but a bouncing heart of happiness of the few hours spent at this enchanting spot, hoping to come back the next weekend.

Contempt of Court action against Dr. Padeniya fixed for inquiry
The Contempt of Court case, filed against Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement delivered regarding the SAITM issue, was yesterday fixed for inquiry by the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara fixed the matter for inquiry on June 5.
On December 6 last year, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the prelimina raised by Dr. Padeniya.
The Court of Appeal yesterday observed that there are sufficient materials to issue a rule against Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya in respect of a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
President's Counsel Gamini Marapana, through a motion, sought a further date for inquiry.
On a previous occasion, a charge sheet was served on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer had informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
The Court of Appeal had also issued an Interim Order (IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this Contempt of Court action.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this Contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgement by the Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgement demanding the annulment or setting aside of the said judgement.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop, the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against the SAITM following the Courts decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017, the GMOA had organised island-wide trade union action against the SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish the SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under the topic Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. Counsel Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the respondent.

Dalmatian themed museum
Dalmatian-mad dog mum has transformed her home into a museum inspired by her first ever puppy.
23-year-old Amanda Renae has spent more than $1,000 on creating the pup-themed pad. She bought little Cloud 18 months ago and claims she managed to dedicated her room to the tiny dog in just a day.
Amanda, from Michigan, US, said: What started as a small idea quickly, within 24 hours, turned into the home of my dreams.
At first, it was a little collection but quickly turned into the idea of doing my whole room based around him. When I first showed him my room he was so excited. Since I bought him, Ive spent around $1,000 (736) on decorating my home. The paint to do my room fully was already close to $200 (147). My bed sheets are all Dalmatian themed, my walls are spotted and every shelf in my bedroom has something Dalmatian-related on it. Ive also gotten things around the house like towels and decorations. The public areas of my house have Dalmatian things scattered throughout but nothing compared to my bedroom. Cloud growls and barks when he sees my life-sized Dalmatian stuffed animal though. He thinks its another dog so I actually have to put it away when he comes in my bedroom. I decided to decorate my room because I fell in love with my little man and think Dalmatians are absolutely beautiful. I love my house and bedroom, it gives me a sense of comfort.
As well as decorating her room in spots, stay-at-home dog mum even took the permanent step of having a tattoo of her poochs spotty markings on her arm to immortalise her love for him.
Amanda said, With my tattoo I wanted something unique, I didnt want the typical paw print that so many people have. The tattoo artist actually said theyve never done anything similar before. Hed never done anything that even looked like fur but handled it like a champ. Cloud has sniffed my tattoo in the past as if he knows its something related to him but Im not sure how much dogs actually understand. Amanda says she first started dedicating her life to her dog after being diagnosed with Crohns disease. She adds that while Cloud was an in the moment decision, she cant imagine life without him now. She said, Cloud is your stereotypical, insane puppy. His energy level is far higher than any other pup Ive ever met. Ive actually had cats in the past but nothing compared to the endless love of a dog. He loves going for walks and playing at the dog park with his other four-legged friends. Hes extremely social and overall a good dog. Hes the first dog Ive ever owned myself and hes like my child. Ive always been in love with the breed and the black on white fur since I was a child, which is funny because growing up I never really liked the 101 Dalmatians movie. But Cloud was an in-the-moment decision. One night I was browsing Dalmatians in nearby states then drove eight hours to get him when the weekend came. I knew when I met him and took him home that he was going to be a huge part of my life. In just his short year-and-a-half of life hes changed my life forever. Despite still living at home, Amanda claims her parents dont mind her eye for canine-themed dcor. Knowing her love for Cloud and his breed, her friends also encourage her adorable Dalmatian museum. Amanda said, I still live at home with my parents and they dont mind me starting to turn their house into a Dalmatian museum. They love Cloud as if he is their grandchild. My friends and family love it, theyve never seen anything like it before. They call it unique and adorable. When I get my own house Ill allow Cloud to have his Dalmatian-themed bedroom with a fake fire hydrant, painted wall and a little house-shaped as the fire department  I want it all.

Discover a snorkelling haven
Trinco Blu by Cinnamon is the perfect getaway for guests seeking to indulge in the unmatched serenity of some of the most beautiful beaches of the eastern coast of Sri Lanka.
If you are seeking a little bit of sea-side adventure booking your holiday at Trinco Blu will not lead to disappointment, as it offers you with a complete package of adventure-based activities including catch and release fishing, whale and dolphin watching (marine mammal safari), snorkelling in the sea surrounding the Pigeon Island in Trincomalee, rediscovering Trinco by visiting some iconic places in the city such as the natural hot springs, the Commonwealth War Cemetery, Harbour Mouth, a fish market, Fort Frederick, Koneswaram Temple, Lovers Leap and Swami Rock, by land or by taking a boat ride.
Pigeon Island, a scenic isle situated in the eastern coast of Sri Lanka, has become an increasingly popular snorkelling site, since the end of the civil war in 2009. The sea surrounding the Pigeon Island is indeed a snorkelers paradise, with live coral reefs inhabited with over 100 species of corals. This splendid marine ecosystem is also home to several exotic marine animals, including over 300 species of coral reef fish anda variety of sea turtles.
The Cinnamon Nature Trails (CNT) team at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon has conducted responsible snorkelling and sea-side tours around the sea of Pigeon Island, since 2009. Pigeon Island is situated around 13 km away from Trinco Blu by Cinnamon and during this exciting three-hour excursion, you have the opportunity to snorkel to your hearts content with shoals of colourful fish to keep you company. You will also get the chance to observe species such as the juvenile and adult black tip reef shark and a variety of turtles such as the Hawksbill Turtle, Green Turtle and the Olive Ridley Turtle. It is recommended that the best time for snorkelling enthusiasts to experience this magnificence is from March to September.
However, due to damages caused by the civil war and the increased number of visitors over the years, these pristine coralreefs have been subjected to damage unintentionally, by tourists and snorkelers alike. Immediately after identifying this risk, the CNT team at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon, along with staff of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, based in Pigeon Island, began deploying a series of buoys, completely circling the affected reef around Pigeon Island and safeguarding it from further harm.
Currently over hundreds of tourists who arrive at Pigeon Island are informed of the areas in which snorkelling is permitted and restricted and the project embarked by CNT and the Department of Wildlife Conservation has been extremely effective in protecting the sensitive habitat of the coral reefs around this beautiful island.

Doctors in quandary over WHT
Private medical doctors are to face a huge shock to the system with the latest deduction of withholding tax (WHT) announced by the Department of Inland Revenue.
The Department yesterday announced that the government introduced a withholding tax of 5% on payment for any service provided in the capacity of independent service providers such as doctors, engineers, accountants, lawyers, software developers, researchers, academics or any other similar service. It specifically said that payment for any type of vocational services provided as an independent service provider is subject to this tax.
A senior executive of a leading hospital speaking to the Daily News said that the worst hit from this new tax law would be the doctors (consultants) working in private hospitals. As previously the onus of declaring the amounts earned was strictly on these professionals themselves, however, now with 5% going in directly from the respective accounts departments of hospitals will give a clear idea of how much these doctors earn and if they have not been declaring the right numbers in the past to the Department of Inland Revenue, there is a sudden jump in their earnings recorded, this will cause some serious problems for them.
This move is designed to bring a large part of the population who are not currently under the tax net under the purview of the Department of Inland Revenue. Senior Chartered Accountant, N.R Gajendran from Gajma and Company, said that this would be leveling the playing field. However, the withholding agent in the scenario of the new law, is being trusted without trusting the taxpayer. So the withholding agent has to remit these taxes to the department. In the past we had this withholding agency situation and why they removed it is because the withholding agents were not remitting the money to the Department. One of the biggest defaulters was the government institutions because they had cash flow problems.
M. G. Somachandra, Deputy Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department, Withholding Tax (WHT) section, speaking to the Daily News said that a large number of doctors working in private hospitals are not in the tax net and in the future the Administrative Officers of the Private Hospitals have to remit 5% of the doctors income to the Inland Revenue Department. They expect through this system to include every individual that is due to pay taxes.
The Government directive says that the WHT should be deducted on the cases where the payee is a resident individual and the payer would be any person such as an individual, a partnership, a company, a trust, a body of persons corporate or unincorporated, an executor, a non-governmental organization, a charitable institution, unincorporated association, a friendly society, a building society, a pension fund, a provident fund, a retirement fund, a superannuation fund or similar fund or society, a public corporation, a board or authority; but excludes Sri Lanka Government.
Deputy Commissioner General, M.G Somachandra says that any payment over Rs. 50,000 per month will have to have this withholding tax deduction and the amount remitted to the department. If the taxed individual can prove that his/her annual income was less than half a million then he/she would get a rebate.
The way these new laws are framed it will increase revenue to the government coffers. Gajendran says that this tax will definitely increase government revenue because it will be easier to trace and track; and there will be transparency of the earnings of the individual taxpayer going to the Department.
Somachandra says that they believe it will take two or three months for this system to be implemented as he initially sees some teething problems due to the registration of taxpayers and obtaining of TIN number, etc. but he says that within about three months it will settle down.

The Groups revenue reached AED 102.4 billion (US$ 27.9.billion), an increase of 8% over last years results, and the Groups cash balance increased by 33% to AED 25.4 billion (US$ 6.9 billion) supported by the bond issued in March and strong sales due to the early Easter holidays at the end of March.
In line with the overall profit, the Group declared a dividend of AED 2.0 billion (US$ 545 million) to the Investment Corporation of Dubai.
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group, said, Business conditions in 2017-18, while improved, remained tough. We saw ongoing political instability, currency volatility and devaluations in Africa, rising oil prices which drove our costs up, and downward pressure on margins from relentless competition. On the positive side, we benefitted from a healthy recovery in the global air cargo industry, as well as the relative strengthening of key currencies against the US dollar.
Weve always responded to the challenges of each business cycle with agility, while never losing sight of the future, and this year was no exception.

An epoch meeting between Dr. Mahathir and President Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirisena in his last official visit to Malaysia had an epoch meeting with Prime Minister elect Dr. Mahathir Mohamad who has been sworn as the worlds oldest elected leader.
President Sirisena in his last official visit to Malaysia insisted on meeting with Dr. Mohamad despite diplomatic obstacles then.
Mohamad under whose rule Malaysia experienced a period of rapid modernisation and economic growth, responded immediately to President Sirisenas request and met him for a discussion which lasted several hours.
The 92-year-old former leader Mahathir Mohamad won a fiercely contested general election, ending the 60-year rule of the Malay-dominated National Front yesterday.
President Sirisena during his last visit is said to have personally called the former Malaysian leader and had expressed his desire to meet him while also describing the diplomatic obstacles which stood in between.
Following the Presidents call on Dr. Mohamad who was in the opposition at that time, had immediately arrived at the hotel which President Sirisena was in and had a meeting which lasted for several hours.
When the former Malaysian leader had asked President Sirisena about the issues facing his country, the latter had replied that foreign debt is a major issue.
Mohamad had promptly replied It is you who has to get out of this debt trap. If you take more loans you will be further burdened with this issue. When our country was faced with the same issue during my rule, financial institutions came to me and offered more loans at a concessionary interest rates. But I did not agree to their terms. I tried to develop the economy using the countrys resources and our own development plans.Ultimately these paid dividends. If you look at our history, you will see how successful this was.
The two leaders had spent several hours getting to know each other, forging a strong personal bond.

EU provides Rs. 810 mn in technical assistance
The European Union has launched a Rs. 810 million project to support the modernization of Sri Lankas agriculture sector.
The project Support to the modernisation of the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka, will be implemented by Ecorys.
The technical assistance team will assist the Government in making the agriculture sector more productive, diversified, climate-resilient, market-oriented and equitable through facilitating an agricultural sector reform process.
The programme will support the development of an overarching agriculture policy where issues such as gender, climate change, nutrition and youth will be integrated.
In addition, it will promote the diversification of high-value agricultural production, including a focus on improved export earnings. Climate change and identification of ways in which malnutrition can be eliminated will also be an integral part of the assistance provided.
A workshop held in the context of the project with participants from Government institutions, private sector, civil society and academia focused on a coordinating mechanism for the New Agriculture Policy (NAP), the impact of decentralisation and fragmentation of the agriculture sector.
The workshop concluded by agreeing on a common approach to the development of an overarching agricultural policy and its implementation strategy.
European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Tung-Lai Margue said, This programme has been designed with the needs of the small farmers in mind. Given the large number of institutions involved in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka, strengthening coordination and developing a joint policy are key to a successful transformation of the sector. We are pleased to partner with the Government of Sri Lanka, civil society and private sector in this regard, a partnership that will make a lasting difference in the lives of the people.
The grant, which is a part of the EUs wider programme in support of rural development in Sri Lanka, will benefit rural communities in the country. The programme is expected to be operational for three years (2018-2020).

Exclusion - an artistic resolution
An innovative artist automatically becomes a good marketer who makes his profession a lucrative one. Many artists do not explore deep into their innovative nature and end up as mere copycats.
Prasad Hettiarachi who brings his art exhibition Exclusion to fore in May 2018 naturally is inclined for innovation. His philosophy is in perfect harmony with people in urbanized areas who struggle to fathom with the fast-track development process taking place in the country in the post-war era.
With his characteristic detailed drawing, Prasad illustrates the unequal effect development has on different parts of society and how uneven development leaves groups of people feeling excluded from society.
Born in 1975, Prasad previously lived and worked in the highly urban atmosphere of Rajagiriya in Colombo before moving to Bentota in early 2018.
Since the early 2000 Prasad has played a role as an artist in an active leftist political party in Sri Lanka, doing calligraphy, posters, huge stage designs while working as a freelance artist. His stint in advertising sphere has endowed him with technical know-how on graphic arts.
I do not possess a formal certificate in visual art but my instincts and inborn ability made me an artist. Years of experience with veterans in the advertising field gave me insights on technical aspects of various genres of art. My first exhibition, An unbelievable Taste had the theme of Saaravita venders who are sidelined by the community. I am very sensitive towards down-trodden people in the society and their grievances, commented Prasad.
When asked why his paintings have greater backgrounds in white, Prasad replied, I keep huge white backgrounds in all my paintings for the viewers to fill them with their thoughts. There are no borders for my creations and I want the viewer to engage in creating the big picture. This big picture may differ from person to person. But everyone who sees these paintings will take home some constructive and philosophical thoughts with them.
People losing social and environmental relationships they had due to so-called development and eventually creating a dreadful void for them are depicted by Prasads art exhibition, Exclusion.
Prasad has won numerous awards and participated in art workshops, poster competitions and projects since the early 90s.
One of his works was selected for the 1994 art exhibition in France at the UNESCO Center organized by the Sri Lanka Cultural, Social and Educational Association of France.
In 2005 he won the Sri Lanka Export Design Silver award, organized by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board and the Ministry of Advanced Technology and National Enterprise Development.
Prasad has exhibited previously at the Theertha Red Dot Gallery, Theertha International Artists Collective. Exclusion is his second solo event at the Barefoot Gallery, following his first, An unbelievable Taste in 2015 at the same venue.
Exclusion will run for enthusiastic art lovers from May 10 to June 3 at the Barefoot Gallery which is open from 10am to 7pm on Monday to Saturday and 11am to 6pm on Sunday.

Fuel prices increased
Fuel prices have been increased with effect from midnight yesterday. Accordingly, a litre of 92 Octane Petrol has been increased from Rs.117 to Rs.137, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
A litre of 95 Octane Petrol has been increased to Rs.148 from Rs.128. A litre of Auto Diesel has been increased to Rs.109 from Rs.95 while Super Diesel was increased to Rs.119 from Rs.110, the Minister said.
The price of a litre of Kerosene was also revised to Rs.101 from Rs.44 resulting in a Rs.57 increase. However, Minister Senaratne said the reason for the price increase was a result of some drivers mixing kerosene with petrol. The minister further said that the prices would be the same for the fishing community.
The fishing community will be issued coupons like on previous occasions to provide the same price for Kerosene before the revision, the minister stated.
The LIOC has also increased fuel prices from yesterday.

Fuel prices will be reviewed every two months - Mangala
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the prices of fuel would be reviewed every two months and the prices would be changed accordingly.
The Minister addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry of Finance said that the retail fuel price formula was changed as a result of fluctuations in global prices and the prices will be reviewed every two months using Platts Singapore benchmark prices.
The prices would increase or decrease according to global prices. If the price goes down it will be reflected in the formula. The fuel price is scheduled to go down by early quarter of next year.Accordingly the prices would come down, he said.
Cabinet approved the new fuel price formula and the government decided to implement it from midnight yesterday. The prices of 92 Octane Petrol was raised from Rs.117 a litre to Rs.137, 95 Octane Petrol from Rs.128 to Rs.148 , Auto diesel from Rs.109 a litre to Rs.119, super diesel from Rs.110 to Rs.119 and Kerosene from Rs 44 to Rs 101.
Minister Samaraweera said that the fuel prices in Sri Lanka are among the lowest in South Asia and added that the price of 92 Octane petrol in Nepal is Sri Lankan Rs 149 a litre, Bangladesh Rs. 159 and India Rs. 169.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the total taxes levied per litre of petrol, State Minister for Finance Eran Wickremaratne said that the tax is around Rs 58.8 per litre of petrol but excise, import duties and port levied included.
However, beneficiaries of the Samurdhi income support scheme and fishermen would be given a concession and they would receive kerosene at a price of Rs.44.
Minister Samaraweera said that eventhough the government has increased fuel prices, it was still among the lowest compared to the prices during the previous regime and the present government reduced the prices when there was a crisis in the global fuel formula.
The former government failed to revise the price formula in keeping with global prices. When the price of one barrel of petrol was USD 49, the price of one litre of petrol in Sri Lanka was Rs 157, he said.
The Minister noted that the government needs to focus on rapid development of infrastructure, health and education and cannot continue to bear losses by retailing fuel below the cost.
Minister Samaraweera said the change in the price formula will also help to curb corruption related to mixing of kerosene with other fuels and the statistics have shown that diesel vehicle owners use kerosene instead.
He further said that the Treasury will be able to save Rs.55.89 billion and the government has decided to use it for rapid development projects,such as the Gamperaliya project focused on village development which is to commence in August this year.
The country will witness rapid development in the coming 18 months, the Minister said.
In the meantime, he said the government has decided to remove all taxes on bank savings accounts for children who are under 18 years of age and authors royalty fee from publishers below the amount of Rs.50,000 per month or Rs.500,00 per year will be exempted from taxes.
Minister Samaraweera in response to a question by a journalist whether the price formula was in line with the request made by the International Monetary Fund that a fuel price formula was necessary to balance losses at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, he said that the price formula was important for the country, no matter who says it.
A good proposal is a good proposal whether it comes from heaven or hell, he said.
When asked whether this price formula would make CPC profitable, Minister Samaraweera said the restructuring of the CPC is vital to make it profitable not just the price formula.
Minister Wickremaratne said that all these years, the government decided on the fuel prices and the consumers hardly reaped the benefits even when global fuel prices were down.
Now, when global fuel prices go down people also will get fuel at a lower rate, he said.

Gem, Jewellery stakeholders confident  of US$ 3 bn revenue
The gem and jewellery industry stakeholders said that they were confident that they can turnaround the industry to a US$ 3 billion revenue generator in three years time, said Chairman, Lanka Gem Dealers and Miners Association, Ratnapura Punsiri Tennakoon.
Export revenue from the industry last year was US$ 270 million.
Tennakoon said that the industry was faced with a major issue as they were harassed by the Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA).
We met President Maithripala Sirisena who is also the minister in charge of the sector and he has now removed both the Chairman and the Director General of the Gem and Jewellery Authority and we are thankful to him for taking this move.
He said during the former NGJA Chairmans time a Rs. 25, 000 tax was imposed on each consignment of gems weighing 100 karats and today they have managed to bring it down to 0.5% of the value.
In addition the former Chairman also stopped the sponsorship of Rs. 10 million from the NGJA given for the FACTS exhibition and we are confident that the new Chairman Peshala Jayaratne will offer it again. This amount is collected from the industry CESS fund which totals up to around Rs. 150 million each year.
Also the gem dealer licence from Rs. 35, 000 was increased to nearly Rs. 300, 000 and there were so many other issues which resulted in a drop in revenue. This has been corrected. He also said that they were also forced take a certificate from the Gem Authority for each export and this was also practically difficult. These issues have now been ironed out thanks to the Presidents intervention, said Secretary Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association, Sherif Rahumn.
The Gem and Jewellery industry had a tax exemption on direct exports and foreign currency sales since 1979. We are requesting for this exemption once again and the removal of red tape to move the industry to the next level.
Due to negative tax effects supplies from overseas are falling significantly and our exporters find it difficult to secure necessary supplies to do their businesses, he said. (SS)

OMP Operationalisation:
A glimpse of hope on a tortuous road
As defined in the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) Act, a missing person is someone whose fate or whereabouts are reasonably believed to be unknown or unaccounted for. But for many of our people today, the definition of a missing person is something more personal, perplexing and painful. For them, family now means an empty chair at a table, clothes hanging on a rack that have not been worn in years, an embrace that is forgotten because no one thought it would be the last, hurt deep in the heart that would never be diminished with the passage of time and a vacuum that could never be filled. A missing person is a loved one to whom a goodbye was never said and the endless stream of questions that follow their absence: How did they go missing Where are they today Will I get the chance to see them again
Search for the missing
Decades later, it is not fair that they must still suffer the plight of not knowing. It cannot be easy to turn away from their pain.
The search for the missing began nearly 30 years ago. The first commission investigating missing persons was set up as far back as 1991, but the story of the missing thus far, has not been one of hope or reassurance. It is a story marred with helplessness, unkept promises and an endless road on which they stumble along. Individuals went missing in the 1970's, during the political insurrections that took place in the South.
Young lives were dispelled with no one to account for their absence, but this was not the end; thirty years of civil war held in its grasp, the lives of many, marking no difference between race, cast or creed. Families in the North and East whose children were taken from their homeswho were split apart by terrorismand soldiers who never made it back to their camps and loved ones; these are few of the thousands who are missing today. They the are lives unaccounted for, that need accounting.
Over the years, efforts had been made to address the issue of the missing. Multiple commissions were set up in 1991, 1994 and 2013 to conduct investigations into missing persons. However, those commissions did not follow through to completion. One primary challenge was that investigations were limited to certain time periods and did not address all contexts during which individuals went missing.
Dearth of data
The lack of proper data and information led to incomplete and inaccurate statistics. Investigations were ineffective and inconclusive and therefore, many cases were left pending. According to a report made by the ICRC, there were as many as 16,000 cases of missing persons remaining as recently as 2016. Seven years after the end of the civil war, Sri Lanka had not yet successfully addressed this primary and pressing issue of its people.
It was essential, after all those years, to find a remedy for the problem and a preventive for its re-occurrence in the future. The Act to establish the OMP was passed in parliament in 2016 and with a seven-member commission, it is ready to begin investigations into all reported cases of missing persons. This includes not only those missing in relation to the conflict that took place in the North and East Provinces, but also those missing during the political and civil unrest in the South, armed forces or police who are identified as missing in action and all enforced disappearances during and in the aftermath of the conflict. This is the chance for the OMP to address grievances made by those of all ethnic and religious backgrounds in all geographical areas of the country. Establishing this office is for the sole purpose of searching for the missing, which is a need of our nation.
Road to closure
The OMP is a transparent and independent body; it would not conduct any prosecutions. The OMP's main purpose is to bring relief to affected families who are suffering the loss of loved ones. What matters is that these families, be it from the North or South, receive the opportunity to search for the truth about what happened, receive answers to their questions and hopefully, find relief from years of pain and uncertainty.
The office had been set up based on recommendations made by the Consultation Task Force on the Act to establish the OMP. This task force proactively engaged with the victims and affected families around the island, collecting feedback and concerns regarding what can be done to redress this issue.
It is their views and worries that matter. Without paying heed to their concerns, the OMP cannot address their grievances. It had been a long and painful wait for the victims and their families. For parents who lost their children and for families who lost their loved ones, the Office on Missing Persons would be a beacon of hope.

Hambantota Hospital nurses protested against the probe to be conducted in connection with taking the Hambantota Nurses Training School principal to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the same hospital, after he was neglected at the Emergency Care Unit (ETU) of the hospital, following a heart attack.
The nurses protested for three hours against the investigation. Hambantota NTS Principal R. M. Ariyasena was admitted to the hospital at 6.00 pm after suffering from a heart attack. Nurses had then transferred him to the ICU at 6.50 pm from the ETU, without the required medical treatment. The ICU doctors had stated that the principal died due to the delay in administering him the required medical treatment at the ETU.
Hospital authorities had charged the nurses for carrying a dead body to the ICU. A doctor at the ETU had made the complaint against the nurses to the Health Services Director General. Nurses said the investigation was not on the doctor responsible for the death of the principal, but against those who tried to save his life at the last moment.

Inland Revenue Act aims to raise direct taxes to 40% - FM
The new Inland Revenue Act is aimed at increasing direct taxes to 40 percent and reducing indirect taxes to 60 percent. Earlier, the ordinary masses contributed to 82 percent of indirect taxes levied on goods bought for daily consumption. This was an outdated system which caused a heavy burden on the common masses, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the 17th AGM of the Inland Revenue Commissioners Association held yesterday.
Thanking the Association for inviting him to grace the occasion as the Chief Guest, Minister Samaraweera said the occasion would provide an opportunity for some interaction at a very important period in the annals of the Inland Revenue Department.
The Minister said this is a period of transition since it was a few weeks since the new Inland Revenue Act became operative. As such, they as a government were facing a series of challenges. However, he considered problems which cropped up as an indication of the success of their endeavour in reshaping the tax system.
If we were to succeed in this situation creative answers should be found to the practical issues that cropped up, Minister Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera said the entire responsibility in this taxation process devolved on the Inland Revenue Department. If they worked together by joining hands, they could achieve the expected targets and structural changes in a short time.
The Minister said the new Inland Revenue Act had brought in a clear strategy to obtain foreign investments to the country. An attractive strategy had been introduced to provide foreign investments to the Northern and Eastern Provinces which suffered most from the war.
Earlier, investments were brought arbitrarily according to the whims and fancies of individuals. But the new act had introduced provisions to obtain investment with necessary legal security.
Furthermore, excessive powers enjoyed by the Finance Minister regarding taxes have been given over to the Inland Revenue Department, he said.
This would provide a level playing field enabling the department to treat everyone in a fair and transparent manner. Now tax exemptions could not be granted to selected persons any more, he added.
The Minister said he expected the Inland Revenue Department to take this opportunity to perform a sterling service towards the countrys economy.
The Minister also thanked the Inland Revenue Department for carrying out a successful public awareness programme on the new Inland Revenue Act. If that programme helped to create positive attitudes among the and a social responsibility of citizens, it would help them achieve their objectives.
The Minister said Sri Lanka would become a high middle income level country from January 19, 2019. This necessitated the country to transact with the world under new laws and regulations and a systematic institutional framework.
The operation of the RAMIS system to which the department is connected and the VAT reimbursement to tourists on their departure would enable the country to achieve quick economic development, Minister Samaraweera said.
The new taxes would enable the government to become richer so that it would acquire strength to act in a decisive manner in times of natural disasters and cater to the health, education and other needs of the people, he said.
Secretary to the Treasury Dr.R.H.S. Samaratunge, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury S.R. Atygalle, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury Chandra Ekanayake, Additional Secretary R. Semasinghe and Commissioner of Inland Revenue Ivan Dissanayake were also present on the occasion.

Ireland set for Test debut after long audition
Dublin, Wednesday: When Ireland become the 11th nation to play Test cricket against Pakistan at Dublins Malahide ground on Friday it will be the culmination of a journey that started nearly three hundred years ago.
There are records of cricket being played in Ireland as early as 1731, with Dublins Phoenix Cricket Club -- still going -- founded in 1830.
But the sports reputation suffered from being seen as the creation of English colonisers, with native games such as Gaelic football and hurling holding sway.
Ireland first made the rest of the cricket world sit up and take notice when they skittled out the touring West Indies, reputed to have enjoyed some typically generous Irish hospitality, for just 25 on their way to a victory at Sion Mills in 1969. After competing in English county one-day competitions, Ireland eventually made it to the 2007 World Cup finals following three failed qualifying attempts.
Having tied with Zimbabwe in their opening fixture, Ireland turned up on St Patricks Day in Kingston, Jamaica, to see a green pitch for their match against Pakistan, and a sea of green in the crowd as thousands of Irish fans took over the Sabina Park ground.
Ireland won by three wickets but the joy in defeating Pakistan -- as well as Bangladesh -- in 2007 was as nothing compared to four years later when England were beaten in a World Cup match in Bangalore. Kevin OBriens stunning 50-ball century -- still the fastest-ever in a World Cup -- proved decisive as Ireland chased down Englands 327 for a memorable win.
Test status
It was then the idea of becoming a Test nation, a status the International Cricket Council granted Ireland and Afghanistan last year, took hold. From an Irish perspective, securing Test status was a way of stopping leading players following Eoin Morgan, now Englands one-day captain, from leaving to seek better opportunities over the Irish Sea.
That journey was also taken by Ed Joyce and Boyd Rankin, both of whom are now back in Irelands Test squad.
Concerns remain that the golden generation of Irish cricketers are ageing -- six of the 14-strong squad are well into their 30s -- and that there is a lack of depth behind them.
But that has not stopped television rights for the Test being sold to Sky Sports and RTE -- Irelands national state broadcaster -- for a reported 1.8 million euros ($2.1 million), a remarkable sum for Irish cricket, with Malahide on course for a 6,000 sell-out on Fridays first day.
Were prepared to take risks, Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom told the 42.ie website.
And the risk for us is huge because its an untested format. Weve never had Test cricket in Ireland before.
In a country like Ireland where the game at international level is still bedding down in the mainstream environment and a five-day game in a country where it probably rains more than others Thats a risk.
But you know what The game is thriving, more people are playing it, more people are getting interested in it so weve got to back ourselves.
The significance is not lost on Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed, who said it was a privilege to be a part of this historic Test match.
No side have won their first match at this level since Australia beat England in the inaugural Test in Melbourne in 1877 but that Ireland are playing Test cricket is a victory in itself.
It is a massive occasion for everyone involved in Irish cricket, said captain William Porterfield.
Youve got a lot of past players -- some of them are here with us, some arent, but we have to remember and recognise what they have done to get us to this stage because if it wasnt for them, and everything that they have done, we would not have been lucky enough to be taking the field, come Friday.

The Josephians under the leadership of Sameesha Verangana have a good record this year having won four out of five matches in the first round and losing only to Royal.
The Josephian front has been tremendously bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards who have carried out wave after wave attacks on their opponents this season together with their whole eight dominating the set pieces. They also have abundance of ball position through line outs, rucks and mauls spearheaded by crack number eight Tharindu de Alwis, third row forwards Dilshan Kelaniyagoda and John Ganegoda.
Along with their speedy three quarter line with the help of playmaker cum diminutive centre Gamunu Chethiya and winger K.D. Kavinda they are famous for their three quarter moves.
They also have a reliable place kicker in fly half Santhush Algama and his contribution in this match with his kicking boots will be vital for a Joes victory.
On the other hand Wesley after their loss to St. Peters Bambalapitiya (7-33) won their first match for the season beating D.S. Senanayake College Colombo (5-nil) and Zahira College (26-7) before losing narrowly to Isipathana College (17-22) in a very close game. They bounced back to defeat Dharmaraja College Kandy (23-15) last week.
Wesley are packed with some outstanding players in their ranks, such as their captain cum hardy number eight Dayan Sabar, Mursheed Doray, centre Sahan Hansaja, Dexter Goonethilake, Kavindana Perera and Theekshana Vithanage, all of whom are match winners. But they should get their act together if they are to pull off their fourth win for the season against the formidable Joes outfit. This year the Wesley team will be under head coach - veteran Samoan Paul Toiya.
If they play to their potential with play makers Murshid Doray together with their speedy centre Sahan Hansaja and their entire three quarter line they can create a shock victory today.

The King of Painters at Kingsand
`Kingsand and Cawsand (hidden but well known)
Before my arrival villages were homes
To two little cottages, the occupants of each
Used to hang their laundry right on the beach
In the early eighteen hundreds when smuggling was rife
Anstuff got plundered an men got life (in Australia)
Clock Tower ESQ  The Story Of The Institute and Me
 By Jacquie Monty
The shrill wind wrapped around my head, swirling like a whirling dervish, grabbing everything it touched with its stormy fingers, including me and a couple of other hardy walkers on a circuit around Cornwalls pretty pastel coloured twin villages of Kingsand and Cawsand. Colourful fishing trawlers that could easily be mistaken for 18th century wreckers boats, were being thrown in all directions in the howling gale out to sea.
I was glad to retreat into the aptly named Storm Cottage, a stunning aquamarine blue haven, which comes complete with a sunken bathroom in the basement and boat portholes looking out to sea, with waves that swirl over the rocky escarpment below.
I sink my weary bones into the rollmop bath filled with sweet smelling essence of Waterlilies, Orchids and Sweet Grass. Here, I soak up the sound of the sea while reading one of Storm Cottages books of amazing memoires about the area, As it twas.
Luckily, unlike the scene in this charming book written by one of Kingsands late creative residents, this spacious and homely abode has all the mod cons. You no longer have to beat and wash your laundry out on the rocks below, theres a new washer dryer in the laundry room for that task.
The house is distinctly relaxed with Cornish twist - there are drift wood sculptures, Cath Kidston lighthouse cushions and pictures that instruct you: This House Runs on Cornish Time, with an arrow sign below directing you straight to the beach.
Its built over four floors, with three charming bedrooms, two of which have spectacular sea views of Plymouth Sound, and three bathrooms, all with a simple, dreamy New England feel. There's parking for three cars in the yard next to the sea - extremely rare in a village this higgledy piggledy.
And whatever the weather, Storm Cottage's thick walls and excellent central heating means you wont have to go out looking for logs - or even food if you arrive in late - as theres a cupboard full of emergency supplies.
History and the sea pervade every corner of this very special spot. The colourful Cornish bay, famously where Napoleon was held captive on board the HMS Bellerophon in Cawsand Bay before being shipped off to St. Helena, provides spectacular Turner-like views from the open plan lounge. But even from the stylish kitchen, where you can make a cup of Cornish Smugglers Brew to warm yourself up on arrival, you can watch the hands turn on the iconic historic four-faced Kingsand Clock Tower, erected to commemorate the coronation of King George V.
Daily life passes each side of the cottage. On the seaward side you can watch yachts, ferries, warships and submarines pass by - as well as the odd dolphin, seal and even a shark! On the land side you can watch village life unfold as you enjoy some alfresco dining on the sheltered sun deck balcony. A delightful sun trap on most summer days, this is a place you can read a book with the hypnotic sound of the sea behind you or enjoy people watching as they wander in and out of the Westcroft Art Gallery below - an excellent spot to buy something unique such as a glass azure blue blown bowl, which when held in the hands feels like water is pouring through it.
For centuries, all types of artists have tried to capture the beauty and magic of this ever-changing shoreline between the two villages that were once divided by the border between Cornwall and Devon. The book of Cornish Villages in Storm Cottages ground floor sea view bedroom tells you more about the areas time-locked villages, which are magical in their ever changing climatic mood from spectacular storms, with waves the height of the clock tower in 2014, to mist that makes the place vanish all together, and back again, even in winter months, to golden sun that breaths warmth like dragons fire across this enigmatic forgotten spot.
The ever changing light and timeless beauty of the villages are the reason Oscar nominated film director Mike Leigh picked it for making a film about the greatest British historic, narrative painter of all time  Englands most romantic landscape artist, Turner. A master of atmosphere and storytelling through his obsessive attention to light and colour, Turner famously captured the engineering beauty of the nearby Tamar Bridge, at Saltash, built by Islambard Kingdom Brunel.
You can see why Mike Leigh used most of the local villagers in his painterly film. One certainly feels, when out and about or having a drink or a meal at The Devonport pub, as if you are in the middle of a living film set, where half the actors got left behind. In some cases, their haircuts and demeanour are unchanged from the 19th century. The place is packed with character and characters, each one with amusing tales to tell. Like Steino, whose family came from Cologne in Germany to trade in leather at the old tannery in Plymouth, and has swapped a seafaring life for Poldark roles and Hollywood movie parts, as well as cooking delicacies like fish head soup and almond tofu.
I amuse myself by thinking that in 2020 people living in Kingsand and coming to see the Turner film locations will be able to use the Turner twenty pound note, due to a landslide vote by the general public to have him on a English monetary note. Turners self portrait has been selected to print on it, along with one of Turners most important artistic works, The Fighting Temeraire. Emblazoned it will also be a quote from the artist, light is therefore colour, as well as his signature - and nowhere is light more colourful and different than here.
As I travelled further, it felt more like I was in the Mediterranean. I admired creative door knockers with mermaids and anchors on, hand painted signage and incredible five-hundred-year-old rampart walls - in many ways it felt more like a Spanish walled city than a Cornish coastal town.
Each thickly walled house is different and has a story to tell. With a vast range of quirks, crags, twists, steps, curves and narrow passages winding their way past, some are made from the pink local Cornish rock - once traded with the Roman Empire - and others are built from stones and rubble thickly plastered over and painted with pretty, historic colours. The villages nestle into the coast of Rame, a peninsula that is isolated due to its geography. It is bounded by the English Channel, Plymouth Sound, the River Tamar and the River Lynher, which means that, having crossed the Tamar Bridge, you have to double back on yourself to reach this forgotten corner.
The area is steeped in military history. With epic vantage points from Penlee Point across the channel to France and beyond, its no wonder Rame has always been a strategic defence location. The area is dotted with interesting remnants of Napoleonic fort battlements - Maker Barracks is thought to be one of the oldest of its kind in the UK - as well as World War 2 pill boxes for guarding against enemy attacks. Across The Sound on the Devon side you can just spot some Gladstone Follies fake forts built to frighten the Spanish away.
The house is reflective of the owners passion for Cornwall with loads of books to read with amazing things to do in the area, fascinating pieces of art on the walls and telescopes so you can watch the stars. You can also take part in the many exciting village events like the yearly May Day carnival of banishing winter and welcoming in summer known as The Black Prince Flower Boat Festival.

LG polls: Decline in votes, a warning sign for government
The decline in votes for the Good Governance Government during the recent Local Government (LG) elections, was a warning sign from the people of the country, Anuradhapura District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Ishak Rahuman said.
"Voters had given a warning signal to the UNP as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the last election. If we fail to learn a lesson from that, they will send us home at the next election," MP Rahuman added.
He was addressing a meeting to mark the inauguration of the rehabilitation work on the Katukeliyawa Muslim Primary School playground, yesterday.
Rahuman said people voted the Yahapalanaya Government into power with faith and expectations. The President, Prime Minister and other ministers and parliamentarians alleged that some of their own party members were preventing them from performing a service to the people. Sixteen members who resorted to that tactic had now, left the government.
Rahuman said he would make one request from President Maithripala Sirisena: to develop schools and roads in the Anuradhapura district with equal emphasis as he gave the Polonnaruwa district, since he was considered the undisputed leader of Rajarata.
He said the government had another two years to complete its tenure; We could march forward and win the next election too, if we act fast to fulfil the election pledges held out to the people during the balance term.

A lift to our ex-servicemen
State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene has launched a self-employment project on behalf of retired security forces and police personnel, mainly concentrating on agricultural pursuits, it was reported in a Sinhala Daily. The State Minister hoped, by this endeavour, to provide an additional income to the retired members of the forces and police while also boosting agriculture. Speaking at an event in this connection, State Minister Wijewardene said this self-employment project will bring substantial financial benefits to the retired members of the security forces and the police and those on the verge of retirement too were eligible to be included in the exercise.
The project, which has already got underway has seen some 300 forces and police retirees undergoing special training in the agriculture centres in Peradeniya, Matale and Angunakolapelessa, and, indeed, has got into their full stride, producing export agriculture crops that is showing great potential for expansion. A special scheme has also being put in place to assist those involved with loan facilities through the state banks, to further develop and expand their ventures.
This brainchild of the state minister should be viewed in the context of the humiliation some of our servicemen were forced to endure not so long ago, selling vegetables and cleaning culverts and drains in a so called city beautification programme of the former Defence Secretary.
State Minister Wijewardene should be commended for coming up with such a concept to assist those members of the security forces and police who devoted the best years of their lives in the protection of the motherland. This will no doubt give those serving members of the tri-forces and police an added fillip to know that their services are being appreciated by the government by making it possible for them to receive an additional income to supplement their pensions. The scheme will also ensure that these valiant men and women would not be dependent on their offspring for sustenance after retirement, and, on the contrary, would be providers in their own right.
This novel scheme on behalf of the retired members of the security forces and police is also an appreciation that their services are being valued and rewarded by the state. They, no doubt, are placed in a special circumstances having put their lives on the line in the battle against a ruthless enemy and thus deserve all the support and generosity a state could shower on them. This initiative should, hopefully, silence those critics of the government who lament that our war heroes are being neglected and harassed by the government and their welfare overlooked and worse, subjected to witch-hunts.
The state minister, certainly, has come up with the ideal venture for the ex-servicemen and police in picking agriculture. Being once active in the battlefield they would hardly find their new occupation an exhausting task and, no doubt, would put in their heart and soul to their undertaking that would bring in rich harvests. What is more, being engaged in a fruitful occupation following retirement, this will also take their minds off the kind of criminal activity some of our retired forces personnel are being accused of that has gone onto bring a bad name on the military establishment as a whole. Be that as it may, commendable as State Minister Wijewardene's efforts are in uplifting the lives of our ex-servicemen, much more needs to be done to demonstrate the nation's unwavering gratitude towards these valiant men but for whose deeds the country's sovereignty would have been at peril. A majority of our retired servicemen were the sole breadwinners of their families even at the time of retirement and were dependent on their pensions to keep the home fires burning, in addition to caring for the needs of their offspring. Some of these soldiers are now in a feeble state physically and may not be up to the task of engaging in agricultural pursuits. Steps should be taken to look into their welfare in additional to what is done already by the Ranaviru Foundation.
Making amends
Former first son Namal Rajapaksa has demanded that action be taken against a train attendant who had harassed and abused a Tamil woman on the Colombo-Jaffna train, according to an English Daily. Namal's gesture, while commendable, also smacks of damage control, for rarely has one come across a Rajapaksa making common cause with a member of the Tamil minority. On the contrary, singing the National Anthem in Tamil was banned in Tamil schools and government offices in the North by his father and victory parades were the norm following the conclusion of the war, that made the Tamil community feel a conquered race. What is more, Rajapaksa senior shrugged off his defeat on January 8th to be owning to the Tigers (including the woman in the train) after the northern Tamils voted en-bloc for the Common Candidate, meaning that the Tamil community did not count in his equation.
Is this an attempt on the part of Rajapaksa junior to make amends, what with a Presidential Election looming, and, where the minority vote will be THE decisive factor

MAHATHIR IN SHOCK VICTORY
MALAYSIA: Mahathir Mohamad becomes the worlds oldest elected leader at 92, after a shock victory in Malaysias bitterly fought election.
The former PM came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on his one-time protg Najib Razak, beset by corruption allegations.
His historic win has ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957.
Jubilant Mahathir supporters filled the streets as the victory became clear.
Najib has said he will accept the verdict of the people, but correspondents say a smooth transition to power is not a given after such a major political upheaval.
No single party within the coalition won a majority, so technically it now rests with Malaysias King to decide who forms a government.
Yes, yes, I am still alive, Mr Mahathir told a news conference in the early hours of Thursday. He said his coalition would not seek revenge but would restore the rule of law.
He also announced - to cheers among his supporters - that there would be a two-day public holiday, adding: But there will be no holidays for the winners.
The official results showed the opposition Pakatan Harapan - the Alliance of Hope - secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats.
Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition.
I feel that with this change we probably can see something better in the future, Suva Selvan, a 48-year-old doctor, told AFP. Our hope for the future is a better government, fair, free and united.
Mahathir was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003.
Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. But he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents.
Most infamously his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was sacked and accused of corruption and sodomy - and later jailed on the latter charge - when he called for economic and political reforms.
Mahathir was also a mentor to Najib, who became prime minister in 2008.
But Mr Najib has been dogged by corruption allegations. He has been accused of pocketing some $700m from the 1Malaysian Development Berhad, a state investment fund he set up.
He has vehemently denied all allegations and been cleared by Malaysian authorities but the fund is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib has been accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their post.
Those allegations led to Mr Mahathirs surprise defection in 2016 from Barisan Nasional to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was embarrassed to be associated with a party that is seen as supporting corruption.
Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again.
But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. He promised he would arrange a pardon for Anwar, clearing the way for him to be re-elected and take the top job. - BBC

Mahathir sworn in as malaysias prime minister
Ninety-two-year-old Dr. Mahathir Mohamad was sworn in as Malaysian Prime Minister.
He became the worlds oldest elected leader after a stunning election win that swept Malaysias establishment from power after more than six decades. In a huge political upset, Mahathirs opposition alliance broke the grip on power of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had governed Malaysia uninterrupted since its birth as an independent country in 1957.
It capped a dramatic political comeback for Mahathir, who previously ruled the country with an iron fist for 22 years and came out of retirement to take on Prime Minister Najib Razak after the leader became embroiled in a massive corruption scandal.
In a ceremony at the national palace steeped in centuries-old Muslim Malay tradition, Mahathir was officially sworn in as prime minister by King Sultan Muhammad V.
Mahathir, dressed in traditional Malay dress, took the oath of office in a elaborately decorated room, with political allies and senior government officials in attendance.
I, Mahathir Mohamad, after being elected as prime minister, swear to carry out my task with all my ability, and that I will be loyal to Malaysia and preserve and defend the constitution, he said.
As he was sworn in, fireworks lit up in the night sky across Kuala Lumpur as people celebrated.
Earlier, Mahathir and his wife Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali were driven into the palace past hundreds of well-wishers waving flags and chanting the national anthem.
Mohamad Azlan Shah, a member of Mahathirs party in the crowd, said he was very proud.
Our struggle to change Malaysian politics is not wasted. We believe Mahathir can make a change, he told AFP. One of the most remarkable aspects of Mahathirs comeback has been his reconciliation with jailed opposition icon Anwar Ibrahim, his former nemesis. Their relationship has loomed large over the Malaysian political landscape for decades.
Anwar was Mahathirs heir-apparent until the premier sacked him in 1998 over political differences, and he was subsequently jailed on charges of sodomy and abuse of power.
Anwar was jailed again during Najibs rule but is due out in June -- and Mahathir has pledged to help him get a royal pardon, allowing him to run for political office again and potentially become Prime Minister.

Nations Trust Bank  1Q profits up by 30%
Nations Trust Bank closed the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 with a post-tax profit of Rs. 939 million, up by 30% over the corresponding period in the previous year with pre-tax profits increasing at a higher rate of 36%.
Post tax profit growth for the Group was lower owing to additional tax provided for the inter-company dividend payments which also resulted in the Bank posting a much higher operating income. Profitability growth was underpinned by a 7% growth in loans and advances during the period under review along with improving net interest margins.
Net interest income increased by 43% as Net Interest Margins (NIM) climbed up steadily due to a drop in cost of funds over the corresponding period coupled with improved portfolio yields.
Non fund based income including fees, commission and operating income increased by 16% for the period under review with trade and transnational fees contributing to a larger portion of the increase. Net trading losses for the year amounted to Rs 203 million which is reflective of the swap cost arising from an increased funding forex SWAP book (up by 30%) coupled with an increase in forward premiums (up by 50bps) as compared with the comparative period. The Bank continued to benefit from the relatively lower funding costs of the forex swaps compared to high cost rupee deposits. Marked to market losses on the FIS portfolio was minimal for the quarter under review.
Impairment charges recorded an increase of 169% due to the combined impact of portfolio growth coupled with some stress seen in selective portfolios as evidenced in the deterioration of the Group NPL ratio to 2.62% from 2.29% reported in December 2017 which also mirrored the trend seen in the industry. The Bank has put significant focus to strengthen the collection and recovery processes.
Expenses recorded a growth of 14% of which relatively higher increases are attributable to expenses relating to investments in technology and branding with moderate increases stemming from regulatory and volume related expenses. The Bank continued its focus on pursuing operational excellence and the drop in the cost: income ratio to 49% is evident of its transformational journey.

NDB records Rs 2.7 bn  PBT in 1Q 2018
The National Development Bank PLC (NDB) closed the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 on a high note with impressive growth in profitability and business volumes.
The 1Q performance was recorded in the aftermath of a highly successful financial year in 2017, where it was recognized as the Best Bank in Sri Lanka by the prestigious Global Banking and Finance Magazine of USA in 2018 for the excellent performance.
The Banks Gross income increased by 20% to Rs 11,943 million, reflecting the enhanced business volumes recorded during 1Q, 2018, compared to Q1 2017. Net Interest Income (NII) recorded an impressive growth of 44%to Rs 3,351 million. The NII was strengthened by the improvement in Net Interest Margin (NIM) to 3.5% from 3.0% in 2017 and the growth in business volumes.
The full suite of Banks lifestyle CASA products with innovative features, appropriate balance sheet funding, etc., enhanced the NIMs.
Net fee and commission income also increased at a satisfactory 28% to reach Rs 710 million for the quarter. Growth in the loan book, particularly in leasing and credit cards, and the accelerated penetration of the Banks mobile banking app were instrumental in generating enhanced fee based income.
NDB aggressively drove its credit card and digital banking propositions in the market, with attractive promotions in Q1 2018.
Net gains from trading and net gains from financial investments both grew in Q1 2018 over Q1 2017, benefiting from the movement in exchange rates and market interest rates. Accordingly, total operating income reached Rs 5,410 million, a growth of 44% over the comparative period.
The Chief Executive Officer of NDB Dimantha Seneviratne, commenting on the quarters performance said the results mark a sound beginning for the year and thanked all the stakeholders of the Bank for the support.
He mentioned that the Bank continues to be guided by its mid-term strategy and is meticulously pursuing the targets with the ultimate goal of becoming a systemically important bank by 2020.
He also made reference to NDBs latest feat in being recognized as the Best Bank in Sri Lanka for 2018 by the Global Finance Magazine of US and the triple awards received from the Global Banking & finance Magazine of UK for year 2018, for Best SME Bank Sri Lanka, Best Bank for Credit Cards Sri Lanka and Best Retail Banking Product - (Personal Loan Product - Dream Maker Loans) Sri Lanka.

No planned boycott of UNP May Day rally - Navin
Although there is much talk and discussion about Ministers and MPs who did not attend the UNP May Day rally, no one boycotted the rally according to a pre-arranged plan, Plantation Industries Minister and UNP National Organiser Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the media after attending the inaugural session of the International Rubber Seminar held in Colombo yesterday, Minister Dissanayake said an unexpected crowd attended the UNP May Day rally . This proved that the party was loved by its supporters. Minister Dissanayake said his brother Mayantha could not attend the rally as he was away in Canada. UNP Chairman Kabir Hashim was indisposed, Minister Malik Samarawickreme was away from Colombo. Their absence was due to unavoidable circumstances and not any planned thing. However, he was sad about Ravi Karunanayake's absence at the rally.
Minister Dissanayake said he was a person who learnt lessons from history. The UNP is a party based on a program of work and a vision. It did not depend on individual characters.
The UNP did not break up due to the resignation of Lalith and Gamini. It only suffered a temporary setback but regained its position later. The party forged ahead with people as a group. All office bearers in the party should work in unison like cogs in a wheel to strengthen the UNP and enable it to forge ahead triumphantly.

President dedicated to find solutionto ethnic problem: Samarasinghe
President Maithripala Sirisena who won back international accolades for Sri Lanka in 2015, is dedicated for a political solution to the ethnic problem in the country, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe also said that the present government protected the countrys war heroes who were under serious international pressure by 2015 and said that the government would continue doing so in the future as well.
We have a President who believes that our diversity is our strength, Minister Samaraweera said. President Sirisena believes that it is through protecting and nurturing this diversity only could we empower the reconciliation process of this country. We have a President who respect the diversity of this country.
Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that the Presidents policy statement highlighted that he wants to strengthen the provincial council system in providing a political solution to the ethnic problem in the country. This statement itself demonstrates that President Sirisena is committed to bring a lasting solution to the ethnic problem in this country. he added.
Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that the present government is working towards a comprehensive reconciliation process. The political solution should be one that is agreed upon, not only by the people of North and East, but also by the people of the South. We need sustainable peace. This political solution should also be within a unitary state. he said.
We now have people such as Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan. They are not extremists. They are people who accept and value the sovereignty of our country. We cannot abandon these people. We must work with them for sustainable peace, Minister Samarasinghe pointed out.
Minister Samarasinghe also pointed out that when President Sirisena took over the country, he faced the challenge of possible economic sanctions.
President Sirisena together with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, diplomatically dealt with the issue and promised to take rapid steps towards reconciliation. There is no use of delivering speeches at international summits. This government has done an immense contribution to strengthen the reconciliation process of the country, he further said.
Division will not benefit country norTamil speaking people: Sampanthan
Division of the country will not be beneficial to the country nor to the Tamil speaking people, said Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, appealing to the Tamil speaking people not to lend their support to any political movement that advocates the bifurcation of the country.
This was the position taken by the Federal Party in 1970 in its election manifesto that they were opposed to the bifurcation of the country and wanted the Tamil people to vote against any political movement that advocated the bifurcation of the country. Many people seem to think we are demanding a separation and we are responsible for the state in which the country is. It was after the election in 1970 and the enactment of the 1972 Constitution that there was a demand for a separate state. But ever since the Indo-Sri Lanka pact in 1987 and certain constitutional changes that came about with that agreement, all Tamil political parties in this country have been prepared to find an acceptable solution within the framework of a united undivided indivisible Sri Lanka. This has been our position at all elections in the past, almost three decades since 1988 at Provincial and Parliamentary elections, he noted.
Joining the Adjournment debate on the Presidents speech made in Parliament on May 8, at the ceremonial opening of the second session of the 8th Parliament, Sampanthan said the President had made a note of the North East issue as it was one of the most serious issues facing this country. He noted with regret however, that despite three constitutions over the past 60 years since Independence, the country has still not been able to adopt a constitution that enables all Sri Lankans to live in peace as a single nation.
He said since 1988, the process of making a new constitution has been a continuous process. The political, social and cultural rights of the Tamil speaking people of this country cannot be buried. Even today, we want a united and undivided country, but we wish to live as equal citizens assured of our dignity and justice. I dont think that could be denied to us, he said, adding that any government should have the courage to take decisions that are challenging.
Focus must be onimplementationof policies :Patali
Focus should be on implementation and productivity of government policies but not on how craftily they are worded, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Joining the Adjournment debate on President Maithripala Sirisenas policy statement, Minister Ranawaka observed that the execution and delivery of government policies are more important than the policies themselves.
This government has taken a number of steps to establish law and order in the country. It has also ensured social stability. However, there are a number of issues unsolved in the economic sector, due to disagreements between the main parties involved in the government.
The government had been focused on political manifestos more than it had on economic policies. It had created several problems to the government. In the backdrop of the results of the last Local Government Election, I have proposed a series of 47 policies highlighting important areas we should focus on in the next coming months, Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka also said that while countries such as Malaysia had achieved economic development through the adoption of scientific or democratic based governance approaches, Sri Lanka over the last 70 years, had adopted a method of governance based on short sighted political promises.
Over the last seventy or so years, most of our governments have adopted a governance approach merely to stay in or gain power. This promises based approach does not benefit the economy or the people of this country. Only approaches adopted by Sirimavo Bandaranaike and J.R. Jayewardene, poles apart they may be, were really focused on developing the economy of this country, Minister Ranawaka said.
The Minister pointed out that in the ex-regime Rs. 1 Trillion had been spent on highways. It is a 42% of the capital expenditure, whereas only a 6% was allocated to the Health sector and a mere 4% to the Education sector, he pointed out.
The World Bank has said that spending money on highways had only a minus rate of return. However, if we spend on education, health and social welfare, they would give a positive rate of return. Thus, this government has taken steps to focus on these three sectors when implementing government policies, he further said.
Govt. failed to rebuild country entrustedby peoples vote: Anura Kumara
The government has failed to rebuild the country which was entrusted to them by the vote of the people, having defeated the dictatorial and ruthless previous regime, said JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
Joining the Adjournment debate on the Governments Policy Statement, which was delivered by President Maithripala Sirisena at the opening of the second session of Parliament on May 8, Dissanayake said the past three years had been wasted by the government. He said this inactive period had forced the country further into crisis.
The Maithri-Ranil regime over the past three years, was the most unsuccessful and unproductive rule, the country had ever experienced. No other government had ever received such discontentment by the people in such a short period of rule. The President and Prime Minister have totally disregarded the mandate and expectations of the people and were merely embroiled in a power struggle. Even the President in his speech, accepted that there was an internal power struggle within the government.
There was a power struggle between the ministers of the Presidents party and the Prime Ministers party.
Dissanayake pointing to allegations levelled against former Minister S.B. Dissanayake, said that the Government MPs are now levelling these charges against him, only as he had left the government and were silent during the past three years. He said there are many within the government who are guilty of various offences, but no one within the government is pointing them out, but they would do so the day they step out of the government.
He charged that during the past three years, members of the government were engrossed in their own power struggle to outdo each other and had deliberately failed to uplift the countrys economy, preserve the rights of the people, rebuild the country, etc. But at the end of three years, the country is facing a dire crisis, as both parties within the government are engaged in this power struggle instead of being concerned with the plight of the country, he added.
He said the President nor his ministers had failed to notify Parliament as to the reasons that led to the proroguing of Parliament.
The internal crisis within the government is what led to the President taking the decision to prorogue Parliament. The power struggle of both parties of the government has led to the downfall of the government and led to this destructive political fate.
With just 23 members from a party that has around 95 members, how could this be termed a national government This cannot be a national government, but a government comprising of UNP members and a group of members from another party. Hence, the concept of a national government had also ended after these three years.
He noted that due to the governments failed economic policies, the rupee has crashed to unprecedented levels, making it difficult for an average family to afford a decent meal. The whole country is dependent on imports, while the export market had crashed, employment is an empty promise and the governments economic policies have proved to be worthless. The government has no proper economic policies to uplift the countrys economy.
The worst dilemma is the unparalleled rate of fraud and corruption. This government is unable to tackle these problems. The governments highest officer is the Presidents Secretary and he too is currently facing charges of corruption. Hence, how can the country be rid of corruption when officials at the highest positions are corrupt he questioned.
The JVP Leader said that the people had given their mandate to this government to break down the wall of corruption and fraud that was built by the previous regime, but instead, this government too had further strengthened and built up this wall even higher, destroying any atom of hope and faith that was placed in them by the people.
Hate speech, a criminal offence: Hakeem
Minister of City Planning and Water Supply and Leader of the Muslim Congress Rauff Hakeem, requested the government to recognize hate speech as a criminal offense and add it to the Penal Code.
Joining the Adjournment debate on the Presidents policy statement said, he said, The President said that the government is committed to protect the peoples freedom of speech. It should rightfully be done. But there is also the issue of hate speech. It was evident how hate speech ignited the recent communal clashes in Kandy and Ampara. Hence, we should not allow hate speech to spread in the country. Therefore, it should be recognized as a criminal offense and added to the Penal Code.
Hakeem noted that there were several salient points in the Presidents speech and it was also regrettable that he offered no solutions to address the issues facing the country.
According to Hakeem, the minorities needed a complete Constitutional change.
A steering committee was appointed to look into the matter and it had submitted its report. But there is no discussion that had been initiated on the findings and recommendations of this report.
We even cannot get a parliamentary debate to discuss it. It is sad that the President did not mention it in his policy statement and we are disappointed, he added.
He said that amendments to the constitution had been proposed by the JVP, but added that it is futile to make any more amendments to the Constitution and it was time for a new constitution altogether.
The President mentioned in his speech that 85% of civilians lands which was used by both the military and the government, had been released. But, that is not enough. These land belong to the people. These are their inherited and agricultural lands. We cannot agree with these lands being held any longer by the military and government ministries. These lands should be returned to the people, he added.
As a result of the recent communal clashes, the minorities have lost their faith in the countrys law and order, said Hakeem, adding that the people wish for a permanent solution to the national problem and they will not accept any temporary solution.
Dissolve Parliament: Dinesh
The only solution in addressing the prevailing anarchistic situation in the country is to dissolve Parliament and call for an election, said Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Joining the Adjournment debate on President Maithripala Sirisenas inauguration speech of the second sitting of the 8th Parliament, MP Gunawardena said that the President had failed to deliver a fruitful government policy statement at the inaugural sitting, as previously done by former presidents, when a new session of Parliament commences.
We expected that President Sirisena would do the same. But unfortunately, he failed to deliver a fruitful and innovative policy statement as was done by previous presidents, Gunawardena said.
The countrys economy has collapsed at the moment. As a result of the Central Bank scam (CBSL), the people have lost faith in the monetary system of the country. This government tries to please foreigners, but not its own citizens. National assets are being sold to foreigners and private companies.
The value of the rupee has crashed to unimaginable levels. There are many serious problems which need immediate solutions. But the President did not present any remedial measures to resolve these problems through his policy statement, added Gunawardena.
He pointed out that it was the President who is vested with the responsibility of steering the government. His policy statement provided guidelines for a government. But, we did not see anything to that effect from President Sirisenas policy statement. Since he failed to provide such guidelines, we have to believe that this government does not have any plans for the country, he said.
What the President implied in his statement is that this consensual government had no capacity to rule the country. He said that the two parties of this government do not have an ability to sustain a government together. By saying so, he indirectly accepted that the consensual government is nothing but a failure. The government had led the country towards anarchy. The country is at a virtual collapse and running bankrupt. I am sorry to use these exact words, but it is the truth, he added.
Commenting on the Provincial Council elections, Gunawardena said that the government is deliberately postponing Provincial Council Elections. Terms of the Eastern, Sabaragamuwa and North Central PCs had expired last year. But the elections for these PCs are yet to be held.
The government promised to hold these PC elections before the end of March this year, but neglected the promise. Terms of several other PCs will also expire in September. However, we do not see any plan on the part of the government to hold elections for these PCs, he said, adding that the only remedy to the current political crisis in the country is to dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections.
Opposition Leader failed to allocate time - TNA MP
TNA Vanni District MP Shivashakthi Anandan, raising a point of order yesterday, complained that Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan has continuously failed to allocate sufficient time for him to speak before Parliament.
MP Anandan complained that he was not given an opportunity to voice the grievances of people living in the Vanni district and held the Opposition Leader responsible for the situation. Calling Sampanthans act a treacherous one, MP Anandan pointed out that this was not the first time he was making a complain on the matter. MP Anandan said that he had become a part of the audience at Parliament, instead of becoming an active Parliamentarian.

China, Sri Lanka celebrate One Belt, One Road initiative:
Port City to create 83,000 jobs for Lankans
A high-level Chinese diplomat said on Thursday that the Colombo Port City was one of the most important projects in Chinas One Belt, One Road development scheme.
The Port City is a witness to the friendship between Sri Lanka and China, Hangzhou Vice Mayor Xie Shuangcheng said.
He was addressing a seminar on potential business partnerships between Sri Lanka and investors from Hangzhou, China, at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
We are all participants of the Belt and Road initiative, said Science, Technology, Research and Skills Development Minister Sarath Amunugama, referring to Chinas plan to link China with South, Southeast, and Eurasian countries by continuous sea and land routes.
Apart from the Port City, he said China and Sri Lankas joint venture at the Hambantota port was already showing results, with plans for a large export processing zone on the way.
It is a model based on what you have done in China, he said.
Although Hambantota is close to one of the worlds busiest sea lanes, few ships currently stop there to unload cargo or refuel, however, Minister Amunugama said that Sri Lankas free trade agreements with India, Pakistan, and Singapore, as well as its participation in the EUs GSP-plus initiative, made it an ideal location for investors looking to reach a variety of export markets.
Sri Lanka is at a strategic spot on the global map, he said. Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake proposed developing a twin cities programme between Colombo and Hangzhou. Hangzhou is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in China and is home to the tech giant Alibaba.
The new Port City will be nothing short of excellent, she said, opening up new opportunities in the retail, service, and hospitality sectors. Its developer, the China Communication Construction Company, had invested about US$ 1.4 billion and promised that it could create 83,000 new jobs.
We are a country that is on the up, Board of Investment Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe said,Our number one foreign investor is the PRC, China, he added.
He promised a streamlined BOI process for prospective investors, with a five-day window to respond to all proposals.
Sri Lanka is a small country of 22 million, but we have access to large markets, he said.

President opens housing complex with 437 units
President Maithripala Sirisena vested with the people 437 houses constructed under the Niwasak Wenuwata Jivitayak programme implemented by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry and the Urban Development Authority, at the Siyapath Sevana new housing scheme in Dematagoda, yesterday.
The housing project is implemented with the aim of providing better housing facilities to the underprivileged people in the city of Colombo.
The project was launched under the programme to settle over 50,000 families living in 1,500 dwellings under minimum facilities in the Colombo city, in apartment complexes with all facilities. The complex was constructed at a cost of Rs. 1,748 million.

These housing complexes will be constructed in the areas of Henamulla, Dematagoda, Angoda, Mattakkuliya, Maligawatta, Kolonnawa and Blue Mandel.
The new housing complex not only offers beneficiaries with a new house, but also opens to them a new life as community development programmes to uplift the livelihood of the people and to provide opportunities to develop skills on sports, education, health and leadership have also been facilitated.
The President, who opened the new housing complex by unveiling the commemoration plaque, later engaged in an observational tour of the complex.

Professionals want open debate  on FTA with Singapore
A group of seven professional bodies urged the government to present the FTA agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka to parliament for an open debate and get professionals engaged continuously in discussions with regard to other proposed trade agreements.
Representatives of the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA), Institution of Incorporated Engineers Sri Lanka (IIESL), Institute of Quantity Surveyors Sri Lanka (IQSSL), Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka (ITPSL), Institute of Landscape Architects and Institution of Surveys (ILAIS) told a press conference, concerns raised by professionals previously are yet to be taken into consideration.
The president of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA) Archt. D.H. Wijewardene said the professional bodies were not against the agreement, yet the manner in which the agreement has been formulated was a great concern.
He also stressed that its important that respective professional bodies should be consulted prior to entering such agreement. He also noted that, while Singapore is well developed to accommodate such trade agreement, Sri Lanka lacks the required advancement.
The President of Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka Engineer Prof. Niranjanie Ratnayake also expressed her concern regarding the same. She said there are several technical aspects to be considered in this agreement which the WTO abides by and that Singapore too has abided accordingly with significant professional input, but the same has not been applied in Sri Lanka. At the few discussions that took place between the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade ( MoDSIT) and the Professional Bodies, it was insisted that until and unless the domestic mechanisms are in place and the professional organizations are strengthened to face the challenges of ensuring prevention of low quality foreign professionals practicing here and taking up the jobs that should be filled by local professionals, and ensuring that new employment opportunities are created for the local professionals, FTAs liberalizing service sector should not be implemented.
The Professionals also insisted that a National Trade Policy must be published with input from the stakeholders and specific cases must be presented for bilateral trade agreements showcasing how they would benefit the country and its people.
They claimed in July 2016, assurances were given by the Minister in writing that the legal framework will be in place prior to signing any FTA but actions have been extremely slow while negotiations on FTAs has proceeded independently.
The few actions taken by the Government to have a trade policy, streamline the immigration laws, strengthen professional institutions etc. has been a very slow process and they are all at the initial stages. Establishment of a human capital authority to figure out human resources requirements which is a prime requirement did not see the light of the day.
Sri Lanka and Singapore signed the FTA on January 23 which is liberalizing key services sectors.
SLSFTA has come into force on May 1, 2018 after an exchange of letters between the two parties confirming that the necessary apparatuses are in place on both sides.

Piyal Silva President of Institute of Town Planners Sri Lanka, President of Sri Lanka Institute of Landscape Architects D Hettiarachchi and President of Institute of Incorporated Engineers Sri Lanka Eng. Kithsiri Kottage were also present at the event.

Registration process for international schools formalised
The Cabinet has approved formalising a registration process for international schools.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister and co-Cabinet spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said Cabinet granted approval to the proposal by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to commence the re-registration of international schools under the Companies Act, on the recommendations of the Education Ministry until a formal legal framework is developed.
Karunathilake said a Cabinet Sub Committee will study the establishment of legal provisions with respect to registration, accreditation, regulation, certification of quality and administration of international schools, teacher's training and making Sinhala, Tamil and Religion and History compulsory for Sri Lankan students in international schools and to grant their recommendation.
The minister said these measures have been taken since there is trend of mushrooming substandard international schools across the country without a proper registration process.

Royal wedding in Legoland
Planning a wedding can be tough, especially when youve got thousands of intricate things to think about. No, we dont mean wedding favours and bridesmaids dresses, but rather tiny Lego pieces  39,960 of them, to be exact.
Thats because folks at Legoland have just put the finishing touches together of their version of the royal wedding and it includes a brick version of Windsor Castle.
You can watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot and greet the crowd of revellers assembled outside the gates. And of course, Prince William, Kate Middleton, and the queen are all in attendance.
Some other special guests include the Spice Girls.
Model maker Lucy Gullon made sure every piece was in place for the brick wedding which took a team of eight model makers 592 hours to build. Wellwishers will be able to see the attraction in Legoland throughout the wedding celebrations. If youre in the area, you cant miss it, its pretty huge, and Harrys been given a ginger top head. Those with a keen memory might remember that there was a similar attraction set up when Kate and Wills tied the knot in 2011. Visitors were surrounded by Lego versions of guests including David and Victoria Beckham as well as mini corgis, photographers and guardsmen.
Harry and Meghan have been given the same care and attention to detail with their special day which includes flags of the union jack, large crowds and Princess Charlotte and Prince George. Meghans parents can also be seen standing proud behind the American actress. Metro

SLAAJ urges government to maintain import duty for two years
The Sri Lanka Automobile Association in Japan (SLAAJ) urged the government to maintain the countrys import duty at least for two years so as to stabilise the local vehicle market.
SLAAJ President Nishantha Meegalla told the Daily News that tax imposed on vehicle importation should be sustained at least for two years in order to avoid importing unnecessary numbers of vehicles, especially during the latter part of the year in which the Budget is presented.
He added that vehicle exports from Japan had increased by threefold during this period since people tend to buy vehicles for pre-budget prices, while hoping for tax hikes. This situation results in the outflow of millions of foreign exchange. Addressing various issues faced by the Sri Lankan customers, Meegalla said that customers should purchase vehicles only exported by the SLAAJ, adding that the SLAAJ was responsible for the standards of all vehicles imported through their stakeholders. He said the SLAAJ consists of 40 executive members and 100 registered members.
According to him, vehicles imported through the SLAAJ could be identified by a specific sticker on the vehicles windscreens which symbolyses their quality.
Meegalla said that over 2,000 people were directly involved in the automobile market, but the uncertainty of tax rates affects their job security.
The SLAAJ would conduct a two-day seminar and workshop in Sri Lanka, to make the public aware on all sectors of vehicle purchasing. The event would be held from October 5 to 6 in Colombo, with the participation of Japanese authorities.

SLFP composition in Unity Government will remain intact - Amunugama
Technology Research and Development Minister Sarath Amunugama yesterday stressed that the SLFP representation in the composition of the Government of Consensus will remain intact in the future, irrespective of SLFP ministerial representation, since President Maithripala Sirisena is the head of the Cabinet and the SLFP.
The Minister made this observation at a media conference held at the Government Information Department yesterday.
He further said the UNP had more Parliamentary seats than the SLFP in the 100 day government and the same composition had remained intact in the Unity Government.
Commenting on the speech made by the President at the inauguration of the Second Session of the 8th Parliament, Minister Amunugama said the evaluation of the performance of the Yahapalana Government is timely and essential since it has completed half of its lifespan.
Most of the people have forgotten what the government did since the day it was formed. The government headed by the President and the Prime Minister has created a peaceful country and ensured human rights and other basic rights of the people.
The government has never promoted racism. Both the President and the Prime Minister have been able to maintain healthy relationships with the international community. As a result of that the government could be able to get more benefits including GSP plus.
Refuting allegations leveled by some groups claiming that Sri Lanka is a bankrupt country, Minister Amunugama said a country which doesnt have an income to pay its loan installments considers is as a bankrupt country. But,Sri Lanka has never experienced such a crisis situation.
The Minister stressed the importance of attracting more and more investments without obtaining loans.
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the government has strengthened the reconciliation process and ensured democracy and the independence of the judiciary. The President and the Prime Minister has been able to project Sri Lanka as a country with a healthy international image. As a result, the countries which criticised Sri Lanka with respect to human rights in the past now commend the country.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam highlighted that poor marketing skills is the only weakness of the present government.
Though the government has done a lot for the development of the country, most of them have not been publicised due to the poor marketing, he added.
Though the SLFP and the UNP are the parties with two different policies, the government of consensus between two parties will be continued with the intention of giving more benefits to the public, he said.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said that under the present government Sri Lanka has made significant progress in eliminating child labour and International Labour Organization Sri Lanka Representative informed that Sri Lanka is at the top among the list of South Asian countries for eliminating child labour.

SLTDA assures better visitor  management at Yala
Holding a stakeholders meeting on protection and development of the Yala national park, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka assured that his organization would push for stronger reforms to ensure better visitor management at Sri Lankas most-visited wildlife park.
He said overcrowding had been identified as a key issue concerning the Yala national park and added that the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority would closely work with the countrys wildlife authorities, including the newly appointed minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to formulate a comprehensive plan for better visitor management.
We need stronger regulations to avoid overcrowding which hampers the sustainability of Sri Lankas most prominent wildlife park. We also need to ensure better discipline on the part of Safari operators visiting the Yala national park on a daily basis. Only a handful of unruly operators is enough to cause great damage to the environment and to the animals inhabiting the park, he said, addressing the meeting held at Cinnamon Wild, Yala, on Saturday (05).
The meeting was attended by all major hotel operators in the Yala-Palatupana area, industry stakeholders and representatives from all government bodies responsible the protection and development of the Yala national park. Senior officials from the SLTDA, including its Director General Upali Ratnayake, also attended the meeting.
Ratnayaka also requested all hoteliers in the area to only work with disciplined and scrupulous Safari operators who do not conduct their business at the expense of the environment and wild animals.
We do not undermine the value of Safari operators in the area as they are an important cog in the wheel. But a group of unruly and unscrupulous Safari operators can damage the sustainability of the wildlife experience the Yala national park offers, he said.
We may also have to revisit the road plan near the Yala buffer zone to facilitate the natural movements of wild animals. Some roads, which we recently opened up for construction purposes, will have to be closed down as they restrict the usual crossings of wild animals, Ratnyaka added. The SLTDA Chairman also discussed the tourism development masterplan for the Yala-Palatupana area.
As part of the engagement with industry stakeholders in the area, Ratnayaka and other senior officials representing the SLTDA inspected the constructions done by private parties near the Yala buffer zone to make sure the right standards are met from a tourism standpoint.
They also inspected hotels and properties located at SLTDA lands in the area which have been leased out to private parties.

South Asian women more likely to breastfeed - UNICEF
Babies in South Asia including Sri Lanka are more likely to be breastfed than any other region in the world and are breastfed for longer, UNICEF said in a new analysis released on Wednesday.
At least 98 per cent of children in the region are breastfed at some point in their young lives including Afghanistan (98 percent), Bhutan (99 percent), Nepal (99 percent), Sri Lanka (99 percent), and elsewhere in South Asia the proportion is also high at 9497 percent.
Almost all mothers in Sri Lanka, deemed a middle-income country, give birth at the hospitals, which promote or implement 10 steps of the baby-friendly initiative. This is on par with the high-income country of New Zealand.
Breast milk saves lives and protects babies against deadly diseases. UNICEF recommends that children should be breastfed for two years and beyond because it provides an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and can prevent half of deaths during a childs second year of life. Furthermore, it leads to higher performance on intelligence tests among children and adolescents (3 IQ points on average).
Breastfeeding is the best gift a mother can give her child, as well as herself, said Jean Gough, UNICEFs Regional Director for South Asia. As we celebrate Mothers Day, we must give mothers the support they need to start and continue breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding for longer periods is important for mothers health; for each year a mother breastfeeds, her risk of developing breast cancer falls by 6 per cent.
Whilst Sri Lanka should be proud that almost every child is breastfed at some point in their lives, we need encourage mothers to breastfeed for as long as possible, ideally for two years. This brings immense benefits in the form of nutrition, health and wellbeing for both mother and baby, said Tim Sutton, Representative, UNICEF Sri Lanka.
There has been little progress in improving rates of continued breastfeeding at two years of age in South Asia between 2000 (68 percent) and 2016 (71 percent). Also, in some countries, breastfeeding rates fall by over 20 per cent between the childs first and second birthday.
The recent analysis also showed that babies belonging to wealthier families are more likely to miss out on continued breastfeeding. In South Asia, 81 per cent of babies aged 20-23 months from poorer families are breastfed compared to only 57 per cent in richer families.
This trend is seen across the world. 7.6 million babies are not breastfed, and babies in the worlds richest countries are most likely to miss out. Figures show that an estimated 22 per cent of babies in high-income countries are never breastfed. In low-and-middle-income countries, the rate is 4 per cent. (UNICEF)

It is no secret that the relationship between Sri Lanka and China has a very long history. There is ample proof that there were good and friendly ties between Sri Lanka and China way back as far in the fifth Century. This has been the case till date.
From ancient times there were several trade routes that linked China to the West. The ancient Silk Route is one such famous example. Sri Lanka was privileged to be one country en-route the ancient Silk Road where goods were transported by ships to different parts in the world.
In ancient times Sri Lanka had two harbours wherein the Silk Route ships used to berth and anchor.This was in Trincomalee and Godawaya. The trade friendship that started between the two countries in ancient time have now reach zenith with Chinese market, Chinese industry and technology drawing the interest of Sri Lankan business community like never before. Lankan businessmen travel frequently to China to discover, explore and purchase new Chinese products. However this is a very costly time and energy consuming travel itinerary for the business fraternity in Sri Lanka.
It would be a wonderful opportunity it Sri Lankans could get the opportunity to explore Chinese products technology and no-how, sans exorbitant travel cost, waste of time and energy. This opportunity now opens for Sri Lanka businesses from May 18-20 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre with the launch of the 2018 China Guangxi Products Exhibition (Sri Lanka) & China Guangxi Brands Silk Road Series (Sri Lanka). The spectacular events are organized by the Department of Commerce of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China.
This is the second time that such a massive fair introducing Chinese products is held in Colombo. One could question as to what are the benefits that would derive from such fairs. What would converge is that a number of top Chinese companies making inroads to Sri Lanka with their products. This would create ample opportunities for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs get familiar with Chinese goods and opportunities open to them in Chinese markets as well. It will also provide rendezvous for industrialists, entrepreneurs and producers to exchange their views and Know-how. The Sri Lankan business fraternity will get the opportunity to see for themselves the products of over 67 Chinese companies. Over 1,000 Sri Lankan companies will also get the opportunity to display their products at the fair along their Chinese counterparts for the potential Chinese market.
Mechanical, electronic, small industry, metal and chemistry products with take the limelight at the exhibition. In addition food, animal feed medical products, clothes and garments too will be available for inspection and perusal by interested parties.
The exhibition which will be held in the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre will consist of four sessions. The first will be the introduction session conducted at Cinnamon Lakeside commencing at 11 am on May 14. The introduction ceremony will be held on May 18 at 10.30 am as the second session. Opportunities for the business community to meet and discuss investment and the increase of production will unlock at 2 pm the same day. The forth step will be the Jewellery and gem exhibition which will take place on May 19 at 3 pm at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre.
It will be a rare occasion where the Sri Lankan traders will get the unique opportunity to work and interact under one roof with the pioneer Chinese trading companies .There will also be a change in the Chinese goods import culture, where Chinese goods are imported into the country. Similarly there will also be an upheaval in Sri Lankan exports to the Chinese market. This could be easily termed as a friendly breeze coming from the new Silk Route into Sri Lanka.

Sunny on the Other Side..!
Theyre frowning down below! laughed the clouds as they stared back at the jovial sun, who was trying his best to make them hot, but then clouds dont become hot do they, I mean, have you ever heard of hot clouds Fluffy clouds maybe! Flurry fluffballs maybe, but hot clouds And these clouds were sure fluffy and huggable as they laughed at the sun, then looked at me staring at them through the plane window. Whos frowning down below I asked and the sun and the clouds as if involved in one big conspiracy laughed at me, Werent you they asked in chorus.
Me I asked.
Just awhile back, before your plane climbed out of us clouds, when you looked at our underbellies, werent you frowning said a little cloud brushing past my window.
Well, yes! I admitted, It was so dark and dismal looking up at you guys, it made me feel low!But I couldnt help it, you guyslook pretty gloomy down below.
Asglum as your shadow looks on the ground Mr Handsome! thundered a huge cloud and I smiled even as the airhostess walking past smiled at me, Talking to the clouds she asked.
How did you guess I asked.
We talk to them all the time, she said, Look around. Is there anyone with a serious face
I looked around and saw them smiling and chatting with the passengers, Looks like you dont have a care in the world, I admitted, You all appear so happy!
Those cheerful clouds inspire us! said another pretty airhostess.
But I saw you all smiling even as you got into the aircraft! I said, And it was dismal and gloomy down there!
Thats because they know that on the other side of us, we are laughing at the sun! said a rather impertinent cloud, who I could have sworn winked at the airhostess, who Im sure winked back.
The airhostesses went by and I heard passengers chuckling as the pilot made his rather jovial announcements. I gathered even hed been talking to the clouds and was in high spirits.
But Im sure it isnt as easy as the airhostess said! I whispered to a light cloud outside my window, How can I be happy on the ground looking at your distressing and melancholic underbellies
Do you always look at the shoes of someone who comes to see you asked the cloud, Or do you look up at a beautiful dress or a pretty face
I look up! I said.
Do just that, when you are down in the dumps, search for the other side of us!
I watched the clouds laughing at the jolly sun as he light heartedly tried to make them hot, but then have you ever heard of hot cloudsAnd I laughed out loud and the airplanefull of passengers laughed along with me, even as we landed to a dark but cheery, solemn but merry world below!
Even the darkest cloud I realized was sunny on the other side..!

Third Charlton brother poised  for England debut, aged 72
LONDON, Thursday: Tommy Charlton is set to follow in the footsteps of brothers Bobby and Jack and represent England when he plays for the over-60s walking football team against Italy on Sunday.
The grandfather of six is preparing to make his England debut at the age of 72 in Brighton in the first walking football international match.
England are set to play in a red strip, similar to the kit worn by Charlton's famous older brothers in the win over West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley.
"I never in a million years thought that I'd follow in the footsteps of my brothers and represent England," said Charlton.
"I was shocked when I got the call but am delighted to be in the squad for the first-ever walking football international against Italy."
The sport has very specific rules, with no running allowed. Now played in more than 30 countries, walking football is also set to hold its own world cup and European championship, both in England over the next two years.
"Walking football is a sport that has given me so much," said Charlton, who was just 20 when he watched his two older brothers help England beat West Germany 4-2 after extra-time.
"It's social, promotes better health and is played in the right spirit."  AFP

Three winners of contrasting styles
Three recent winners of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main title, with contrasting styles, are serving in the Sri Lanka national team at present.
Sri Lanka national team is studded with three former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketers in Dinesh Chandimal (2009 winner), Niroshan Dickwella (2012) and Kusal Mendis (2013).
Giving birth to a school cricket awards show during an era when there had not been any organized inter-school tournament and continuing it for 40 years uninterrupted is no easy task. That is exactly what the Sunday Observer, together with its current sponsor Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel, has done!
The first-ever recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title  the current Chief Match Referee of the ICC, Ranjan Madugalle has confirmed his participation at the 40th anniversary celebrations. The former Royal College, NCC and Sri Lanka captain turned ICC Chief Match Referee will grace the historic occasion as the chief guest.
The countrys first school cricket awards show has produced many world class cricketers who consider the Mega Show as their stepping stone for the big league. Since Sri Lankas inaugural Test in 1982, almost all national teams had at least one past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer. That alone shows the impact the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has made on Sri Lankas cricket history.
The first two winners of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award Ranjan Madugalle (1979) and Arjuna Ranatunga (1980 and 1982) represented Sri Lanka at the inaugural Test  against England played at the Sara Oval in February 1982. They were the first two Sri Lanka batsmen to score half centuries in Test cricket.
During the last couple of weeks, we discussed the progress of the Mega Show in its first three decades. The first decade of the Mega Show saw the emergence of some of the big names in Sri Lanka cricket. Besides Madugalle and Ranatunga, we saw Roshan Mahanama (1983 and 1984) and Asanka Gurusinha (1985) emerging through the Mega Show to make lavish contributions to Sri Lanka cricket. Last week, we had a flashback on milestone achievements of former Observer Schoolboy Cricketers Kumara Dharmasena, Marvan Atapattu and Muttiah Muralithan and today we will have a closer look on the outstanding cricketers produced through the Mega Show during the past decade. Three of the brilliant Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketers who had come to the limelight during the past decade, including Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, are currently serving the national team.
Chandimal, Dickwella and Mendis stepped into the national team just months after their crowning glory. The trio has become vital ingredients of the national team, cementing their places in double quick time.
Sri Lanka Test captain Chandimal is the most senior of the three, having won the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2009 when he was representing Ananda College. Former Trinity skipper, Dickwella won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012. Kusal Mendis, who led Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa with distinction, was adjudged Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013. Months later, he was chosen to captain the Sri Lanka Under-19 team to Bangladesh in 2013.
At 28 years of age Chandimal has represented Sri Lanka in 46 Tests to aggregate 3,413 runs with an attractive average of 43.75, cracking 10 centuries and 16 fifties that included a career-best knock of 164. In 139 ODIs, Chandimal has aggregated 3,433 runs with an average of 32.69. He has scored four ODI centuries and 21 fifties with a career-best knock of 111. Chandimal, following the footsteps of most other past recipients of the prestigious title, made his Sri Lanka debut only months after he was crowned the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2009. He did not get an opportunity for a long innings (made an unbeaten 10 on his ODI debut for Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on June 1, 2010) when his team had a nine-wicket victory.
Chandimal is one of the most technically accomplished batsmen in the Sri Lanka team who is capable of hitting bowlers to all corners of the ground with a wide range of strokes. He has shown maturity at the crease with a good temperament to build and pace an innings. Dickwella, considered one of the most successful Trinity captains and a reliable top order batsman, entered the big league by winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title six years ago having scored over 1000 runs in the previous season. He is an attacking left-handed wicket-keeper batsman.
Dickwella, who turns 25 on June 23, comparatively has an impressive record in limited-overs cricket. Merely months after winning the coveted title at the Mega Show, Dickwella was called to represent Sri Lanka A on its tour of England in 2013. Since then, he has proved his class not only as an accomplished top order batsman but also as a dependable wicket keeper. Having made his Sri Lanka debut in 2014 against India in Ranchi, Dickwella has represented Sri Lanka in 36 ODIs to aggregate 1074 runs with two centuries and five half tons with a career-best ODI innings of 116.
Dickwella is only ten runs short of reaching the milestone of 1000 Test runs after figuring in 17 matches, producing eight half centuries that includes a career-best innings of 83.
The Trinity Lion has said that winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy cricketer of the Year title was a great source of encouragement. Winning the award was a great encouragement for me. It gives me great pleasure to learn that the contest has lasted for four decades. This contest has produced a bunch of some great cricketers in the All-Island and Outstation competitions. Most of the recipients have blossomed in their chosen professions, be it in cricket or otherwise,, Dickwella was quoted as saying.
Mendis, who has produced many match-winning innings for Prince of Wales, was adjudged the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013. Since then, he has shown impressive form with the bat.
A smart wicket-keeper and dependable right-hand batsman, Mendia has often
let his willow to do the talking. Just months after winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title five years ago, he was appointed Sri Lankas under-19 captain for the Youth World Cup.
Mendis signalled his Sri Lanka debut with an explosive half century scoring 51 off 59 balls with eight boundaries in Sri Lankas first ODI against Ireland in Dublin on June 16, 2016. Since then, Mendis has figured in 44 ODIs for Sri Lanka and has scored 1,239 runs for an average of 30.97. He has one century and 11 fifties to his credit with a career-best knock of 102.
Representing Sri Lanka in 24 Tests, Mendis has aggregated 1712 runs with four centuries and five fifties. He was the top scorer for Sri Lanka in the first innings of the recent second Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka. His brave 68 off 98 balls mainly helped Sri Lanka to take a vital first innings lead, which eventually won the match for them and with it the two-Test series.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest. Chief Executive Officer of SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera, under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel PG Kumarasingha, has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the long standing association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association with the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), headed by Thilanga Sumathipala.
The 40th edition of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest is scheduled to be held shortly. This will be the 11th consecutive year that SLT Mobitel will be sponsoring the Mega Show, which has a rich history of producing legendary cricketers, including the worlds highest Test wicket taker Muttiah Muralitharan.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted in three divisions, is on its last lap.
Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.

Trishaw fairs increased
Three wheeler charges for the first kilometer was increased by Rs 10 (minimum charge) following the increase in fuel prices, President of All Island Three Wheel Drivers' and Owners Association Sudhil Jayaruk said.
"Our minimum charge will be Rs 60 for the first kilometer", he said.
Jayaruk said that he does not see the increase in fuel price as an unfair decision taken by the government but the public will have to face many difficulties as a result.
"It is very hard to live with the present economic condition. The union also had no option other than to increase charges", he said.
Jayaruk further said that he sees this fuel formula as an initiative taken by the government to correct their decision taken on fuel prices in 2015.
"When the government took the decision to decrease the fuel prices in 2015, we understood that with the prevailing issues concerning fuel the government will have to face major issues. And we were right, the government could not continue with the previous price formula", he said.
In the meantime, President of the Ceylon Motorcyclist Association (CMA) Shirantha Amarasinghe said that increase in fuel price was required as the government was losing money after oil prices rose and Sri Lanka's rupee depreciated.
"Despite the inconvenience caused to the public, I do not think the government had an alternative solution to solve the crisis. People who are aware of the current international situation would understand this price formula", he said.

Two weeks sufficient to start implementing Judicature Act - Ajith
Two weeks are adequate to make the necessary arrangements to implement the Judicature Act, State Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He was speaking at a press brief held at the Parliament complex yesterday afternoon.
State Minister Perera urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint the additional 35 High Court Judges before long, who will be a crucial part in setting up three-judge-Bench High Court. He pointed out that the law on appointing High Court Judges was amended six months before. Previously, the law allowed only 75 High Court judges whereas now it provides for 110.
State Minister Perera also requested the Attorney General to take necessary measures to recruit 100 State Counsel to the Attorney Generals Department at the earliest possible time.
He observed that Cabinet approval had already being granted to recruit 100 State Counsel.
State Minister Perera further said the Ministry of Justice will soon be naming three provincial High Courts in the Western Province as special High Courts with a Bench of three judges.
He also said 10 more high courts will soon be established including a special court to handle child affairs.
To have all these High Courts up and running, we need the extra High Court judges appointed as soon as possible. The law on this was passed six months back. We have also solved the issues regarding low payments for counsel employed at the Attorney Generals Department. So we hope the new 100 officers will soon be recruited as well. The AGs Department has 17,000 pending cases to conclude. At present, they only have 113 Counsel to handle all these cases, Perera said.
The State Minister also said that the Judicature Act, which was unanimously passed is a great victory for the government. Many raised concerns over expediting our legal process. They looked at it with skepticism. But, we have introduced the amendments in a very short period of time, he said. Perera expressed his confidence that all responsible parties in appointing the High Court judges and recruiting legal counsel to the AGs Department will soon fulfill their responsibilities to expedite the justice administration in the country.
Responding to a question, State Minister Perera requested for an investigation with regards to a misappropriation of the Samurdhi Social Protection Fund. Asked as to why this issue was not raised earlier when subject Minister S.B. Dissanayake was a part of the government, Minister Perera said that some people are reluctant to give out information when a minister is in power.

Malaysias shock election result:
Whats in store for the future
On the early morning of May 10, results from the Election Commission indicated that Malaysias opposition coalition had secured enough seats to prevail in the countrys general election, effectively marking the end of the worlds longest continuing ruling coalition, led by scandal-ridden premier Najib Razak, and putting the countrys longest serving leader, Mahathir Mohamad, back into office. Though an opposition coalition win would no doubt be historic, the election result has also quickly cast the Southeast Asian state into a period of uncertainty and raised questions about not just the transfer of power, but the future direction of its domestic politics and foreign policy.
The oppositions tally in the countrys 14th general election is nothing short of historic. Though the ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional (BN), had seen its support erode over the past decade under Najib  losing its much-prized two-thirds majority in 2008 and then the popular vote in 2013  most had predicted BN would still nonetheless cling to power in GE14 by employing its usual bag of political tricks, including gerrymandering and restrictions on the opposition. Instead, by early Thursday morning, results disclosed by the countrys Election Commission showed that the opposition Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition had surpassed the 112 of the 222 seats required in parliament with 121 seats, giving it an effective simply majority, with BN winning just 79 seats.
The result was above all an indicator of the high degree of frustration among the Malaysian electorate with the status quo. Najibs declining popularity over the years had come amidst deep discontent  not just about the much-ballyhooed 1MDB scandal, but also policies such as the unpopular goods and services tax (GST) that hurt regular Malaysians. GE14 saw huge rallies for the Pakatan Harapan (PH) opposition alliance during the election campaign, significant turnout by Malaysians, and record losses by BN in terms parliamentary seats. The demand for change in Malaysia was clear for all to see.
Yet while the opposition victory might mark the end of a historic election race, it also represents the start of an age of uncertainty for the Southeast Asian state. Given the unprecedented nature of the oppositions tally, the immediate focus was around whether or not there would be a peaceful transfer of power that would see Mahathir sworn into office again as prime minister and Wan Azizah, the wife of his former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim who he once deposed and is now behind bars, will be sworn in as deputy prime minister.
Mahathirs swearing in
Whether or not this in fact occurs still remains to be seen. During Najibs first press conference since his partys defeat on Thursday morning, he stopped short of conceding power, noting that no single party had received a simple majority  if the 121 seats are to be broken down by the 104 seats contested under the PKR logo along with 9 seats for the Democratic Action Party and 8 seats for Parti Warisan Sabah  and that the King would have to determine who the next premier would be.
Meanwhile, Mahathirs swearing in, initially said to be set for Thursday, was delayed. The added period of uncertainty had the effect of feeding into rumours that BN may not accept an opposition win and that raising concerns about the outbreak of violence.
Even if a peaceful transfer of power does occur, the deeper concerns lie in how the electoral outcome is likely to affect Malaysian domestic politics and foreign policy. As of now, things still look quite unclear on both fronts. Domestically, the election campaign ahead of polls was dominated by a focus on personality attacks and cosmetic promises rather than substance, in spite of the fact that the countrys true challenges are structural and transcend party or person.
Amid the vilification of Najib, for instance, one should not forget that it was Mahathirs authoritarian rule for over two decades that paved the way for some of the trends the opposition rails against  from the erosion of Malaysias institutions to the lack of reforms in decades-old affirmative action policies. These are serious problems that cannot be fixed overnight no matter who is in office, and they are tougher to talk about than to actually address.
Remarkable triumph
It would also be a mistake to conflate an election victory with sustained political dominance. As remarkable a triumph as the Malaysian oppositions is, the fact is that it took a slow accumulation of several developments  including the deepening 1MDB scandal surrounding Najib, Mahathirs unlikely re-emergence in Malaysian politics, and deep frustrations that translated into record turnout  to get to this historic outcome.
Sustaining that kind of momentum will not be an easy task, particularly as the opposition transitions from campaigning to governing  with Mahathir claiming he will eventually step aside  and supporters of the defeated ruling coalition begin realigning post-Najib using their deep patronage networks and other levers of influence. The pendulum could well swing back in the direction of continuity after sudden change.
Things are equally unclear on the foreign policy side as well. Beyond shallow slogans and cheap talk from the two sides  from Mahathirs promises to restrict Chinese investments to Najibs self-congratulatory note on the relatively good state of Malaysia-Singapore relations  there was little substantive debate about the structural problems have eroded the exercise of Malaysian foreign policy and constrained the countrys manoeuverability.
These include a meagre defense budget that limits Malaysia from addressing growing security threats to a more divided country that dilutes the support needed for the country to wage an effective foreign policy and preserve its sovereignty from outside threats from state and non-state actors.
Some might turn to Mahathirs foreign policy record for a guide as to what might play out. But it has been a decade-and-a-half since he was in power, and the domestic, regional, and global realities that Malaysia confront differ significantly.
It is also still unclear how the management of foreign relations will work under the oppositions tenure, as well as the extent to which mulled changes will actually find their way through bureaucracies into implementation. For these reasons among others, doomsday scenarios, whether with respect to neighbouring states like Singapore or major powers like the United States and China, are less likely to play out than subtler recalibrations in the countrys key relationships.
The immediate headlines so far have focused on the Malaysian oppositions historic election tally, and deservedly so. But as the days and months progress, it will be equally important to pay attention to the countrys new period of uncertainty and what that means for how it conducts itself at home and abroad.
