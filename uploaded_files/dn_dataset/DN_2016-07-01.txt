Gatlin shrugs off  slow  start  to 2016

NEW YORK, WEDNESDAY: It remains to be seen whether a legitimate 100 meter challenger to Usain Bolt will emerge from the US Olympics trials as injuries and mediocre results have hampered the mens sprint team this season.
Former Athens Olympic gold medalist Justin Gatlin has yet to break 9.90 in a wind legal race this season after a barnstorming 2015, when he won silver at the Beijing World Championships.
Trayvon Bromell, who picked up the bronze in Beijing, is a question mark due to an Achilles injury.
Gatlin, 34, said Wednesday that his slow start is part of a bigger plan.
I basically have to run two championships in one year, so I wanted to start slower this year so I can prepare myself for that, he said in Eugene, Oregon, where he is getting ready to compete in the trials beginning Friday.
Sprinters Tyson Gay, Marvin Bracy and Mike Rodgers also have a chance at reaching Rio as the top three finishers in each event qualify for the Brazil Games, August 5-21.
The controversial Gatlin remains unapologetic after serving two doping bans that have some officials and athletes questioning how the American is still allowed to compete in light of the added scrutiny directed at Russian athletes because of suspicions about that countrys anti-doping program.
Gatlin has never admitted to doping, saying that a 2006 failed test was the result of a massage therapists rubbing testosterone cream on his legs. He also tested positive in 2001 for an amphetamine. He served a four-year ban, returning to the scene in 2010.
Alexander Zhukov, Russias Olympic committee president, took a swipe at Gatlin and Gay during a recent Olympic summit in Switzerland, questioning the fairness of letting them compete in Rio de Janeiro while some Russian athletes who have never tested positive might not. Like Gatlin, former world champion Gay was suspended for doping in 2013.
More than 100 athletes will qualify for the Rio Games by the end of the US trials on July 10. The American track and field team is traditionally the biggest by size across all sports. In 2012, the USA topped the medal table with nine gold among 28 total medals.
The US also led the medal standings at the Beijing Worlds with 18, but Jamaica and Kenya grabbed more golds.
The US trials are going to be a dogfight, Gatlin said earlier this month.
Allyson Felix says it is more difficult to compete at the trials than the Olympic Games themselves because the American program is so strong. A lot of times you do feel like its this bigger thing than even the Olympic Games, she said.

GMOA to complain against political interference on SLMC

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will complain to International Medical Councils regarding unacceptable political influences on Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in connection with the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
According to Dr. Soysa, the GMOA will make a formal request from them to hold an International inquiry on the various political influences made on SLMC, pressuring it to recognize SAITM and its medical students.
Both the institution and the students do not have legal recognition and do not have permission to operate.
The GMOA will also make a formal request from all SLMC councilors to step down if politicians do not allow them to function independently, because then the International bodies can question the Sri Lankan Government in connection with this issue and the Government is answerable, he said.
The GMOA will take legal action and stern trade union action to avoid any possible violations of the Medical Ordinance and any interference on the independency of the SLMC, he added.
This so called private medical faculty, its human and other resources, education or anything, had not received the registration from the SLMC or at least have any required minimum standards to function, he stressed.

DSS retains trophy with 28-12 rout of Mahanama

D.S. Senanayake College retained the Battle of the Gold trophy in their 10th annual inter schools rugby Big Match encounter when they beat Mahanama College by 28 points (4 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion) at CR&FC grounds, Longden Place yesterday. DSS led 12-5 at the breather.
Although starting the match as favourites D.S.Senanayake had to face stiff resistance and there was doubts cast whether they could retain the trophy for another year.
Mahanama had an indifferent season but had shown their capabilities when they beat some top schools, hence an enthralling battle was expected.
Both the teams played high class rugby which is a tribute to their coaches but two individuals stood out and were the stars of the team. Mahanama skipper and flanker Dinesh Bandara led from the front and was always in the thick of the action, while D.S. Senanayake open side flanker Inura Samarawickrama was surely the player of the game for his cracking runs to go along with his spectacular tackles and steady performance.
Samarawickrama was easily the highest points scorer along with Mahanama skipper Bandara as each scored two sensational tries apiece.
D.S. Senanayake opened scoring when flanker Samarawickrama crashed through for a try which captain Mohamad Ashroff fluffed with the conversion and they went into a 5-nil lead.
DSS scored again when prop forward Imaad Siddik went over the line off a forward rush. This time around Ashroff made the conversion and they extended their lead to 12-nil.
Mahanama immediately cut down the lead when Bandara dummied his way over for a superb try. Dimantha Gimhana missed the difficult conversion and the score read 12-5 in favour of DSS which was the score at half time. Soon after the interval DSS scored through their cracking centre Ruchira Weerakoon who touched down for a sensational try through a three quarter move. Ashroff made a good conversion and they went further ahead to lead 20-5.
Bandara quickly reduced the lead with a sensational try and Gimhana made a good conversion so that the scoreline read 20-12.
Within a couple of minutes Ashroff slotted a superb 35 metre penalty to extend the lead to 23-12.
DSS sealed the match when their hard working flanker cum hero of the day Samarawickrama collected a ball off a ruck and crashed through on the blind side to score. Place kicker cum captain Ashroff failed with the conversion but the final score was a commendable 28-12.

Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka  a strength in next big battle: PM

Catering to the peoples expectations for a new country is the next biggest battle before the Government and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is a strength in this crusade, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was speaking at the event to grant UNP membership to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka at the Sirikotha UNP Headquarters yesterday. Fonseka received the membership letter from Prime Minister Wickremesinghe after signing a document at the auspicious time of 11.40 am.
Along with Fonseka, all Democratic Party front line members received UNP membership letters from UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim. Fonseka was also appointed the UNP Kelaniya Organizer.
The Premier speaking at the occasion said granting UNP membership to Field Marshal Fonseka was a unanimous decision of the party.
The UNP is a party that marches forward. Field Marshal Fonseka did not retreat at anytime, not even after the war. Many difficulties came his way after he contested as the Common Candidate. That was how the then Government treated a war-winning Army Commander, he said.
The Premier said even though Fonseka contested the previous General Elections from a different party, the UNP decided to offer him a seat as they were of the opinion that he should represent Parliament. Now we are one force and we have one journey. That journey is to create a better country that has eliminated poverty and corruption. We need to empower the rural economy, strengthen the middle class, create employment opportunities and usher in educational reforms. Saying is earlier than done. People like Field Masrshal Sarath Fonseka are a strength to us in this journey, he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka pledged that his support to the UNP would be consistent and unchanging.
This is a unanimous decision taken by our party considering the contemporary political situation and needs. When I came forward as the Common Candidate in 2010, my ambition was to save the country from the corrupt rule that prevailed at the time. I also campaigned for good governance and a better political culture. Therefore, I can be happy that the present government has been committed to good governance and a country free of corruption, bribery and thuggery, he said.
The Mahinda Chinthana plague is not over. Its phantoms are still haunting. The 6.2 million people who united to defeat him should remain strong and united, he added.
He said the UNP agreed to give nominations to 39 of his party men at provisional and national level elections, and requested to give a chance to the rest of his party men at the Local Government level elections. I have no separate political agendas and the UNP leadership can trust my word. I am not a politician who back stabs. I challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa openly and to his face."
