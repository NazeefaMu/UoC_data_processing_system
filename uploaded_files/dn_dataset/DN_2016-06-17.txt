Moschinos  ready-to-wear  collection

Jeremy Scott cooked up double trouble over the weekend, unveiling not one but two Moschino collections.
The brand's Spring Menswear 2017 and Resort Womenswear 2017 collections were revealed in typical flamboyant style, with the Italian fashion house migrating to the sunny west coast of the USA for the event, which was held in the backyard of the designer's LA home. The grounds were transformed into an exotic garden wonderland, setting the scene for a vibrant and colorful show.
Both collections ran on the same bold, psychedelic theme - 1960s-style florals and punchy tie-dyes were the order of the day, with colorful crotchet work also making an appearance. The summer of love references continued through flared pants, frock coats, bustier tops, cropped half-sleeve bombers, smoking jackets, maxi dresses and pant suits for the girls.
The guys got precision-fit tailoring in the form of embroidered and embellished tuxedo jackets with tails not to mention lace double-breasted suits, alongside hyper-biker jackets and jeans, crochet hoodies and flower-power cycling shorts.
The devil was in the details -- there were hand-applied Shisha-inspired mirror adornments, holographic floral appliqus, fine-gauge fringed knits and troupe l'oeil mythical prints all over the catwalk. Flashes of black lace, crochet and embellished leathers created a pop gothic vibe perfectly suited to LA.
