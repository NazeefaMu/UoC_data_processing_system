Preparing the mind and living with pressure ....the new oxygen!
Sri Lanka is a remarkable nation of sport mad islanders, who spend much of their time being experts in many disciplines ...especially national selection policy and how much we should consider so and so in the team
Rugby is the second most popular islandwide ...cricket owning that top slot... but only international limited overs cricket.
Schools rugby is no. 1 by miles on any level ...its popularity soaring every weekend as we speak ... the Royal-Thomian all the way down to the wire. Coach Lagga for STC and Martis for Royal, both master tacticians, both islanders and pretty talented players to guide. The system for all the big stables fully professional at each level.
Teams carry head coach, asst coach, backs and forwards coaches, trainer, physio, masseur, analyst at the top end ...master-in-charge and manager add to a squad of 23 players and complete the list. Home and away games are massive logistical plans to map and execute. Feast your rugby appetite for a veritable..."All u can handle" this sunny weekend:
Royal v St Joseph's, St Peter's v Isipatana, Trinity v S Thomas'.
Experts and pundits will have a field day waxing lyrical and speculating score lines, plus plenty of gnashing with all the old boys passionate about pride and their badge.
All three games promise family fans and class mates... Plenty heartache from the kick-off and lots of hydration before half time.
The schools rugby association should consider water breaks to absorb this extreme heat and not end up dehydrating players and fans alike ... Coaches and physios must insist on tanking up before warm up ...during match and rehydrate after the game.
Excellent rehydrates on the market, ...otherwise nothing better than the world champion thambili, closely followed by the more elusive kurumba ...both supplies the body exactly what it needs to revive and prep for performance all thru the 80 mins.
Coaches should weigh in and weigh out for all players...to tag how much the body and fluid loss is, on average for 40 mins.
If the temp is 35...then the temp in the boots ...a lot greater and good to 38
Both teams should request for water breaks pre and post half time, and water should be provided ....plus we can also use to avoid cramp. extreme fluid loss etc ...sunstroke and many other horrible factors that directly affect performance in the middle ...plus of course the quality of the big encounter!
Good common sense must prevail and a practical alternative for junior games to be played earlier...8am starts ideal...all done by 10am perhaps.
The schools and Singer should I think, release a medical guide, a leaflet in all languages, on how to handle heat, to deal with dehydration, heat stroke and extreme fluid loss. Valuable information for all of us.
Parents need plenty of guidance about the do's and dont's of training in the sun, how to fluid up for matches etc...they also need to understand the clinical basis of supplements being handed out to their children, on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. The promise of becoming an impact power player with 3D muscles and a 5D ability, is too tempting for the kids, to say no.
Extreme gym conditioning ...is a specialist area of expertise and should be handled by qualified knowledgeable trainers...who understand the requirements of modern rugby and prepare the boys to be match ready with 80 mins petrol to burn.
Shocking loss to absorb Sajith Mallikaarachchi leaving us long before full time. We had him in our Sri Lanka 7s squad that played one leg of the 2004 World Series in Dubai and South Africa. A proud product of isipatana, national captain and Cup winner for several years with Kandy SC as player and captain.
An exceptional ability to read the game made him very difficult to gauge ...at fly half or centre...his contribution will be part of his legacy, for school club and country...respected by his fellow team members as a player who always protected and took the pressure ...control and balance his weapons in the middle. Blessings for the young family he leaves behind and may the turf lie gently on him ...knowing that he has gone to a better team and will always be loved and missed as a good friend, a great player and skills that exemplified his rare and gifted qualities as a proud islander.
The game demands absolutely everything in the middle ...with little consideration...for those who lack the performance fitness or courage to handle pressure in the middle.
Focus in every hurried shout does little for players in the scrum...or the ball from scrum half to inside centre on a miss pass for the full back to hit the overlap at pace...my mind is racing as I remember screaming for early ball and a chance to power up against my opposite winger. Little has changed!
The mind for more ...the mind for pain...the ability to withstand impact from bigger and stronger ...but still stand up and surprise the opponent. We push the limits of human tolerance in preparation ...and only a handful can graduate those impossible pain levels ...only the elite champions have the kryptonite quality... A heart so strong it defies logic, defies science and gets back up to fight till the last gasp...these are the players ...these are the flag bearers, these are the real champions that simply makes us proud and add value to our sport and life. It's the incredible nature of these amazing islanders, so humble from the hard work, that gives our active lives true meaning...and being able to surprise, certainly deserves "flipping Christmas cake" all year round. All hail the warriors.
Finally, it's for all rugby pundits and experts to try and predict what results will hit us from the Peter's-Patana game Can Royal bounce back against Joes Will the Trinity-Thomas game be such a humdinger in Pallekelle ...that pushes it right down to the wire
Cheers islanders!

MJM Lafir's 35th death anniversary on April 26
Sri Lanka's first world title winner M.J.M. Lafir will be remembered on his 35th death anniversary, which falls on Tuesday (April 26). Lafir brought the first world title to the country by winning the world billiards crown in 1973.
Lafir won the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay, in November-December 1973, being victorious against all his opponents and also scoring the highest break of 859. It is an achievement without parallel in the annals of sports in Sri Lanka. Prior to this pinnacle of his success, Lafir had participated in international championships in Billiards and Snooker in Edinburgh, Scotland, Malta, and Auckland New Zealand since 1970, but had not won any of them.
At the World Snooker Tournament in Edinburgh, Scotland, in Oct-Nov 1970, Lafir defeated I L Glozier (NZ), Paul Mifsud (Malta), John Clint (N Ireland), D Sneddon (Scotland), but lost to John Phillips (Scotland) and Sidney Hood (England).
At the World Amateur Billiards Championships in Valeta, Malta, in Nov 1971, Lafir finished fourth defeating D Sneddon (Scotland), Paul Mifsud (Malta), Lance Napper (New Zealand) and lost to Manuel Fransisco (South Africa) in the preliminary rounds.
The stamp issued in honour of MJM Lafir in 1988.
In Nov-Dec 1972, at the World Open Billiards Championship, held in Auckland, New Zealand, in which professionals as well as amateurs participated, Lafir lost to Clark McConachy (New Zealand), Eddie Charlton (Australia), Paddy Morgan (Ireland), Satish Mohan (India), Leslie Driffield (England) and Michael Ferreira (India) but won against C Everton (Wales), Jim Fryer (England), Kinsley Kennerly (England) and Jack Karneham (England). He failed to qualify for the final round.
So, it was in 1973 that finally reached the pinnacle of his career by winning the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay. He defeated Clive Everton (Wales), Michael Ferreira (India), LU Demarco (Scotland), Alfred Nolan (England), Satish Mohan (India), Eric Simons (New Zealand), Brian Kirkness (New Zealand), Phil Tarrant (Australia), and Paul Mifsud (Malta).
Lafir was born on May 27, 1930 at St. Joseph's Street, Grandpass to S.L.M. Junaid and Salaha Ummuna. He had two brothers Farad and Izzeth and a sister Hinaya. He came into the scene, to play billiards when he was seven years old. That is the time his father won the snooker championship of Awwal Zavi Road Billiards Club beating his uncle A.M.A. Marzook. It was this success that made Lafir try out his skill at the cue game. It was on April 26 1981, one month before his 51st birthday this great man who put Sri Lanka sports on the world map, breathed his last.
Lafiar's fame would have been lost in the "desert air" of Hulftsdorp but for two happenings. He joined MICH (Moors Islamic Cultural Home) in 1947 and played for them in their regular friendly games with other clubs and the founding of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association in 1948 Lafir was grateful to the MICH for discovering, nurturing and grooming him for big billiards.
He was well backed by late M.M. Thawfeeq, the first secretary of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association for providing the opportunity to play against visiting champions and to go overseas for international competitions.
Though he was unafraid of facing the cue greats on the table he had one handicap that was his lack of adequate knowledge of the English Language, which would have helped him to familiarize and mix with the other players in tournaments. He was progressing well as a standard 2 student at Hameediah Boys English School.
But when a teacher slapped his elder brother Farad, his father in a rage, stopped both Farad and Lafir from attending school. But dedicated and determined Lafir overcame this handicap by learning to speak English with both his local opponents and abroad. He mastered the language so well that he soon began to joke and "rag" his opponents on the international field and won their hearts.
The launch pad for many of Lafir's triumphs overseas and boosting Sri Lanka's image overseas was the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike's cheque for Rs. 100 which started the fund to send Lafir overseas to train and play with world champions.
The Asian snooker tournament was introduced in memory of M.J.M. Lafir. Now the tournament is in operation but the Cup and name of M.J.M Lafir is unfortunately missing. This tournament came into being because of late Maurice H Kerr of Thailand, the first President of the Asian Billiards and Snooker Association, and late Frouse Saheed of Sri Lanka who was the Vice President of the Asian B & S A and President of Sri Lanka cue sport.
Lafir reigned supreme for 24 years between 1949 and 1973, he annexed the National Billiards title of Sri Lanka 16 times and the National Snooker title on 15 separate occasions. He was not satisfied; he went across to the Indian National Snooker title won on seven occasions from 1956 to 1976, defeating some of the best Indian Stalwarts.
Lafir's achievement was commendable to Sri Lanka at that time. After his death before his 53rd birth anniversary on 17 April, the Colombo Municipal Council re-named Messenger Street, as M.J.M. Lafir Mawatha, as a tribute to him. During the presidency of Jagath Sumathipala, in 1988 when the 5th MJM Lafir Asian tournament was played in Colombo, with backing coming form then Minister M.H. Mohamed, a stamp to the value of Rs. 5.75 was issued.
The maestro is no more but people in Sri Lanka will ever remember him for his contribution to our soil.

De Silva said that SLC has requested for a comprehensive report on Malinga's injury from the panel and they expect it to be available to them sometime next week.
However it is learnt that Malinga will be out of action for at least six months and with proper management and rest he will be able resume his career.

Sri Lanka to christen Canberra with a Test in 2018/19

Finally, Canberra's Manuka Oval has passed the Test. After narrowly missing out to Hobart on playing the game's long form in the ACT next summer, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland announced on Wednesday Australia will play a Test against Sri Lanka there in the 2018-19 summer.
It came on the back of the announcement Australia will play New Zealand in the second of a three-game series for the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in December.
The Test will replace Canberra's ODI for the 2018-19 summer in the four-year agreement between the ACT government and Cricket Australia to hold international cricket in the nation's capital.
It could affect the roll-out of Greater Western Sydney's proposed $800 million Manuka Oval redevelopment, if the Manuka Green project is given the green light.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr told Fairfax Media Manuka Oval would not be a construction site during the historic Test. That could delay any potential starting date of the Manuka Green project.
Instead, the government will invest $3-10 million to upgrade Manuka, which could include increased capacity, bigger replay screens and improved media and player facilities, as well as the widening of entry gates.
Barr was "delighted" to have finally landed an historic Test for Canberra.
"The ACT government has been working towards the goal of hosting international Test cricket in Canberra for many years," he said in a statement.
"It is a significant win not only for Canberra cricket fans, but the broader community who will benefit from the increased coverage of our city during the test match and a boost to the local economy.
"We are committed to ongoing investment in sport in the Territory, and we have invested significantly in Manuka Oval in recent years to ensure that the venue is well placed to host Test match cricket. "Canberra has proven itself an ideal city for hosting world-class sporting events.
"For cricket alone, over the past couple of summers we have hosted men's and women's One Day International games, the Cricket World Cup and year after year we host a successful Prime Minister's XI."
The ODI against New Zealand will be played on December 6, as part of the Australian men's team summer schedule announced Wednesday morning.
Sydney will host the first of that ODI series on December 4, and Melbourne the potential decider on December 9, and a second ODI series will be played in New Zealand in 2017.
New Zealand will be one of four international sides to travel to Australia this summer, with South Africa, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka also playing here.
The summer schedule will break from tradition by starting in Perth with a Test match against South Africa on November 3 at the WACA
The three-match series against the Proteas will continue in Hobart from November 12 to 16, before a Test at the Adelaide Oval from November, 24-28 which CA says has "potential" to be a day-night Test, as it was last year.
Cricket Australia says it would like the Adelaide Test to be played with the pink ball, due to "enormous expectation" from fans, but said "understandably, there is some concern from the South African players", and they are working with Cricket South Africa to come to an agreement.
Brisbane will host its first Day-Night Test with a pink ball from December 15 against Pakistan, that three-Test series continuing as per tradition with day Tests in Melbourne for Boxing Day and Sydney from January 3.
A five-game ODI series against Pakistan will then start with Brisbane (January 13), Melbourne (January 15), Perth (January 19), Sydney (January 22) and Adelaide (January 26) to host.
Sri Lanka will visit Australia at the end of the summer for three T20 Internationals on February 17, 19 and 22 , with venues to be confirmed. - SMH

EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports lifted

The EU ban imposed Sri Lankan fish exports has been lifted, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry stated.

Earlier it was reported that a high level discussion to decide on the lifting of the European Union fishing export ban imposed on Sri Lanka was scheduled to take place today (21).

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that relevant documents pertaining to removal of the ban will be received by Sri Lanka in the coming month. Sri Lanka's seafood exports were severely hit by the ban and continued to decline since the announcement of the ban in October 2014. "The EU ban took effect over the previous government's failure to prevent local fishermen from violating international fisheries laws," he added.
