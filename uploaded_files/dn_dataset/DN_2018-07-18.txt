Building HR skills vital to reach  upper- middle income country status
Sri Lanka needs to focus on building human resource skills and investing in early childhood education, in order to achieve its targets of becoming a competitive, upper-middle income country, and if Sri Lanka is to achieve its ambition of becoming a globally competitive upper- middle income country, a human resource development expert said.
Professor of Human Development at University of Oxford, Edward Melhuish said lack of investments in Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs will greatly affect future education, literacy rate, numerical and social skills, employability and health of the people of this country.
Addressing a forum on Building Brains, Building Futures organized by UNICEF in Colombo, Professor Melhuish said Sri Lanka faces a shortage of human resources and also lags behind other middle income countries in terms of early childhood education.
Citing reasons for this, he said Sri Lanka spends extraordinary little of 0.0001 % of GDP on ECE and this is lower than its south Asian neighbors and even lower than some of the poorest sub Saharan African countries.
Consequently, ECE programs in Sri Lanka are inadequate and regulatory structure is poor. There is no formal curriculum and early learning standards and many centres are lacking adequate resources for teaching and learning.
He pointed out the importance of enhancing access to ECE programs, especially for poor households through public funded ECE while raising parents awareness.
To improve the quality of ECE programs in Sri Lanka, he also stressed the need to implement high quality curricula, develop standards for child outcomes and to introduce minimum standards for Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres.
In addition, Prof. Melhuish noted that it is important to ensure teachers receive adequate pre-service and in service professional development. In a bid to improve sector coordination and governance, he said, it is also imperative to clarify regulatory structures and quality assurance framework and to maintain data on ECD.
Building Brains, Building Futures, follows a series of sectoral consultations on health, education and child protection, that were held to identify new and additional investment priorities and budget asks for ECD that the Government can make through its National Budget for 2019.
The High-Level Meeting was organized by the Department of National Planning and supported by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) in partnership with Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, The Parliamentary Caucus for Children and World Bank.

Anglican Church opposes hanging drug trafficking criminals in death row
The Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) yesterday said it cannot agree to a government decision to resume the execution of those sentenced to death for drug related crimes.
Issuing a joint statement, the Bishop of Colombo and the Bishop of Kurunegala (The Bishops of the Church of Ceylon)said that it has been reported that the President and the Ministers have decided to authorize prison authorities to resume the execution of those sentenced to death for drug related crimes and are yet continuing to be involved in the drug trade while in prison. As Christians, we believe that all people are made in the image of God and are therefore imbued with the spark of the divine within them, however obscured and hidden it may be. This is why the taking of human life is expressly condemned by the Church, whether by man or by the State.
The Church of Ceylon (Anglican Church) cannot therefore in any way agree with this move, which we believe has been rushed into without proper reflection, in the backdrop of criticism and public disquiet about the spate of gang related murders and shootings in the recent days.
Engagement in criminal activities outside prison by convicted persons cannot take place without the connivance of prison authorities. The government cannot absolve itself from its duty to devise ways of minimizing such occurrences. It must take quick but well designed steps to put into place strong security measures in prisons. obtaining the services of experts here and even abroad, if required. It cannot resort to hanging people to escape its own obligations. Sri Lanka halted judicial executions more than 40 years ago, Although several governments in the past have tried to reimpose the death penalty, wiser counsel has always prevailed.
This does not mean that we are unconcerned about the drug menace. We are indeed very deeply concerned by this widespread and very dangerous threat especially to the young people of our country and its consequences on wider society. In our pastoral visits all over the island, we are very often briefed of this menace and we encourage our clergy and organizations to carry out awareness programmes and join with others in doing what ever we can to protect children.
The church is willing to join and offer our assistance to the government in this regard in the educational sector. We, therefore, reiterate our opposition to this decision and we call instead on the government to vigorously combat drug smuggling and distribution at all levels in our society.
It is widely spoken including in government circles, that it is the sprats who are being caught and punished while the sharks are allowed to remain free to carry on their business, profitable to many, even politicians it is said.
The law ought and must be applied in full force equally to all involved in this destructive trade, the statement said.

Bolt poised for surprise trial  with Aussie football club
Sydney, Tuesday: Usain Bolt is on the verge of sealing a deal to trial with the A-Leagues Central Coast Mariners, the Australian club said Tuesday, as the sprint legend pursues his dream of playing professional football.
Eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, 31, who retired from athletics after Augusts World Championships in London, is an avid Manchester United fan who has long dreamt of playing top-flight football. The 100m and 200m world record-holder trained with Norwegian club Stromsgodset last month and Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund in March.
The planned arrangement will see him take part in a six-week trial starting next month at the Mariners base in Gosford, some 75 kilometres (47 miles) north of Sydney, chief executive Shaun Mielekamp said.
A season-long deal could follow if it goes well, he told commercial broadcaster Channel Seven. Football agent Tony Rallis, who has been working on the deal, told Sky Sports Radios Big Sports Breakfast Tuesday it has been agreed in principle... subject to a couple of benchmarks.
Mainly, a trial, and of course marquee funds support from (governing body Football Federation Australia), he said, adding that the arrangement was not a gimmick.
Once the FFA comes back and says that theyll be part of the process, were going to the trial... This blokes an ambitious athlete. The A-League needed a hero, and we got superman.
Mielekamp said his club had been working on the agreement for four to five months, and there was still some work to do.
But fingers crossed things might play out, but the most important thing is we wait to find out and see how good a footballer he is first.
If all goes well, who knows He may be playing in the A-League this season.
Mielekamp said reports of Bolts performance at the European clubs he has trialled with have been pretty good, and that every time he trains, he improves significantly.
He has a very good left foot, and time will tell at what level he is at and if it fits the A-League... it would only be big if he could play and go really well, he said.
If he comes in and he is not up to the level, it could have a detrimental effect. AFP

Artist Prasad Abu Bakr who is participating in the event for the second consecutive year shares a few of his thoughts with the Daily News.
Nawa Kalakaruwo is the only annual art event that offers an opportunity for emerging artists to showcase their work, happening since 1988. It is due to open again for the 22nd time in Colombo early next week with the participation of a large number of artists  Some of them for the first time and others who have been participating at numerous exhibitions around the country has been selected by the foundation to showcase their work as in other years.
The George Keyt Foundation has been constant in opening up avenues for new artists to emerge through their two highly patronized promotional programmes such as Kala Pola and Nawa Kalakaruwo. However the unique aspect for me as an artist is that it gives artists a platform to show their various creative exercises  which takes a different perspective from the routine painting & drawing aspect because, as in my case, for example, I combine my photography with my childhood ability to paint  creating a brand new form of imagery says the artist who emerged with his all-new creative exercise in recent years and states that it is heading in the right direction where art appreciation is concerned.
Speaking about the confusion some people create by calling his work collage or photomontage  which is a term he too used initially when he held his first collection sponsored by The Alliance Francaise de (Kotte) Colombo in 2016, as he steered along showing his work at numerous exhibitions he came to realize that it was more tilted towards mixed media as there are a lot of creative elements involved in the process of his exercise  his photographic images play a vital role while he enhances and gives his pictures more three dimensional depth by using various other techniques such as painting, drawing, collage etc.
To me, Nawa Kalakaruwo is an ideal platform to present my creative images to be viewed by a larger audience, says Prasad, promoting the event as an all-round artistic exercise that can be utilized by emerging artists to promote themselves.
As the organizers of the event  from the George Keyt Foundation says Nawa Kalakaruwo presents new and interesting paths and different handling of the chosen medium. This exactly is what is interesting about this annual event, that it also opens a fine testing ground for artists like me, who totally into creating an images combining two contrasting art forms, painting and photography and have built an ardent fan base  especially amongst many foreign buyers who find this novel creative exercise much to their entertainment stated the artist.
Nawa Kalakaruwo by itself creates a larger platform for both art enthusiasts and collectors alike to visit, explore and experience the emerging talent of local artists while seeing for themselves new trends and styles totally individualistic. The exhibition also stands out as the one & only annual art show to happen in Colombo or any other part of the country for that matter stresses Prasad adding that the George Keyt Foundation together with Carson Cumberbatch PLC and its subsidiary Carsons Management Services (Pvt) Ltd should be applauded for coming forward in support of the event this year  giving art lovers yet another opportunity to visit the only art event of this caliber which happens once a year only.

Response to Dr. Asoka Thenuwara
Life and suffering in another realm
Dr. Asoka Thenuwara has commented on my recent letter and says that the solace to either form of suffering does not lie in the external world. But my contention now after reading all the letters on this subject is that the main cause and source of mans suffering is the man himself. Three-fourths of mans suffering is man-made. Therefore if the man is controlled mans suffering will come down drastically.
Causes for mans sufferings like a disease, poverty, bad luck, cancer, failures cannot be controlled and there is no alternative but to live with it. This part of suffering can be due to Karma.
In the Middle East crimes like murder, assault, theft, are not heard of due to severe punishments and strict enforcement of the law. If the same thing is done in Sri Lanka all sorts of crimes and offences can be eradicated. Mans suffering is caused by jealousy, negligence, injustice, robbery, theft, murder, dishonesty etc. committed by the man himself.
In good faith, Dr. Asoka Thenuwara recommends Universal Consciousness as a means of understanding life which can be achieved through deep meditation. He advises me to find the Heaven within me. This means Heaven is intangible and mere imaginary, a state of mind.
No one in the whole world knows where heaven is located whether between Mars and Saturn although we have been talking about it daily over 2000 years. Only one out of a thousand will have the freedom and peace of mind like Dr. Thenuwara to meditate to that extent as most of us are burdened with day-to-day problems.
It is always better to prevent it before happening instead of waiting until it happens to accommodate it through Universal Consciousness, which is hard to achieve.
Sri Lanka is a country where the day starts with the preaching of Bana and closing with one murder, one rape and a classic robbery. Religion alone cannot control man. Adequate punishment should be imposed.
Killing a man is as simple as cutting down a tree. A man is killed for simple reasons like jealousy, non-payment of loan, robbery, revenge, political grudges, personal hatred etc due to the inadequacy of punishment. What is more practical is to control the man which should be done by law enforcing authorities.

Clowns or Murderers: Our Hobsons Choice
There is no Viyath Mawatha; it is just a word for a programme. Clearly this is a carrying forward of Mahinda Chintanaya... - Mahinda Rajapaksa (4.7.2018)
The news was sensational, yet it was downplayed. The chief incumbent of a temple in Ratnapura strangled a police sergeant to death. The monk has been absconding after being charged with sexual abuse. The sergeant went to the temple to hand over the summons. He went alone and unarmed; after all, he was going to a temple to meet a monk.
The sergeants screams alerted the neighbours who called 119. When a police team rushed to the temple, the monk greeted them with a hand grenade.
What if this incident happened in a kovil, a mosque or a church What if a Hindu, Muslim or a Christian religious figure strangled a policeman to death with his bare hands and tried to lob a grenade at a police team The media would have talked about nothing else for weeks. Politicians, especially those subsisting on patriotism, would have howled about resurgent Tigers, Islamic terrorists or Christian conspirators. Questions would have been asked about how the grenade was procured and what its procurement portends for national security. But a monk was the culprit, so reportage was muted, and there were no cries of alarm or condemnation. The chief prelates, who make it their business to interfere in secular matters beyond their competence, are yet to say a word about the horrendous incident and what it signals about the current state of Sinhala-Buddhist monkhood.
The suspect monk is now being questioned by the police. Hopefully, after a speedy trial, he will join the 15 other monks serving prison sentences for various crimes including murder. According to the prisons chief, there are also 10 monks in the remand prison.
As President, Mahinda Rajapaksa thought persecution was prosecution and replaced due process with witch-hunts. Now he thinks prosecution is persecution and sees witch-hunts in due process. Addressing a religious ceremony in a temple in Matara last month, the former president depicted monks serving jail sentences as victims of persecution. These days I think it is important to learn how to turn the robe into a jumper, the way things are going. This is a time when 40-50 Buddhist monks are locked up in jails. We have a great responsibility as Buddhists to protect... From one that falsehood he moved seamlessly into another one, this time about the reason for the dearth of new entrants to monkhood. Those days there are nine ten children in a family. Now theres one or two, maximum three. So our race is systematically vanishing. There are economic difficulties. There is also the programme carried out by the government, a very koota (insidious and evil) programme to reduce population.
Mr. Rajapaksa is a master at dog whistling. In that brief statement he alluded to a conspiracy by the current government to eviscerate the monkhood and destroy the Sinhala nation. The caption says it all  Our race is nearing extinction  Mahinda Rajapaksa. Never mind that the ratio of Sinhalese and Buddhists in Sri Lanka has increased consistently from 66.91% and 61.53% in 1881 to 74.9% and 70.1% in 2012. Never mind that there are only 25 monks behind bars and they are there because they have been accused or convicted of crimes. His audience wouldnt know the facts and wouldnt care anyway. His lies fit in with their manufactured reality. (They wouldnt even wonder why Mahinda Rajapaksa has only three children and his even more patriotic brother Gotabhaya just one child. Surely the absence of nine or ten offspring couldnt have been due to economic reasons or the koota doings of the current administration Incidentally, why has no Rajapaksa sibling or offspring entered the monkhood)
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration is a government of and by clowns. There are a million and one truthful, factual accusations that can be made against the administration, starting with its abysmal failure to improve the living conditions of ordinary Lankans. There is no need to resort to incendiary lies, the kind which enabled Black July, 35 years ago. And, yet, incendiary lies rather than facts and figures constitute the bedrock of the Rajapaksa comeback strategy. Are they creating an anti-democratic mindset in the country so that the rapid dismantling of democratic rights and freedoms will have public support
A crime wave
Vendaruwe Upali thera (who advised Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to become even a Hitler and correct the country) is not the only one suffering from Hitler-mania. A tweet by a self-declared Christian (I will refrain from mentioning his name as he has apologised for his praise of Hitler) says Looking at the killings in Sri Lanka, I sometimes wonder who is in charge... The situation is reaching serious levels.
The question is where did this gentleman look to conclude that the situation is reaching serious levels Not facts and figures certainly, because according to statistics there are less murders today (and less grave crime) than there were during the Rajapaksa years.
Sri Lanka is not crime free or violence free. But it is less crime-prone and less-violent than it was four years ago. A fake news pandemic  and not facts on the ground  is responsible for the idea that we are living in an unprecedentedly lawless and bloody time. The aim is political and partisan - exacerbate the feel bad factor, and manufacture a pre-emptive justification for dismantling democratic rights and freedoms under a future Rajapaksa government.
Sometimes memory is an eel. The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government has forgotten its solemn promises to the electorate  the inane plan to build a third airport in Polonnaruwa being the latest case in point. Perhaps in tandem, the electorate has forgotten what life was like under the Rajapaksas. Even such causes celebres as the serial killings of Kotakethana in Kahawatte, the slaying of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, and the brutal murder of British tourist Khuram Shaikh and the gang rape of his Russian fianc are no longer remembered. Equally forgotten are the level of impunity enjoyed by Rajapaksa loyalists  such as Mervyn de Silva; or Julampitiye Amare, who had more than 100 arrest warrants against him, including for murder and rape, yet strutted about in Tangalle resplendent in military fatigues and toting a T56.
Forgetting is an integral component of the Rajapaksa comeback project. The past must be remembered as a time of law, order and discipline; let the present be imaged as a time of chaos and anarchy. After all, if Lankans remember what the past was really like, a majority of them would not want to return there.
Crimes today are more brutal, often sickeningly so, but this too is not a post-Rajapaksa development. That tendency began during the war years. As a police spokesman said in 2012, .the murders committed in recent times have become more gruesome. They cut and chop without a care. Sometime back rape was not followed by murder, however now rape is followed by murder.
The Rajapaksa paradise was a land of crime and impunity, violence and indifference, a place where strong abused, weak endured and everything insalubrious was kept under wraps. When a soldier stationed in Jaffna murdered two of his comrades and killed himself, the Rajapaksa regime responded by imposing a news-ban. When asked about the rape problem in Sri Lanka, the then ambassador (and Rajapaksa first cousin) Jaliya Wickremesuriya smilingly told The Washington Times, oya rapes this and that not taking any place in Sri Lanka We have very disciplined people in Sri Lanka... Like any other country, we have, like couple of cases.
That statement about a couple of rapes was made in 2012. In 2010, three children were raped/abused per day. 1169 child rape cases were reported in 2011  a rate of over three a day. In the first six months of 2012, over 700 cases of child rape/abuse were reported  a rate of four a day. The Rajapaksa governments only solution was a rape-marriage law which, if approved, would have enabled the rapist to escape prosecution by marrying his underage victim. In a related development, the then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa (who is being touted as a kinder gentler alternative to brother Gotabhaya) said, My opinion is that nobody can make men responsible for the violence against women. Women are responsible for it Little wonder, rape proliferated during the Rajapaksa years, far more than before or since.
That was how the crime-fighting Rajapaksas fought crime.
Rajapaksas go together - One Family, One Path, One Goal
Rajapaksas always go together. We dont have divisions like others, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa claimed after Mahinda Rajapaksa reminded his audience that Viyath Maga was Mahinda Chinthanaya by another name. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa can win only if he is anointed by brother Mahinda and assisted by brother Basil. Whatever their personal or other differences, the Rajapaksas are united in a joint enterprise to regain lost power - One Family, One Path, One Goal.
They might succeed, thanks to the infantile conduct of the current administration.
Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, the newly elected president of Mexico had a key campaign slogan. I will not fail you. I will not disappoint you. I will not betray the people.
The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe has done all three. They have forgotten most of their promises and are walking back on some of the implemented ones, such as lifting the ban on Glyphosate. After much procrastination, the government banned female genital mutilation (FGM) in Sri Lanka, but might succumb to pressure from conservative Mullahs and re-permit this atrocious and harmful practice. The government gave up pursuing socially liberal policies fearful of antagonising traditionalists; it gave up on the environment to please multinationals. It succumbs to any bully, from the GMOA to the Chinese.
Todays Sunday Times carries pictures of four of the cheques issued by the China Harbour Engineering Company, effective corroborating The New York Times story. Even more worryingly, it reveals that the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) carried out an investigation about the matter in 2015, and managed to identify those who cashed the cheques. Then the onetime top official of the CBSL i.e. Arjun Mahendran halted the probe unceremoniously. Another chance to clean up the Augean Stable that is Lankan politics was wasted. When this government is buried under the avalanche of its own mistakes, a fitting epitaph would be, And they did nothing.
Three and half years out of power, the Rajapaksas remain unchanged. Violence, verbal or physical, is their first resort. Retired Admiral Sarath Weerasekara has threatened the head of the Human Rights Commission, Dr. Deepika Udagama by calling her a Tiger. When the New York Times piece about Chinese contributions to the presidential campaign coffers of Mahinda Rajapaksa appeared, some SLPP parliamentarians responded by issuing veiled threats against the two local journalists associated with the piece  Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wanaman. That response was a reminder of what awaits the media, and Sri Lanka, if the Rajapaksas return to power, especially under a President Gotabhaya, the man who once said, If they harm me, it is the country they harm.
Clowns or murderers, such is the choice before the country currently. Weimer Republic was a pretty broken down place, but Hitlers Thousand Year Reich (which mercifully for everyone ended in just 12 years) was a hell beyond even the most sadistic of human imaginings.

From  commitment  to excellence
Head Girl of Anula Vidyalaya Nugegoda Oshadini Piumika firmly believes that our actions have great power if we work together. Perfect Prefects features Piumika who feels it is never too late to make a change.
We need to be there for each other. We need to get off our high horse sometimes.
Commitment is so important in life. Living in a world full of troubles and difficulties, if we think of anothers welfare while also thinking of ours, and if we can support each other, keeping in mind to do what is right all the time, then we can as young people influence our generation and the generations to come. It is so important to actually listen to each other and put our ego aside. Other people have something to bring to the table. They also have a point. They also have a perspective on the matter. Take a moment to be patient and listen to others ideas. When facing a problem I examine all aspects of the problem and then take a decision as what to do, said Piumika.
Always change
Integrity is important in life. Your reputation matters. People can always change.
I am the leader of my younger sisters at Anula Vidyalaya. It is important to be helpful and well- mannered and not rude and obstinate because rudeness does not help at all. Being helpful goes a long way because what goes around comes around. Trust is so important if you get into the habit of lying and if you go back on your word or if you are dishonest, you are going to lose a lot of potential friends and supporters, stated Piumika.
If you take any statesman of distinction, manners and politeness are words that immediately come to mind. They are men and women who have rubbed shoulders with some of the most well-regarded individuals in history.
Being courteous and obliging to all is the hallmark of a good leader. Being well disciplined shows that you have self- control. Respecting those who are more experienced than you does you a lot of good since that benefits you, explained Piumika.
United we stand, divided we fall. We are all familiar with this adage. But how many of us put this into practice
Poverty is, without doubt, an extremely serious problem. Starvation is painful. These problems cannot be solved by a leader no matter how brilliant he or she is. Like I said before a commitment is important. We need to unite as a group of people. We need to be loyal to our community. We need to create a ripple effect here, pointed out Piumika.
Bad habits
Procrastination is the undoing of many of our fellow human beings. Once it gets into a habit, it can be a silent killer.
Procrastination is a factor when handling pressure. If you delay working, you have to face the penalty. You can make your life a lot easier if you do your work on time without putting it off. The more you delay the more you put yourself under pressure. You need to have a positive mindset. That will help you overcome your procrastination. Do things on time, explained Piumika.
One of the first lessons anyone should be taught in life is that if you feel good about yourself then others feel good around you.
Enthusiasm is so important because it is infectious. If you are enthusiastic about what you are doing, then others around you also feel good about themselves and they feel good about you. Being positive is also important because no one is on the side of someone disgruntled, added Piumika.
What comes first
Family always should come first. They have a duty towards you and you have a duty towards them.
Family time is important to me. The little things I do with my family are so important, and though I attach a lot of importance to my duties, I always help my mother with gardening and share memories with my sister. These leisure activities make me happy. Doing my advanced levels in the bio- stream, I take an avid interest in science. Being curious and inquisitive I always keep myself updated on scientific discoveries, said Piumika.
Piumika has a solid foundation in life. And she is who she is because of her parents and school.
My parents and my Principal will always be my greatest teachers and leaders. My father was in the Navy and knows how to handle a platoon. My mother is a housewife but is strong-willed and can run the house. The both of them have taught me what true love is. My principal is an extremely versatile and remarkable lady. Her advice is spot on and has helped me a lot, stated Piumika.
Piumika also added that being appointed Head Prefect was an unbelievable day and one that she will never forget. That was an unforgettable day.

Completing NES, NTFI within  time-frame vital - Chrisso de Mel
It is imperative that the ongoing projects such as the NES (National Export Strategy) and the National Trade Facilitation Initiatives (NTFI)aimed at establishing a Trade Information Portal and the National Single window which falls in line with the WTO Trade facilitation agreement, are completed and implemented according to the proposed time-frame, if we are to gain the advantage and be in front of competition as an international trading partner, said Chrisso de Mel, Chairman, Sri Lanka Shippers Council.
He made these comments at the 48th AGM Post Business session of the Sri Lanka Shippers Council in Colombo last week.
He said the shipping community stays committed to ensure that these initiatives will see the light of day.
The Shippers Council has always fully engaged and played a pivotal role on the ongoing initiatives of the Sri Lankan government. Throughout the past year we, the private sector have invested our valuable time in discussions and planning with the Public offices such as the EDB, Sri Lanka Customs, Department of commerce and many other agencies such as Donor agencies, technical committees and their project offices to ensure the work in progress is completed in a timely manner.
He added, We may have the best ideas and strategies to grow our exports and be successful in International trade but unless we usher in discipline, trust and respect to human life and nature, we will not have a future. My task is to bring you, to realization, and shape your understanding, that it is time that we learn from the past and make the necessary changes.
De Mel was also concerned about the fast diminishing ethics and values in our society, which is a serious issue for businesses as well. People have not only lost the value and purpose of life but also the right spirit in which business should be carried out.
We have almost come to terms that we have to remain helpless whilst all the injustice takes place around us. We are almost deaf to what we hear, be it corruption, abuse, violence or hate. We consider all of them to be, a part and parcel of life, and that you cannot beat them, but you could only join them or do likewise.
We also must be aware that there is something called fake news and therefore not rush to believe in everything that our ears and eyes can pick up, that is penetrated into our minds and has influenced our thinking. Time and time again we have thrashed politicians at will, standing at these podiums or other forums such as this, but nothing has changed. Because it is almost a trend these days where business leaders are helplessly running to politicians like headless chicken looking for favour and unfair advantage.
But they get frustrated and complain when others do the same. If a politician agrees to tango with them, they consider him good, but if not they label him as corrupt. Through our individual shortsightedness, we have traded our strength to stand together as one and hold the administrators accountable but rather we have opted to remain divided and weak in separate silos, he added.

## Title: CURB SMALL ARMS TRAFFICKING

CURB SMALL ARMS TRAFFICKING
Sri Lanka has been fighting against the global trafficking of arms, arms, drugs and wildlife for some time. During the 30-year war, Sri Lanka was unable to fully cope with it. Post-war Sri Lanka has also been unable to cope with it for reasons which can be addressed immediately. These include the lack of political will, unwillingness to engage with the international community and lack of human and financial resource availability. Sri Lankan authorities should know that such transnational organised crime taking place in the country cannot be tackled without international support.
Addressing transnational organised crime taking place in post-war Sri Lanka should be one of the priorities of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL). Otherwise it will sabotage ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts and badly impact on the countrys human rights record. Addressing this important issue directly will improve the human security afforded to citizens. There are seven essential issues associated with human security: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security and political security.
Sri Lanka ended its 30-year armed conflict between government Security Forces and the LTTE in 2009. By the end of the war, Sri Lanka had almost cleared the threat to national security. But unfortunately, post-war Sri Lanka has yet failed to address the issues relating to human security and up to now, no lasting solutions have been found to address them. During the war, Sri Lanka took some impressive action, particularly against the illicit small arms trade. Soon after the war ended in 2009, such initiatives were stopped. Now post-war Sri Lanka is facing a spiral of crime taking place on a daily basis.
NCAPISA 2005-2008
When the UNs Programme of Action (PoA) on small arms and light weapons was established in 2003, Sri Lanka actively engaged with the PoA. Sri Lanka carried out certain activities with the PoA which benefitted the country at large and were praised by the international community. With the support of the international community, Sri Lanka established the National Commission Against Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms (NCAPISA) in 2005 under the instructions of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The NCAPISA, with the support of civil society, collected over 35,000 illicit small arms and light weapons in the country, except in the war-torn Northern and Eastern Provinces, and destroyed them at Independence Square on International Gun Destruction Day on July 7, 2006. In 2006, the first Review Conference of the PoA was presided over by Sri Lanka which brought honour to the country. The then Sri Lankan Ambassador to the US Prasad Kariyawasam presided over the Review Conference.
Between November 2006 and April 2007, NCAPISA carried out a survey on the Prevalence of Illicit Small Arms, which was the first in the South Asian region. The survey report was published in 2008 with important recommendations for the NCAPISA, Executive and Parliament, Defence, Public Security and Law and Order Ministry, Security Forces, Police, Civil Security Department, Justice Ministry and Attorney Generals Department, Prisons, Government Analyst, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Health Services, Customs, Forestry, Agriculture and Wildlife Departments, Education Ministry, media and civil society.
Post-war Sri Lanka
The war ended in 2009 and at the same time the NCAPISA stopped functioning. It was unable to carry out any recommendations mentioned in the 2008 Survey Report of the Commission. From 2008 until now, neither has the government nor has any other party raised the importance of the re-establishment of the NCAPISA in post-war Sri Lanka. If this particular Commission existed today, the country could have avoided certain grave crimes. Not only are people getting killed, but also getting disabled physically or mentally and or both, due to such violence. Small arms cause 90 percent of civilian casualties. According to Sri Lankas Police Department crime statistics, 35,978 grave cries were reported in 2017.
Post-war Sri Lanka is directly or indirectly linked to the illicit trafficking of drugs and wildlife on a daily basis. These two illegal activities have direct links to illicit arms which is linked to the global arms trade. In other words, these three illegal activities are always interlinked to one another. During and after the war in Sri Lanka, underworld groups, political groups and certain individuals received various types of small arms through several means. It is believed that the LTTE sold their weapons to the South, military soldiers smuggled them, and previous governments distributed weapons to politicians but never collected them, and arms were smuggled through and airports and harbours.
Due to the circulation of illicit weapons in post-war Sri Lanka, underworld activities such as drug and wildlife trafficking, theft, ransom demands, contract killings, rape and various other crimes are soaring.
SL needs international support
Post-war Sri Lanka alone will not be able to eradicate illicit arms trafficking as mentioned earlier.
The international community has already pledged its support to Sri Lanka on this important matter, if Sri Lanka is willing to join this effort. Sri Lanka should show genuine commitment towards the matter and should carry out two important acts. The Survey Report of the NCAPISA recommended (page 18) that the Foreign Ministry should continue to play a strong and active role on behalf of the Sri Lankan government in strengthening international and regional instruments to control small arms, including the UN PoA and the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).
The ATT, which came into force in 2014, promotes responsibility, transparency and accountability in the global arms trade. Further this treaty is critical to stopping weapons falling into the wrong hands. The ATT is particularly concerned about women and children who account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict and armed violence. Further, the ATT and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 share common goals and purpose.
It is unfortunate that since 2009, post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with the UN PoA and the ATT. Due to the fact that post-war Sri Lanka did not engage with these two international instruments, the country itself failed to address the issue of proliferation of illicit small arms.
From next year onwards, Sri Lanka will start hosting the worlds largest international conferences like the Conference of the Parties (CoP) of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The CITES always encourages governments around the world to fight against the illicit arms trade which has a direct link to wildlife poaching. Before the 18 CoP of the CITES, Sri Lanka as the host country should show commitment on the matter and accede to the ATT.
The way forward
Post-war Sri Lanka should immediately accede to the ATT and re-engage with the UN PoA programme this year. By engaging with these two international instruments the GoSL will be able to receive the necessary technical and financial assistance from the international community and carry out some of important activities in 2018 and 2019. These are: a) re-establishment of the NCAPISA (reviewing the previous mandate of the Commission with a new work plan); b) carrying out an islandwide survey on illicit small arms and light weapons; c) amending the Firearms (Amendment) Act No 22 of 1996 or bringing in a new Act on Firearms; d) reviewing the recommendations set out in the 2008 Survey Report of the NCAPISA; e) a public campaign against proliferation of illicit small arms; d) destruction of small and light weapons recovered by the Security Forces from the LTTE as well as destruction of other illicit arms at a public place. This could be organised during the 10th anniversary of the end of the war between the LTTE and government Security Forces.
Carrying out such activities will help to improve Sri Lankas human rights record and strengthen ongoing peace and reconciliation efforts. Post-war Sri Lanka should look for permanent solutions to the issues concerning human security rather than survive on day-to-day short-term political tactics on such important issues.
If post-war Sri Lanka fails to address issues relating to human security, no doubt the country will head towards a lawless state.
Implementation of the death penalty alone will not bring the desired results and that will only bring adverse publicity for the country.

Deliberations on  Sinhala Grammar
Viyarana Vivarana a book covering some debates that took place from the 1920s to the 1930s on Sinhala Grammar will be launched at the National Archives Auditorium July 18 at 2.30 pm.
The manuscript of the book, which the late Pracheena Pandith Bemthota Enulasiri Dharmawardhana authored and published by Sarasavi Publishers, last year, was prepared for publication by Dr Nande Dharmawardena.
Pandith Enulasiri Dharmawardhana was nourished in the literary traditions set by the well-known centres of learning that prevailed in the Buddhist temples of the south. The author associated with the Bemthota-Yaathramulla Vanavasa group of temples, and the Vidyalankara Pirivena, where Rhys Davis, Wilhelm Geiger, Sir D. B Jayatilleke and many other scholars also learnt their Praacheena Bhasha or oriental languages, as they were known at the time.
In addition to his duties as a School Teacher, Pandith Dharmawadhana served in the pioneer editorial team of the Sinhala Dictionary, with Sir D. Baron Jayatilleke as the Editor in Chief, during the period 1932-1938.
The debates involve Sinhala literary figures like Munidasa Kumaranathunga, Baron Jayatilleke and others as well as the author.
A previous book by Pandith Dharmawadhana dealing with the literary debate on Kumaratunga Munidasas accusation that the Ven. Sri Rahula was a plagiarist, entitled Kukavi Vaada Sathya Prakashanee (Godage Publishers) was published in 2011. The book was reviewed by Prof. K. N. O. Dharmadasa, the late Prof. Tissa Kariyawasam, and the Late Prof. A.V. Suraweera at its launch.
Prof. K.N.O. Dharmadasa and Prof. Kulathilaka Kumarasinghe will deliver specialist orations. Prof. J.B. Dissanayake will deliver the oration from the chair.
The new book which Dr Nande Dharmawardana arduously edited using an unpublished draft manuscript written in 1970 will be reviewed by Prof. J.B. Dissanayake, Prof. K.N.O. Dharmadasa, Prof. Sandagomi Coperahewa and Prof. Kulathunga Kumarasinghe.
The material, culled from the literary pages of the Swadesha Mithrayaa newspaper and other sources, gives a detailed view of the thinking of the Sinhala Scholars of the 1920s -- 1930s era. Such material has been hitherto inaccessible to the general public. As the first half of the 20th century was the formative period of modern Sinhalese, this period with its many literary debates, and this book itself should be of great interest to literary historians, linguists, grammarians as well as the interested public.

Dept. of Commerce wins historic export judgement in US Trade Courts
Sri Lanka has won the first ever revocation of countervailing duty imposed in US for a Lankan export, thanks to the continued pursuit of the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
This will greatly help our Ministrys efforts to enhance manufacturing exports, specially rubber products. This will help in strengthening our trade with US and will help in achieving the $3 billion export target to US very soon. We thank the people of US for looking for Sri Lankan products, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
This is Sri Lankas first international victory on countervailing duties especially for a well-known rubber product export, Director General of Commerce of Sri Lanka Sonali Wijeratne said.
The US Court of International Trade, on July 11, 2018 has ruled that the 0.95 percent countervailing duty attributed to the guaranteed price scheme on import of off-road OTR tyres from Sri Lanka be removed. Interestingly, as a result, not only 0.95% duty is out but a larger, 2.18% countervailing duty on the imports of off-the-road (OTR) rubber tyres from Sri Lanka to the United States too will be eliminated as a result due to the operation of WTO Agreements once the 0.95% duty is removed. Sri Lankas solid tyre exports to US has been on a growing trend-US $ 58.21 million in 2012, $ 56.15 million in 2013, $ 50.70 million in 2014, $ 53.22 million in 2015, $ 60.38 million in 2016 and further strengthening last year to US $ 69.04 million. Total Lankan exports to US last year was almost close to $3 billion.In 2017, it was $ 2.9 billion, which was an increase from 2016s $2.8 billion. Total bilateral trade with US increased by 12% to US $ 3.7 billion last year, from 2016s $3.3 billlion.
Based on a countervailing duty petition filed by US industry at the US Department of Commerce (USDOC) and US International Trade Commission (USITC) alleging that producers of off-the-road tires in Sri Lanka benefits from subsidies provided by the government and the subsidized imports cause injury to the domestic rubber industry of the United States, the US Department of Commerce initiated a subsidies and countervailing duty (CVD) investigation aiming at imposition of countervailing duty on imports of OTR tyres from Sri Lanka to the United States.
The USDOC has used the subsidy programs of exemptions on fiscal levies on capital and intermediate goods, Tax Concessions for Exporters of non-traditional products, and guaranteed price scheme for rubber given to rubber small holders by the Sri Lankan government to calculate the countervailing duty margin.
After the investigations, the US Department of Commerce on January 4, 2017, announced its affirmative final determinations in the countervailing duty (CVD) investigations and imposed 2.18 per cent countervailing duty on imports of OTR tyres from Sri Lanka. This margin consists of 0.41% duty on Exemptions on fiscal levies on capital and intermediate goods, 0.95% on Guaranteed price scheme for rubber given to rubber small holders and 0.82% duty on Tax Concessions for Exporters of non-traditional products.
On behalf of the Sri Lanka government, the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Attorney Generals Department and Camso Loadstar (the affected exporter in Sri Lanka), made a number of submissions to the US Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission in the investigation stage rebutting the petitioners claims. After imposition of the countervailing duty of 2.18 percent, the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka, with the assistance of other line agencies and the local company, took necessary measures to challenge the decision by the USDOC at the US Court of International Trade.
As a result of effective interventions by the Department of Commerce in the appeal procedures, the US Court of International Trade ruled that the 0.95 percent countervailing duty attributed to the guaranteed price scheme be removed. With this removal, the overall countervailing duty rate on import of OTR tyres from Sri Lanka to the US imposed by the USDOC has now fallen down below the minimum threshold of 2 percent to impose countervailing duty on developing countries as specified in the WTO Agreements. Therefore, the imposition of 2.18 percent countervailing duty on export of OTR Tyres from Sri Lanka to the USA shall now be terminated and not be applied anymore.

In the adaptations, new characters and situations have been incorporated particularly to facilitate an intellectual and entertaining discourse with the Sri Lankan child.
Satirical exposure
Punchi Apata Dan Therei (We know it Now) is a prescribed text for Grade six drama and theatre and Grade nine Sinhala Language and literature.
Vikurthi is an original play and is a satirical exposure of hapless generation of youth whose lives were dominated by the incessant struggle between the parents aspirations and the youths abilities and preferences. In the 1980s, at the time the drama was conceived, the widespread social tendency was that the aspiring parents trying to achieve the missed opportunities of their own lives through their children. Consequently, the children were forced to study for competitive government examinations such as GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L), specifically in the Science Stream disregarding their aptitudes and available resources at respective schools and the universities. The play discusses in depth how this anti-social process denied the youth of their own life, which in turn deeply affects them in many ways. The production is a semi-musical which is a familiar theatrical experience to the local audiences.
Foreign audience
Vikurthi was first performed in 1982 in Colombo and since then had performed more than 1500 performances in Sri Lanka in the last 36 years. The play is considered a landmark theatre production and as a result, Vikurthi became a trendsetter of a new style of modern theatre in Sri Lanka. It is also considered as a pioneering effort of youth theatre concept in Sri Lanka. The professional theatre group of Somalatha Subasinghe Play House has performed Vikurthi in English in major cities in India and Australia in 2000. The play has been received well by the foreign audiences.
Vikurthi is a prescribed text for drama and theatre for GCE O/L and the performance will be a good opportunity for students, who are sitting for GCE O/L examination shortly, to watch the play with their parents.
The production style of these plays has been developed so as to give the audiences an aesthetic journey of entertainment.
Its possible that you grew up with Somalatha Subasinghes plays. So now its time to introduce your children to them. And if neither you nor your child has ever seen them, then it really is not an experience you should miss.
The cast includes Wickrama Seneviratne, Mayura Perera, Saviour Kanishka, Thilakshini Ratnayake, Kumudu Wickramathanthri, Geetha Alahakoon, Thiwanka Ranasinghe, Dhanushka Dias, Nipuni Sharada, Chamara Gamaathige, Sameera Lakmal Wimalasiri, Keshika Koralage, Nayathara de Silva, Nipuni Sharada, Pramod Edirisinghe, Renuka Liyanage, Dilip Kumara Koralage, Susith Ishantha and Kesara Hasarinda.
Somalatha Subasinghe Play House (SSPH) was established in 1981 by the late Somalatha Subasinghe as a voluntary organisation to further course of theatre for Children and Youth in Sri Lanka. Over the years, it has produced a repertoire of internationally acclaimed theatre for Children and Youth and award-winning mainstream theatre productions. The professional theatre group has showcased Sri Lankan culture at a number of international Childrens theatre festivals in Europe and Asia.

France gives World Cup winners  a heroes welcome home
Paris, Tuesday: The World Cup-winning French team returned home to a heroes welcome on Monday, parading down the Champs-Elysees as hundreds of thousands of cheering fans gave a raucous welcome to the countrys newest idols.
After overcoming a determined Croatia to win 4-2 in Sundays final in Russia, the team came back to euphoric crowds in Paris hoping to catch a glimpse of the players that have captured the nations imagination.
The footballers did not disappoint, passing the golden World Cup trophy from player to player as they jumped and danced on an open-air bus with World Champions emblazoned on its side.
Wow, it was completely crazy! They are too beautiful, France is beautiful! said Julia Cohen, 28, after seeing players pass by on the Champs-Elysees, the gathering point for all national celebrations. The parade was under heavy police guard, with 2,000 officers deployed in the capital to ensure the safety of the estimated 300,000 people who turned up. Above the partying crowds, nine jets from the Patrouille de France, the air forces acrobatic unit, did an honorary flyover trailing blue, white and red smoke.
Allez les Bleus!
After leaving the Champs-Elysees, the players changed into custom-made blue suits before being welcomed at the Elysee Palace by President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte, who were also decked out in blue for the occasion.
Macron has already promised the Legion of Honour for the victors exceptional services to the country, an award given to the legendary team that won Frances first World Cup title in 1998.
The first couple then posed with the team as they sang the Marseillaise national anthem and waved scarves for a joyous group photo, before heading inside for a private meeting.Thanks to you all! Macron told the team after gathering again outside. This team is beautiful because you are united!
Midfielder Paul Pogba, despite his voice nearly failing him, then proved himself a showman off the pitch as well as on by leading the guests in an impromptu celebratory rap punctuated by Allez les Bleus!
Its true, we went on the pitch, and we said, Were going to crush them all! he said.
Thank you
Nearly 3,000 guests were received in the Elysee gardens, including around 1,000 youths from local football clubs such as Bondy, the gritty Paris suburb whose towering housing blocks produced rising star forward Kylian Mbappe. Some of the children even got to touch the famed trophy, which captain Hugo Lloris handed around.
The guests were also treated to the beats of DJ Snake, who has worked with pop stars including Lady Gaga and is part of the Pardon My French collective of French DJs.
Mbappe, who applied the coup de grace in the final to cement his place as a new global superstar at just 19, said he achieved what he had set out to do -- win the World Cup.
We are proud to make the French happy, he told French channel TF1.
Striker Antoine Griezmann said: Frankly, personally, its not real yet. This cup weighs a lot.
We are trying to give a good image for France, for French players. I hope that lots of young people will have seen this match and do the same, he added.
Now, the players are on holiday, Philippe Tournon, head of press for the team, told AFP. Macron had already celebrated with the team on Sunday -- even doing dab dance moves with players in a video that has gone viral -- after attending the final in Moscow.
Some analysts believe the 40-year-old centrist will benefit from the feel-good factor sweeping France, with Macron able to show a common touch after months of criticism from his opponents that he is distant and elitist.
Commentators have also focused on the outpouring of patriotism and sense of national unity created by the multi-ethnic French team, many of whose stars including Pogba and Mbappe hail from deprived and often overlooked suburbs of Paris.
Disappointed fans
Macron will be relieved that joyous and occasionally chaotic celebrations across the country on Sunday night passed off without any major incident following a string of terror attacks in France since 2015 that have claimed nearly 250 lives.
Some fans outside the luxury Hotel de Crillon were however disappointed after a lengthy wait to see the team, and vented their frustration on police.
Bottles were thrown, people shouted and booed angrily, before police finally broke up the crowd and forced them to disperse.
Overall, some 292 people were arrested nationwide with 31 people, including eight minors, having their detention extended on suspicion of involvement in incidents in Paris during the victory celebrations, a Paris prosecutor said late Monday. AFP

India made a sound start in their first innings by scoring 92 for one in reply to Sri Lankas first innings score total of 244 on the first day of the first test match played in Nondescripts Cricket Club on Tuesday. Indian skipper Anuj Rawat lashed a half century scoring 63 and was involved in a partnership of 89 with Atharwa Taides 26 runs before. Anuj was dismissed by Kalhara Senarathne
Sri Lankas first innings of 244 was built on a solid knock of 69 from Pasindu Sooriyabandara and a stroke filled 39 off 55 balls by opener Nishan Madushka and Nipun Dananjaya scoring 39 runs batting at number three. Sndun Mendis survived a confident run out attempt at 39 but failed to score a half century when Harsh Tyagi foxed him into edging a catch to Taide just before tea.
However, the wickets continued to tumble as Harsh Tyagi began to make inroads into the Lankan middle order batting getting three wickets including Pasindu and Sadun followed by the next four batsmen getting out cheaply.
Harsh Tyagi was the pick of the Indian bowlers claiming four wickets for 92supported by fellow spinner Ayush Badoni who ended up with four wickets for 24 runs.

Long-lost sisters  find out they're neighbors
31-year-old Hillary Harris was given up for adoption when she was just a baby. Her and her brother, 33-year-old Tyler Hardy were adopted in 1987 by Lee Hardy, 65, and his late wife Rochelle.
Hillary began trying to track down her biological family in 2011, when she fell pregnant with daughter Stella. Her adoption agency revealed the names of her birth parents but she was heartbroken to discover her father Wayne Clouse had died in 2002.
However, when reading her late fathers obituary, Hillary discovered that she had two half sisters  Dawn Johnson, 50 and Renee Diericks, 49.
Hillary, from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, tried tracking them down on Facebook, but to no avail.
Then in June 2017, a woman named Dawn and her partner, 53-year-old Kurt Casperson in next door. After discovering that Dawn was from Greenwood  the same place that her half sister lived, according to the adoption file  Dawn joked to her partner that she could be her sister.
It wasnt until she saw Dawns surname Johnson written on a package that the realisation dawned that she probably was. Hillary was too afraid to ask her in person, so sent her a text asking who her father was. It was Wayne. They had the same father.
For me this is 100 per cent fate. I was so sad when I discovered my biological father had passed away, says Hillary.
But by meeting Dawn, I feel like I have all the answers I will ever need. Shes the missing puzzle piece I have been looking for for so many years. For me something first clicked in June when I first found out her name was Dawn and she was from Greenwood, Hillary continues. My husband and me joked for a few weeks that she was my sister but we didnt know her last name. One day she got a delivery of shingles for her roof and it was addressed to Dawn Johnson, the same name in Waynes obituary. I began to shake. It was such an intense moment.
Hillary had to ask her straight away, but was afraid to do it face to face.
It was late at night, but I finally got the courage to text her and ask her who her dad was, she explains.
She confirmed it was Wayne. I told her we had a lot to talk about and she said, We have the same dad dont we Ever since then weve grown so close, reveals Hillary..
When I met my birth mum I thought I would have this tingly feeling and an immediate bond and I didnt. With Dawn I felt an immediate connection.
Dawn didnt grow up with her dad, but formed a relationship with him in later life. Its such a weird coincidence, she says. Of all the hundreds of thousands of homes we bought a house that shares a driveway with my sister. I was ecstatic and so was my sister Renee. She couldnt believe it. After meeting her biological mother, Hillary discovered she and her brother Tyler, a factory worker, were born as a result of an affair with Wayne.
Tyler was reluctant to meet Dawn at first, he Hillary says he eventually agreed to meet his half sibling. Hillary and Tyler plan to undergo DNA tests to officially confirm that Dawn and Renee are their siblings. We would hope to DNA tests soon but were in no rush, she says. My brother has met Dawn and said he would have no problem providing his DNA.
Dawn has two sons  29-year-old Todd and 27-year-old Tyler  and shes enjoyed getting to know her new niece, seven-year-old Stella, and 44-year-old brother-in-law Lance.
I have become so close to Stella, Dawn reveals.
I had only ever had boys so it is so fun to have a little girl playing in the front yard. Hopefully my boys will be able to meet the whole family soon.
Hillary confirms that Stella is a massive fan of Dawn: Stella just loves Dawn. She thinks she so fun and has loved getting to know her and Kurt. I think all our bad luck with weird neighbors finally turned around because I feel so lucky to have found Dawn.

Low-cost method for PC Elections
A senior retired engineer friend of mine has raised a few concerns on my proposal on the above subject that appeared in the press recently. I take the liberty to enlist my responses to him for the benefit of the readers and the authorities concerned
The proposal, in fact, calls for a robust selection procedure for preparing a District Party Merit List for each District, based on a set of compulsory eligibility criteria laid down by the Election Commission itself followed by a scientifically structured interview process for eligible applicants by a special interview panel of the parties concerned.
This procedure should automatically make lobbying and favouritism a disqualification.
Also, any application that doesnt meet any one of the eligibility criteria will get rejected by the returning officer during nomination time, ensuring a viable choice for the voter. A comprehensive article by the writer on the said selection procedure was also published in the press both in Sinhala and English.
It is pertinent to repeat that at much larger Provincial and National level, voters have proved to be poor electors when it comes to the election of individual candidates, as they are swayed by the offer of various goodies and wide-ranging bribes by unscrupulous candidates. Besides, voters have no thorough knowledge of the core competencies of the candidates even if they are from the electorate.
However, voter decision on which party to vote has been more rational throughout the past.
Instability in Provincial Councils
This parochial concept founded on maintaining an absolute majority in the Council for all purposes is not in keeping with the principles of a liberal democracy where a healthy debate is always welcome. Hung or unstable Councils will become misnomers when professionals with the country at heart deliberate and decide on the best-fine-tuned options for the Council/Parliament/country.
Campaign funding by individual candidates
Since the parties will do the selection and election of candidates (District party merit list), the entire campaign expenditure should be borne by a Centralized Party Campaign Fund (CPCF) through which accountable funds shall be allocated to each candidate based on rational criteria evolved by the parties themselves. As a result, the contesting candidates will not be required to spend their own money. However, they can assist to raise funds which have to be channelled through the CPCF. This will also enable the Election Commission to monitor the campaign expenditure of parties methodically. The introduction of District Party merit list will not only attract genuine contestants who are not financially strong but will also enable the Elections Department to save substantial time, money and human effort by doing away with the cumbersome counting of preference votes.
The similarity with Mixed Voting system
Even under the Mixed System, it is the party that selects the candidate for the area.
Further, in a small country saturated with a 4 tiered (Exe. President, National Parliament, 9 Provincial Councils with 9 mini-Parliaments and 9,000 strong Local Government members) political administration pyramid, the tiers can be easily charged with specific role responsibilities to avoid duplication of functions and make the system more efficient and productive. As a result, it is not compulsory for PC members to visit the local areas to identify and solve local level problems.
In such a scenario, Provincial Councillors can be confined to their roles as Provincial Law/Policymakers/monitors/implementers while the Local Govt. members would identify and feed the higher level with their necessary budgetary requirements to solve local level problems. The huge network of 14,000 strong Grama Niladaris combined with the 9,000 strong Local Govt. members is more than ample to identify and cater to the local needs which are any way declining due to advances in communication technology, systems, procedures and transport. Moreover, the print and electronic media and the NGOs have already become positive agents in identifying and in many instances even solving local level issues.
Ad hoc ratios and bonus seats
At PC and National level elections, all votes should be considered as cast by Sri-Lankans. In our view, only this concept can iron out the elusive issue of voting based on ethnicity, religion, cast etc. The application of proportionate arithmetic in a cut and dry scientific manner, to determine the no. of seats won in a District by each party, will ensure an equal value for each Sri Lankan vote in a District. The delimitation exercise should generate the pre-determined number of seats allocated to each District. Thus, formulae such as ad-hoc Ratios and bonus seats not scientifically founded on empirical evidence and research being mere trial and error mechanisms, should not be used to strike a balance in a liberal democratic process of exercising voter franchise.

Mandelas Legacy for Reconciliation
Message by Former President of Sri Lanka Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR)
"It is an honour to be a part of the commemoration of the universal symbol of freedom, ethnic harmony, unity, and reconciliation," - Nelson Mandela on the centenary of his birth anniversary.
Mandelas legacy has inspired not only South African society damaged by Apartheid but also every mass movement around the globe that fought for human freedom and dignity by celebrating ethnic diversity as a virtue that helps override the challenges.
He was committed to democratic values and advocated human dignity and equity. He personally experienced the pain of social repression. Consequently, he identified and addressed the root causes of human suffering.
Initially as a freedom fighter, then as a politician, eventually as a charismatic, world-renowned statesman who initiated an influential international movement, The Elders, dedicated to social justice and the dignity of humanity, Mandela showed us through personal example the qualities of true leadership. He has demonstrated the importance of unity among diverse communities. He has proved by actions, no power on this earth can destroy the thirst for human dignity".
Mandela has edified us during the debate in South Africas Parliament while speaking on the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on February 1999, Reconciliation  [is] inseparable from the achievement of a non-racial, democratic, and united nation affording common citizenship, rights and obligations to each and every person, and respecting the rich diversity of our people.
Mandela was one of the greatest human being of our time. Not only he fought for what was right, he was also amazingly forgave his enemies.
As a nation emerging from an armed conflict, we need to work tirelessly together to overcome the multiplicity of challenges facing us. We have many lessons to be learned from Mandelas legacy. As he told us, reconciliation requires that we work together to defend our democracy and humanity proclaimed by our constitution.
Let us learn, understand and transmit to succeeding generations the timeless legacy Mandela left us and march undaunted toward our goal of a united, strong and prosperous nation.

Minister calls for strict rules to control crime wave
Strict rules need to be in place to control the crime wave in the country, Leader of the House and Public Enterprises and Kandy City Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He said the government has taken action to curb underworld operations.
The minister was speaking at the launch of Lakdiriya, an enterprise loan scheme in Kandy, encouraging small and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
Under the first stage of the programme, an initiative of the minister, 300 people were granted loans. The only government that rules the country according to Buddhist principles is this Good Governance Government, he said.
The minister said today there was discipline in the country.
The government is taking steps to eradicate underworld operations in the country unlike before when the previous government supported underworld operations. This is why many crimes were committed in the past. The underworld committed crimes and the government safeguarded the underworld. The murders of Pradeep Ekneligoda and Wasim Thajudin are the best examples, he said.
Our government does not support the underworld because of good governance practices. Today our country is accepted internationally.
Referring to the loan scheme, the minister said the public does not have a clear understanding of available loan schemes in the country.
Currently, our country has about 100 bank loan schemes. Therefore, we are taking steps to take these banking services to the rural areas. We have understood that people in the villages are ruled by scammers who loan money on high interest rates. Some people get a five percent interest rate per month. Some get loans from banks at low interest rates and give to the poor at a high interest rate. Innocent people fall prey to these scammers because of the lack of knowledge on loan schemes available from proper organisations, he added. The minister added that there is a huge debate in the country about the governments decision to enforce the death penalty on criminals.
Kandy was the last kingdom to be ruled by kings. Even during that era, executions were carried out to keep the nation at peace and in order. As a good governance government, when seeing the crime wave sweeping the country, we have understood the importance of implementing strict rules and regulations. We see children getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. It is the duty of parents to keep a watchful eye over children. Prevention should start from home, he added.

Seven Sri Lankan fishermen who were reported missing in the sea off Maldives since June 30, returned to the country yesterday.
The fishing boat - Sinhdur 2, left the Galle Fisheries Harbour on June 14.They lost contact with the Galle harbour after June 30 and were unable to locate their whereabouts for nearly three days.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry said they could not track the fishermen as the battery of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) faltered and the communication barred as a result. The Fisheries Ministry said the fishermen were found close to the Maldives.
The VMS is a satellite - based monitoring system which at regular intervals provides data to the fisheries authorities on the location, course and speed of vessels.The fishermen who arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) said that the VMS failed and alleged that if it was working properly, they could have been tracked and rescued easily.
Fisheries Department Director General Prasanna Ginige said the radio system was also not working and there was no communication with the radio unit of the Fisheries Department.
Ginige said however the Fisheries, Foreign Affairs Ministries and the Maldivian Embassy took every initiative to bring them back to the country.
He said that India and the Maldives assisted the authorities to locate the missing fishermen.
Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said that the Ministry would take all possible measures to avoid a similar situation in the future.
He said a new unit with smart and new technology will be established to ensure the safety of the fishermen and added that a communication officer and a controller will be appointed to look into it. Minister Zoysa said that measures have also been taken to provide VMS to even small boats with the support of the Australian Ambassador.

The nitty-gritty  of Indian facial makeup
Facial makeup is an important and a separate art form, for any performing art. The role of facial makeup plays an important role in Cinema, Teledrama, stage drama, dance drama, and different dance fields.
Any dance form whether it is classical, or folk, or ritual or creativity or even fusion dance form the facial makeup is a unique art, for any dance. Even each classical dance form has its own selective and unique style of facial makeup. Even if it is traditional, or classical, or folk or ritual or creativity, or fusion, without the help of the makeup artist it is quite hard for any individual to put the facial makeup by their own. Facial makeup for any traditional classical dance is not an easy task, as compared to other dance forms.
Different types
For traditional classical dance forms have their own defined, unique, and selectively makeup which is adopted. For instance, most of the Indian Classical dance forms have different types of facial makeup. Bharatha Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam, and Odissi have an almost similar type of makeup. Kathakalis facial makeup is entirely different, from other Indian classical dance forms, Similarly, the North Indian Classical dance form Kathaks facial make up is quite different as compared to the other Indian dances. Kathak dance form adopts light make up, rather than other South Indian dance forms. Like Kathak, the East Indian dance form Manipuri dance also adopts light make up.
The entire Indian Classical dance forms belong to oriental dance forms. In the Eastern Dance forms, the skin colour of the personalities also changes from one another. Some are fair; some are very fair and some are of whitish complexion. Some are yellowish complexion, some are dark brown complexion, and some are light brown colour complexion. Hence according to the skin colour, the basic foundation is chosen. After the basic foundation is applied; a different combination of colours is selected and mixed up together to brighten the skin colour for the need and necessity.
Meanwhile, the shape of the face also differs from one another, and the structure of the face also differs. Some have square shape faces, some have round shape faces, some have long faces, and some have oval-shaped faces.
Even the shape of the mouth, the nose, the eyes, and the eyebrows also differ from individual to individual. Shaping the eyes, by the black colour eye tex and by the black eyebrow pencil, are an exceptional talent. Some dancers who are having small eyes. Shaping such eyes is a very difficult task for makeup artists.
Eyeshadows
Big eyes, which are very much needed to express the emotional expressions in dance. In Indian Classical Indian dances, the eyeshadows are not used, likewise even pasting the eyelashes, for the classical dances are not necessary or suitable. Such makeup should not be used for the classical Bharatha Natyam recitals. The eye makeup is a very important aspect of the classical dance. Everybodys eye shape differs from one another. Hence shaping the eye, according to the eye shape and face shape also differ from one another. Similarly selecting and shaping the lipstick colour is a unique and important art. Nowadays some of the makeup artists use the lip pencil to outline the lips.
Outlining the lips by the lip pencil for a classical dance recital is not much needed or desired, because many of times the pencil outline is visibly seen. Therefore it looks ugly. Always bright red colour lipstick is selected for the classical dance recitals, to brighten the face.
Earlier for the Bharatha Natyam recitals, the reddish blush and pink colour rouge were applied for the cheeks. Such makeup factors are avoided now because sometimes it makes the face look swollen, or makes the jaw bones jutting out. That is why at the present era, the makeup artists avoid, maximum to use the rouge and the blush for Bharatha Natyam.
Nose ornaments
Similarly, the nose shape also differs from one another. But whatever the nose shape is, the nose ornaments, such as Pillaku, Nathu, and nose studs cover the nose shape of the performing artists. Hence the nose shape is not obviously seen, and it is covered by the nose ornaments.
Selecting Pottu for the face depends on the shape of the individual face as well as the wish of the dancers. Some dancers like to have round shape Pottu and some dancers like to have long shape Pottu. Doing facial makeup for the small children is really a very difficult task for the makeup artists, as compared to the elder ones.
Meanwhile, the eyebrow shape also differs from one another. Not only the eyebrows differ from one another, but presently the youngsters, shape their eyebrows as they wish. Anyhow, the makeup artists try to shape the eyebrows according to the facial features of the individual. Hence the facial makeup for the individuals in the classical Bharatha Natyam is a unique and excellent artistic skill.
It is really regrettable that the service and contributions rendered by the makeup artists are very much forgotten by the art world. Many times, unfortunately, their service is not much recognized or taken into account by the present society.

The Speaker also requested MP Weerawansa to refrain from unparliamentary language when referring to the Speaker. Please sit down and lower your voice. You always bring up something unnecessary. I listened to you. It is not relevant to todays sitting. I am very fair. I am fairer than you are, Speaker Jayasuriya told MP Weerawansa.
Weerawansa then went on to say that he wanted to know the progress of the AGs inquiry into the incident. Are you waiting till eternity to have the Attorney Generals report he questioned.

To develop country
SLSFTA must be implemented without delay: Sampanthan
The Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) must be implemented without delay to lift the country towards development, said Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday.
Joining the Adjournment debate on the SLSFTA, Sampanthan urged the government to implement the Agreement subject to any correction needed for the betterment of the country.
While highlighting how far Singapore had economically advanced surpassing Sri Lanka, Sampanthan said it is not a time to check the teeth to gauge the quality of a horse which was gifted by someone.
Emphasizing the importance of the SLSFTA, Sampanthan further said that, Singapore does not need a FTA with us. It is we who need a FTA with Singapore.
The Opposition Leader identified five principles that had resulted in Singapore economic advancements including meritocracy, ethnic harmony, clean government, rule of law and social equity. He pointed out Sri Lanka had gone backwards, because it did not observe these principles.
Sampanthan also questioned as to why the Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) was not yet signed. You cannot go on like this. You cannot turn a blind eye to the development taking place in other countries. We cannot move backwards. We should start to co-operate with other countries.

Harin to visit Geneva in bid to resume Google Loon project
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando told Parliament yesterday, that he is visiting the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva, Switzerland today, in a fresh bid to resume the Google Loon project.
Responding to a question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake, Minister Fernando said the project had hit a snag as the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (TRC) raised issues with its spectrum license, adding that he would seek a clear decision in that regard from the ITU during his visit. He pointed out that if the problem could be sorted out, the project could be pushed ahead.
The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards.
With the Google Loon project, we have tried to provide 4G facility to the entire country. Sri Lankan born Silicon Valley based venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, supported us in that endeavour. It was a great opportunity Sri Lanka received free of charge from the Google Company, but unfortunately, the Google balloon became a joke to our people. We did not make a solid approach to the project and the TRC raised issues on its license, the minister explained.
He also reiterated that the Google balloon did not crash as some critiques say, but it made a pre-planned landing with the support of the Civil Aviation Authority. He also said that the Government had not incurred any loss as a result of the Google Loon Project and that the Google Company had not officially stated that it is giving up the project.

JO opposed to lifting of Glyphosate ban : Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday, that they are strongly opposed to the lifting of Glyphosate ban.
We are in favour of the ban. Thousands of people are suffering from kidney disease. The ban was imposed with Cabinet approval after studying the research outcomes. How could it be lifted without Cabinet approval simply because a few officials wanted it he questioned.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella intervening at this point, reminded that the substandard fertilizer imported by the previous Government, contributed largely to the spread of the kidney disease. Under the pretext of fertilizer subsidy, low quality chemical fertilizer was distributed for many years. You made it a political tool to win elections, he said.
MP Gunawardena also queried whether the Government had also removed the ban on Cholopyrifos and Carbofuran, in addition to Glyphosate. MP Ven. Rathana Thera also severely criticized the Government over its move to lift the Glyphosate ban. He also questioned the non-availability of the relevant Gazette on the tables of the MPs for them to peruse

Civil Society against Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka appoinment
The High Post Committee yesterday, delayed granting approval to the diplomatic posting of Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka as Sri Lanka's Ambassador to Russia, observing that it needed going into more details.
The High Post Committee chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, interviewed Dr Jayatilleka when it met at 3pm at the Parliament Complex yesterday.
The Committee paid attention to the petition received to the Committee carrying signatures of 115 Civil Society activists and organisations requesting for the rejection of Dr Jayatillekas nomination as Ambassador to Russia. This was the first time the High Post Committee received a petition signed by such a large number of people. Among them were respected individuals whose representations we needed to consider seriously, a Committee member who attended the meeting told the Daily News.
He said the Committee also considered the fact that Dr Jayatilleka was recalled to the country in 2009, when he was serving as Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. The Committee has also taken serious note of Dr Jayatillekas active political involvement, as at present he was openly campaigning hard for former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The Committee was of the opinion that it needed to study this nomination in detail before granting approval, a Committee member said.
Committee members Dinesh Gunawardena, John Amaratunga, Lakshman Kiriella, M A Sumanthiran, Vijitha Herath, Bimal Rathnayaka and Eran Wickremaratne attended the meeting yesterday.

SLSFTA:Sri Lanka has violated Intl. trade agreements: Dinesh
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader and Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena urged the Government to discontinue the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and to draft a new agreement that is not destructive to the local industries of the country.
MP Gunawardena said that local industries would undergo dire consequences due to the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. He said that local industry owners are threatened by the agreement and that they are fearful of its activation. He also said that the agreement also puts professionals of the country at risk as well.
MP Gunawardena made these observations opening the Adjournment Debate on the Sri Lanka- Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) yesterday.
According to MP Gunawardena, the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA is invalid. He pointed out that there had been no Cabinet approval pertaining to signing of the agreement. He said that there was only a Cabinet memorandum. MP Gunawardena also said that there was no approval from Parliament to the agreement either and thus it violates the Constitution. If there is no approval from Parliament, there is no validity in the agreement. he pointed out.
MP Gunawardena also alleged that there have been no discussions with any relevant parties with regards to the trade agreement. When a country introduces new changes to trade policies, they hold lengthy discussions and take years to proceed. With whom did you hold discussions MP Gunawardena questioned. MP Gunawardena also said that Sri Lanka has also violated international trade agreements from signing this agreement.

The Deputy Minister was responding to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Udaya Padma Shantha Gunasekera, who demanded a full report be furnished to the House on criminal activities carried out by the Aava gang and the steps taken by the Government to control them.
The Aava Group has been painted as devils by some sections in the South. Some of those children of the Aava group who were in Police custody had been crying. We have identified them and we will rehabilitate them. There are gangs worse than the Aava gang operating in the South, he said.

The environment committee of the Pradeshiya Sabha took this decision in response to allegations made by certain environmental organisations that the mining is causing environmental damage.
The suspension would be in force until an area investigation is made and a report obtained. Permits were granted for mining when the Pradeshiya Sabha was administered by commissioners.

SA batting coach calls for mental preparedness after Galle debacle
South Africa batting coach Dale Benkenstein put his team's struggles against spin down to their mental make-up after their twin collapses in the first Test in Galle.
South Africa were routed 126 and 73 - their two lowest totals in Sri Lanka, and lowest since readmission - and Benkenstein said the poor performance arose from a lack of match practice and, chiefly, an absence of mental toughness on their first tour since early April.
It's not the standard we want. Technically, you have to face the spinning ball and there's a few things that you have to adjust to. But 90% of it is being tough mentally, being used to the ball missing the bat or spinning past the bat, Benkenstein said. When you've had a lot of Test cricket, you are toughened for Test pressures, and I think the guys were low on that as well. South Africa came into the Test off a three-month off-season, and though some of their players were involved in the IPL during that period, and a few others in the county circuit, the rustiness from a lack of Test cricket showed.
Benkenstein admitted that not even intense training at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria helped in shaking off the cobwebs. We did some pretty good preparation before [the series], but in our conditions. We were trying to simulate the conditions here. We hit quite a lot of balls, but we haven't had a lot of competition, Benkenstein said. That competition arrived in Galle, and it turned out to be one in which South Africa lost heavily. But on the upside, it has given them two extra days in preparation for the next Test, and Benkenstein wasn't necessarily looking at utilizing that time in the nets. I don't believe practises are going to make a huge amount of difference.
Mentally, we've got to remind ourselves we are back in Test cricket again. It's tough. Interestingly, Benkenstein made no mention of conditions or of what he wanted the batsmen to do to wrap their heads around the spinner-friendly tracks. All he said was that South Africa are close to getting things right, despite what the scorecard might say. I don't think we are far off.
It's actually not such a big gap. It seems like a big gap in the end, but it's not such a big gap.

Second thoughts  on the sixth sense
According to Kettelkamp, the commonest of those meta-communication or extra sensory perception is probably telepathy. This term comes from the Greek words tele and pathy, which means distant and feeling. It is used to describe an incident in which a person receives information from the thoughts of another person in another place.
The terms such as forecast, foretell and prediction are quite familiar to most of us as implying the meanings related to the future. But the terms have been extended in concept and meaning with words that may be used as clairvoyance, third eye, extrasensory perception (ESP), sixth sense and telepathy. These terms denote a special branch of study relating to a certain degree of psychic powers that have been developed by individuals based on their inherent cultivation of spirituality and/or meditation.
As far back as 2002, I found a book titled Sixth Sense lying in a car-boot sale in London, written and illustrated by Larry Kettelkamp, a lesser-known writer. Over the years, he had been experimenting on the subject of psychic experiences.
Unusual experiences
According to Kettelkamp, the term psychic literally means of mind and/or soul. The term also has come to be used for a whole range of unusual experiences from mind-to-mind communication to mind over  matter  occurrences. The communication scholars have denoted the subject area as metacommunication experiences. As such, the subject area is not regarded as a comprehensive discipline.
Sixth Sense deals with such experiences. It seems beyond the regular senses and activities of ones normal senses like the eye, ear, nose, mouth and touch. They are hard to observe and even harder to explain. But it looks as if those who are interested in studying them have found or unearthed perhaps a vast area of knowledge that goes into the study of communication sciences.
According to Kettelkamp, the commonest of those meta-communication or extra sensory perception is probably telepathy. This term comes from the Greek words tele and pathy, which means distant and feeling. It is used to describe an incident in which a person receives information from the thoughts of another person in another place. The emphasis is laid on that it is felt strongest when intense emotional feelings are involved. One of the most famous experiments in the area of telepathy was carried out by two men, Harold Sherman, an American author and psychiatrist, and Sir Hubert Wilkins, an English explorer, who had a common interest in the study of extrasensory perception. The experiences resulted in the book titled as How to Make ESP Work for You.
Telepathic impressions
But I have not had the chance of reading that work. It is recorded that the term Sixth Sense had come from these experiences. Sherman and Sir Hubert found that the accuracy of the telepathic impressions had little to do with the extent of the distance between them. The impressions had been most accurate when there was a strong emotion involved. They too have the experience in conveying diary notes kept by them, that eventually looked like a series of dialogues ensued between them.
Followed by the studies, the writer shows how the well-known writer Upton Sinclair and his wife too devoted time to the study of telepathy and extrasensory perception. Sinclair is said to have found that his wife was able to pick up their thoughts unusually well. They worked out a series of experiments in which Sinclair would make a simple drawing and his wife, without seeing it would try to make a copy of the same. In some of those experiments, Sinclair was in a neighbouring room with doors closed and could not see her husbands drawings. In others, she was as far as forty miles away. The distance seemed to have no particular effect on the findings.
After nearly 300 tests had been made, Sinclair wrote a book about the experiments titled Mental Radio followed by the notes comes the term clairvoyance. This is sometimes known as second sight. The term comes from the French words meaning clear vision. But here it is the mind rather than the eye that does the seeing.
ESP experiments
As Kettelkamp notes, the best book written so far, this subject is titled as Hidden Channels of the Mind by Dr Louisa Rhine and her husband Dr J B Rhine conducted their studies in extrasensory perception. As I remember well, the late Dr D V J Harischandra of Karapitiya Hospital used to talk to me about some of these types of ESP experiments conducted by him. As a true-to-life example to explain the concept of the sixth sense, Kettelkamp lays down the following event.
In one case, a married couple had gone to the theatre. In this particular theatre, there were, under the seats, round cushions, there were holders for mens hats. After the show, the couple stopped for a soda. Then the wife suddenly noticed that the blue Opel stone was missing from her ring. They went home very depressed. Next morning, the husband left the home early saying that he had an errand to attend to. Without telling his wife, he went directly to the theatre.
Then later on the husband had explained what made him do so in the following words. In a dream, I saw that night a large round, black thing, and I thought of those hat cushions in the theatre.
When he located the seats, they had used the night before and looked beneath them there just exactly as in the dream were the two black objects side by side. He found his wifes missing blue Opel.
The short study of Larry Kettelkamp, Sixth Sense, first published in London, in 1973, is highly readable research work running to 95 pages with illustrations by himself. In his work, he takes the reader into the realms of futurism, spiritualism, creativity, memory and how it works for ones benefit and understanding why PSI means with special reference to psychology and psychic powers.
All in all, a reader may find as the writer implies that one can carry over these activities, test and studies as laid down in the pages into the day to day life. The awareness is normally better off than being in ignorance as the writer says: The final proof will be its usefulness to you and to others.

Services Sector PMI up in June
The Services Sector PMI increased to 58.7 index points in June 2018 from 56.9 index points recorded in May 2018 supported by faster growth in business activity.
The Manufacturing Sector PMI decreased to 57.6 index points in June 2018 from 60.6 index points observed in the previous month and was in line with the pattern observed in the previous years.
The significant drop in production especially that of manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco products largely contributed for this decrease. Further, new orders and stock of purchases also decreased during the month. However, the overall employment increased with the new recruitments in manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparel, leather and other related products.
Meanwhile, the time taken by the suppliers to deliver materials increased due to unfavourable weather conditions prevailed during the month and the tightened environmental regulations in China. As a result, the suppliers delivery time lengthened.
Overall, all the sub indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold in June 2018 signalling an overall expansion in manufacturing activities yet at a slower phase compared to May 2018. Meanwhile, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months.

Singapore FTA to bring more dividends to country - Malik
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema while requesting the opposition to change their narrow minded thinking, yesterday reiterated that the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore has been very cleverly negotiated by the government ensuring more dividends for the country and its posterity.
The Minister also requested the Opposition members to shed narrow minded thinking and join hands with the government to ensure better future for the younger generation.
Unlike other FTAs signed by Singapore with other countries where the level of liberalization is more than 90% of tariff lines, in the FTA with Sri Lanka, we limited it to 80%. So, 20% of tariff lines or 1,487 items, were kept protected because of a concern on domestic industries and revenue, he stressed.
Joining the Parliamentary debate on the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement,(SLSFTA), Minister Samarawickrama said that Sri Lanka has received a proposal from Singapore for investment amounting to 14.8 billion Dollars in an oil refinery for export of petroleum products in just the past two and a half months since the agreement came into effect.
Excerpts from the speech:
The Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA provides a binding commitment and framework for bilateral trade and investment, which we did not have earlier. This will encourage much needed investment into our country. It is important to understand that not every FTA is meant to balance trade between two countries or bridge the bilateral trade deficit.
Sri Lanka has trade surpluses with some countries and deficits with other countries. Sri Lanka would need to sign a range of FTAs aimed at different purposessome FTAs aimed at boosting exports (to gain new and preferential market access) as well as give domestic producers access to lower cost inputs; while other FTAs are aimed at leveraging on the trade-investment nexus.
The first allegation is made is that the signing of this FTA has not received Cabinet approval. Hon. Speaker, for your information, the Cabinet of Ministers was first updated via an Interim Report in August 2017 on the progress, including the areas and extent of liberalization and the status of the consultative process carried out with stakeholders. On 21 st December 2017, a Cabinet paper was submitted by me containing the draft agreement.
Based on that, positive observations were made by His Excellency the President and 14 other Cabinet ministers by 9 th January 2018. Taking into account these observations, a revised agreement was submitted to the Cabinet for approval. At the Cabinet meeting of 16th January, Cabinet approved the agreement submitted and granted approval for me to sign it during the visit of the Singapore Prime Minister on January 23. Furthermore, I would like to inform this House that the agreement came into force on 1 st of May after the Anti-Dumping and Safeguard Measures Acts were passed in Parliament.
Recently at a press conference Minister S B Dissanayake has stated that he is against the FTA. However, he is one of the 14 Cabinet Ministers who have sent in writing that he has NO objections to the signing and Parliamentary Debate on SLSFTA on July 17, 2018.
Implementation of the Singapore FTA! His exact words, in the letter signed by him are:Ihatha yojanawa kriyathmaka kereema sambandayen magey virodhathawayak nomatha.
Agreeing in Cabinet then. But playing narrow political games now. This is the hypocrisy of members of the opposition!
Another argument is that we did this without consultations. I can responsibly state to the members of this House that we frequently kept stakeholders informed of the status of the negotiations and possible commitments that were to be undertaken. Over the 18 months, about 20 consultation sessions were held with a wide range of stakeholders including business chambers, trade associations, and professional bodies.
Another assertion is that we can never amend the agreement  this is not true.
Article 17.10 of the Agreement provides for amendments to be made to the agreement. Furthermore, under article 17.1 there is a high-level committee established to monitor, review and supervise the implementation of the Agreement as well as to recommend amendments.
The first meeting of this committee will be held within the first year and thereafter at regular intervals and take up issues relating to the agreement that either party would have.
Article 17.12 of the Agreement provides for termination of the agreement by either party by giving notice, and it will be effective one year from the date of notification.
There has been much debate on the liberalization of services. Let me be very clear  as we have repeated time and again, we are NOT opening up to any country the independent movement of persons.
Singapore FTA, there can be services workers only if they are part of a company here  so it is always linked to investment in Sri Lanka. Even then, we have restricted it to senior management. Such senior managers will initially be issued visa for 2 years and will get it only for a maximum of 5 years. The option of renewing this visa is ours. To be eligible in the first place, that worker should have been employed in the relevant Singaporean company for at least one year and should have 5 years industry or professional experience. Above all this, our countrys immigration laws will always apply and there is no exemption from that.
Look at all the conditions we have built in to this agreement! So for anyone to say we have blindly opened up is irresponsible and is propagating lies.
Another argument is that non-nationals of Singapore can take undue advantage of the FTA. This is again a baseless claim. The SLSFTA Singapore defines a National as a citizen of Singapore or a Permanent Resident of Singapore. Obtaining PR in Singapore is not easy  it is a long and stringent process, and more stringent requirements in recent years. It is only this cohort of Singapore Nationals who are eligible to enter under the FTA, and all other nationalities are excluded from the FTA.
There have also been ridiculous allegations that this agreement allows for paddy to be freely imported  that is simply not the case. Under the Rules of Origin chapter, agricultural produce like paddy, wheat or meat - it must be wholly obtained in Singapore. In the case of meat  the animals must be born and raised in Singapore; in the case of paddy, spices, fruits and vegetable it must be wholly grown and harvested in Singapore to be eligible for tariff concessions  and remember Singapore doesnt have a single paddy field! Furthermore, it is mentioned that Pakistan and Thailand rice can be imported through Singapore. This is not allowed under the Rules of Origin criteria. In any case, rice is kept in the Negative List of the Agreement. On other process or manufactured products too, those products should have 35 percent value addition or sufficient working or processing undergone in Singapore. Therefore simple diversion of Parliamentary Debate on SLSFTA on 17 July 2018.
Another frequently cited issue is about manpower agencies. Even under the prevailing laws and regulations of our land, a Singaporean recruitment services company could set up a company in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas commitment in this sector does not include Mode 4 in any capacity  it is completely unbound. Unlike in other Mode 4 commitments, there is no reference even for senior management personnel for such recruitment companies, under this services sub-sector. A Singaporean recruitment company can set up an office in Sri Lanka, as is already allowed in the current legal structure, but it cannot recruit personnel from abroad since mode 4 is unbound or no commitment taken to open. Any such recruitment company that wishes to hire work from overseas has to go through the regular processes of immigration, line ministry approvals  the
current laws and regulations prevail, and the FTA creates no new liberalisation in this regard.
It has also been alleged  very irresponsibly - that the FTA will pave the way for waste products to be dumped in Sri Lanka. Again, this is totally false. The many items called waste products are already under the duty- free list and have been included in the India-Sri Lanka and Pakistan-Sri Lanka Agreements and there are no evidence to suggest that these
products are coming in to the country in any harmful manner. Even under the Singapore FTA, these products cannot just come into the country and have to go through the regular import licensing requirements and standards and regulations applicable to protect plant, human and animal life. Furthermore, Sri Lanka rights under article 20 of GATT /1994 of WTO to take measures to protect human animal or plant life is ensured by inclusion of article 17.7 on General Exemption under chapter 17 of the Agreement. Therefore, Sri Lanka is free to introduce environmental measures to protect human, animal or plant life.
Furthermore our rights under International environmental conventions that Sri Lanka is Signatory to such as Basel More broadly, let me reiterate that this FTA with Singapore has been very cleverly negotiated by us. Unlike other FTAs signed by Singapore with other countries where the level of liberalization is more than 90% of tariff lines, in the FTA with Sri Lanka, we limited it to 80%. So, 20% of tariff lines or 1,487 items, were kept protected because of a concern on domestic industries and revenue. Items like footwear, confectionery and many other sensitive items have been kept out of the agreement. The liberalisation programme under this FTA has been carefully designed to have the least impact on domestic industry and revenue collection. We have included all revenue sensitive items in the negative list of items which will not be subject to removal of tariff. Therefore, 97.8% revenue from customs duty is protected. Our tariff liberalization will take place over a period of 12-15 years!
In fact, the revenue earned through tariffs on good imported from Singapore last year was 35 Billion rupees. The revenue loss for over the next fifteen years due to the FTA is only 733 Million rupees  which when annualized, on average, is just 51 Million rupees. That is just 0.14% per year! So anyone who claims the Singapore FTA causes revenue loss to the Government cannot do basic arithmetic!

17th Golden Pennant Football encounter in Matara
Spectator intervention prevents a result
Spectator intervention prevented a result being reached in the 17th Golden Pennant Football Encounter between Rahula College and St. Thomas College Matara. Rahula were in the lead with two goals to one at the time. The annual football encounter was hosted by St Thomas College and played at the German Sri Lanka friendship football ground at Uyanwatta recently.
Spectators intervened when the referees disallowed the would have been equalizer by St Thomas College as a player was ruled offside at the crucial moment. With approximately 12minutes of the game remaining the officials were unable to continue due to the controversy. Referee Indunil Ediriwickremasuriya said that a result could not be given as approximately twelve more minutes of play remained and confirmed that Rahula led two goals to one when the interruption occurred.
As the barrier erected by the organizers was less than a meter away from the line the spectators encroached the space inbetween and even spilled on to the playing field in places as the game progressed hampering the line judges from carrying out their duties. The attempts made by the organizers and the police officials on duty tokeep the lines clear were not futile.
Vice captain Vinuka Sameshana (21) opened the score for Rahula in the 27th minute of the game while Reshan Brian Weerapulli scored the second goal for Rahula eight minutes later to see Rahula lead two goals to nil at half time. STC skipper Dilshan Tharaka made it two nil through a penalty 29 minutes in to the second half. The Thomians would have equalized six minutes later if a player was not ruled offside when Tharusha Biyanka managed to get a free kick past goalie Pramuditha Madihahewa.
With a result not being reached in this game the series stands level with eight wins each.
The Rahula contingent for the 17th encounter led by Avith Kaushika comprised of Vinuka Sameshana, Adeesha Prabashwara, Nimthaka Chirath, Tharindu Lasith, Tharushan Chandula, Kavindu Dilshan, Dulshan Vitharana, Gaveesha Nuwansara, D L Henuka, Senila Bhathiya, Pramudith Madihahea, A J S Jayawardena, Reshan Brian Weerapulli, Nadil de Silva, Kaveesha Geethapena, Thiviru Mankisa, Hasindu Randika, Pasindu Chamuditha, Rusil Tharanga, Bosara Sankalpa, Niduk Savendra, Pasindu Sandeepa and Nimath Induwara

Stars to descend on the stage
The stage is set to host the 34th Sarasaviya Film Awards. The gala event which will see some of the cinema greats being felicitated for their contributions to uplift the cinema industry will be held at the BMICH on August 3.
This year Cargills has joined hands with the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited to make the starry night a reality. The joint venture itself turns a new page in history as it is the first time that two main organizations of this nature have joined together to bring about an awards festival of such nature. Furthermore, this years awards ceremony will be dedicated to globally acclaimed Sri Lankan filmmaker and the Father of Sri Lankan Cinema the Late Dr Lester James Peries. This also marks the first time in Sri Lankan history that a film festival will be dedicated to an individual.
Films screened in 2016 and 2017 will compete at the event in 32 categories. Awards will be presented separately for both years. A special jury award will be handed over to a filmmaker who has made his or her debut to filmmaking by obtaining the Public Performance Board Certificate but not screened in cinemas during the period. The most popular film award will be handed over to the film which the most number of spectators have viewed. Two Rana Thisara Lifetime Achievement Awards and the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Memorial Award for film criticism will also be presented. An award titled the Dr Lester James Peries award will be included in the awards list.
Film songs rerecorded to suit the stage will be performed by artistes. The event will be choreographed by Channa Wijewardena. Ranga Dassanayake will handle the music.
The oldest running film awards ceremony in Sri Lanka the Sarasaviya Film Awards is presented by ANCLs weekly cinema tabloid Sarasaviya. It is the longest surviving film weekly in the country and has garnered many cinema buffs.
Sarasaviya, the name which derives from the goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning, Saraswathi, has always been strongly rooted with the arts field in the country. It is the longest-running arts-related Sinhala weekly in the country and is the only Sinhala magazine which is dedicated to the local cinema, television, stage drama, music and other forms of arts.
The first Sarasaviya Film Awards was launched in 1964 at the Asoka Cinema Hall, Colombo. This occurred 17 years after the first film was screened. Another significant fact in connection with the Sarasaviya Awards is that Dr Lester James Peries Gamperaliya won the Best Film and Best Director awards and then went on to bag the Golden Peacock at the International Film Festival of India.
There is a belief among all those in connection with the film industry that ones cinematic journey is not complete if they have not gotten a Sarasaviya Film Award.
Throughout the years as each festival took to the stage, the Sarasaviya Film Awards moulded its own unique identity. Since then many greats have carried home the statuette. Their movie career would not have been complete without having a Sarasaviya Award on their awards shelf. It is not only the jury awards that they strive for. Fans get to play their part by selecting their favourites to gift them with the Most Popular Actor and Actress awards. The Sarasaviya Film Awards has often been referred to as Sinhala cinemas equivalent to The Oscars.
Many significant Indian stars have graced the past Sarasaviya Film Awards. Sunil Dutt and Nutan were the chief guests at the Sarasaviya Film Awards in 1966. Meena Kumari graced the occasion in 1968. Mani Ratnam was present at the event in 2003. Throughout the years many awards ceremonies which ooze of glamour and glitz have joined the scene. However, the Sarasaviya Film Awards managed to keep apart from the rest especially because it honours the best among the best.
Considered as one of the oldest movie production companies in the island, Ceylon Theaters will be screening films for free to commemorate the Sarasaviya cinema week which will be held from July 24 to 28 at the Regal cinema, Colombo. The unedited version of Dr Peries Delovak Athara will be screened at the Regal cinema, Kandy, on July 21 at 4.30 pm as a part of the event lineup.

Students protest decision barring them from exams
The Engineering Faculty of the Peradeniya University was closed indefinitely from 6 am on July 17.
All engineering students were ordered to leave campus premises by 2 pm yesterday.
The university administration has decided to prevent three percent of the students from sitting examinations this year for failure to attend 80 percent of lectures. Members of the Peradeniya university students union have launched a protest against this since July 6 by entering the senate building. The Vice Chancellor and other university officials faced difficulties in trying to enter the senate building which is the administration block. As a result, they have been staying out of the administration building after reporting for duty since July 12. Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake said attending 80 percent of lectures was a pre-requisite for engineering students to quality to sit the examinations. However, three percent of the students had failed to satisfy this condition.
Students Union President Mahil Bandara said they launched the protest against 'the student oppression by the university administration' based on the condition of attending 80 percent of lectures. They also decried the arbitrary action taken by the administration to set up CCTV cameras in the campus as it would be an obstruction to their freedom. The 11-member university senate appointed by the Higher Education Ministry comprises Vice Chancellor Prof Upul Dissanayake and Dean of the Engineering Faculty Prof Leelananda Rajapaksa among others.

The trade adjustment package will cover new machinery and technology and skills retraining, he explained. Minister Samarawickreme made these observations joining the adjournment debate on the Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) yesterday.
Minister Samarawickreme observed that the only way to increase peoples income for them to achieve a better quality of life is to integrate more with the global market. He highlighted that the government will strengthen the local industries to compete in the global market. Naturally, we are mindful of the impact on the industries present today, but that cannot be our only consideration.
Our government is committed to assisting and improving local industries. However, assistance does not mean protectionism. We will assist the local industries to increase efficiency and productivity and help them to be more competitive so that they can compete in the world market. Already we have launched loan schemes and exporter upgrading grant schemes to help SMEs. Minister Samarawickreme said.

The transcendental, defiant world of Druvinka Madawala
For the first time since 2012, the work of Sri Lankan native Druvinka Madawala will be displayed in a solo exhibition at the Barefoot Gallery from July 18 to August 5. The upcoming show consists of 46 paintings, each accompanied by a poem written by her friend, Jozie. Druvinkas work gained prominence after a solo exhibition in Colombo in 1990 and has appeared in Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, and London. However, none of that matters much to the 47-year-old, who spends her days living as a yogi in the mountains of Indias Himachal Pradesh.
With legs half-crossed, and an arm resting lazily over her knee, Druvinka discusses her work in the studio above Barefoot gallery. In the corner of the room, Druvinkas paintings lean up against a wall, awaiting her final touches.
The paintings are absorbing and other-worldly, though many of them seem dark and ominous with grey, brown, and black colours figuring prominently. But these impressions are false, says Druvinka, because all colours go into my work, so even if it looks like a dark painting, underneath, if you look, theres a lot more. On second glance, darker tones tend to inhabit only the outer edges or epicentres of her paintings and add to the rectangular and circular infinities of the canvas. The collection is all to do with nature and nothing against it. I believe in evolving and change. Like a snake shedding its skin.
Druvinkas art is a clear extension of her lifestyle, I am a yogi myself. I sit on the ground, I eat once a day. Druvinka takes an inclusive approach to spirituality, informed by Hindu philosophy, her grandmothers influence as a Buddhist who practised Hindu rituals, and her mothers Christian family.
The process of creating her work (in addition to the art itself) is a transcendental one. Its like a spirit comes into me and it happens, she says, I am just an instrument in a human body. Druvinka works late at night when everyone else is sleeping. She puts her artwork on the floor and works around it, then puts it up against a wall, touching it up. Then back to the floor, then touching it up again, as the process repeats itself. Her pieces are primarily layered tempera, a method of mixing water and colour, though some in this exhibition are pen and ink as well.
Druvinka refrains from describing her work piece by piece, or even from collection to collection, because what I am comes out. Even I am not in control of it sometimes, when I paint. Painting is simply a part of Druvinkas lifestyle, which is reflected in an erratic and sometimes prolific pace of producing art; she can complete anywhere between one and five pieces in a day, and she is always working on a few at a time. In a year I can do, if I am really working continuously, maybe fifty sixty works. Its possible, though, it depends on the mood and the weather.
Another of Druvinkas quirks is her defiance towards labelling her work. She doesnt title her pieces, because that becomes a seal. Maybe you dont see the painting as I do. At the mention adding a signature, Druvinka recoilsshe didnt want to sign her pieces, but For artists, documentation, signature and date are important. For me, its not. This is where Druvinkas artwork clashes with her philosophy, as a person who believes thatYou dont own anything in the world, really.
Druvinkas latest exhibition comes at a time when the artist has reached sannyasa, or monk-hood, in her life. She is deeply detached from worldly things, including her own artwork: I dont keep my artwork, she says, I send it out. You can burn my painting in front of me. I wont say anything.
Druvinkas philosophy is also what draws her away from modern society. She scorns the smartphone (though she has one), all isms, including feminism, and environmentalism. She hates passports, gates, locks, barriers, wars, I dont think you should have them. She only has a bank account because its necessary.
Its unsurprising that for her first solo exhibition in several years, Druvinka went back to basics. She focused on the elements of nature, the shivling, the yoni, kundalini, or serpent power, and fire. One painting in the new exhibition captures these interwoven motifs particularly well: against a background of deep blues and splashes of yellow and red colouran open circle, a yoni, encompasses a shivling. Within the shivling, a collection of shapes and parallel lines frame two intertwined, red snakes. The imagery flows towards the deep red colours at the base of the canvas, which seems to allude towards the culmination of the five elements in the fire. When you burn wood, which Druvinka says is a composition of all five elements, the result of it is dust. Thats what we are. Burn anything it becomes dust.

Trump under fire
US: US President Donald Trump returned late Monday from his European tour to face ire in Washington, where US intelligence officials and senior Republicans were denouncing the President as shameful and disgraceful after he refused to challenge Russian leader Vladimir
Republican Senator John McCain said Trumps seeming acceptance of Putins denial was a historical low point for the US Presidency and the Helsinki summit between the two leaders a tragic mistake.
Todays press conference in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American President in memory. The damage inflicted by President Trumps naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate, McCain said in a blistering statement.
No prior President has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Taking direct issue with the president who appointed him, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said US spy agencies have been clear and fact-based in their assessment that Moscow interfered in the presidential race two years ago -- an assessment that Trump refused to endorse in Helsinki.
Coats added that Russia remains behind ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.
Trump stunned US political allies and foes alike with his answer to a question about Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election which saw him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Putin just said it is not Russia. I will say this: I dont see any reason why it would be, Trump said.
That came three days after the US Justice Department indicted 12 Russians for hacking Democratic Party computers, the latest in a series of actions taken by the US government since late 2016 in retribution for what intelligence agencies say was a broad plan to support Trumps election campaign directed by Putin himself.
Yet Trump appeared to take Putins word in dismissing that conclusion.
I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.
Trump also appeared to embrace Putins offer to have Russian investigators work together with US prosecutors on the case of the 12 just indicted.
I think thats an incredible offer.
Astonished Republicans and Democrats uniformly condemned Trump, with harsh criticism coming even from hosts on Fox News -- a network normally friendly to the president.
The President must appreciate that Russia is not our ally, said Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.
There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals, he said. Senior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Trumps answer on meddling will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness.
Bent on forging a personal bond with the Kremlin chief, Trump headed into the summit blaming the stupidity of his predecessors for plunging ties to their present low.
This is shameful, said Senator Jeff Flake, a fellow Republican and staunch critic of the President.
I never thought I would see the day when our American President would stand on the stage with the Russian President and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression.
The language used by Democrats was much harsher, including accusations of treason.
For the President of the United States to side with President Putin against American law enforcement, American defense officials, and American intelligence agencies is thoughtless, dangerous, and weak, said Chuck Schumer, the senior Democrat in the Senate.
Democratic California Representative Jimmy Gomez charged: To side with Putin over US intelligence is disgusting; to fail to defend the US is on the verge of treason. - AFP

A welcome move
The absence of a national policy on vital sectors has been a recurring theme of debate in this country down the years. In countries such as India there is a national policy covering a gamut of sectors and change in governments will not change the national policies of those countries. Here too the need for a set national policy on vital sectors that would not be changed with a discontinuation of a government has been badly felt in order to maintain continuity and consistency. True, ideological differences between political parties lead to a drastic change in policies when there is a regime change, as has been witnessed in this country. However with the transformation in the political outlook of most political parties in this modern day and age these differences have narrowed to a considerable extent leaving scope for consistent national policies, at least on vital sectors. This, while leading to stability, would also go a long way in facilitating the development and progress of the country. For, no government will be able to deviate from the established national policy.
In this respect the move by a band of intellectuals and professionals to set up what has been termed as a National Intellectual Organization to draft a national policy covering 10 important sectors has to be welcomed. There has been a lot of talk about setting out a national policy on health, education, agriculture etc. There was a lot of noise made about adopting the Senaka Bibile recommendations, as the national policy on health. Whether or not this policy is operational today nobody seems to know. The health sector is always in turmoil with doctors and the administration often at loggerheads.
There is also the current demand made by the GMOA for laying down a national policy on trade, following the governments move to enter into trade pacts with India and Singapore. Though the doctors motives may be politically oriented, much conflict and confusion could have been averted if such a national policy was in existence.
According to a news report we carried on Monday the proposed National Intellectual Organization will comprise over 150 professionals drawn from various fields. They will include university dons, professors, lawyers and professionals. A member of the organisation Attorney-at-Law Upul Kumarapperuma said it has been planned to introduce this national policy in respect of education, health, economy, agriculture, transport, Sri Lankan community, art and culture, fisheries and environment, as well as several other vital sectors.
Of course, ALL stakeholders will have to be consulted before drawing up a national policy in respect of any one of these sectors. For instance, the farmer community will have to be consulted when drawing up a national policy for agriculture. Similarly, representatives of the fishermen will have to be brought into the picture where the national policy pertaining to the fisheries industry is concerned. One has to ensure that the national policies will stand the test of time.
No doubt, there is bound to be a lot of hot air in the drafting of the national policy on health. The doctors will insist on having their say in a majority of decisions that will be taken. Similarly, the national policy on education will witness much wrangling, especially centred on the establishment of private educational institutions ala a SAITM, with student bodies laying down the rules. But these issues could be overcome through discussions and compromise. What is important is to establish a watertight national policy on a given sector so that it will withstand changes in government and be binding. Today, doctors, teachers, students and workers stage agitations, chiefly, due to the lack of understanding between the authorities and the stakeholders. However, such unrest could be avoided if the proper parameters are laid down via a national policy, within which the government and the stakeholders could reach agreement.
Today, privatization has become a sore point with many and there are sell out cries made by certain politically motivated elements. However, if there is a national policy, agreement could be reached under which circumstances privatization could be resorted to, particularly of loss making state institutions, and the governments stake in the deal. This way there will be no unrest or work stoppages and disruption of public life. Importantly, this would also prevent unscrupulous politicians exploiting trade unions, since, with the existence of a national policy, they would not be in a position to do so.
Like Kumarapperuma said, instead of finding piecemeal solutions to the countrys problems cropping up from time to time, lasting solutions should be found to the overall problems to ensure an environment free of problems to the country and future generations.
Above all, the establishment of a national policy on vital sectors would also put an end to ministers cutting and chopping policies to do with their subjects, resulting in chaos. This malady mostly affected the countrys education sector which has undergone many changes since independence.
Besides, with over one third of our legislators not having passed their GCE (O/Ls) it is best that intellectuals and professionals be made to think on their (politicians) behalf in setting out policies that affect our national well-being.

Who are our progenitors
In the Ceylon Department of British Library of London, my eyes were captivated by a report written by Sir Henry Ward, Governor of Ceylon, to the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain.
My irrigation engineers submitted to me a descriptive project regarding an ancient tank called the Giants Tank and 122 small tanks lid in geometrical order around, in the Manner District of North Ceylon. Now they are abandoned lying in the arid zone under the blazing sun. They are only fed by monsoon rain from November to January.
This cluster of tanks is not mentioned in any chronicle of Ceylon. When Indo-Aryans came headed by Prince Vijaya, according to history, they were there displaying their splendours. There are no historical accounts to prove by whom they were built or when. It was said by this peculiar 228,000 acres of land was cultivated for paddy producing bumper harvest to fill up the countrys panarium. Now cattle and goats are grazing and wild animals including elephants come at nightfall to appease their thirst in untold numbers. Aravi-or Malwathu Oya, at tekkem, in Periya-arnalkulam, was harnessed in the olden days, on the 27th-mile post on the Mannar-Madawachchi road, for the purpose of turning waters of the river from the natural course into the channel which feeds the Giants Tank. It is an imposing sight. Araviaru brings so much of gurgling waters, we ken, if they flow into the cannel, the whole tank might be blasted, luckily 122 tanks come into rescue sipping them passes to the fields to save the mother tank. It was unsuccessfully repaired in 1897. As the tank is 40 ft. high, we are unable to convey the water uphill.
In the time immemorial there must have been kings who built these sorts of irrigational wonders, we cant imagine as they were gone with the cyclone of time. For thousands of years, South Indian invading armies came here and settled down driving natives interior. A South Indian Prince called Magha, came with people called Vanni and settled them there. For the reason, Manner area turned out to be a Tamil Domination. They, I hear, are boasting that these tanks were built by Tamil giants. Thats why they bear giants names.
It is all nonsense. This marvellous project requires at least the labour of 25,000 workers for 10 years to do the framework. They dont have scientists gifted with scientific know-how. Only a powerful native king who could do it. South Indian history does not mention a single giant. Only Lanka history wrote about giants. King Gemunus army had 14 giants including Nandimitra, and Velusumana, who killed Tamil soldiers in Vijitapura. King Parakramabahu himself was a giant. King Gajabahu had a giant called Neela Maha Yodaya, who went to South India and captured 75,000 Tamils abs brought them here to restore tanks destroyed by Tamils. Very recently there was a giant from Tamuttegama, unfortunately, he died of starvation.
Assyrian Giants
No need to cite, the whole world know how 7 Assyrian giants who rebuilt marvellous Ashur temple. They irrigated whole Euprerese-Tigris valleys and adorned them with rice and wheat fields and orchards. In 2500 BC Assyrias first king, Tiglath-pileser 81115-11029 boasted that he was the king of the whole world. The last emperor Assurbanipal died in 626 BC. Fourteen years later, an army of Babilonia, under king Nabopolassar, united with an army of Medes under Cyaxeres and hordes of Scythians from the Caucasus and with amazing ease and swiftness captured the citadels of the north Nineveh  the capital was laid waste as ruthless and completely, just like Assyrians destroyed Capital Susa of Babylonia. And they put the torch to all towns. The population was slaughtered or enslaved and places levelled to the ground as rubbish and Assyria disappeared from history. Their God was dead.
Paradise Lost
For the first time, Assyrians brought the Industrial Revolution to the world. They invented cart to run on the land, and the ship to plough the sea, metals and minerals tamed to serve the man, because of the world could write and read, they showed how to irrigate the land and how to water reservoirs. Now they lost everything. Very few of them fled to neighbouring lands to save their dear life. Some were on board of ships, they invented, sailed through opened Persian Gulf, sojourned for some time at Adana /Aden/ and navigated to the Indian Ocean to look for an uninhabited land if existed. According to the accounts of Greek historian and geographer, Strabo (61BC-24AD) and Arabian historian Marki Ahamed Oglu, they found an island in the Indian Ocean, at last, to settle down in peace without fear.
About three centuries later, Assyrians together with Phoenicians, former trading partners who sold their cunei-forms and Alphabet for exorbitant prices abroad, opened an emporium at Mantota, in the jutting out tip of the north-central shore of Helia. Phoenicians were the tycoons, floating in money by committing piracy on high seas. The Vedic name for Helia was Lanka. By Persian was Hela. Aryans were late to get the alphabet, when they were writing Veda on the bank of Nelukha (Indus) they heard some giants making wonders in Lanka and they wrote, Yaksha people could transform themselves into giants or formless spirits. The author of Mahavansa had drunk this elixir.
Mantota
According to Persian history Mantota international market was rich in diversity of articles such as ivory, gems, pearls, peacocks, rice, vegetables and various kinds of tropical fruits. According to the accounts of Greek geographer Ptolemy, new inhabitants could transform the barren lands into unsurpassed fertility and made the landscapes mysterium trimendum. At that time north-central part of Helia was known as Manaram Adaviya. Legends said it was Kumni Adaviya.

World's longest  Italian beef sandwich
A Chicago eatery cooked up 75 pounds of Italian beef and spread it across 109 feet of bread to set a world record for the longest Italian beef sandwich.
Buona Beef gathered a team of volunteers at the Cornerstone Community Center in the Sheridan Park neighborhood to spread the beef across the 109-foot Turano bread and top it with sweet peppers.
John Gill, marketing director for Buona Beef, said the company decided to perform the record attempt at Cornerstone to highlight the center's outreach work with Chicago's homeless population.
"To have something special like an Italian beef sandwich would be awesome. When you can't go to a restaurant yourself, it's pretty exciting to have someone bring the restaurant to you," Andrew Winter, chief financial officer for Cornerstone Community Outreach, told WLS-TV.
Gill said Buona plans to seek certification for the world record.
