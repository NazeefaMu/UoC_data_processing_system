Unitary status dropped from Constitution: MR
Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday alleged that the unitary clause found in the Constitution had been dropped from the first resolution at the SLFPs 65th Convention held in Kurunegala on September 4. Furthermore the clause non-alignment also seemed to have been dropped at first glance from resolution adopted, he said.
The former President who returned to Colombo after his trip to Malaysia on September 5 around noon was speaking to the media from a friends residence in Anuradhapura after paying homage at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and the Ruwanweliseya.
The former President said the Joint Opposition SLFP group had decided toboycott the Partys 65th Convention and he kept away as he had to abide by that decision. Their action was also in keeping with the decision taken by the Partys electoral Bala Mandalaya to boycott the Convention.
Asked about the assault on the Sri Lanka Ambassador in Malaysia, Rajapaksa said it was a most saddening event.
It was done by a group of about 20 youth wearing T-shirts bearing the picture of Prabhakaran and the LTTE label, he said.
These people satged protests at every temple he visited. They even manhandled a bhikkhu. He could not visit only one sheduled temple because he did not want to cause inconvenience to the Bhikkhu who who had been roughed up. However, from the day they defeated LTTE terrorism they expected such threats against them.
Referring to the claims of massive crowds attending the SLFP Convention at Kurunegala, he said he knew how a government had the means to gather crowds Rajapaksa who said he is a die hard SLFPer than many others who staked the claim added that the name of his father late D. A. Rajapaksa who crossed over to the opposition from UNP government following Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike to form the SLFP had been conveniently dropped and forgotten by most people holding the Party reins. Asked about the rumours about the formation of a new party, Rajapaksa said they should have a place to go when they are offered a step motherly treatment.
Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena and Shehan Semasinghe, Provincial Minister H. B. Semasinghe and former Anuradhapura Mayor H. P. Somadasa were also associated with the former President.

LTTE being strengthened locally and internationally warns - Ranatunga
Parliamentarian and Joint Opposition member Prasanna Ranatunga in a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena, has requested him to intervene and counter LTTE activities inimical to Sri Lanka which he says have been increasing both locally and internationally in recent times.
To prove his point, Ranatunge has cited the destruction of two Buddha statues situated in Kanagarayankulam on the A9 road by some unidentified persons on August 29.
He had said this followed the adoption of several resolutions by the Northern Provincial Council calling for the removal of Buddhist places of worship and Buddha statues, recently.
Ranatunga said in his letter that the motion for the removal of the Sambodhi Viharaya in Kokilai Mullaitivu, tabled by Provincial Council member T Raviharan, had been seconded by member Sivajilingam. Member Subramaniam Pashupathipillai tabled a motion for the removal of a Buddha statue from Madhu in Kilinochchi.
Following the destruction of the two Buddha statues in Kanagayankulam, several Bhikkhus and Tamil people in Kurusittikulam led by the Kurukkal of Kurusittikulam Amman Kovil, had intervened and re-installed a Buddha statue there and they were thankful for this deed.
However, it was regrettable that legal action had not been taken against those responsible for dismantling Buddha statues.
Ranatunga said the behaviour and the activities of TNA Members of Parliament and the NPC, showed that they were nurturing Tiger Terrorism.
Certain resolutions adopted by the TNA showed that they helped to strengthen separatism.
Ranatunga said the TNA supported the President at the last Presidential election and a party which supported him (the President) acting in this manner was most regrettable.
The President while addressing media heads recently, had requested them to desist from causing harm to reconciliation.
But there was suspicion among the public that silence was maintained in the face of TNA onslaughts on reconciliation as a reward for supporting the President. Ranatunge said if the President truly wanted to promote reconciliation, he should stop anti-reconciliation actions taking place in the North forthwith.
Ranatunga said they vehemently condemned the attack and threats aimed by the Tiger diaspora on the Viharadhipathi of Senthul Viharaya in Kuala Lumpur, which was to be visited by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the attack on the Sri Lanka High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur which happened in a well organized manner. The Government should take immediate diplomatic action against these incidents.
All this showed that the LTTE (Tiger) Diaspora was getting strengthened both locally and internationally. The most regrettable thing is to see the Diaspora getting strengthened internationally at a time when a government which crows about winning the international world was in power.

[Parliament (07-09-2016)]
PM reassures security to MR
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in Parliament reassured adequate security to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Prime Minister, replying to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Order 23 (2), said the government has paid special attention to the security of former President Rajapaksa in and outside the country.
We will not let him be harmed. He is a person who should be in active politics. I have no issue at all about it, the Prime Minister said.
He said the Foreign Affairs Ministry gave all facilities to former President Rajapaksa when undertaking foreign visits, including vehicles to travel.
It is the government's responsibility to provide assistance to MPs, Ministers and even former Presidents when they make foreign visits. This equally applies to former President Chandrika Kumaratunaga, he said.
The Prime Minister, however, said it was up to the host country to provide adequate security to diplomatic missions.
This is common even to the President and me. We can take several security guards, but they are not allowed to carry weapons. The practice is to ask the security from the host country, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government was looking into the pro-LTTE groups in Malaysia, adding that it had close connections with Kumaran Pathmanathan (KP).
It is with him the previous government had entered into agreements, he said.
The Prime Minister reminding that yesterday marked the 70th Anniversary of the UNP, said UNP Founder D. S. Senanayake emphasised the need to build up the Sri Lankan identity keeping aside Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim differences.
That is what we are trying to do. We will solve this problem forever with the support of all parties, he said.
The Prime Minister said former President Rajapaksa participated in the International Conference of the Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) held in Malaysia representing the SLFP.
The ICAPP did not recognise any group from the Joint Opposition, but the SLFP. Representing the UNP, Minister Daya Gamage and Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage participated. MP Dinesh Gunawardena participated representing the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. Rajapaksa thought this conference was more important than the SLFP convention and went to Kuala Lumpur. If they attended representing the Joint Opposition, they would not have been recognised. They might also have to stay outside along with those who were protesting on the street, he said.
The Former President was a former Chairman to the ICAPP. He attended it representing the SLFP, he said.
"We do not criticise it. Even the President had no objection, said the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister before making a reply to MP Gunawardena also asked former President Rajapaksa who was present in the chamber to express his concerns too, but he declined it and signalled that he did not not wish to speak.
Accused should be prosecuted here
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan condemned the protest against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa during his visit to Malaysia to attend the International Conference of the Asia Pacific Parliament Members Union (ICAPPMU) and the assault on Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar.
He said the government should take action against the offenders. Such incidents should be discouraged and terminated ensuring the stability in the country, he said.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday during the debate that followed the special statement by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23 (2) querying the measures taken in connection with the recent incidents in Malaysia.
Sampanthan said he unreservedly condemned the incident.
Stringent action should be taken against the offenders, if they are Sri Lankan citizens, the Opposition Leader said.
If they are not Sri Lankan citizens, they should get extradited to Sri Lanka and be charged against them here,he said.
He said at a time the country is marching towards stability and harmony, such incidents were unwarranted. He said the people who do these foolish actions would not realise the consequences of such actions. Such people do not realise that they are playing into the hands of those who do not want stability in Sri Lanka. Stringent action should be taken against the offenders, Sampanthan said.
Malaysian protesters motive doesnt reflect Northern peoples voice: Anura Kumara
The voice of the protesters in Malaysia that staged the protest during the visit of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and other members to attend the International Conference of the Asia Pacific Parliament Members Union (ICAPPMU) does not represent the voice of the people in the North, said Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday during the debate that followed the special statement by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23 (2).
MP Dissnayake said the diaspora demanded the people in the North during the last elections to boycott it. However the Northern people did not respond to them and did otherwise at the elections.
He said the protesters in Malaysia were not Sri Lankans. If the voice of the people of the North tallied with the voice of the diaspora and the extremists, we would face a problem, MP Dissanayake said.
Due to this reason, Parliament as a whole should condemn these incidents, he said. Dissanayake said the assault on Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar should be condemned as he was representing Sri Lanka.
The Malaysian government has failed to reciprocate by providing security to representatives of Sri Lanka as we had done to them, he said.
Dinesh queries govt. actionon Malaysian protestors and attackers
Joint Opposition Member and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday inquired as to what steps the government has taken in connection with the incident of a fierce protest against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his visit to Malaysia to attend the International Conference of the Asia Pacific Parliament Members Union (ICAPPMU) and the assault on Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar.
He made this query in Parliament making a special statement under standing order 23 (2) yesterday.
He queried as to why the government was silent on the assault on the chief monk of the Sri Lankan Buddhist temple in Sentul, Malaysia by the protesters after querying him on the arrival of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This incident has a serious impact on the dignity of the country said MP Gunawardena.
The protesters also came to the Airport asking for Mahinda Rajapaksa. This was carried out by some people who have connections with the LTTE.
He questioned if the security of Mahinda Rajapaksa be increased and change the policy of the government in this connection.
Govt. to prevent recurrence of incidents that happened in Malaysia
The government would not allow to recur such incident that took place in Malaysia during the visit of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, some other MPs and the incident faced by the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia, said Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake yesterday. He said a party that enabled all the communities to live together harmoniously is in power. It was established 70 years on a day like yesterday. He said on such an occasion, the government ensures that such incidents would not be allowed to be repeated.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday during the debate that followed the special statement by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23 (2) querying the measures taken in connection with the recent incidents in Malaysia.
Sagala skips question on ISIS on national security ground
Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayake in Parliament yesterday declined to respond to a question on ISIS links in Sri Lanka on the ground of national security and public safety.
The order paper contained a question from MP Dullas Alahapperuma asking whether it is true that Sri Lankans have joined the organisation called the ISIS, which spreads terrorism for a World Islamic State.
The minister when asked to table the answer as MP Alahapperuma was not present in the House, said he seeks the approval of the Chair to refrain from replying. However, he said if MP Alahapperuma or any other MP wishes to have more information pertaining to what was in the question, he was happy to speak to them outside the House.
The MP in the question had asked how many Sri Lankans have been revealed to be fighting for the ISIS and whether there are persons who have been found to have died fighting in this way.
He asked whether it is true that the ISIS has envisaged Sri Lanka as a battleground of theirs for 2020, according to the plans prepared on their expansion.
He asked what instructions have been provided by the state intelligence sections to counter the spread of ISIS terrorism in Sri Lanka and whether any political party, organisation or a non-governmental organisation in Sri Lanka maintains links with the ISIS.
Kiriella reminds of attack on Chris Nonis
Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday queried as to what steps did the previous government take when Sri Lankan High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Chris Nonis was assaulted in the UK.
He made this query from the Joint Opposition side members during the discussion that followed the special statement by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23 (2). Lankan diplomat Chris Nonis was assaulted in London. What did your government do then queried Minister Kiriella.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena said he raised an important question seeking response from the Prime Minister. The problem between Sajin Vass and Nonis occurred in a dinner after consuming various things, said MP Dinesh Gunawardena. You cannot compare it with this incident. The other matter is that he is an SLFP organiser who is with the government, he said.
Malaysian HC regrets over assault on Lankan HC: Harsha
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said the Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka expressed his regret over the assault on the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia.
The Deputy Minister said the biggest damage was caused to the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia who is employed by the Foreign Ministry.
He said the Foreign Ministry took measures to have a meeting with the Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and discussed the matter. He said the High Commissioner deeply regretted over the incident.
The Deputy Minister said the Malaysian High Commissioner assured on behalf of the Malaysian government that such a situation would no be repeated.
Deputy Minister de Silva made these observations in Parliament yesterday, expressing his views on the special statement by Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23(2).
Bandula asks Finance Ministry to settle revenue collection issue through dialogue
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday asked the Finance Ministry to initiate a dialogue with the Trade Unions of the Inland Revenue Department to resolve matters over revenue collection.
The MP raising supplementary questions directed the attention of the House to the fact that Inland Revenue Department officers went on sick leave on Monday to register their objection over moves to hand over revenue collection to a foreign company.
The MP asked the Finance Ministry to consider the practical aspects when imposing new taxes, pointing out that the government has been unable to reach the predicted revenue targets due to impractical budgetary proposals.
Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, who replied to MP Gunawardena in the absence of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, said the questions raised would be brought to the attention of the subject minister.
The minister reading out the Finance Ministry reply to a question on the Mansion Tax, said the government had received no income from the tax proposed in the interim Budget of 2015 and the Budget 2016.
The tax was proposed to be levied on the owners of houses and buildings constructed on or after April 1, 2000 for residential purposes of which the floor area is not less than 10,000 square feet, or the value of such building as at the first day of April of any relevant year is not less than Rs. 150 million. However, it could not be implemented as several more Amendments to it were proposed to add more exemptions. The Bill has not yet been finalised with the Amendments, the minister said.
JVP berates govt. for outsourcing tax collection to Hong Kong company
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) accused the government stating that it has signed an agreement with Hong Kong McKenzie Company Ltd to outsource tax collection.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath said in Parliament that the fees to be paid to the company has been agreed upon.
He made these observations joining the debate under the regulations under the Industrial Disputes Act yesterday.
He said the government had not learnt a lesson from the privatisation of estate companies.
It had gone further into privatise tax collection.
He said the privatisation of estate companies had resulted in a delay in signing collective agreements with the unions.
It has been almost two yeas since signing of the collective agreements, said JVP MP Vijitha Hearth. Such collective agreements are usually signed once in two years, he said.
Feasibility study by AAI to develop Palali airport
The government has given consent to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to carry out a feasibility study to develop the Palali airport, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation replying to a question by MP Bimal Rathnayake.
The Prime Minister observing that the Cabinet approval is not necessary to obtain a feasibility report, said the decision was taken with the approval of the relevant ministry.
MP Bimal Rathnayake asked whether an agreement was signed between the Sri Lankan government and the Indian government or an Indian company to modernise the Palali airport and whether open tender procedure had been followed in giving the contract to the Indian Company.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Niroshan Perera replying to the question said there has been no such agreement, adding that only a feasibility study had been carried out.
We need to inform them our requirements on the project. If the Palali airport is to be developed the adjacent lands have to be taken over. It requires a large sum of money. We have not decided to proceed on this venture, he said.
UN chiefs remarks do not affect countrys sovereignty
President Maithripala Sirisena has pledged that a hybrid court comprising foreign judges would not be established to hear alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, said Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
He said the President has assured that he would not betray War Heroes during his tenure as the President. He said the Presidents stance is to build up strong reconciliation in the country.
He made these observations in response to an adjournment motion moved by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday, demanding the government to reveal its stance on a statement made by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

The minister said there is nothing in addition to their stances published even in the UN website. He requested the Joint Opposition not to make these things political slogans.
This government is coping up with the international communities well. We request you not to disrupt it, said Minister Samarasinghe. The image of the country was damaged by what our politicians did When Ban ki-moon and Navaneethan Pillei came to Sri Lanka on previous occasions. We cant fool the United Nations, he said. The minister said the government works according to a national policy. He said the government would not betray War Heroes.
Joining the adjournment debate, acting Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said the government has proved that it attempts to ensure rights of all the people equally.

UPFA Gen.Sec.invites all Leftist parties to join SLFP
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic and Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera invited all Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members and all Leftist political parties to join hands with the SLFP to form a strong SLFP-led government in the future.
With the successful completion of the SLFPs 65th Convention,it is obvious that the SLFP is marching forward as a strong political movement regardless of those minor obstacles.At this juncture, all our supporters and leftist parties are invited to work within the party to form a SLFP led government, he said.
He was addressing a media conference at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The SLFP will contest the forthcoming elections under the traditional Hand symbol, he said.
Come under the shadow of the Hand symbol and lets strengthen the SLFP so as to form a SLFP led government. Join the Hand symbol and join the blue colour to empower the SLFP,he said.
Speaking about the recently held SLFP 65th Convention, Amaraweera said it was the largest ever convention held by a political party in the country.
He added it has been reported that the convention was attended by supporters from all parts of the country.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the SLFP was able to showcase its strength and political power at the recent Convention. Moreover, it was significant that Party leader President Maithripala Sirisena clearly mentioned that he would take up the responsibility of steering the party towards forming a SLFP- led government.
President Sirisena pointed out a way-plan to prosperity and how the party will be driven forward while protecting its internal harmony and unity. With the success of the Convention, we were able to strengthen party unity, he said.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Senevirathne noted that the recent Convention was definitely the biggest ever convention held by the SLFP since its founding. He refuted certain allegations levelled especially by Joint Opposition members that a large number of UNP activists participated in the SLFP Convention as the SLFP leaders were unable to bring their supporters to the Convention.
That was an utter lie.No UNP supporters were seen at the Convention except UNP General Secretory Kabir Hashim, he said.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said thet SLFP is not anybodys personal property and it belongs to every SLFP supporter.
He added that Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa are not SLFPers.
Gammanpila does not have any moral or ethical right to talk or comment on the SLFP. He does not have any connection with the SLFP. Actually, I feel sorry for him, he said,
He further added that it is a great mistake if anyone thinks that the party can be defeated if one resigns from a post. The party cannot be defeated by resigning or criticising it.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama said the large crowds at the Convention is considered as a turning point for the SLFP.
He added that Gammanpila and Weerrawansa are now past their expiry date. They have nothing to market now other than levelling baseless allegations and slinging mud at the SLFP.
The shelf-lifeof Gammanpila and Weerawansa is over and therefore they are expired now, he said.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said that Gammanpila is talking about the 65-year-old SLFP when his party has still not been born. Weerawansas party is born but is handicapped.
They want to create problems within the SLFP aiming to achieve cheap political mileage. Weerawansa and Gammanpila are in Parliament today because of the SLFP.
Minister Perera added that there is no danger for small political parties which are with the SLFP eventhough the SLFP goes to elections under the Hand symbol.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissnayake said the party has now come under the leadership by the right person and therefore the party is now going in the right direction.
The SLFP is in government without losing its identity. He also invited Leftist parties to join with the SLFP.

Gammanpila on how MR could regain power
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and UPFA parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila yesterday spoke about several ways how former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could regain power.
If the office of the President shall become vacant, Parliament can re-appoint former President Rajapaksa to fill the vacancy.
According to Article 31(2) of the constitution, people cannot re-elect a President who has held the post on two occasions. But nowhere in the constitution it says that Parliament cannot do so, Gammanpila said.
He said it was the new government which brought the 19th Amendment which curtailed the maximum term of a President to hold office to two terms.
Gammanpila said this was done to keep out Rajapaksa from regaining Presidency and added they still left loopholes.
He said Rajapaksa could become the Prime Minister with majority consent in Parliament.
If he has majority support in the legislature he can be appointed as the Premier, Gammanpila added. Speaking to the media in Colombo, Gammanpila said the joint opposition will launch a mass agitation campaign if the government tries to postpone the next Presidential election.
Commenting on the 65th SLFP convention held at Kurunegala last Sunday, Gammanpila said the crowd present was below 10,000 and added that the comments made by some SLFP leaders it was the biggest ever was a mere rhetoric.
He said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had not met the President recently as predicted in some newspaper reports.
Gammanpila identified himself as the unofficial spokesman for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
