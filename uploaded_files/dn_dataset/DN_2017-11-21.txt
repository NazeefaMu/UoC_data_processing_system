The future of Sri Lanka is its youth
The future of Sri Lanka is its youth, and that future depends on access to a quality education in a safe and nurturing environment, said US Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Hilton at the opening of US-funded Refurbished School in Batticaloa last week.
The windows provide students a view of different landscapes of ideas, while the doors open to new opportunities. It is especially important to offer these opportunities to young women and girls. The education of women has historically been overlooked in many societies, including my own.
I am happy we can provide this assistance to the future female leaders of Sri Lanka.
We are standing in a densely populated area that is unfortunately vulnerable to natural disasters. Because of this, we have worked with the Disaster Management Center to construct a building that can serve as an emergency shelter for the local population in times of need. The kitchen can prepare 500 meals a day and the new 35,000-liter water catchment system and 2,000 and 500 liter water tanks will ensure safe drinking water for anyone who shelters here.
Originally built in 1976, this all-girls school was selected by the US Pacific Command (PACOM) for upgrades based on recommendations from the Sri Lankan Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Center. Together, the US Government and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education have invested 95 million rupees (approximately US$ 624,750) to build this three-story addition to the school. This addition means that another 480 students will have the opportunity to pursue their education.
Over the past four years, PACOM and our Embassy teams have worked closely with the Eastern Province Ministry of Education and the Disaster Management Center to bring us to this day.
I would like to thank our partners at Magbool Engineering Consultants and Hairu Engineering Consultancy, US Army Corps of Engineers for their essential contributions and thank Richard Stanlee and the Pacific Command/U.S. Embassy Civil Military Support Element. They made it all possible.
This cooperation is part of the US Embassy and governments support for a reconciled and unified Sri Lanka. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Sri Lankan government as it rebuilds the economy, advances good governance and the rule of law and works to ensure equal rights and human rights and equal opportunity for all.

Budget aims to make SL a nation of entrepreneurs
The country has lost a sense of enterprise and the traditions as a trading nation have been buried under an ever expanding role of the state coupled with a blanket of protectionism, said State Minister of Finance and Mass Media Eran Wickramaratne.
As a result, over the years, trade has contracted, making the economy more vulnerable and Exports to GDP ratio which was 33% in 2000, had declined to around 12% by 2016.
He was speaking at the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) post-Budget Forum at the Kingsbury Hotel recently. He stated that it is time to change this narrative, which the Government has begun with this budget. The programme Enterprise Sri Lanka will empower Sri Lankans and will enable them to take their future into their own hands.
As such, the objective of the Budget this year is to create a nation of entrepreneurs, where innovative business startups thrive in a competitive market economy. He added that the government wants to bring that old glory back and make Sri Lanka a trading nation.
For this purpose, the Government has made a number of proposals which include empowering SMEs to reach global markets, making export procedures smoother and less cumbersome, removal of para tariffs which hinder trade in certain sectors, removal of ownership restrictions of foreign entities in the shipping and logistics industries, etc.
Most of the reforms proposed are a part of the holistic idea of liberalization of the economy.
Liberalization increases competition, competition breeds success, tests limitations and forces innovation.
He therefore emphasized that exporters should not be worried about the moves of the Government towards liberalization, including entering into free trade agreements with trading nations and removal of para tariffs.
The main presentation at the Forum was made by Suresh Perera, Principal Tax and Regulatory, and Director of Secretarial Services of KPMG who said that the revenue arising from taxation related to GDP was relatively very low in Sri Lanka compared to many other countries.
He added that that Budget 2018 has introduced four new taxes namely the debt repayment levy, carbon tax, levy related to cellular towers, and the levy on SMS advertising which has increased the number of taxes to 39.
This factor could have contributed to the Doing Business Index of Sri Lanka declining from 109 to 111 while India has gained 23 positions in the ranking, probably due to consolidation of many existing taxes under the GST, among other factors.
He further stated that expansion of coverage of VAT is a good move as in the case of most countries, since the objective and the effectiveness of the VAT scheme is diminished due to several exemptions provided hitherto.

Gabbatoir theatre of Ashes nightmares awaits Roots England
BRISBANE Nov20: Joe Root's tourists will have to conquer England's historical psychological demons at the 'Gabbatoir' if they are to avoid another potentially fatal start to their Ashes campaign this week.
Brisbane's Woolloongabba Ground -- an Aboriginal word for 'fighting place' or just 'The Gabba' as it's commonly known -- is Australia's intimidating fortress and a theatre of nightmares for visiting England teams.
The Australians have not lost a Gabba Test since November 1988, and that was against the mighty West Indians. England last won there in the days of Ian Botham 31 years ago.
The Gabba has mystical qualities. It does extraordinary things to touring English teams.
England have won in Brisbane only four times in 20 Tests - twice in the 1930s, once against the Kerry Packer-weakened 1978-79 Australians and the last time in 1986.
If something can go horribly wrong for England at the outset of an Ashes series in Australia, it usually occurs at the Gabba.
In 1954, the legendary Len Hutton won the toss and sent Australia into bat and crashed to an innings defeat. In 2002 Nasser Hussain did the same and England were crushed by 384 runs. On the next tour in 2006 Steve Harmison hurled down what has been panned as the worst opening ball in the history of Ashes cricket.
Harmison sprayed his first delivery to second slip much to the chortling derision of the Gabba crowd as a tell-tale early indicator to England's subsequent abject 277-run demise.
On England's last visit to the Gabba, firebrand Mitchell Johnson captured nine wickets to blast out Alastair Cook's team for 136 and 179 leading to a whopping 381-run defeat.
It's little wonder England's team and fans approach an opening Ashes Test at the Gabba with some trepidation. Part of the fortress culture at the Gabba also comes packaged with the ribald welcome that the home fans serve up to visiting teams.
Paceman Simon Jones experienced that hostility when he chased down the ball in the outfield on the first day of the 2002-03 Ashes only to jar his knee in the loose turf.
He ruptured ligaments and was carried off the field, his tour over. As I was carried off, someone in the crowd shouted that I was a 'weak pommie bastard' and threw a can of beer at me, Jones recalled.
But I didn't take it personally. The Gabba was like that. It's a seriously impressive stadium with its own intimidating properties. Not even England's vociferous Barmy Army supporters will be there in mass numbers to help their team this week after receiving an allocation of just 200 tickets for each day's play. AFP

More Sri Lankan goods entering Indian market
Sri Lanka-India FTA structure is changing fast and there is a trend that more Sri Lankan products are entering the Indian market, said former Secretary, Minister of Finance, India, Dr. S Narayan. Speaking at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute on the subject of India -Sri Lanka economic relations in Modis India, he said that the trade balance is now shifting towards Sri Lankas favour, from 9 to 1 three years ago to 6 to 1, recently. The total bilateral trade volume was US$4.7 billion. He said that most Sri Lankan companies that set up manufacturing plants in South India are doing great. Companies like Damro are well accepted in India and from Chennai they are now setting up plants in other states as well.
He said that Sri Lankan sausages too are very well accepted and Indian manufacturers are now raising their bar to meet Sri Lanka standards of quality. The same has to be said with regard to Sri Lankan strawberries and chicken feed. The former finance secretary said that this has also to be said with regard to the ICT sector. The fear that if you open up an ICT firm in Sri Lanka, it would be invaded by Indian staff is not true. Already there are so many vacancies that are going a begging in India. Hence this fear is not warranted.
Similarly, there are so many small-time businesses that are struggling to get staff and it has to be said this is also the same when it comes to professionals like doctors, accountants and engineers.
He also said that there are over 100 flights per week taking off from Chennai mostly filled with passengers as well as goods like saris and sarongs from India.
In addition, there is a lot of merchandise that is being transported from Tuticorin to Colombo in small boats. These boats carry cement and automobile parts.
He also said that the India-Lanka FTA is still to reap its full benefits as some of its clauses are yet to be implemented and they are at the discussion stage.

Public to suffer due to tax increase on packing material
The tax increase on packaging raw materials under the proposed budget, will only have a negative impact on the public who are the end consumers of packaged products, says Sri Lanka Laminated Flexible Packaging Manufacturers Association.
Under the proposed budget for 2018, an import tax of Rs10 was levied for every Kilogram of plastic resin. The association states that it will fall short of being a sustainable solution to reduce the usage of polythene.
The budget is portrayed as an environment-friendly budget; with measures targeted in that direction. However, in reality, these measures only burden the public in the form of increased product prices. Sri Lanka still does not have a sustainable solution to recycle garbage. Although many are trying quick fixes to solve this problem, their efforts are proving to be futile. The country needs a far-sighted program and not a short-term fix and the leadership responsible must be committed to such a program instead of a short term solution. Far-sighted programs need time, planning and patience.Taxation under the green economy is only a bigger burden to the end consumers, said the Spokesperson of the Sri Lanka Laminated Flexible Packaging Manufacturers Association.
The Association says that this taxation will have a ripple effect and hit multiple industries that are depending on the services of the packaging industry and eventually the end consumer. According to the Packaging Manufacturers Association, the current tax increase comes into effect on
top of many other challenges already faced by the industry. While the prices of raw materials have been continuously on the rise over the past, the depreciating value of the Sri Lankan rupee, high cost of electricity and high bank interest rates have put the industry in a difficult situation.
Waste management and recycling are the responsibilities of the government. Eluding these responsibilities and imposing taxes in the guise of Eco-friendly solutions is not a viable proposition to the larger issue. Tax revenues collected in the past on packaging raw materials have not been utilized to find a sustainable solution to the problem. We urge the government to analyze all different aspects of the problem and reconsider these proposed taxation as these do not provide a real solution, the spokesperson further added.

Afghanistan clinches Under-19 Asia Cup
Afghanistan pulled off a stunning 185-run victory against Pakistan to clinch the Under-19 Asia Cup for the first time at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.
Riding on an unbeaten 107 from Ikram Ali, Afghanistan posted 248 for 7. In response, Pakistan was bundled for just 63 in 22.1 overs, Mujeeb Zadran returning brilliant figures of 5 for 13. Mujeeb, the off-spinner, had taken 6 for 23 in the league match between the sides, which too Afghanistan had won, by seven wickets.
Mujeeb, who finished the tournament with 20 wickets from five matches, removed Mohammad Arif (4) and Omair Yousuf (0), the openers, early in the chase, giving Afghanistan control over proceedings after Ikram had helped it rack up the runs.
The early wobble triggered panic in the Pakistan camp, and the Afghanistan bowlers took full advantage of the situation.
Qais Ahmad, the leg-spinner, chipped in with 3 for 18 in six overs to lend support to Mujeeb, and the wickets kept tumbling in quick succession.
With the pressure of the final bogging them down, as many as nine Pakistan batsmen failed to reach double-figures, and Afghanistan wrapped up the tail with ease to achieve victory.
Earlier, sent in to bat, Afghanistan had got off to a good start, with Rahmanullah Gurbaz (40) and Ibrahim Zadran (36) putting on a 61-run partnership off 108 balls for the opening wicket.
Once Gurbaz fell, caught by Muhammad Arif off Muhammad Musa, Pakistan sensed an opening. But Ikram foiled its plans with his brilliant knock to singlehandedly carry Afghanistan past 200.
Ibrahim was caught off Mohammad Taha in the 27th over, and after that, there was hardly any support for Ikram from the other end. Pakistan, however, couldn't break Ikrams resistance, with the batsman keeping the scoreboard ticking with ten boundaries and two sixes in his innings.
Musa, who troubled the top and middle-order batsmen with figures of 3 for 46, was ably supported by Shaheen Afridi, the left-arm pacer who bagged 2 for 42 to inflict some late damage.
In the end, Afghanistan had more than enough on the board to get the better of Pakistan in its first entry into the final. Afghanistan had crashed out at the semi-final stage in the previous three editions.
Scores: Afghanistan 248-7 in 50 overs (Ikram Ali Khil 107; Muhammad Musa 3/46)
Pakistan 63 in 22.1 overs (Mujeeb Zadran 5/13)

BCC backs liberalisation of shipping
Liberalisation of the shipping and logistics sectors despite criticism would result in the increased utilization of the Port of Colombo and help promote the logistics sector, said Business Chamber of Commerce (BCC).
BCC President Dr. Ali Asger Shabbir said that changes to entrepot trade (trade in one centre for the goods of other countries) and current laws pertaining to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority besides the Merchant Shipping Act too are most welcome.
Sri Lanka has yet to exploit entrepot trading to its full potential which has been taken advantage of by Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore enabling them to earn billions in foreign exchange through this medium of trading.
With regard to policy reforms and laws on trade, the proposed action on anti-dumping and countervailing measures and tariff should help to curb dumping.
A host of multilateral trade treaties bind Sri Lanka to such treaties. We agree with the Ministers proposal that a degree of protection to local industries is important.
The idea to create a green and blue economy is welcome. It is of importance from the overall perspective of the nation especially in face of upcoming projects of a mega nature in Colombo. As an export-oriented Chamber, we are pleased with the proposal to introduce an export support program.
The idea to meet costs involved in renting retail shop space for a period of 36 months in selected markets will most likely boost trade in Sri Lankan products.
The proposed emphasis on vocational training and liberalization of the labour market would also have a major positive impact on the overall economy.
Many countries including those in Asia reap rich rewards by attracting foreign students to universities in their respective countries.
We would like to say that the university system be further liberalized to encourage foreign students to be educated in Sri Lanka.
Finally, we wish to commend the idea of e-trade information platforms contained in the proposals together with the changes in incorporating business registration through the establishment of a one-stop shop including digitalization of company records. It is our sincere hope that the reforms and changes initiated through the 2018 budget proposals will be implemented in due course.

Bolt enlisted to make Aussie cricketers explosive runners
Sydney: Australias cricketers have called on retired sprint king Usain Bolt to boost their running between the wickets during the Ashes Test series against England.
The Jamaican track superstar, the world record holder in the 100m and 200m and eight-time Olympic champion, is working with the Australian batsmen to improve their explosiveness off the mark.
Its all about explosiveness, and thats one thing Ive noticed with cricket -- they dont really have a lot of explosiveness when theyre running, the worlds fastest man told the Herald Sun newspaper.
They seem to always take off at a slow rate. Getting that right will definitely help people.
Bolt, 31, who retired from athletics after Augusts World Championships in London, said he was trying to increase the awareness of running while batting.
Australian batsman Peter Handscomb said Bolts tips were welcomed ahead of Thursdays first Ashes Test in Brisbane.
He was giving us a few pointers on how to get a little bit faster, Handscomb said. Well give it a crack.
He was trying to get us nice and low in the turn and in and out. The first couple of steps are key and if we can get them right, well be fast. AFP

Boomers thrive amid thrills but keep alive!
We oldsters are known as the Baby Boomer generation. But I prefer to think of people my age or thereabouts as the Live and Learn generation. We threw caution to the winds when we were young and tested the boundaries every chance we had to prove our invincibility to the world. We slept in cribs that were covered in lead-based paint and consumed enough five cent bulls-eye sweets from the corner kadey to fall into a sugar coma.
Our weekends were spent at beaches, lakes, and muddy pools without the protection of sunscreen lotion. Suntans were the norm. After all, arent the majority of Sri Lankans born naturally tanned Cuts and burns were treated with the sap from an aloe plant. We didnt worry too much about what we ate. We were expert flingers of rocks, sticks and stones at fruit-laden trees. How else could we have gathered forbidden fruit Raw mangoes and half-ripe fruit, complemented with chillie and salt, were exotic snacks between regular meals. Besides, our standard food didnt come with nutrition labels listing the number of calories per serving or percentages of fat. We ate real butter guilt-free in an age when words such as triglycerides and cholesterol were as alien to us as the moon.
Also an egg has to be one of the first eggs-traordinary items of real natural food we were fed. We had them for breakfast four or five times a week and occasionally for supper. Many hundreds of dozen of eggs later this is a love affair that has not waned. And making an egg dish is as easy as breaking a leg, or rather an egg. We all shared the same egg-static notion about eggs. We did not carry sealed water bottles with us when straying outside home. We drank it unfiltered straight off the tap to slake our thirst while ignoring its rusty flavour.
We rode in the back of station wagons without seat belts and played games on the floorboards of cars. Our Dads and uncles smoked as they drove, often with the windows rolled up, because no one propounded that cigarettes caused health problems. And yet, we survived. There are so many memories from our childhood that our kids will never experience, which Im pretty sure theyre thankful to have missed. To them, a world without internet, cable TV, video games, cell phones and microwaves would equate to living in a cave and communicating with rocks and sticks. It would be beyond their comprehension how a family of six could share a single fixed-line rotary dialling phone.
It was a time when you had to make certain you darn well swotted for your exams because they threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed. And it was no threat because they did. Imagine there were unfortunate chappies who were kept back in the primary fourth standard for four years on the trot.
Forty years ago, Google couldnt be found in the Websters Dictionary and Yahoo was something cowboys yelled during a cattle drive. School projects were researched with thick books from the public library rather than by the click of a mouse. World Book Encyclopaedias lined the shelves of many homes and formal letters were pounded out on a manual Smith-Corona typewriter. Handwritten letters have all but disappeared as a form of communication these days. Thanks to technology, the messages our kids send to friends are nothing more than abbreviated texts. That is obviously the reason why if you have school-age children, you may have noticed their handwriting is horrendous.
They may communicate incessantly via written word  they can text with their heads in a paper bag  but put a pen in their hands and they can barely write a sentence in decent cursive. It's not going to be easy to decipher one either, if they think cursive might as well be cuneiform.
Theres something to be said about a six page, handwritten letter from a long distance friend who cared enough to take the time to write it. Still, todays kids will never know the cushion of safety we felt from the world outside of our small slice of suburbia. Front doors and car doors remained unlocked and bicycles could be left out on the lawn overnight without worrying that they might be stolen. As children, we had more freedom to explore the neighbourhood with our friends and could play at the park until dusk without fear of being abducted. That was an era long before stranger danger became both a slogan and safety program. Those lazy stormy afternoons were perfect for reconnecting with family over a rousing game of Monopoly. It was also an opportunity to discover how ruthless your siblings could be when it came to buying up prime property on Boardwalk and Park Place. From pop culture to fashion, these memories take us back in time. Do you remember the good old days of film shows starring singing cowboys sporting white hats who always beat the bad guys in black hats Or how about when a bottle of sugary Orange Barley or Lanka Lime cost 25 cents The latest cowboy Dell comic books were sold retail at 50 cents.
We were parent-free when we walked or rode our bikes to school whizzing past the snail-paced buggy carts conveying smaller kids while wickedly shouting the uncharitable nickname of the terribly squint-eyed carter, Udaballum.
By todays safety standards, every baby boomer should have been dead by the time we were 12. We defied danger on a daily basis. We never knew that we were doing risky things, of course, we just thought that we were having fun. Nonetheless, we spent our days immersed in activities that wed never for a second allow our children or grandchildren to do. Or even think about doing. We rode bikes with no safety gear. Not only did we not wear helmets, wed never even heard of them. Bikes came with a single reflector on the back. It mostly broke off, when another maniacal biker intentionally slammed you from behind just for the heck of it and was rarely replaced. Lights existed but they were considered an extravagance used only by show-offs.
There were no bike paths or lanes offering a buffer from traffic. Many of us seldom rode our bikes sitting on the seat, particularly when there was an audience watching our high-jinks.
We would stand on the seat or sit on the handlebars or turn around backwards and ride down the steepest hill we could find. We did crash a few times and I still have momentous scars from some of the tumbles I took, but Im still here.
In fact, for most kids, the entire concept of bike safety was reduced to a warning from their mother: If you get run over, dont bother to come home for dinner.

Buddha tattoo woman abused on Facebook
A woman who was deported from Sri Lanka for having a tattoo of the Buddha on her arm says she had to leave Facebook after being abused by extremists.
Naomi Coleman, 41, from Coventry, won compensation on Wednesday after being detained in the country for four days, in April 2014.
Following her deportation, she says she received online messages telling her she should die and burn in hell.
Coleman, a Buddhist herself, said she will not return to Sri Lanka.
Coleman, an NHS support worker, said she received the messages following her deportation.
I have never experienced anything like this with Buddhism, she said.
They mostly seemed to be sent from Buddhist extremists in Sri Lanka. They were writing that I should die and burn in hell.
I came completely off Facebook for a few weeks and have now changed my name on social media.
To me, this is not the Buddhist way. Buddhism is about compassion and understanding.
On Wednesday, Sir Lankas Supreme Court said Ms Colemans treatment while she was in custody was scandalous and horrifying and awarded her compensation of 800,000 Sri Lankan rupees - about 4,000.
It said there was no legal basis for her arrest and she had been subject to degrading treatment by some officers and a prison guard.
Coleman, who has been a Buddhist for about 10 years, has travelled widely and continues to go to retreats in Thailand and Nepal.
She said she was overwhelmed by the ruling but would not be returning to Sri Lanka.
Its a shame - its a beautiful country and most of the people are very welcoming, she said.
But it seems there is a small percentage of people who want to cause trouble for me.
Im not sure if its because I am a woman travelling alone. But, at the moment, I wouldnt feel safe going back. - BBC

A budget aimed at strong capital market
One of the most economy friendly budget proposals presented by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera is to allow two leading state banks; Bank of Ceylon and Peoples bank to be listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), having a significant impact on CSE as well as the entire economy.
Even if Sri Lanka is well ahead of other counterparts in the region in terms of literacy rate, we as a country cannot be satisfied with the financial literacy. It is under such a circumstance that certain objections are being made on listing these two banks.
Even though this has been a topic among the stakeholders over the years, the government could not put it into action, due to various reasons, especially protests by trade unions. Truth is that the majority of Sri Lankans want almost everything to be under state control, as they think it is the safest. However, until this attitude is changed, the developing the nation has to be postponed.
Therefore, this must be looked into in an economic perspective, having discarded different political ideologies.
Because the government plans to keep the majority shareholding, giving about 10% to the public, these institutions will not be privatized or owned by a private investor. Although protests were made, due to fears of any privatization, when Sri Lanka Telecom was going to be listed in 1997.
Its majority shares are still owned by the government. Thus far, those that benefit from receiving interests will be given an opportunity to be shareholders and receive dividends in the future.
Profitability can be increased by making necessary reforms and fully utilizing large assets base. Banks are allowed to raise the capital via the stock market. After being listed, they are bound to submit quarterly accounts and annual reports to the CSE, in order that depositors, investors and other stakeholders can know financial performance in the company and predict its future cash flows.
It is needless to say that this improves the level of transparency in companies. Furthermore, stock brokering companies always make researches on listed firms, so that their clients will be informed of companies suitable for possible investments. Accordingly, the public will be well informed of these institutions to be listed in the future.
Public enterprises are said to come under state interference under any government. This criticism can be avoided, when listed firms are bound to comply with CSE rules and regulations. Profit can be taken out as dividends alone.
In conclusion, it has to be stated that this proposal was made, when the Colombo stock Exchange was in dire need of such proposals to be boosted. For a stock market to be a well-performing one, there have to be higher number of listed firms as well as investors. The CSE still has 296 listed firms.
The majority in the country is away from the stock market, especially due to lack of financial literacy. Foreign investors will be further encouraged to invest in the market, when these kind of large firms are being listed. Although this action will be taken as a revenue generating measure, it spontaneously raises market liquidity as well. Hence, it ought to be appreciated in an economic sense.

CID to probe false information about fuel shortage
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry has requested the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to immediately launch an investigation regarding false information being spread about fuel shortage.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga urged the public not to panic due to rumours and assure that there is no fuel shortage in the country.
Addressing the media at the CEYPETCO yesterday, headquarters, Minister Ranatunga said that three fuel shipments are to arrive in next two weeks.
The Minister said he had informed the President that an investigation needs to be immediately conducted.
Measures have been taken to check the quality of fuel before it reaches Sri Lanka. There is no need to panic, there is enough fuel available in the country, he said.
He said that spreading false information could be a conspiracy lead by anti-government groups aimed at the forthcoming Local Government elections.
I will inform the public if there is any shortage of fuel. I will not hide behind anyone,he said.
Minister Ranatunga further said some fuel stations had refused to dispatch oil, having enough storage and added that necessary action will be taken against those fuel station owners.
In the meantime, the Minister added that they were all private fuel stations and if needed their license will also be cancelled.
He said a fuel mafia has been functioning for the past 10 years and added that he is not afraid to take any action.
When questioned about building fuel tanks, Minister Ranatunga said measures to build tanks will be taken in two weeks following the cabinet approval.
He said that 8 years ago Cabinet approval was given to build tanks but no initiatives were taken by the then government.
The Minister added that the Cabinet Sub- Committee appointed to look into the previous fuel shortage issue also suggested building more fuel tanks.
He said decisions with regard to fuel tanks in Trincomalee oil tanks cannot be discussed as there is a court case pending and added that tanks are needed for the Kolonnawa, Muthurajawala and Sapugaskanda oil refineries.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist that owners of the fuel bowsers had requested to increase the amount being paid to them, the Minister said that the owners have requested and would look into that when the right time comes.
He said that it is cheaper to transport fuel in train than in bowsers.
The Minister said before all the bowsers belonged to the CEYPETCO but now private involvement is very high.

Make roads totally safe
I read the Citizens Mail on Friday on road safety by Yu Hwa Li of Pelawatte with great interest. As only a tourist to this wonderful island I have only brief experience to base upon but I can honestly say that by far the worst and most puzzling aspect of my vacation has been the almost irresponsible driving I have seen from most big bus drivers.
Near misses and absurd and unnecessary risk taking to gain a few seconds for a short while before the next stop seems the norm. Compared to all other Sri Lankan road users  whether car, tuk tuk, motorbike or minivan  as well as bus drivers I have seen around the world, they drive far too fast, dangerously and aggressively and on balance despite the service they provide they also seem to represent a considerable liability to public life.
Whether as a passenger, fellow road user or innocent pedestrian on the crowded or narrow streets who can honestly feel totally safe with such driving all around Tolerance of such driving behaviour indicates a worrying lack of concern to public safety. Something needs to change.

Colombo, highest HIV affected district
Colombo North, Central Colombo and Borella are the three most HIV affected areas in the country, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday, he said the most affected province is the Western Province and the most affected district is Colombo.
The CMC conducts free monthly clinics and carries out blood tests but no one wishes to take part if they hear the words `HIV' or `AIDS'. Expensive drugs are given free of charge for infected persons but they abandon treatment after the first or second session.
Consultant Epidemiologist attached to the National STD / AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka Dr. Sriyakanthi Beneragama said a total of 3,900 Sri Lankans are living with HIV by 2016 (last year) and there were 550 estimated new infections in 2016. There were 110 AIDS related deaths in 2016. The estimated HIV prevalence in Sri Lanka in 2016 was less than 0.1 percent. According to Dr. Beneragama, in Sri Lanka, the HIV infection ratio is one woman to every three men. The gap between men and women who are infected with HIV is widening. This means that more males are infected with HIV than women. By the end of October this year, 2,783 HIV infections are reported and 693 of them have developed AIDS. Out of them, a total of 444 have died. Over 80 percent of the HIV infected persons were between the ages of 25 and 49.

Credence Genomics creates history
Credence Genomics Pvt Ltd., Sri Lanka's premier specialized DNA diagnostics services provider has achieved yet another first by being published in the acclaimed BioMed Central (BMC) Infectious Diseases publication.
With their innovative range of specialized DNA diagnostic tests, Credence Genomics has reached out to benefit the medical community in Sri Lanka and in the region, with the uncompromised guarantee of accuracy and speed of test reports by achieving unparalleled benchmarks.
Conceived by Dr. Vaz Gnanam in 2011 Credence Genomics was one of the earliest biotechnology startups not only in Sri Lanka but the region to invest in cutting edge Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and application development.
Steering the clinical genomics initiative, he led a team of scientists and ICT engineers to develop leading edge innovative diagnostics tests which have been the result of six years of stringent research on industry defining genetic science, application of information technology and testing across a broad spectrum of diseases.
The tests rely on NGS technology, which enables the four basic building blocks found in all life forms to be interpreted as digital data, to be captured, stored in a silicon chip and compared by complex software backend.
Complying to relevant international accreditations and quality standards in clinical genomics, the tests have been well received by many leading hospitals and medical institutions across the country. Three specific tests that have been developed are Rapid Infection Detection (RID), BactFast and FungiFast. The above 90% accuracy and ultrafast reporting times have proven their benefits across many different specializations of medicine within a very short span of time.
All three tests are designed to identify suspect organisms based on their DNA makeup, and as an outcome of the tests the presence of all known pathogenic bacteria and fungi in any clinical sample.
On reaching this landmark achievement, Associate Lab Manager of Credence Genomics Pvt Ltd., and first author of the paper Manahari Abayasekera stated, The Rapid Infection Detection product (RID) along with BactFast and FungiFast represents the future of accurate diagnostic delivery in infectious diseases.
Professor Jennifer Perera, Clinical Director of the company, further elaborated saying, It's not very often you find a product that not only has precision and coverage under a single umbrella. Anaerobic infections, mixed infections, unculturable organisms and novel/rare organisms along with the common infection causing candidates can be addressed with these tests.
Dr. N.V. Chandrasekharan, Director Laboratory of Credence Genomics, added, The stringent parameters under which the company has developed and deployed these products can be considered class-leading. With built in quality control and validation these tests represent the future of medicine available now and developed by Sri Lankan scientists and information technology specialists.
The publisher, BioMed Central (BMC) has an evolving portfolio of more than 300 peer-reviewed journals, sharing discoveries from research communities in science, technology, engineering and medicine.

At Credence Genomics our commitment to creating a truly world class product has paid off. Not only does this highlight the ground breaking capabilities of Sri Lankan scientists but our ability for niche development in software engineering in specialized health care delivery, said Dr. Vaz Gnanam, CEO of Credence Genomics.

A day after rallying from a 24-point deficit to beat Philadelphia, the Warriors surged ahead by as many as 28 points early in the second half before the Nets battled back and Curry was out for the last three minutes.
"It was a good learning experience for him," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Curry. "I thought, obviously, he was brilliant in terms of his scoring and shot-making. I thought his second half, he got a little wild.
"We had to withstand their run, and luckily we did with good execution in the last few minutes after Steph Curry went out."
The Warriors improved to 13-4, matching Houston for the best record in the Western Conference with their ninth victory in 10 games, despite the absence of star forward Kevin Durant with a left ankle sprain.
Curry said trying to be aggressive with Durant out led to his 11th career fouling out in the NBA.
"You'd love to have those plays back, but I loved the aggressiveness I had on those possessions," Curry said. "You don't like to foul out, but it was kind of how I tried to bring that intensity the whole game."
Golden State's Klay Thompson had 23 points and 10 rebounds and sank a 3-pointer in his 71st consecutive game while Allan Crabbe had 25 points to lead the Nets (6-10), who suffered their eighth loss in 11 games.
Durant and Washington guard John Wall were sidelined Sunday with injuries. Durant, who suffered a sprained left ankle in the Warriors' 124-116 victory Saturday at Philadelphia, is averaging 24.9 points, 7.0 rebounds and 4.9 assists in 15 games.
His absence comes three days before Golden State plays at Oklahoma City against Durant's former club.
Wall, averaging 19.9 points and 9.3 assists a game, was benched with a swollen left knee. A fluid buildup has been lingering for about a week.
DeMar DeRozan scored 33 points, grabbed eight rebounds and added six assists to spark the Toronto Raptors over visiting Washington 100-91. AFP

Della Reese, 'Touched by an Angel' star and singer, dies at 86

Della Reese, who rose to fame as a jazz singer and later found television stardom on the drama "Touched by an Angel," has died.
She was 86.
"On behalf of her husband, Franklin Lett, and all her friends and family, I share with you the news that our beloved Della Reese has passed away peacefully at her California home surrounded by love. She was an incredible Wife, Mother, Grandmother, friend, and Pastor, as well as an award-winning actress and singer," actress Roma Downey, Reese's co-star on "Touched by an Angel," said in a statement on Facebook.
"Through her life and work she touched and inspired the lives of millions of people," Downey's statement continued. "She was a mother to me and I had the privilege of working with her side by side for so many years."
For nine seasons on CBS, Reese played Tess on "Touched by an Angel," tasked with sending angels to Earth to help people redeem themselves.
"We were privileged to have Della as part of the CBS family when she delivered encouragement and optimism to millions of viewers as Tess on "Touched by an Angel," CBS said in a statement to CNN. "We will forever cherish her warm embraces and generosity of spirit. She will be greatly missed. Another angel has gotten her wings."
Like many during her era, Reese got her start in the black church, where she began singing at the age of 6.
When she was 13, Reese snagged a gig with gospel legend Mahalia Jackson after another lyric soprano became pregnant and was unable to tour.
"Mahalia was magnificent,"Reese told the Archive of American Television in 2008. "I didn't particularly like her because she didn't let me do what I wanted to do. I thought when I got away from my mother on the road, I'd be able to get down and break it loose and do all the stuff she wouldn't let me do. Mahalia was stricter than my mother."
Reese went on to sign a record deal with indie New York label, Jubilee Records and in 1957 landed at No. 12 on the pop chart with the ballad "And That Reminds Me."
Her initial success caught the attention of RCA, where her hits "Don't You Know" and "Not One Minute More" helped secure her place in the music industry as an R & B/pop vocalist.
Reese would later become known for her live jazz performances.
But it was acting that broke her into the big time.
Her stint as the landlady on the 1970s comedy "Chico and the Man" led to other roles that showed off Reese's sass, including as Vera, the tough-as-nails madam in a brothel in Eddie Murphy's 1989 film "Harlem Nights," which also starred her good friend, comedian Redd Foxx.

Deputy Minister writes to Bond Commission
Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera in a letter to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquiry into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds, stated that he has been vilified, over the mass media, including the internet, with false details of an alleged conversation between him and Arjun Aloysius are being circulated.
In a letter sent through Attorney-at-Law Manjula Balasooriya, the Deputy Minister vehemently stated that such details are absolutely false.
My client is gravely concerned that the proceedings of the Bond Commission have been used to cause harm to the character and reputation of my client and hence would appreciate if this letter is placed before the Members of the Commission, and, if required, to allow my clients Counsel to make representations before the Commission Mr. Balasooriya added.
It was reported through the media that on Thursday, November 16, 2017, evidence was led before the Commission from Investigating Officers, by officers of the Attorney Generals Department, of information of alleged telephone communications between Arjuna Aloysius and members of the Committee on Public Enterprise of Parliament, including my client.
In respect of Ajith P. Perera it is alleged that the telephone communication was limited to two telephone calls between my clients mobile phone and that of Aloysius- one incoming call and one outgoing call. There have been no communications on viber or whatsapp.
By alleging that there had been telephone conversations between Aloysius and members of the COPE , there is insinuation that there has been some form of impropriety on the part of the said Members, who were conducting inquiries into the issuance of Treasury Bonds.
My client categorically states that he has not had any conversation with Arjun Aloysius on the Bond Issue. He further states that he is not acquainted with Aloysius in any manner, whatsoever, and has never met Aloysius.
My client draws the attention of the Commission to the following:1. The Additional Solicitor General who led evidence before the Commission on the alleged telephone conversations, failed to lead evidence on or present to the Commission, material particulars relating to the telephone calls, including the time duration of the calls, as well as the dates on which the calls were allegedly made.
2.The ASG failed to lead evidence on other Members of Parliament who were not members of the COPE Committee who had telephone communications with Aloysius. Such communications will be material, since Parliament itself considered the COPE report and debated the same during the relevant time. 3.The ASG has insinuated impropriety on the part of the relevant COPE members, without giving them an opportunity of being heard before the Commission, and, by selectively leading evidence on the said telephone calls.
In the aforesaid I am instructed by my client to request from the Commission the following:
(a)That my client be issued with copies of the reports pertaining to the telephone calls between all Members of Parliament including the members of the COPE and Aloysius, including the details provided by the relevant mobile operators;
(b)That my client be informed of the material particulars of the two telephone calls which had allegedly emanated between his phone and that of Aloysius including the dates, times and durations;
(c)That my client be informed if any recordings exist of such telephone calls and if so that such recordings be released to my client and to the public forthwith;
(d)That my client be given an opportunity to cross examine the relevant Investigating Officers at the earliest opportunity.

Dimitrov beats Goffin to win ATP Finals
London: Grigor Dimitrov beat David Goffin 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in a gripping title decider at the ATP Finals on Sunday to become the first debutant to win the season finale since 1998.
In a surprise final match-up, the Bulgarian sixth seed held his nerve under intense pressure at London's O2 Arena to seal the biggest title of his career on his fifth match point.
He will climb to third in the rankings behind only Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer as he begins to deliver decisively on his rich promise as a youngster.
"It has been a tremendous two weeks for me," said the 26-year-old. "It is such an honour to play here. This week has been one of the best I have had."
"I am lost for words," he added. "My team have been unbelievable, my family."
The Bulgarian came into the title decider unbeaten at the O2, with a healthy 4-1 head-to-head record against Goffin, including a 6-0, 6-2 win in the round-robin stage.
But seventh seed Goffin was buoyed by wins over world number one Nadal and and a gutsy effort against second seed Federer, coming back from a set down to beat the Swiss in the semi-finals.
Both players struggled to hold serve at the start of the contest in front of a feisty packed house and the error count was high from both men.
After three consecutive breaks, the Belgian was the first to hold his serve, forging ahead 3-1 but as time ran out for Dimitrov, Goffin played a poor service game, going long on a forehand to concede another break of serve as the Bulgarian levelled the match at 4-4.
The errors continued to flow from a nervy-looking Goffin and Dimitrov finally secured the decisive break on his fifth set point when the Belgian thumped a forehand into the net.
Goffin, 26, landed just 42 percent of first serves in the first set and made 20 unforced errors, struggling to find the bite and consistency he had enjoyed in beating Federer.
In the second set, neither player earned a break point until the sixth game, when Goffin saved himself with a dramatic backhand crosscourt shot that caught the sideline, taking advantage of two double faults from the racquet of Dimitrov in the next game to break.
Infused with renewed belief, the Belgian held his nerve to clinch the set 6-4.
Despite a sprinkling of break points, a tight third set went with serve until the sixth game, when Dimitrov broke to lead 4-2 as Goffin went wide with a backhand.
As the tension mounted, Goffin bravely saved three championship points on his own serve but Dimitrov held his nerve to seal the match on his own serve after two-and-a-half hours, at the fifth time of asking.
A disappointed Goffin said: "It was a special week for me. A week with a lot of emotion and a lot of fatigue. Now I am feeling tired but it was an amazing week.
"We did an amazing job. It was tough after losing to Grigor in the group. It was not easy to come back but we worked a lot as a team." AFP

A certain group has been spreading rumours, of a petrol shortage, around the country. In such a situation it has been reported that consumers are flocking to petrol sheds and stocking up on petrol. I would like to note that there is no such petrol shortage in the country. Thus I request the general public not panic unnecessarily, stated Marasinghe in a statement released to the media.
The Secretary also asked that the general public not purchase petrol from third parties at exorbitantly high prices and to purchase petrol only from licensed petrol sheds as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had enough stocks.

The dos and donts of EYE MAKE - UP
When it comes to eye make-up, it can transform your look in a jiffy. Be it a classic kajal look or wing liner, your eye make-up can be the focal point of your face. Getting eye make-up right is quite challenging, but following few tricks and how to blend the rest of the make-up can make you look like a beauty pro. Here are a few rules you must follow to master your eye make-up:
1. Dont wear too much make-up
When it comes to sporting heavy eye make-up, you should keep the rest of the make-up minimal, unless you want to look like a disco ball. Go for natural-looking blush and minimal highlighter.
2. Avoid bold lipsticks with heavy eye look
Similarly, a bold lipstick may not be the best choice for smokey eyes or heavy glitter make-up. You can try colours that blend well. Think nude shades or light shades like pink, brown, etc.
3. Use a mascara for light shadows
If youre using a light shadow like a silver one or pastel hues, make sure you define your eyes with a mascara. This will help intensify your eyes and not make you look washed out.
4. Dont forget to groom your brows
Always make sure you groom your brows when sporting eye make-up. So, fill in your brows and shape them well, as all the attention will be around your eye area only.

Sainthood of the Servant of God, late His Eminence Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray
End of an era
The Archdiocesan phase of the Road to Sainthood of the Servant of God, late His Eminence Thomas Benjamin Cardinal Cooray, an illustrious son of Sri Lanka and a very much treasured Member of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the first native Archbishop and the First Sri Lanka Cardinal, is over.
Ragama, Tewatte Basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Sri Lanka was the venue where the official closing ceremony of the Archdiocesan phase of inquiry took place on October 28 with a Concelebrated Holy Mass offered by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo and the Promoter of the Cause, who shoulders the responsibility of getting the Vatican Curia move to name the Sri Lankan, a Saint of the Universal Church, presided as the chief celebrant.
The Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Most Rev. Dr. Piere Vanvot, Chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Bishop of Badulla Diocese Most Rev. Dr. Vincent Fernando, Colombo Auxiliary Bishop Most Rev. Dr. Maxwell Silva, Very Rev. Fr. Ervin Moraes OMI, the Provincial of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Colombo Chapter, joined to Concelebrate the Holy Mass.
The day also marked the 29th death anniversary of the late Prelate. (His Eminence passed away  Rested-In-Peace in the year 1988 at the age of 87).
Colombo Archbishops now in retirement Most Rev. Dr. Nicholas Marcus Fernando and Most Rev. Dr. Oswald Gomis along with the distinguished delegates of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate and other ecclesiastical dignitaries graced the occasion by their presence. Very Rev. Fr. Francis Nicholas Senanayake, Vicar of Judiciary, Colombo Diocese and the Episcopal delegate of the Postulate delivering his homily at the Concelebrated Holy Mass said the Servant of God late Cardinal Coorays deep relationship with God Almighty had guided all his actions in serving the people God as the Chief Shepherd of the diocese and as Cardinal, the local and universal church.
Status of Venerable
The Basilica ground was filled with the devotees from parishes far away to attend the ceremony, that was being an event of historical importance, that being the very first time an event of that nature took place in the annals of the Sri Lanka Catholic Church.
The Roman phase of the inquiry will commence once the Curia, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints receives the Historical Report sealed and dispatched from the Diocese where the Servant of God born and bred, served the People of God as their pastor. The Colombo Archdiocese Canonization Committee will comply with the request and seal and dispatch in due course after ceremonial closure of the local process. The Local Church prayerfully awaits for the day, the Servant of God Cardinal Cooray enters the next phase, the status of Venerable. At the commencement of the Holy Mass His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith expressed his appreciation of the work done by the Postulator Very Rev. Frs. Leoplod Ratnasekera OMI, Very Rev.Fr. Nicholas Senanayake and Rev. Fr. Jude Samantha. While admiring the work done the documents due to be sent to Rome was signed and sealed. From the three boxes containing detail reports of events and issues relevant to the life time of late Cardinal Cooray, two will be kept in the Archives of the Archdiocese and one will be dispatched to Rome. There was also floral tribute to the late Cardinal at the site where his mortal body laid to rest.
Rev. Fr. Leopold Ratnasekera OMI, the Postulator with able support of the Archdiocesan Canonization Committee has completed the preparing of the Historical Report Positio Historica as required by the Vatican Curia, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which including all documentation, compiled with the life story of late Cardinal Cooray, collection of his writings, pastoral dealings, record of challenges he faced on crucial issues during his three decades long episcopate, (1947 -1976) his involvement in Asian and Universal church, and his pastoral apostolic activities.
The Historical Report prepared by Very Rev. Fr. Ratnasekera, as the Postulator was certified by Most Rev. Dr. Oswald Gomis, the former Archbishop of Colombo.
According to reliable sources since the commencement of the work of the Sri Lanka Canonization Committee in May, in the year 2010, Fr. Rathnasekera as Postulator has visited well over 60 churches/parishes, delivered special sermons, gathered information, collected data, both supportive evidences and criticisms within the archdiocese of Colombo, beginning from the year, the Holy See endorsed the process.
His was a mission to awake people, educate the devotees the process of canonization and strengthen the campaign to pray without ceasing to grant that miracles do take place through the intercession of late Cardinal Cooray, now known as the Servant of God, to declare him a Blessed.
The books on late Cardinal Cooray OMI written by scholarly priest, the erudite feature writer and author Rev. Fr. Ernet Portuthota and the former Editor of Gnanartha Pradeepaya, Hector Welgampola would have helped a great deal, as some of the vital of information of the Servant of God is included in them. Fr. Poruthota has also taken pains to include what both eminent lay Buddhists and religious personalities of the decades gone by- had said about late His Eminence. Raphayel Tennakoon is one of the greatest poets of this country and a journalist par excellence Sirus W. Surendra, both Buddhist by religion had expressed words of appreciation when the Archbishop Cooray was elevated as a Cardinal of the Catholic Church.
Winning all hearts
They shun aside all differences and had the guts to hail a person, when they know that despite differences of opinion, one has to honour when and where it is due. Late L.H. Meththananada, a great defender of Buddhism and late Ven. Madihe Pannaaseeha Thera, one of best Monks, among the Sangha fraternity though in opposition camps when vital issues proper but had the courage and audacity to honour and praise Cardinal Cooray. They saw in Cardinal Cooray a simple man of the village who firmly stood his ground when He found it just, right and correct to do so and had won the hearts and mind of those closely associated with and those who shared his thoughts and views of his day.
Late Cardinal Cooray was a simple simon so to say coming all the way from Periyamulla, Negombo, known to rest of the land as the Little Rome born in 1901 and lived his school days until he entered the Minor Seminary to be a Priest of God to serve His flock. He was sent to Rome to do his philosophical and theological studies and once retuned with flying colours obtained successfully completing studies with Ph. D. for Philosophy and S.T.D. for Theology.
During this period of studying in Rome he took his First Vows at the age of 24, in 1925, and in the year 1929 he was ordained a Priest of God in Rome at the age of 28. His first obedience was to the teaching staff of St. Josephs College, Maradana October 1, 1931, and also served as the Warden of Catholic University Students hostel, at Bambalapitiyafrom September 1, 1934 .
On August 6, 1937 he assumed duties as the Superior of the Oblate House of Studies at Kynsey Road, Borella and taught as a professor at St. Bernard Major Seminary, Borella. While Fr. Cooray was serving in this capacity as a professor, in December 14, 1945, at the age of 45, he was nominated the Archbishop Co-adjutor to Archbishop Jean- Marie Masson OMI, with the right to succeed the See of Colombo Archdiocese one day.
The consecration ceremony took place on March 7, 1946, and He took over the Colombo See on July 28, 1947 as the first native Archbishop with the passing away of the then Archbishop French-man Most Rev. Dr. John Mary Masson OMI, and held that post for long 30 years until his retirement in 1976, as Archbishop of Colombo but retaining the Post of the Prince of the Church, the first Sinhala Sri Lankan Cardinal.

Englands Josh Hodgson re-signs with Canberra Raiders
SYDNEY Nov20: England Test hooker Josh Hodgson has re-signed with the Canberra Raiders until the the end of the 2022 National Rugby League season, the club said on Monday.
The new contract is an extension of his current deal which finishes at the end of the 2018 season with the Raiders. Hodgson, who is preparing to play in England's World Cup semi-final against Tonga in Auckland on Saturday, said he was excited to remain in Canberra.
There's no way I'd sign long term if I didn't believe this group of players were able to achieve great things, so a big part of the decision was staying at a club who I believe will have long-term success, Hodgson said.
I'm really enjoying the World Cup experience and hopefully we can continue through the tournament, but I'm also looking forward to get ready for next season. Raiders CEO Don Furner said the club was confident in their decision to retain Hodgson on a long-term deal and his value for the club both on and off the field were important factors in the new contract. The former Hull Kingston Rovers hooker moved to Canberra in 2015. AFP

Evergreen tunes in Timeless Classics
Timeless Classics', featuring the much loved Soundarie David and Shey Liyanage, is a concert to raise funds toward two of the Rotary Club of Colombo Easts anchor projects namely, Project BEAPAccident and Emergency Trauma Unit Centre at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa, and the eradication of dengue which has claimed many lives in the island over the last few years. The Rotary Club of Colombo East partners with Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo for this worthy cause.
The Trauma Centre of the Emergency and Accident Services at the Batticaloa Hospital is to be upgraded and modelled after the Karapitiya Emergency Hospital, a previous project of the Rotary Club of Colombo East. This initiative is a long overdue need in Batticaloa as the Eastern Province has approximately seven lives being lost each day and many more persons injured. says Indrajith Fernando, President of the Rotary Colombo East.
He adds, We are also engaged in multiple dengue eradication projects across the island which include funding research in the hope of bringing about medical-science breakthroughs in this field.
The Rotary Club Colombo East appreciates the support extended by the Government for both these projects.
The Eastern province, in addition to its high population, also boasts of the best surfing facilities in the world, drawing thousands of tourists each year from across the globe and the rest of the island too. Ensuring better healthcare for both the local community and tourists in Batticaloa was at the heart of the Clubs efforts with both Rotary Colombo East, and the Rotary Club Strathmore in Melbourne joining hands.
A sum of two million (USD) has been donated to the project by local and foreign donors thus far, and with the Timeless Classics concert the Rotary Club are confident of driving further funding for this national minded project that is surely the need of the hour. Timeless Classics will feature an amazing line up of talent including Soundarie David, Shehara (Shey) Liyanage and more. Timeless Classics will take place at the Shangri-La Ballroom on November 26, and as the largest ballroom in the city, this is the ideal venue for an event of this nature.
Timothy Wright, Vice President and General Manager of Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo said, Embracing such initiatives allows Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo to endorse both research toward long term solutions for pressing national issues, whilst also contributing toward immediate solutions. This is our commitment to the communities in which we operate.

Families in Ampara receive coconut saplings
The Ampara district Coconut Cultivation Board in a bid to grow more coconut trees, distributed coconut saplings to about 1,000 families in the Sammanthurai DS division recently, under the Divi Magada Kapruka programme implemented by the Plantation Industries Ministry.
The chief guest on this occasion former Eastern Provincial Councilor I. L. M. Mahir, inaugurated the distribution at a ceremony held at the Sammanthurai Mullah Mosque premises.
This ceremony was presided by the Ampara District Coconut Cultivation Board Regional Manager S. I. Susantha.
Coconut cultivation in the Ampara district is planned to be enhanced, and several programmes have been implemented in the Ampara district to meet this goal. The programme initiated by the Coconut Cultivation Board would be supported by the Coconut Development Authority and the Coconut Research Institute of Sri Lanka.
Steps have been taken to form a Coconut Cultivators Association in several areas of the Ampara district. Association members will receive various type of assistance, and coconut saplings will also be distributed under this programe.
Coconut saplings will be of hybrid and dwarf varieties and they will bear fruit after a short period.
Due to the lack of rain and severe drought, the production of coconut has dropped in the Ampara district.
As a result, the price of coconuts has risen immensely, sources said. Ampara District Coconut Cultivation Board Development Officer H. K. S. R. Sampath, Sammanthurai Sub-office Development officers I. L. Saneer, M. I. Fasliya, T. L. Rizwana, R. Priyatharsini, A. L. Jumana Begum and beneficiaries participated.

Firm foothold for ethnic harmony
The people of Sri Lanka, holding on to one another and trying to stand up on solid ground, have been slipping and falling from time to time from the many community pedestals they have set up for themselves. This has caused all to pull them downwards together and crash in a mighty tumble. The ethnic, language, religious, cultural differences have given rise to destructive rivalry leading to fratricide. All need to recover their senses and build ourselves into a national family living in a common homeland.
The diverse communities, Sinhala, Tamil, Muslims, Burghers and other minority groupings with their Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Christian and Atheistic and Rationalist identities have for a long time vied to stand hegemonically isolated and in a domineering and authoritative manner. The absence of frank dialogue and lack of understanding of one anothers hopes, aspirations and human yearnings have brought not only estrangement but also suspicion and distrust. It is time to dispel that and build mutual trust and understanding.
Though accidents of birth in various communities have put us together in an island home, we have together failed to live in our community habitations under one Sri Lankan roof. Our particular ethnic and community identity has blinded us to the need for national solidarity and even human fraternity and sharing.
Some have even tended to hijack patriotism for narrow and selfish political purposes to provide for themselves alone a dubious ownership of the Island, a security in wealth, power and privileges. They considered others patronisingly or as uncompromising rivals and enemies who should be forcibly controlled through state power or the barrel of a gun and if possible eliminate them completely from life itself. Thus some groups decided to terrorise, slaughter, murder and assassinate and resort to genocide to secure their power of domination over a whole people. These attempts have been inhuman, foolish and unsuccessful.
political struggles
Business magnates are concerned about economic gains and high returns on their investments while the politicians of today concern themselves about a good share not only of the gains of business magnates but also of prominent wholesale and retail traders as well as a share of the till collections along with the trustees of the temples of sundry gods and goddesses.
Meanwhile in the economic melee the gap between the rich and the poor widen and the voiceless poor continue to suffer. The elected representatives of the people are endlessly at loggerheads. They cannot come to a workable collective consensus on co-existence, development, progress and distributive justice. Lacking a vision and moral strength they often capitulate and succumb to their own narrow and selfish individual objectives and those of the powerful. The net result of their narrow political struggles is the ambushing of the poor in a blind alley.
We in Sri Lanka have to ask ourselves and honestly answer hard questions and answer them reasonably. We need to acknowledge that all of us, even persons devoted to religion, are sometimes not reasonable. To think and act unreasonably is contrary to our human nature. What are the democratic and human values we wish to uphold and live by How often have racist conscienceless politicians and even religious leaders since Independence in 1948 ignored those values and instigated by inflammatory rhetoric, have let loose hordes of unthinking sword and knife-wielding thugs on helpless and innocent people
Havent well planned capricious, racial and religious hatred and volatile social chaos been caused in our lifetime with overt and covert support of governments, politicians and state agencies Acts of abhorrent hatred have occurred even as recently as 2014 in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. Are we and should we be continuing to anchor ourselves in the mindset that brought about such hatred and destruction
Have we lost the moorings of civilised behaviour and promoted anarchy through prejudice, envy and jealousy Is that what has been reaped today after 2500 years of civilisation and the influence of the religious culture of four world religions over many generations Have we understood how that came about and are we collectively prepared to withstand such anti-social provocations Could we stand together and prevent them
The sad and heart rending events and unimaginable human tragedies, compounded by the horrors of war which have left individuals and communities in isolation and divided this country, should be relegated to the past. Memories should be healed. Though recompense adequate to recoup the losses of human lives could never be made, just and fair reparation should be made to help the survivors of the horrors of war and racial fratricidal tragedies to recommence their truncated economic activities and rebuild their lives. In a free Land there should not be any internally displaced people. All should be helped to become one people freely linked in a growing national identity to become one people, made one out of many communities.
New Constitution
It is in the context of a great political failure and misrule of partisan governments during the last seventy years that today a New Constitution is to be framed. Even the experiences of the last seven decades do not seem to be sufficient to some politicians who are deaf and blind with short memories, for they do not hear the cry of the helpless and the poor. They do not see nor remember the carnage and injury, arson, destruction of property and looting of peoples belongings including jewellery, desolation and despair that have affected the people of this country. It is the duty of the present rulers to put a definitive stop to all of these.
A new beginning dawned on January 8, 2015. The promised New Constitution should re-establish firm moorings for solid and stable democratic values, new relationships among all citizens, for renewed ethnic and religious communities to flourish among all Sri Lankan citizens in every part of the country. Thereby the human dignity, rights and duties, mutual self-respect and honour of all should be upheld, protected and promoted.
There are voluntary organisations of concerned citizens working in many spheres indiscriminately to improve the lives of citizens in various ways and they should be given the moral support of the government.
The best of constitutions could be nullified by inept, ego-absorbed incompetent legislators and others exercising power. The democracy minded people of Sri Lanka are now striving to grow up to higher levels of social maturity through inter community solidarity and through inner purification. Religions and fraternal religious leaders should be helpful in that.
It is one thing to adopt the draft of a New Constitution, present it to the people at a referendum, and promulgate it after the people have approved it; it is quite another to swear verbally to uphold it and yet flout it in practice. Many legislators not knowing what they have sworn to defend have often in letter and spirit flouted and desecrated all the constitutions thereby breaking the law. There should be a minimum of civilisation and culture to sustain the Constitution. The present level of civilisation and culture of the legislators, who should be mindful of all the people of the land, leaves much to be desired. Many are social oddities insufficiently educated to shoulder national responsibilities and unconcerned about the perennial human values that underpin humanity. It is too much to hope that all the legislators would transcend themselves.
Nevertheless the people hope that at least the greater majority of the legislators will be patriotic enough to be able to transcend themselves when considering the draft constitution and make it a lasting and suitable instrument of security of all the people and appropriate for good governance.

Former Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna dies aged 49
Prague: Emotional tributes poured in for former Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna after she died at the age of 49 following a long battle with cancer.
Novotna, who won the Wimbledon title in 1998 when she defeated Frances Nathalie Tauziat in the final, died on Sunday in her native Czech Republic surrounded by her family, a WTA statement said.
She played in two other Wimbledon singles finals, losing to Steffi Graf in 1993 and to Martina Hingis in 1997.
The picture of a distraught Novotna being comforted by the Duchess of Kent after losing the 1993 final when she had led 4-1 in the final set is one of the memorable Wimbledon moments. Novotna also won four Wimbledon doubles titles with compatriot Helena Sukova in 1989 and 1990, with Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in 1995 and with Hingis in 1998. Wearing her distinctive headband, she won doubles titles at all four Grand Slam tournaments.
Czech-born American great Martina Navratilova led a number of players -- both past and present -- expressing deep sorrow at Novotnas death.
The tennis world is so sad about the passing of Jana Novotna...I am gutted and beyond words- Jana was a true friend and an amazing woman... Navratilova tweeted.
Former US player and now tennis commentator Pam Shriver -- who along with Zina Garrison beat Novotna and Sukova to Olympic doubles gold in 1988 -- remembered her rival fondly.
Jana was as kind as she was athletic, as smart as she was competive. I cant believe she is gone this soon. Her smile lives forever young, Shriver tweeted. AFP

Fourteen killed in Colombia bus accident
COLOMBIA: At least 14 people were killed and 35 injured when the bus they were traveling in plunged down a ravine in rural northwestern Colombia, officials said Sunday.
The bus skidded off the road when the driver swerved in an attempt to avoid hitting a motorcycle rider, Sabanalarga Mayor Cesar Cuadros told reporters.
The Sabanalarga hospital could not cope with the sudden influx of victims, most of whom were local farmers, so many of the survivors were rushed to nearby towns for treatment.
We are going through a cold period and it has rained heavily, Cuadros said.
We are not clear how many people traveled aboard the bus, but we know that there were a lot, he said.
Sabanalarga is located in the department of Antioquia, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) northwest of the capital Bogota.- AFP

Gamini Sedara Senarath, two others released on bail

Three suspects, including former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath were today ordered to be released on bail by Colombo Fort Magistrate for allegedly misusing public funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet for a hotel project in 2012.
While ordering the release of thethree suspects - Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of one million rupees each, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act.
The Magistrate further observed that so far there are no sufficient facts brought before court criminal charges against three suspects.
The first and second suspects were barred from leaving the country.
In her bail order, the Magistrate maintained that Sri Lanka Insurance Corporationis a company registered under Company Act and thereby it does not come under the Public Property Act.
However, the Magistrate observed that there is no obstacle for the Attorney General to initiate legal action against the suspects following the conclusion of investigations.
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The funds in question had been the allocation for the Colpetty Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings Ltd, a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
It was revealed that Canwill Holdings formed two subsidiaries, Sinolanka Hotel and Spa, which was implementing the Hyatt hotel project in Kollupitiya and Helanco Hotels and Spa to carry out the proposed Hyatt hotel in Hambantota.
The re-construction work of the partly build Celestial Residencies building of the failed Ceylinco was then transformed, during the past three years, to build the Hyatt hotel in Colombo.
The main land was leased for 99 years from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) after the former Ceylinco property was expropriated by the previous government in 2011 in terms of the provisions in the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilised Assets Act No.43 of 2011.
The prosecution maintained that the Canwill Holdings Ltd is a state-owned public enterprise, set up during former regime, with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity, secured from its major shareholders, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which has invested Rs. 8.5 billion, and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
On November 9, the three suspects appeared before Court as per an undertaking given to the Supreme Court. However, at that time the defense counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects told Court that their clients were not surrendering to Court, but merely appearing for the purpose of making a statement to the FCID.
Senarath and two others had filed three Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting them in connection with a magisterial inquiry, under the Public Property Act and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
This petition is to be taken up for support on November 24.
Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry with Anil Silva PC, Sampath Mendis and Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the suspects.
Chief Inspector Anura Premaratne appeared for the FCID.

Gifted moves
Contemporary dance was born in Ohio city, US. In the US, Kapila studied the numerous techniques of contemporary dance. Thats where the uniqueness of nATANDA emerges. It is a combination of many local traditions such as Angampora.
Kandyan dance is the oldest dance form in the world. Yet what is the fate of the Kandyan dancers, Kapila questions. They are hired for every trivial function. On the contrary, Noh and Kabuki of Japan are an expensive art. They are not easily accessible
In 2003, an undergraduate with an animated spirit wanted to establish his own dance company. That was to become the first contemporary dance group in Sri Lanka afterwards. The youth, yclept Kapila Palihawadana, studied dance only in his first year and had to dedicate the rest of his university years to cram German and Translation Methods. But his insatiable desire fell for the aesthetic movement lingered. He was never to give in. Things took a decisive turn when he obtained a German-funded scholarship to study dance.
Following my stay in Germany, I felt like I should choose dancing as my profession. Over the period I studied dancing in Germany, I could notice quite a lot of talent as well as the support offered to art in the country, Palihawadana muses.
Why not Sri Lanka then Sri Lankans have the talent, Palihawadana adds, but not quite much the opportunity. With the dearth of opportunity, you cannot look forward to commitment and discipline. That gives us the key to the mystery of why dancing does not flourish much in Sri Lanka  at least professionally.
This instigated Kapila to brave the odds. He named his dance company nATANDA, an acronym influenced by four languages: Sinhala, German, Russian and English.
Immense talent
When I travelled from one city to another, conducting workshops, getting along with well-known artistes in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Mannar and Vavuniya, I have observed immense talent in young dancers. Travelling across the country, we found out how dance could play a beautiful role in bridging communities.
Palihawadana hastens to add that dance is not the only art form that can bridge communities. But when you practise contemporary dance, without confining yourself to specific variants such as Kandyan and Indian, you will be able to make people more comfortable.
If I try to teach Kandyan dance in Jaffna, they will naturally question why. On the contrary, contemporary dance is the commonest platform for engaging the communities without any barrier.
Dance could bring in a small step. Palihawadana believes that artistes should think seriously on how they can contribute to the ethnic harmony. Palihawadanas dance productions, held consecutively since 2005, have thrown the spotlight on communities, social issues and environmental concerns.
The nATANDA idea struck Kapila while he was still studying in Germany. Having been to a number of dance festivals in Germany, Kapila was passionately nursing the idea of organising one in his motherland. What seemed more important to him is the dances capacity to bring people together.
nATFEST (nATANDA International Dance Festival), which will be held from December 1 to 4, is the latest of his festival series.
What can dance do to the community The strength always keeps the peoples mind afresh, disciplined and calm. That only happens when people are exposed to arts.
We need to find tips on how to make people more open-minded and more aware of the surrounding. How can we make people respect each other Dance helps that.
Artistes need to keep on producing artworks to feed the peoples intellectual and entertainment hunger. The first international contemporary dance company established in Sri Lanka, nATANDA is involved in dancing from morning to night.
Foreign attention
We are the only full-time dance company. We want to open more doors for the younger generation. This is something you can benefit. You are also supporting the community. I am really fascinated about this because I know how valuable it is in Sri Lanka.
Contemporary dance was born in Ohio city, US. In the US, Kapila studied the numerous techniques of contemporary dance. Thats where the uniqueness of nATANDA emerges. It is a combination of many local traditions such as Angampora.
We merge it in a careful way. And in a unique style. Thats why nATANDA stands unique above all the other dance forms in the world. We are just we are. What we do is basically none of the other countries will be doing.
There are similarities though. When they fuse traditional elements into modernity, it draws the foreign attention. Maintaining uniqueness is no plain sailing. The nATANDA is extensively engaged in research. Every time they come up with a production, it is an offshoot of intensive research.
That is why the all-day-long practice is necessary. Contemporary dance is contemporary. Every day it is subject to change. A choreographer should be updated with every emerging technique.
All the same, Kapilas contemporary dance concept is not much to the appeal of the traditional schools. Most traditional dancers loathe his concept. The most interesting feedback against Kapila Palihawadana is that he destroys the traditional beauty of dance.
When we look two millennia back, yes we have a great tradition. But at the same time, as a contemporary person, you need to become accustomed to your modern day living. If you are so concerned about the tradition, then why use a smartphone Why a mobile phone It is the work of the contemporary society. You need to merge with it. So I dont really care what people say about my dance. I accept and respect their comments, though I do not think we destroy the culture.
Negativity
Kapila terms it as enriching and enhancing the prevailing culture into a different way of culture. Sri Lankans need to move ahead. The negativity all the time harms creativity. The traditional dancers do not adhere to all the traditional elements. If tradition does not change, development cannot come. The development comes only when the people are ready to move ahead.
As Sri Lankans, we are rich. Look at Dalada Maligawa. Look at Sigiriya. We never had to borrow these things from another country. But the problem is that we do not understand our own values. And worse, we do not respect our own values. Business magnates are ready to throw in money if some Indian artiste comes here. But the local artistes do not get the same treatment.
Kandyan dance is the oldest dance form in the world. Yet what is the fate of the Kandyan dancers, Kapila questions. They are hired for every trivial function. On the contrary, Noh and Kabuki of Japan are an expensive art. They are not easily accessible.
We have launched groundbreaking productions for the last couple of years. My dancers have been working with me for 16 years. They come to my place every Sunday. Who would be in for such a commitment Thats your family day. Thats how things are with the younger generation.
Always with a smartphone held on their palms, the younger generation is open-minded and ready to see the world.
They understand the facts. If we only had the younger generation in the decision-making bodies, things would have been much easier.
The nATFEST has hosted dancers from Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, Lebanon, USA, Malaysia, Russia, India, Switzerland, Australia and Luxembourg over the past two years and has mesmerized 8,000 audience members collectively.
This year nATFEST will begin at the Verrasingam Hall, Jaffna, on December 1 at 6:30 pm, while the festival will end in Colombo with performances held at NADA on December 7 and 8 at 7 pm.
Supported by German Embassy, Turkish Embassy, Pro-Helvatia, Nelung Arts Center, Arts Council, House of Fashion and Goethe Institute Colombo, the main partner of nATANDA International Dance Festival is Swiss Embassy.

## Title: Hemantha Devapriya had fantastic talent

Hemantha Devapriya had fantastic talent
Hemantha Devapriya, a local boy from Etul Kotte first attended Christian College, a school with a rich history and well over 100 years old. He played under 13 cricket for his school, there was a tournament where 10-15 schools participated and in that tournament in the final against Royal he got a fine hundred. Due to this sparkling knock he was in big demand amongst the prestigious schools such as Ananda, Nalanda and Royal. The then principal of Nalanda Sugunadasa Atukorala got to know about this young talented and pleasant boy and approached his father (an accountant at the Dehiwela Municipal Council) who initially did not like the idea but eventually agreed that the son should get involved in cricket.
Hemantha joined Nalanda and his success story began from thereon. How he got connected to the famous cricket coach Nelson Mendis was during his second year, playing for the Nalanda 1st eleven, (Hemantha also was quick to mention that Susantha Karunaratne, a good schoolboy cricketer in his own right played alongside with him.) During this period Nelson Mendis, had rejoined Nalanda in 1976. N.M. was the prefect of games then at Nalanda. Hemantha states that N.M. was a strict disciplinarian and a wonderful motivator, he encouraged his style of play, knew his strengths and weaknesses. Hemantha by nature was an attacking bat, who has never been coached technically but N.M. never altered Hemanthas approach towards his batting. Mendis gave targets to achieve and he used to follow up diligently stated Hemantha. A typical example was during an Ananda-Nalanda 50-over match in 1978 N.M came to Hemantha and asked what his contribution would be in that particular match. Hemantha in turn said he would have five victims which was a promise, true to his word he stayed up to the fast bowlers and those days strangely enough 2 wides were allowed so when they bowled a wide they used to drag their back foot and he could stump them quite easily and as a result bagged five victims. Adel Hashim was one of his victims who got so confused by Hemanthas lightning quick stumping, that he asked whether he got bowled or stumped recalls Hemantha.
Hemantha goes on to say that N.M knew how to squeeze the best out of the players. He was never late for his duties or for practice. He always insisted that they should trust their own talent and to believe in ones self. He also encouraged them to dress smart and he knew how to get the right combination for the team. Hemantha also stated that NM motivated him by trusting his talent
And in spite of being strict on the attire of what his charges dressed he had a soft corner for Hemantha because in his younger days he grew his hair and also had a tiger tooth around his neck which his grand father had given him as a good luck charm. The point which Hemantha is driving at is N.M checked the background and the behaviour of the boy before he meted out his punishment. N.M. did not demand respect but he commanded respect notes Hemantha.
He was brought up by different coaches at u 13 and u 15 levels and as a result he had his own style of play. Late Gerry Gooneratne, the senior coach at Nalanda did not disturb these traits of his players and never tried to change the rhythm or to do major adjustments to a batsmens style, he discouraged batters playing against swing and spin. Hemantha also stressed the fact that Gerry Gooneratne liked attacking players and always allowed their flourish and flow to remain intact.
Just after school Hemantha played in the Donovan Andree Shield for Bloomfield on K.M. Nelsons invitation. Hemantha recalls that it was like a dream playing alongside Michael Tissera who was his schoolboy hero. Hemantha opened with Gihan Mendis the ex-Sussex county player who came near enough to play for England, (the author was fortunate enough to watch Gihan Mendis playing for a world eleven in Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, in 1981, although Mendis did not shine that much. For the Windies, Desmond Haynes and Gordon Greenidge had a glorious partnership of over a hundred). Hemantha states that he learnt a lot by playing alongside Gihan Mendis, taking singles and rotating the strike .they had more than six century partnerships.
In a couple of years he noted that he got matured playing with the seniors such as Vernon Caldera and K.M. Nelson. He got selected to play in the Gopalan trophy match under Anura Ranasinghe in 1975, who mentioned to Hemantha that he had fantastic talent and for him to work hard so that he could earn a Sri Lankan cap one day. He played for Sri Lanka, and scored 95 the following were his contemporaries Anura Tennekoon, Sidath Wettimuny, Madugalle, Ravi Ratnayake, Asantha de Mel, Rohan Jayasekera, Gajaba Pitigala and for India Madan Lal, Srikkanth, Shekar from the Indian side had a good tour.
After that Indian tour they went to England where they got Test status. Bandula Warnapura captained that team which included Lalith K, Ajith deSilva, Hemantha scored a lot of runs including fifties against Leicestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. He also had a good partnership with Sidath. Asantha de Mel came for high praise from Hemantha. He was the best bowler of the team who could move the ball off the seam both ways. After his retirement from cricket Hemantha coached the Sri Lanka A team from 1998-2004. Mahela played under him for one year, Kumar, Rangana, Dilshan all played under Hemantha.
Hemantha points out that in comparison with Sanga and Mahela, Sanga was never an organised person, Sangas room was untidy but Mahelas was better organised, however when Sanga went to bat he was utterly focussed. When the Zimbabweans toured Sri Lanka, Sanga was playing for Sri Lanka A Dave Whatmore the then Sri Lanka coach came down to see Sanga scoring a magnificent 170. Hemantha recalls that Dave watched every ball of that innings from Sanga and he sailed into the Sri Lanka team and never looked back.

A Bad Moms Christmas
Home is where your Mom is
Check your calendars - it's barely the 2nd week of November and the first X'mas film of the year is already here. Granted, the festive season is perfect for some light-hearted, feel-good stories that make you chuckle and warm your heart in equal measure. But what is it about Christmas that compels Hollywood to churn out lazy comedies It requires some amount of absurd reasoning, or in this case - foreign financing, to take an average film - 2016's 'Bad Moms', and give it a sequel with a holiday theme, no less.
Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell & Kathryn Hahn are back to showcase their best bad behaviour. This time they're joined by their mothers played by Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski and Cheryl Hines. While one is extremely carefree, another is over-possessive and there's a perfectionist thrown in for good measure. All to ensure that the mother lode of stereotypical, dysfunctional maternal figures can be mined for a laugh. Naturally, this allows for a wide range of jokes at their expense, but when the writers chose to infuse every other sentence with an expletive, you know they're aiming for low-hanging fruit. While the film seems to be aimed at the female demographic, it's written by the two men who penned 'The Hangover'. That isn't essentially a problem in itself, although it's another matter when you hear a little girl dropping F-bombs. It's one of the rarest cases where you might just be thankful for our conservative censor board! The film feels like it's grabbing every opportunity to justify the 'bad' in the title, with ample genital anatomy gags and crude sexual innuendo.
The less said about the performances, the better. The three main leads seem to be going through the motions with barely any investment into their characters. The actresses playing their mothers, however, display a little more experience. Susan Sarandon seems to have signed up for this movie just to let her hair loose and have some fun with an edgy character prone to debauchery. Yet even the Academy Award winner doesn't do much to justify her presence. This is indicative of the film as a whole - sure there are a few occasional laughs, even if they're incredibly silly. Sadly, the film holds back from completely committing to that direction and ends up being yet another generic Christmas flick. Watch this only if you've exhausted all the other choices out there.

Huawei creates smart city nervous system for more than 100 cities
Huawei is participating in the Smart City Expo World Congress 2017 (SCEWC) in Barcelona under the theme of Leading New ICT, Creating a Smart City Nervous System, highlighting how a Smart City can be like a living organism that works seamlessly to continuously learn and enhance the citys services.
Together with its global partners, Huawei is demonstrating joint ICT solutions to connect the digital and physical worlds across city administration, public services, and industrial economies.
Alongside the SCEWC, Huawei hosted the Global Smart City Summit, where representatives from the European Union, international standards organizations, world-renowned consultancies, relevant research institutions and leading Smart Cities shared their insights and experiences in driving Smart City development with over 400 city administrators from around the world.
Becoming a Smart City involves the digital transformation of a city to address challenges in the physical world. This demands data-driven systems that combine management and IoT data to help authorities manage the city and enable the physical and digital worlds to be integrated.
Smart City development requires a fundamental change to city administration and for the development to flourish it needs to be a priority for the government. In addition, there must be a strong and capable Smart City project team, long-term and stable investment, and city leaders need to partner with a leading digital provider that can facilitate the transformation.
Yan Lida, President of Huawei Enterprise Business Group, said: A Smart City is like a living organism, which is powered by a nervous system. This Smart City nervous system comprises a brain [the control center] and peripheral nerves [the network and sensors], gathering real-time information about the status of the city, transmitting the data, enabling the brain to analyze and make informed decisions, delivering feedback commands, and ultimately carrying out intelligent actions. This creates a seamless link between the physical and digital worlds.
During the Global Smart City Summit, Huawei released the Intelligent Operation Center (IOC), a solution that functions as the brain of the Smart City, connecting the digital and physical worlds.
The underlying infrastructure of the IOC comprises distributed cloud data centers and ubiquitous city networks that collect, integrate and share city information, enabling real-time visibility of the city. The IOC uses an Integrated Communications Platform (ICP) that enables intelligent collaboration across city functions and emergency dispatch of all services. By using Big Data, machine learning and AI technologies, the IOC delivers valuable insights to facilitate city planning and management of vital services such as transportation and security.
Huawei also provides wired and wireless broadband, IoT platforms, and LiteOS  a secure, lightweight and intelligent operating system, that serve as the peripheral nervous system, collecting data to assist the brain in making decisions, which bring about changes in the physical world.

Kohli hits 50th ton as SL cling on for draw
Kolkata: Skipper Virat Kohli scored his 50th international century Monday as India gave Sri Lanka a major scare before the first Test ended in a nerve-racking draw.
Sri Lanka were reduced to 75-7 -- with paceman Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking four wickets -- as they chased 231 for victory.
Under intense pressure, Dasun Shanaka (six not out) and Rangana Herath (0) nervously played out the final few deliveries before bad light at Kolkatas Eden Gardens came to the rescue. Kohlis 119-ball 104 not out had put India on top and allowed them to declare their second innings on 352-8. The captain hit 12 fours and two sixes as he flayed the bowling.
Feels good, Kohli said of his 18th Test century, to add to his 32 one-day centuries for India.
My journey hasnt been long but I want to continue contributing, especially in situations like these, the 29-year-old captain said.
If I can step up and perform, that will give me more pleasure than thinking about the number of hundreds I have. The mindset is always to go forward and help the team forward, and win Test matches.
Kumar struck in the very first over when Sadeera Samarawickrama chopped a delivery onto his stumps and was out for 0.
Mohammed Shami then had left-hander Lahiru Thirimanne bowled for one as the visitors slipped to 2-2 in 3.3 overs.
Umesh Yadav, Indias third seamer, joined in by trapping former Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 12.
The match became even more tense when Shami bowled current skipper Dinesh Chandimal for 20 and Kumar, who returned impressive match figures of 8-96, trapped Niroshan Dickwella lbw for 27.
- Praise for Kumar -
Hes grabbing his chances and is a massive contender to start every Test match for India. Hell do us good in overseas conditions and not just in home conditions, Kohli said of Indias man of the match.
Hes going to be an important part of our plan going forward in all formats.
The hosts had resumed the day on 171-1 after Lokesh Rahul (79) and Shikhar Dhawan (94) staged a 166-run opening stand that saw India overcome a 122-run first innings deficit.
Sri Lankas fast bowlers Suranga Lakmal and Shanaka took three wickets each to rattle the Indian top and middle-order.
But Kohli displayed his class in taming the attack towards the end of the innings.
He let out a roar and pumped his fist after getting to 100 with a six off Lakmal, who ended with match figures of 7-119.
Indias Cheteshwar Pujara, who fell to Lakmal in the morning session, joined an elite list to have batted on all five days of a Test.
Pujara, who top-scored with 52 in Indias first innings 172, put on his batting pads on each day of the game, which was marred by bad weather.
Only 32.5 overs were possible on the first two days before the weather cleared for the final three.
Sri Lankas premier spin bowler Herath also made an impact -- this time with the bat -- hitting 67 in Sri Lankas first innings of 294.
Im really happy that Rangana scored the runs but unfortunately spinners didnt come into play. Well have to learn to bat in the second innings, said Chandimal.
Lakmal is unbelievable, especially over the last one or two years. Hes one who you can trust as a captain, he said of his pace spearhead. The second of the three Tests start in Nagpur on Friday. AFP

Lee retires after 12 seasons
Washington: David Lee, who helped the Golden State Warriors to the 2015 NBA title during a 12-season career, announced his retirement Sunday on Instagram.
Lee, whose fiancee is Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds over 829 games with New York, Golden State, Boston, Dallas and San Antonio.
"An epic night celebrating my retirement with my friends and family!" Lee posted with a group photo on Instagram. "Thank you to my amazing fiance @carowozniacki for planning the surprise!"
Former world number one Wozniacki had a relationship with Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy, a four-time major champion, and they became engaged in January 2014 but broke up four months later, McIlroy saying he "wasn't ready for all that marriage entails."
This past Valentine's Day, Wozniacki announced she was in a relationship with Lee and the couple announced their engagement earlier this month.
Lee was a first-round pick by New York in the 2005 NBA Draft and spent five seasons with the Knicks, earning NBA All-Star honors in 2010. AFP

Linkin Park releasing Chester  Bennington's final performance album
Linkin Park will honour their late bandmate Chester Bennington by releasing a live album full of his last performances.
The rocker committed suicide in July (17), during the groups One More Light World Tour, and the band subsequently cancelled dates in North American and Japan.
But the completed shows were recorded and now tracks will feature on a live album.
We dedicate this live album to our brother Chester who poured his heart and soul into One More Light, a statement on the groups website reads. After we finished recording the album, we joked with Chester that - since he had delivered so many stunning performances in the studio - he had set the bar extra high to produce that alchemy on stage each night. Not surprisingly, he welcomed the challenge.
The shows we played together during the early summer of 2017 were extraordinary, the statement continues. Chester shared with us that he felt this was the best tour we had ever done. The camaraderie and joy we experienced on stage reflected our deep connection with each other, with our fans, and with the music...
His dedication to bringing these songs to life was triumphant, the statement adds. For those of you who attended this tour in person, we thank you. For those who could not, we hope this live album gives you a glimpse into how magical these shows were for the six of us.
Last month (Oct17), the group paid tribute to Bennington at a memorial show at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, where members of blink-182, System Of A Down and Korn joined them onstage. One More Light Live will be released on 15 December.

Looking back
Exactly three years ago, the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Maithripala Sirisena, took a giant step in his personal, and, political life that was to transform the political landscape of this country, perhaps irrevocably so. Taking the whole country by surprise, Sirisena, sporting a jubilant smile, was shown on television, walking to the Town Hall, to the tumultuous ovation of UNP supporters, flanked by then Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, and, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Joining them were ministers in the Rajapaksa government, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Duminda Dissanayake, M.K.D. S. Gunawardena, MPs Arjuna Ranatunga, Rajiva Wijesinha and Wasantha Senanayake.
The die had been the cast for a monumental transformation in the countrys political landscape, with Sirisena being the standard bearer in that change. In war they say, it is the element of surprise, that, more than anything else, which contributes to the defeat of the enemy, and, so it proved to be the case, with Maithripala Sirisena, who played his cards close to his chest, until the eleventh hour, before delivering the sucker punch.
But, it was only the beginning. Much needed to be done, monumental challenges to be overcome, if victory was ultimately going to be his. Walking out of the government, as a minister, and, General Secretary of the SLFP, to consort with the enemy, certainly was not going to be viewed kindly, by Mahinda Rajapaksa. The climb to the peak, was, by no means going to be a cake walk. There were mountainous obstructions, and, obstacles, to overcome, for the Common Candidate.
But the challenge was accepted in earnest. There was a surge of public opinion, calling for change, in the existing setup, that added a spur to the forward journey of Maithripala Sirisena. He had the solid backing of the UNP, and, all the forces that were marshaled against family rule. The Rajapaksa brigade, perhaps, for the first time, in their decade long rule, started seeing red and took every step to queer the pitch of their formidable opponent.
The political rallies of the Common Candidate were attacked, stages burned down, meeting venues withdrawn, at the eleventh hour. Worse, scurrilous material were manufactured, to vilify the CC, curtsy the state media, blatant falsehoods propagated, calumny heaped, and, every possible trick in the book, and, out of it, tried, to blacken the image of the man, who defied the odds and took on the might of an oligarchy.
That he prevailed against the odds was a telling endorsement of the calibre of the man, particularly, given his subsequent remark, that, had the enemy had his way, he would have been six feet under terra firma.
President Sirisena, no doubt, will be the first to acknowledge his indebtedness to the UNP, and, its leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, for providing the solid backing that made him emerge victor. The Grand Old Party made a tremendous sacrifice, by forfeiting its turn to field its leader as candidate. He also owes a massive debt to the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, whose Movement for Social Justice provided the core element, in the campaign to oust the Rajapaksas.
True, not all the pledges made to the people have been realised, and, admittedly, there have been instances where the Yahapalanaya Government had veered from the ideals of good governance, expounded by the late Sobitha Thera. There has also been tardiness in the prosecution of cases against the former VVIPs, which formed the chief plank of the election platform of the Common Candidate. Also, there have been bickering between the partners of the Unity Government, that have caused confusion in the minds of the public and threatened stability.
The scales, though, are weighted heavily, on the plus side of the balance sheet. Today, undeniably, there is a climate of peace, the people are free from fear, freedom of expression has been restored to unprecedented levels, with the certain news channels taking the government to the cleaners, so to speak. No white Van roams the streets, no journos abducted, tortured, murdered or made to disappear, nor are media institutions torched, or, newspaper editors knifed. There are also no Safe Houses, operated by military personnel, in the heart of the Colombo city.
The countrys image, which received a severe battering, internationally, has been completely restored, with world leaders, and, top foreign dignitaries making visits with monotonous regularity, the high point being the visit of US Secretary of State John Kerry, soon after the election of the new government - the first time in 40 plus years that a US Secretary of State visited this country. President Sirisena is also readily accepted internationally, his visits to top nations confirming this, a far cry from the past, where his predecessor was concerned.
Most of all, President Sirisena will be commended for forging a Unity Government, between arch rivals, the UNP, and, the SLFP, and, changing the culture of the vituperative, and, contentions politics, that had been the bane of this country, since Independence, paving the way for economic development, and, progress.

They were followed by a plantation rehabilitation and renovation drive within the Commerce section at Ananda. With respect to the latter category, attended by around 30 schools, it was preceded by another quiz competition and live marketing campaign, as well as a Sinhala and English Oratory competition, finalised on Wednesday, October 4 at the Kularatne Hall. Bandaranayake College, Gampaha emerged as Champions, with Lyceum International School, Nugegoda as Runners-Up and Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda as Second Runners-Up. All three schools were subsequently tasked with preparing a presentation revolving around the theme of sustainability and the commercialisation of Sri Lankan society.
Luca17, the Commerce Day of Ananda College, was attended by around 35 schools. The Chief Guest for the event was Tharindu Dananjaya, Senior Lecturer at the University of Kelaniya. Luca17 was spruced up with various skits, involving the Drama Society and the Dancing Society of Ananda College as well as a musical performance by the school-based band Voltage, the latter headed by the incumbent President of the Commerce Society, Vimod Edirisinghe. Special plaques for students who had secured first and fourth places nationally in the Commerce Stream at 2016 GCE A/Levels were handed over, while three teachers who had served more than 10 years at Ananda, and who had been transferred to other schools, were duly and dutifully felicitated.

Maggi partners International Pepper Conference
Maggi recently partnered the 45th International Pepper Conference as Silver Sponsor, as part of its commitment to use popular Sri Lankan spices in its products to naturally enhance flavour, and encourage the use of spices in home cooking.
Locally sourced pepper is one of the many spices that add delicious flavour to Maggi and delivers its much loved spicy taste. The commitment is part of Maggis Simply Good initiative to offer consumers tastier and more nutritious choices, using ingredients typically found in the kitchen.
The global event was held for the first time in association with the Spice Council of Sri Lanka, and addressed topics of interest to the world pepper economy, relating to policy makers, traders, manufacturers, researchers and farmers. It was attended by key stakeholders locally and from across the world, including Sri Lankan President, Maithripala Sirisena, and other high ranking officials.
Nestle Priyadarshinie Karunaratne, Vice President Food said, In response to local consumer preference for more natural and familiar ingredients, such as those typically found in their kitchen cupboards, we are using spices, vegetables and herbs to naturally enhance flavour in our products. We want to inspire and offer tastier and more nutritious choices, and encourage home cooking. We strongly believe goodness starts with homemade food and everyone should be able to enjoy it every day, with a little help from Maggi. We already have a good portfolio of products in Sri Lanka - ranging from coconut milk powder to noodles and seasoning - to encourage and support homemade food. Our range is now strengthened with the goodness of local spices.
Spices are popular ingredients in Sri Lankan meals owing to their flavour and aroma, and also their implied health benefits as a food high in anti-oxidants. Maggi products contain a mix of spices like black pepper, chilli, garlic, coriander, cardamom, turmeric, cumin, nutmeg, fenugreek and aniseed where relevant. It is pepper however that is popularly referred to as King of Spices; with a distinct flavour loved the world over and indispensable in the Sri Lankan kitchen.
Interestingly, peppercorn comes from a plant native to Sri Lanka and South India, and Ceylon black pepper has a stronger taste and aroma than black pepper anywhere else in the world. Celebrated for their very local flavours and products in Sri Lanka, many of Maggis products contain Ceylon black pepper; including its Chicken Flavoured Noodles, Daiya Chicken Noodles, Spicy Blast Noodles and Soup Cubes.
Managing Directort at Nestle Shivani Hegde, said, The world of food is changing. On the one hand, a new generation is reinventing the basics; playing with family recipes and exploring new tastes. On the other, cooking at home is becoming increasingly challenging to fit into daily life. We want to be a brand that responds to these new needs by showing consumers that homemade food can be easy, creative and tasty. At Nestl, we believe our purpose as a company is enhancing quality of life and contributing to a healthier future. Our Maggi brand brings this purpose to life by continuing to inspire and help people cook good food with fresh ingredients.

My Miss World..!
And as the Miss World contest comes to a close, and Indias Manushi Chhillar wins the title, I remember my Miss World:
Was it five, nay seven years ago; she lived behind my house in a hut for just a year. She was leader of her little gang. Id watched from window as she led that gang. They treaded cautiously past ant hill, where she told them wide eyed, a snake lived, she walked first, bravely, but I knew her heart was in her pretty mouth. She showed them nests where strange birds tried to blend themselves into thick foliage, but her quick eyes spotted those evasive feathered friends, and her gang gained from her keenness.
She was part of a family of construction workers who were putting up buildings behind my home, and was at an age when as a woman-child, she did not have to go to work, nor much to do at home, except look after the horde of little children her parents kept adding to her little gang. She was good with them, so good she would ever so often get them occupied in some pastime, and quietly run off by herself for a few moments with her dreams.
Once, I felt her dream:
The Miss World show was on, and every eye glued to the screen. I watched the beauties parade one by one and then looked out of my bedroom window. There she was, her eyes intent, sitting on dividing wall and looking into my TV screen, smile on face, watching women not half as pretty selling their wares to statue like judges. I looked at screen through her dreaming eyes and saw her walk down ramp decked in designer finery. I heard the crowd roar, TV viewers gasp at rustic beauty theyd ne'er seen before.
With flourish of gown and twirl of sensuous body the judges leaned out to her. The crowd stared frenzied at village beauty and crowned her then and there. I saw the smile upon her face as with peasant grace she put the crown on matted hair.
She sat on the wall, closed her eyes and I felt her dream.
Suddenly she saw my eyes on her. She jumped from wall and like a gunshot, was off into her hut. The next day her gang wandered about, leaderless.
And then one day I saw her, bricks on her head as she walked from mason to brick pile and back through the day. I felt her thoughts. It was a ramp she was walking on, and in her head the crowd cheered, till at dusk her duty done, she crept home exhausted.
She was woman now and a different ramp her graceful walk.
I look at pictures of the beauty queens of today, and think of her sitting on my wall years ago, watching the beauty contest where I dreamed her dream.
She would have won hands down again; my Miss World..!

New IR Act to reduce ad hoc tax exemptions
Inland Revenue Department plans to reduce the number of ad hoc tax exemptions with the introduction of the new Inland Revenue Act, next year.
Inland Revenue Department Commissioner General Ivan Dissanayake, speaking at a recently concluded post-budget seminar in Colombo, noted that the introduction of Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) too will revolutionise the tax culture in Sri Lanka and a number of key government institutions are to be connected with this system in the near future.
RAMIS, to be implemented next year, is expected to support a number of web services including tax payment, tax collections, cancellations, returns, etc. Dissanayake however noted that ICT systems at several agencies are not connected to the RAMIS system because these institutions dont have software packages compatible with the packages used by the Inland Revenue Department to implement the system as soon as possible.
However, issues related to ICT systems will be sorted out soon with the assistance of ICT agencies which come under the management of the government.
In addition, the department is currently in the process of widening the number of tax files to include the informal sector such tuition teachers, Dissanayake said.

Over 300,000 Sri Lankan voters lack NICs
There are over 300,000 Sri Lankan voters who have no National Identity Cards (NICs) countrywide at present, according to a latest survey conducted by the Registration of Persons Department, and this situation came to light while verifying the Voters Registers.
Registration of Persons Department Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilake has already launched a programme to issue NICs to voters who have no NICs at present countrywide before the forthcoming local government elections are held. Accordingly, the Commissioner General has already held discussions with the Elections Commission in this regard.
Most of these voters have no original birth certificates and it has become an obstacle for them to get NICs immediately.
To solve that issue, a new legal procedure has been designed to be implemented by the Department and hence, all Grama Niladharies countrywide have already been issued with a special circular as to how such voters could be issued with new NICs in the future.
These voters have to forward an affidavit testifying their dates of births by three close relatives and three permanent residents of the villages they are presently residing in.
All adults who dont possess NICs by now should take early steps to get NICs, and for more information on this subject, they should consult their respective Grama Niladhari soon, said Senior Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake speaking at a meeting of parents of students of the Bingiriya electorate in Kurunegala held at Bingiriya National School, yesterday.

Padmavati  becomes Sanjay Leela  Bhansalis longest film
Sanjay Leela Bhansali is known to make larger-than-life films that are long enough to give every character enough time in the narrative. His films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas, Ram-leela, and Bajirao Mastani amongst others are proof enough of the fact. This time around though, the opulent filmmaker has taken things to a higher level. Bhansalis Padmavati is his longest film yet. Yes, you read that right.
According to a report in a leading daily, the Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor starrer has a runtime of 3 hours and 13 minutes. A source told the daily, The runtime of Padmavati is somewhere around three-hours-and-13-minutes. The makers had shot material of over four-and-a-half hours and the director sat with his editor to chop the film down to somewhere around 200 minutes.
What comes as a surprise here is the fact that till date the Salman Khan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Ajay Devgn starrer Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam was considered as Bhansalis longest film with a run time of 3 hours and 8 minutes backed by Shah Rukh Khan starrer Devdas which was 3 hours and 5 minutes. With the new report, looks like Padmavati has broken all previous records of SLB films. Surely this is going to add to the already booming buzz around the film. Exciting!
- Filmfare

Padmavati will be screening in 3D and 2D format at CEL circuit theaters from December 1. The Tamil and Hindi versions of the film will be subtitled in English. It is screening at Majestic - Cineplex Colombo, Regal Cineplex Gampaha, Majestic Cineplex  Jaffna, Regal - Nuwara Eliya, Capitol  Maradana, Concord  Dehiwala, Savoy 3D, City Cinema - Mt.lavinia, Cine City  Maradana, Lido  Borella, Liberty Scope cinema, Plaza  Kaluthara, Excel World and other film halls islandwide

## Title: Paris Accord - Oil companies can come to our rescue

Paris Accord - Oil companies can come to our rescue
However ceremoniously an accord is signed, signatories should be brave enough to discard it, if its found to be yielding results in obvious contravention of its expectations. Unfortunately, we see the Paris Accord falling into this category deserving to be scrapped as soon as possible. The objective of this article is to enumerate a few reasons as to why it should be scrapped at the earliest. It should be scrapped not for the sake of the signatories, but for the sake of their grandchildren, at least one of whom accompanied the grand-father to signing ceremony.
Nor should it be saved for the sake of signatories when it is certain to bring nothing, but disastrous consequences to their grandchildren.
The accord was signed more out of desperation  an important world leader was moving out after an eight year term  than out of a clear cut conviction of why climate change takes place and what is the most serious of its threats to mankind. The only climate parameter addressed was temperature and all other aspects were explained as been direct or indirect derivatives of temperature. When there are no anthropogenic perturbations, this is a reasonable explanation as then precipitation and wind will happen as a result of seasonal fluctuations due to planet earth orbiting around the Sun in an elliptical path once a year and changes in temperature could be a predecessor to changes in precipitation and wind.
Even when anthropogenic perturbation was due to combustion of coal  a fuel very low in hydrogen and no additional water vapour from combustion of a hydrocarbon -- whatever changes in precipitation would have only occurred via a change in temperature. The models that had been developed and research literature clearly indicates this approach. I have already written about CIMP-5 model as well as IGSM-2 Model to show that they have missed out on Newly Formed Water (NFW) vapour due to combustion of oil and gas.
But the moment you start adding gas  CH4, methane  and oil (CH2)n -- to replace coal and reduce CO2, situation changes dramatically. Here we are using fuels which do not need to go through a temperature increase route to bring water vapourto initiate that havoc through climate parameters called precipitation and wind. Without any support from CO2 nor from temperature, products from these two fuels, gas and oil could bring about precipitation and wind. Unfortunately, this water vapour when in atmosphere will also increase temperature and bring more water vapour to aggravate the situation further. It is immaterial where this Newly Formed Water (NFW) resides, in the atmosphere or coming down or on the ground, it spells out only disaster. It is not the water which has been in the global water cycle during the last one million years.
Then everybody got frightened and climate model numbers started clicking, convention numbers came closer to 24  24th hour should be avoided  and they decided to curtail the bad guy CO2 and his follower temperature increase to certain limits and wanted to put it down in black and white. And the only model fuel on the screen presumably, was natural gas, the best out of the three major carbon containing fuels So while International Energy Agency is promoting the combustion of gas till 2030 and then reducing thereafter  only they know how to -- world leaders signed up that historic Paris Accord agreeing to limit temperature increase above pre-industrial age level to 20C by 2100 by achieving a peak of greenhouse gas concentration in 2035 and reducing thereafter. We signed this historic Paris Accord and it is left to the individual signatory countries to decide how to achieve the set targets.
Impending Misery
The question arises what those climate scientists attached to Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change and UNFCCC were doing till we have concluded 20 conventions. If these best of brains  climate science wise  could not identify suitable solutions to curtail GHG concentration and temperature increase and make recommendations to UN or UNFCCC or to world community during a 20+ year stretch, from whom are we expecting these solutions today From officials in ministries of wild life, environment, forestry in the individual countries. These IPCC scientists have messed up the understanding of climate change by concentrating on CO2 and temperature and when the situation is about to get out of control they want to hand over the problem to individual countries through this Paris accord. No, what we say is this. You have wasted so many years, only complicating things by remaining silent while coal is been replaced by gas and oil and NFW entering the atmosphere was creating havoc in Australia, Thailand, India, Texas, California, Sri Lanka  rather all around  you need to tell us what would help us to overcome the same today.
So where are we today, 20 years closer to the real climate change menace  whether it comes from melted ice along the shore lines or from the atmosphere in the form of cyclones, hurricanes,  left alone to look after ourselves. We, the fools we are, have signed Paris Accord and agreed to find our own salvation and we may be paid some money for the purpose. Still they want us to be bound to their manthra  CO2, greenhouse gases and temperature  while they would promote us to use more gas and send more water vapour to the atmosphere.
We should request the United Nations to explain in simple terms how they want us to proceed from here rather than to say find your own salvation. At least they should answer the following questions:
(i) Does more consumption of natural gas lead to more water vapour in the atmosphere and is it not detrimental to mankind in respect of increased precipitation, hurricanes
(ii) Does not road vehicular transportation using gasoline emit water vapour again and could not this also lead to increased temperature, precipitation and wind related disasters
(iii) Their agency IPCC in their TAR 4 mentioned about different options for obtaining tractive power for road vehicular transportation and what is the most favourable option today
(iv) In case they say that battery electric vehicles are preferred more in response to (iii) above, how would they recommend we obtain the electricity needed for the same
(v) Do they believe that they have educated the government officials in different countries adequately so that these governments can work out their own routes of salvation from here onwards
(vi) They have got climate scientists develop so many models covering all parts across the world from the stratosphere downward and studied them in so much detail, what guarantee on a 1-5 scale (1-no guarantee, 5- fully guaranteed) could you give different governments that their territories will not face a catastrophe, like what Puerto Rico faced, impacting 25% of the land space under that governments jurisdiction before the year 2035
Our approach to climate change
I started looking at Climate Change only in 2008, when our own President was concerned about how issues related to Energy Security might impact food security and devoted my full time to studying climate change and related issues. My interest was not to investigate all possible reasons for the climate change; but to identify a solution for the most significant reasons. When a patient came to my Ayurvedic Physician father with an ailment, he never wasted time to identify all anomalies in the patients system. He could talk about thousands of such ailments and prescribe for those (He had read and had copies of both Charaka Sanhitha and Susrutha Sanhitha). But he always treated for the most obvious and predominant one and then only looked at the others. He of course, ensured that all connectivities the particular ailment had with other system components were understood and addressed and medicines given had a holistic effect on the patients total system.
We identified that climate change predominantly arises from the following three reasons: (a) Percentage of solar radiation reflected or converted to chemical energy is reduced by anthropogenic activities. (b) Energy is converted from one form to another during anthropogenic activities only while liberating a significant fraction as waste energy. (c) During such conversions and changes either greenhouse gases are generated or their absorption reduced which will reduce the waste or unutilized energy exiting from our atmosphere.
When one looks at Annual Radiation Budget at Top of the Atmosphere, one would notice that Reflected Shortwave Radiation (RSW) makes the biggest numerical contribution to the annual changes and this is the only item which had a statistically significant variation during 2010 to 2016 out of the three fluxes crossing the top of the atmosphere. Even CMIP5 has found that this net TOA radiative flux indicated a difference due to GHG emissions before a change in surface temperature is indicated. This clearly indicates the significance of item (a) given above.
Although CMIP5 model captures something similar to (a) and (c) above, it is not comprehensive enough. For example, the model has included under anthropogenic perturbations the following three only.(a) CO2 emissions, (b) Other gas emissions (NFW is not included) and (c) Land use. Under land use CMIP5 was considering changes arising from crops and pasture area changes. These changes would not change the quality of their contributions towards maintaining an equilibrated atmosphere. For example, the original vegetation, say grass, has an albedo of 0.26 and wheat would have an albedo of 0.20, both of them would absorb CO2 in the atmosphere during photosynthesis and might convert about 8% solar radiation to chemical energy. If original land cover was pine or oak, they have albedos of 0.14 or 0.18. To compensate for this lower albedo, they might absorb more CO2 per ha per year than grass.
Land usage for roadway construction is entirely different. Once deforestation/land clearing is carried out, the losses of (i) reflection of solar radiation, (ii) CO2 usage for photosynthesis and (iii) conversion of solar energy to chemical energy during photosynthesis are all permanent. And when the highway is paved with an asphaltic surface, the solar radiation is absorbed to an extent of 90% which energy is then reemitted as infrared longwave radiation leading to global warming. This is one of the things which we identified in our root causes.
Where CMIP5 model considers water and energy exchanges, they are basically through the ORCHIDEE model and considers the transfers that take place only during photosynthesis. While the energy exchange may be due to solar energy been converted to chemical energy or latent heat associated with water coming from the ground to be emitted through stomata, it does not consider the waste energy generated during conversion of different forms of energy either to electrical or thermal energy as we had expressed in our item (b) in our explanation. The issue here is that while ORCHIDEE looks at water and energy components already in the current system or received from the Sun Earth has systems to handle energy we receive from the Sun, at least it will dump it in the ocean -- we talk about water & energy components that are new or rather water and energy that had been packed up for millennia for our use or misuse to-day. There is a role for this extra energy in this explanation could be seen from the fact that Kiehl and Trentberthin establishing their Mean Energy Budget were not able to balance the energy flows without bringing in that 24 Wm-2 due to thermals  calculated by carrying out an energy balance for the system. They had already considered the latent heat of vaporisation arising from annual precipitation. So both my reasons a and b do have a significant role to play in explaining climate change. Reason c about greenhouse gases is well established and accepted, the only difference would be that I would bring NFW also into the picture as it is generated almost all the time along with that bad guy CO2 who could retain more water vapour in the atmosphere.
Is there a solution
So now we have identified the three main reasons for climate change and we are in a position to look at/for solutions. In looking for solutions we identified three guidelines to be given due consideration as they will help us to reduce the climate change the most with the least effort and as fast as possible. These aspects are as follows: (i) We will design a system which could influence all three environmental aspects we mentioned earlier, (ii) Our solution will bring about the maximum benefit with the least effort, (iii) We will not bring undue pressure on the current environmental balance. And fortunately for the luck of mankind, we found a solution like that and we call this solution Highway Solarisation to support Battery Electric Vehicles.
Highway Solarisation is defined as follows: A dedicated infrastructure to generate electricity for powering battery electric vehicles or the Grid using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above the highways as a solution for climate change.
We identified transportation as the segment which needs the immediate attention for a few obvious reasons. Would you need 20 years to identify this (i) It is transportation which leads to most amount of waste energy per unit of energy actually used. Maximum benefit with the least effort. Environmental aspect (b) helped us in this. It is also transportation which emits most amount of greenhouse gases per unit of energy actually used. Environmental aspect (c) helped us on that. These two imply that by substituting for transportation with a cleaner and less energy expensive fuel we can bring about the most beneficial impact from a unit of energy developed already.
Of course looking at alternative sources of energy our focus fell on Solar Energy for the obvious reason that in 1989 we developed a method of drying coir dust using solar energy and it is this development and our fixing a price of Rs. 21/= per kg of coir dust (price of sugar at that time) which helped it to be Rs. 2 billion a year foreign exchange earner to-day. But we were mindful of environmental aspect (a) and we did not want to disturb the atmospheric balance more in respect of solar radiation reflection, conversion and absorption. This drove us to look for a developed area to lay the PV solar panels and our awareness of highways been the most damaging out of all developed areas in respect of climate change issues, we selected it as the most suitable place to lay the solar panels.
Once we identified the highways to be the best place for laying PV solar panels, more and more advantages of the arrangement came to our mind and we have written many articles on the same.
In 2011, global electricity generation had been about 25,000 TWhrs out of which 70% would have been from fossil fuels. About another 10,000 TWhrs for transportation would have been obtained from oil. So this 27,000 TWhrs is what is required from renewable sources if fossil fuels is to be completely avoided. With about 200 billion square meters of paved roadways been globally available and more been added almost everyday, phasing out fossil fuels using Highway Solarisation would be the ideal solution for climate change due to fossil fuel combustion to obtain energy to generate electricity and for transportation.
How oil companies could help
Oil companies could take the lead in this transition from oil energy to energy from Highway Solarisation and automobile companies are already pursuing the transition to BEVs by setting very specific targets in this respect. In fact in September, 2014, UN Climate Summit suggested three objectives for controlling Climate Change as follows: (a) 30% of vehicles sold in cities in 2030 should be battery electric vehicles, (b) these should be powered by renewable energy and (c) deforestation should be reduced to 0% by 2050  and there is no gap between that and Highway Solarisation. Oil companies I am sure, have carried out many SWOT Analyses and Scenario Planning, etc and learnt how to convert threats to be opportunities. But I dont think they have ever experienced a conversion of a Threat to an Opportunity of this magnitude. When they are threatened of losing their mission of Powering Global Mobility to power producers they can turn it upside down by indulging in Highway Solarisation and carving out a significant part of main grid power also into their plate. Oil companies  right at the top of Fortune 500 listing  are the best suited for this transition and be the real saviors of mankind and can keep on supplying petrochemicals at a slower rate to make those plastics which are an important ingredient of modern day living. Then they would have a greater serving on their plates  polymers industry, transportation, main grid electricity and they would be driving the Global Energy System in its truest sense. With enormous resources at their disposal, they could bring about this transition the fastest and the world would be a more pleasant place to live in, thanks to the oil companies.

Recording COPE telephone calls breached MPs privilege: Kiriella
Telephone calls of the parliamentarians in the COPE committee that investigated the bond issue have been recorded by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and it was a breach of MPs privilege, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said in Parliament.
Raising a privilege issue Minister Kiriella requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon a party leaders meeting to discuss the issue and get all the other parties responsible including parliamentarians whose names were mentioned, inquire into the issue and take steps as he deemed appropriate.
The Speaker said he would summon a meeting.
Moving the motion, Minister Kiriella said a forensic report prepared by the CID was placed before the Presidential Commission on the Treasury Bond Issue on November 16. The report includes details of telephone calls of 28 members. He said that according to the report, five members had received calls from Arjun Aloysius.
If Arjun Aloysius had contacted the five to make changes to the COPE report in favour of him, he had failed, Minister Kiriella said. The COPE made a unanimous recommendation signed by the five members too that action must be taken against all wrongdoers, the Minister said.
The Minister pointed out that it must be remembered that the Commissions mandate is to investigate and report. It is not a Court of Law and no one was found guilty of any offence. There is no finding against these MPs, Minister Kiriella said.
This brings us to the question who instructed to record telephone calls, especially of these parliamentarians and for what purpose. This is clearly a breach of privilege of the MPs, Minister Kiriella said.
He said communications between parliamentarians and constituents are privileged and there were instances where administrative action was taken to preserve the rights of the constituents communicating with MPs. The telephone was identified as one of the means that constituents communicate with MPs, the Minister said.
In these circumstances, considering that the Commission has not come to any conclusion, it is highly improper that this information have been published, Minister Kiriella said. Therefore, it is our view that before the CID or even the Attorney Generals Department seek information about telephone calls of MPs, they must obtain the Speakers permission. Neither of these department have done this, the Minister said.
He said that notwithstanding this, confidential information was put out for public consumption. He added that the media is now in a frenzy giving all sorts of twists and interpretations to this information.
I call upon you to holds a party leaders meeting to discuss this matter, Minister Kiriella said.
Joint Opposition Member Gamini Lokuge queried whether the investigations were held against the former Finance Minister who publicly accepted that he took money and that his wife received flats from Aloysius.
Joint Opposition Member Udaya Gammanpila said Minister Kiriella misled the House. He said several members of the COPE had put footnotes in the report in favour of Arjun Aloysius.
UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana suggested that the details of all the members and the President be taken for investigation.
New Acts soon in Parliament to protect domestic businesses: Malik
The Anti-dumping and Countervailing Measures Act, and the Safeguard Measures Act will be presented to Parliament soon to protect the domestic business from unfair competition while improving the investment climate for domestic and foreign investors, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said in Parliament yesterday.
He was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up for debate.
The Minister said the bills were ready and they could be presented, debated and passed in December this year or January next year.
Commencing the speech, Minister Samarawickrama thanked Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera for introducing an outward oriented economy.
Sri Lanka have benefited from an open economy from the time of the kings. We feel sorry at times when we deviate from that policy, the Minister said.
It was reversed during 1970 to 1977 and during the previous regime. But the government has focused to make the economy more open and make it an attractive place for more business. When I heard the new economic reforms and opening up of the economy, I was excited and encouraged to become an entrepreneur. Same kind of spirit would be kindled in the youth having heard the directions of the proposals in the budget 2018, the Minister said.
He said the government has shifted its focus from a growth model heavily dependent on the public infrastructure spending to the growth driven by private enterprises, exports and foreign direct investments. The number of jobs created by the government infrastructure projects is insufficient because the debt burden is very high. We need the private sector including small, micro and medium enterprises to drive this economy. We must create the best possible environment for them to thrive. Our domestic market is too small. We have to trade with the world, export and welcome the world to our shores.
Our ministry has taken many steps to strengthen this aspect through a series of initiatives and programmes focusing on exports, Foreign Direct Investments, trade agreements and bilateral economic corporations, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The New trade policy was approved by the Cabinet in July 2017 to stimulate growth and create jobs by improving ability of firms to export and compete for domestic market through a modern simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. The NTP we launched addresses for key elements: competitiveness through domestic policy reforms, market access and trade facilitation, macro-economic balance policy and institutional coherence, and helping the adjustment of enterprises and workers, he said.
The Minister said the most significant trade policy that they were undertaking was negotiating bilateral partnership agreements.
The FTA with India is deepened and it is broaden to include services investment technology and training. We have to recognise that India is expected to be the fastest growing economy in the world in the coming years with a middle class consumer base that will be 10 to 15 times of our domestic market.
Six rounds of negotiation on the Economic and Technology Corporation Agreement (ETCA) were completed and the seventh will be held in December.
Our main objective of the ETCA with India is to resolve the implementation issues of the existing FTA, the Minister said.
Sri Lanka is negotiating the removal of quotas of goods such as garments, pepper and vanaspathi. An important new measure is to establish a mechanism to redress all grievances and problems that Sri Lankan exporters face, he said.
He said the China-Sri Lanka FTA will generate nearly USD 700 million in trade. The apparel sector loan is set to gain USD 400 million in the new trade. We are nearing the FTA with Singapore. It will be signed in January. We focus on encouraging Singaporeans to invest in Sri Lanka, the Minister said.
The GSP+ was restored and it opened a market for 6,000 items. Sri Lanka ratifies the WTO trade facilitation agreement early this year. Its main component is effective national coordination, Minister Samarawickrama said.
The National Trade Facilitation Committee was set up to implement the Sri Lankas TFA commitments. A single electronic window is established to facilitate trade and it will operate in the Customs Department shortly. All these measures will improve the investment climate for domestic and local investors, the Minister said.
A One Stop Shop mechanism is set up to address the regulatory inefficiencies and inter-agency coordination.
The BOI has revised its targets in its new corporate plan for 2017 to 2020. A single window investment appraisal committee was established to facilitate granting approvals within the shortest possible time, the Minister said.
The Logistic and Industrial Zone in Hambantota initially would attract an investment of USD 1.12 billion and another USD 500 million during next few years. Several industrial zones will be developed in Mawathagama, Bingiriya and Weligama. The New Inland Revenue Act provides a predictability on the incentives for new investment. With the technical assistant of the World Bank, we developed a road map for climate reforms for investments. It will be launched July this year, the Minister said.
Prisoners under PTA
Sampanthan asks for special meeting
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday requested the Justice Minister to schedule a special meeting with all the relevant officials to discuss the matter of prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
The Opposition Leader made the request in Parliament yesterday participating in the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up for debate.
I discussed the matter several times with the President and the Prime Minister and found that their positions quite reasonable. We now have a new Justice Minister. We are looking forward to resolve the matter reasonably with her. The former minister did not take adequate actions. I earnestly request the new minister to convey a meeting with the Attorney General, Law and Order Ministry Officials and other relevant persons to discuss this matter. We will try to work out some arrangement, Sampanthan said while bringing the attention of the House to a number of demonstrations taking place in the North in the past few months over the prisoners detained under the PTA.
He said these Tamil prisoners committed crimes for political reasons, not for personal benefit. Political decisions were made in the past to pardon and release prisoners who committed political crimes in 1971, 1987-89 and so on. Why cannot you do the same here he questioned the Government.
He said the Government itself concedes that detaining prisoners under the PTA as an obnoxious law. The PTA is very different from the normal law. The manner of arrest, investigations, extracting confessions, prosecutions are entirely on confessions and the nature of the evidence are all different, he said.
The President pardoned the person who attempted to assassinate him because the accused was politically motivated. He was granted pardon, then why others who had committed less serious crimes cannot be pardoned he asked.
I know persons who are attempting to create communal tensions by raising such issues to prevent the right thing being done. The Government should not drag its feet from doing what is right, he said.
AGs Dept. will have more judges, officers: Thalatha
Measures were taken to recruit more judges and officers to the Attorney Generals Department and we will increase the number of courts as well, Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The Minister was participating in the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 as the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry was taken up in Parliament yesterday for debate.
Minister Athukorale said a committee was appointed regarding the changes to the Civil Procedure Code and Cabinet approval for it was expected. The salary increment for the AGs Department officials is required because an increment was not effected for them over the past 10 years. Now we have received approval from the President and the Prime Minister in this regard and we expect to implement the proposals by January 2018, she said.
Responding to an issue raised by JVP MP Wijitha Herath that appointing of High Court judges was not completed, Athukorale said the country has 75 High Court Judges. The normal procedure is to appoint 74 but only 73 were appointed and another will be appointed shortly, she said.
The matters with regard to the Supreme Court and the Appeals Court are carried out in accordance with the Constitution, she said.
The Justice Minister said varied opinions were expressed on delays of court cases. The AGs Department is doing a great deal of work. When the opposition levels allegations against the AGs Department, they forget that the AGs Department was under the former President earlier. Now our government has taken measures to recruit more officers, the Minister said.
Some are alleging that the AG was brought to Sirikotha. On October 7, a paper was submitted proposing that three courts be established to hear corruption cases.
The opposition should stop slinging mud at us saying that the AG was brought to Sirikotha. Now the AGs Department is functioning independently, Minister Athukorale said.
Hakeem promises relief for Uma Oya affected
Three projects were initiated to provide water for the people affected by the Uma Oya Development Project, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
Responding to a query posed by MP Chaminda Wijesiri during the round of questions for oral answers in Parliament yesterday, Hakeem said his ministry intended to fulfil the water requirement of 110,000 people.
He said 110,000 people from 55 Grama Niladhari divisions affected by the Uma Oya Project would receive water from the Dayabara Ella Project and three projects were being implemented at a cost of Rs. 352 million.
It can provide 1,350 water supply connections. The Hali Ella Project is very productive and every project has specific aims. We will implement a separate project in the Demodara area as well, Hakeem said. The Minister said 750 water supply connections would be provided through the Makulu Ella Project and the Weheragalatenna Project could provide 300.
Also the Kurundugolla Project was initiated for the purpose, he said.
JVP urges to take up Bonds scam first in new courts
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday called on the Government to take up the Treasury Bonds case first in the newly established special court to fast track the hearing of large scale corruption and fraud cases.
The MP was speaking at the Committee Stage Debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry were taken up for debate.
The MP commended the move to set up three special Trial-at-bars to hear fraud and corruption cases and challenged the Government to take up the Bonds scam first and set an example of good governance.
The Government needs not wait for the report of the Presidential Commission inquiring the Bonds issue, the special COPE report was sufficient to initiate legal action against those involved, he said. The MP said it would take another three years if the Government took the normal procedure to punish the culprits of the Bonds scam and then, the justice would not be met.
Rs. 10,000 allowance for former MPs
A Rs. 10,000 allowance was added to former Parliamentarians pensions from October, a Senior Parliament Official told the Daily News yesterday.
He said it costs the government an additional Rs. 26.2 million monthly to provide the allowance to 262 former MPs and about 220 widows of deceased MPs.
Parliamentarians are entitled to the pension after they completed five-year term in Parliament. The official said former MPs were entitled to have a pension of one third of their basic salary. The minimum pension for a former MP who completed five years in Parliament is Rs. 18,095 and it would be Rs. 36,190 for a former MP who completed 15 years, he said.
He said Rs. 10,000 allowance was given as per a Cabinet decision. Several former MPs had presented their grievances to the Speaker that their pension was too little. The Speaker had communicated their request to the Government and the Cabinet decided to grant them an allowance, he explained.
MPs salary usually increases in par with the High Court judges. This time, the increment was not given. Therefore, former MPs pension did not change, he said.
Objections to Gammanpilas statement
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale, Development Strategies and International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe and MP Nalin Bandara opposed Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Gammanpila when he was blaming the AG in Parliament yesterday during the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018 when the Finance Heads of the Justice Ministry were taken up for debate.
According to Gammanpila, yesterday destroyed the respect of the AGs post.
Media reports indicated that when the Prime Minister went before the Bond Commission yesterday, he was questioned by the AG. According to paragraph 12(1) of the Constitution, everyone is equal before the law. Then, why was the Prime Minister given special privileges The person who cross-examined the PM at the Bond Commission inquiry, was a person who received special treatment by the Prime Minister, he said.
Minister Thalatha Athukorale responded that the AG had taken on the questioning of the Prime Minister on a written request made by the Bond Commission.
Gammanpila said Additional Solicitor General Dappula Livera cross-examined so far. He is known to expose even the most hardened liars. Rogues and crooks are afraid of him, he said.
He pointed out that today there is no proper mechanism to appoint even judges, not to mention the AG.
Gammanpila said the crime rate has risen because people have lost faith in the judiciary.
The AG post is very important as it holds the authority of the executive and the judiciary. This post is second only to the post of the Chief Justice.
COPE says no fraud in Treasury bonds issuance
Development Strategies and International Trade Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe in Parliament yesterday argued that the COPE in nowhere in its report stated that there had been a fraud in the Treasury bonds issuance.
In a heated exchange of words with Joint Opposition MP D. V. Chanaka over the phone calls of COPE members with Perpetual Treasuries former Director Arjun Aloysius, the Deputy Minister said Aloysius has had 800 calls to MP Namal Rajapaksa.
The Deputy Minister made this comment when MP Chanaka accused Senasinghe of having 62 calls to Aloysius while being at the COPE meetings. Aloysius was not charged yet. Then what prohibits us from contacting him for clarification The COPE cannot charge any private party. It does not have such a mandate. Its purview is limited to probe public servants. The COPE cannot punish anybody, Senasinghe said. MP Chanaka said Senasinghe was trying to cover up Aloysius because of the Deputy Ministers close association with Aloysius.

Pathfinder participates in conference on Regional Dynamics and Strategic Concerns in South Asia
The South Asian region is the economically and politically least integrated region in the world.
This makes South Asia vulnerable and provide ample opportunities for intervention by outside powers even in domestic affairs of South Asian countries. South Asia need to address decade old conflicting issues and find solutions and move ahead in developing the countries economically, in order to benefit people.
South Asians should develop common perceptions, common interests and common concerns and rise as a region stated Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage attending the conference on Regional Dynamics and Strategic Concerns in South Asia, in Islamabad, Pakistan on November 14.
This conference was organized by Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) in partnership with Hans Seidel Foundation of Germany. Scholars and subject matter experts representing governments and research institutes from Pakistan, China, Russia, Germany, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, USA, Nepal, France presented their research findings during the two-day conference. The main themes of the conference were, Regional Dynamics of South Asia, Strategic Concerns in South Asia, Strategic Situation in Afghanistan and its regional Implications and Addressing Security Concerns in South Asia; A way forward. Ambassador (Retired) Abdul Basit, the president of IPRI, conducted the welcome address opening the conference and General Zubair Mahmood Hayat, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of Pakistan delivered the key note address.
Institute of Policy Research is an autonomous think tank. It is dedicated to undertaking research, analysis and evaluations of important national and international politico-strategic issues and development affecting Pakistan and the region. One of the prominent areas of activity of the institute is organizing national and international seminars and conferences. IPRI was established in June 1999. In its research activities, IPRI interacts freely with national and international forums, think tanks and scholars of high repute at home and abroad through formal/informal discussions, seminars and workshops.
Admiral Professor Colombage, represented Pathfinder Foundation presented his paper titled Assessment of Socio-political Trends in South Asia at this international conference. This paper highlighted the diverse nature of South Asian countries with regards to population, size, ethnicity, religion, development and economic standing at presently. This paper also identifies the flash points among the states which could lead to conflict. Lack of economic and people to people connectivity and integration of regional economies were also stressed upon. Admiral spoke about terrorism and violent extremism, which had engulfed some states in the region including Sri Lanka and the need to collaboration in eradicating the menace of Terrorism with a view to bring peace and stability to the region. The strategic importance of the maritime domain of the south Asian region within the greater Indian Ocean region was also highlighted. Admiral described this region as an area of Strategic Competition for major powers, strategic alliances by some major powers against other major powers and strategic dilemma for smaller, less powerful states as these are at times forced to choose between major powers.
Admiral indicated the predicament of smaller states as they are unable to make decisions based on economics but first have to give way to strategic considerations and aspirations of major powers. Admiral also emphasized that major initiatives such as Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), Security and Growth for all in the Region (SAGAR), Free and open Indo-Pacific Oceans should be aimed at developing the region and not in competition against each other. Admiral Colombage argued that due to the mistrust and strategic competition, this region has become heavily militarized and nuclearized and has become a dangerous area should hostilities break out among major players.
Therefore, the need to establish a new Indian Ocean Order to commit all stake holders to abide by the International Rule based maritime order was emphasized. Admiral Prof Colombage suggested that Sri Lanka by being in the most strategic location of the South Asian Region and with its eqi-distance and balanced foreign policy can play a key role in regional integration in a new security architecture for the common good of the entire South Asia.

Pechstein set for seventh Winter Olympics
Berlin: Germany's Claudia Pechstein, 45, is set to compete at her seventh Winter Olympics next February after claiming a World Cup victory in Norway on Sunday.
The five-time Olympic champion won the women's 5000m World Cup race at Stavanger by clocking 6min 56.60sec, having only needed a top-eight finish to qualify for Pyeongchang, for the 33rd World Cup win of her career.
She narrowly beat Canada's Ivanie Blondin, who finished second, despite being 18 years younger than Pechstein.
"I'm very, very proud of myself. I had set myself the goal of skating under seven minutes, but such a time is crazy for me," Pechstein told German broadcaster ZDF.
"I think I am on plan, now it is all about staying healthy and building on this form."
The Winter Games in South Korea take place from 9-25 February and Pechstein will turn 46 on the 22nd. The German is the most successful Olympic speed skater, male or female, of all-time. AFP

Historic appearance before Presidential Commission
PM reveals secret debts of former regime
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made history yesterday by testifying before the Bond Commission where he exposed the secret accounting practices of the former regime which had mislead even the International Monetary Fund.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds made it clear at the outset of its packed final hearing that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had not been compelled to appear before it.
The Commissions Chairman, Supreme Court Justice K.T.Chitrasiri, noted that the Prime Minister had readily agreed and therefore the question of a need to compel the Honourable Prime Minister to appear before us did not arise.
Justice Chitrasiri started off the days proceedings by asking the Prime Minister about the new governments financial requirements just before the contentious Bond auction was held on February 27, 2015, less than two months after coming to power. The February 2015 auction raised 10.5 billion rupees.
The Chairman sought clarifications on the Treasurys projection of 13.5 billion rupees required by March 2, 2015 and an additional requirement of 15 billion rupees determined at a meeting held a few days before the auction.
The Prime Minister said these were two separate requirements and disclosed to the commission that the previous administration had left out large amounts payable to contractors outside the budget. He said that the previous regime had not made provision to pay some of the contractors it had hired. Claim by such companies continue to come in.

The Prime Minister cited the example of a Singapore company that had made a claim last week for work they had done in 2013 - 2014. The debt was not included in the appropriation bill and authorities were unaware of it till the foreign company asked for its money last week.
What had happened in the previous years was that there had been many projects approved which were not shown in the Appropriation Bill, simply because of the IMF limitations. So you got around these IMF limits by not including them in the books.
We actually had two streams of payments to make. One is what is in the Appropriation Bill and one is outside that, he said.
He said for 2015 alone, about 75 to 100 billion rupees had to be paid in respect of highways alone. In fact last week, I received a letter from a Singaporean company which had to be paid for doing a part of the Northern Expressway in 2013/2014.
No one knew about this until we got this letter last week,  he said, adding that the payments not included in the budget had been parked in the balance sheets of banks and should there be defaults, the banks would be in trouble.
He said the government still had a liability of 500 to 600 million dollars to meet, thanks to the creative accounting of the former regime. We are just going through a forensic examination on this issue at present, he said.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya asked the Prime Minister about Joint Opposition member Mahindananda Aluthgamages allegations in Parliament against the then finance minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Prime Minister said he raised the matter with Karunanayake who had dismissed the allegations. He raised laughs from the packed commission room when he shot back at the Attorney-General reminding him that an investigation against MP Aluthgamage had been completed and the file sent to the AGs department to decide whether to prosecute or not, but there had been no response yet.
Yesterdays evidence on the final day of the commission, which is expected to prepare its report by December 8, was led by Attorney-General Jayasuriya and the three-member Commission.
Almost all Senior Ministers were present yesterday.
The Commission sought clarifications from the Prime Minister based on the answers provided by him in the two affidavits in response to questions put forward by the commissioners.
Chairman Chitrasiri asked the Prime Minister if he was aware that Arjun Aloysius was a director and shareholder of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) in 2014 and up to sometime in January 2015 and that Aloysius resigned from the office of Director in January 2015. He was also asked if he knew that the holding companies of PTL were Perpetual Capital Holding Limited and Perpetual Capital Private Limited.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe (PM): No your honour. I was not aware of the shareholding structure except that we knew Arjun Aloysius had shares in it.
Justice Chitrasiri (JC): Were you aware that Mr. Aloysius continued to be a director and a shareholder of these two holding companies even after 2015
PM: No, I am not aware. Mr. Aloysius did say he needed sometime to dispose of his shares at a good price.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena (JJ): In your answers you have said that Mr.Aloysius told you that he will dispose of his shares. Were you referring to Perpetual Treasuries Limited 
PM: His shares with PTL. But whether he held them himself or through another entity I do not know. 
JC: Question No: 10 inquired whether you instructed Mr. Mahendran on 24 February 2015 to immediately stop the practice of the Central Bank of accepting private placements of treasury bonds. Then, in reply you have said that you were aware that the practice of the Central Bank was to issue the majority of treasury bonds by way of private placements and that you were of the view that the system was unsatisfactory because it lacked transparency market forces should ideally determine interest rates and exchange rates. You have gone on to state that these are the reasons you advocated public auctions. Then you have stated that you directed Mr. Mahendran to consider issuing Treasury Bonds by way of public auctions in accordance with the economic policy of the government and that you expected that he would comply with the due procedure. Further you have stated that in the circumstances it was expected that Mr. Mahendran would take appropriate steps in accordance with due procedure to give effect to the objectives of the government as expeditiously as possible. Were you aware that the Monetary Law Act clearly specifies that it is the Monetary Board which is vested with the sole authority to determine policies and measures of the CBSL taken under the Monetary Law Act and that it is the Monetary Board which is the sole authority vested with the powers, duties and functions of the CBSL under the Monetary Law Act 
PM: I am aware of it. But we have also gone on the basis that in the constitution, the government, the cabinet of ministers can determine policies which apply to all institutions under the government and the right of the secretary to give instructions on general policies. So that applied to all and the decisions on transparency had to be implemented by all. Most of these decisions went with the constitution that the control of public funds should be with the Parliament which was a big issue because the Central Bank and Treasury were acting without answering to Parliament and. therefore. all these bodies had to become answerable to Parliament and the Auditor Generals powers had to be strengthened.
JJ: Certainly the policies are to be decided by the government. But once you give an order, the direction to remove a particular auction method in this case, would you expect the execution of such an order to be made out in due procedure followed by that institution 
PM: Yes, you have to consult. But the second official member of the Monetary Board, the Secretary to the Treasury, was aware of it. How they proceed inside the Monetary Board, I am not aware. But certainly, of the three MB members, two were aware of this matter. They were attending our meetings with us and discussing. What happened beyond that I am not aware of.
JJ: Did you expect whatever the normal procedure followed by the Central Bank when making major policy changes to be followed
PM: I would expect. I was in the 1977 Cabinet where we decided to liberalize. And then, the Treasury, the Central Bank, every one fell in line. So those were major decisions on which we had already made a commitment that there will be further macro-economic changes.
JC: Were you aware that the Monetary Law Act clearly specifies that the function of the Governor of the Central Bank is primarily to execute the policies and measures determined by the MB and when performing other duties when MB may confer upon him
PM: Yes, I am aware of it and we wanted that to be restored, because in the previous era the Governor only informed the MB only what happens (after the event). So we were committed to ensure that there should be a way in which the MB should act subject to overall government policies. We were not going to interfere with exchange rates and all that, which are separate matters to be done according to policies.
JC: Were you aware as at February 2015 the policy of the MB had been to issue the overwhelming majority of the treasury bonds by way of private placements
PM: Yes, I was aware. When we were in Parliament, we were informed of it that this was the practice. We were also informed that there was no specific authority of these private placements. In 2008, there were some captive funds (making) private placements. I did ask Mr. Mahendran for all copies of private placements and they were produced up to 2008. Subsequently, Governor Coomaraswamy also provided only up to 2008. There was a grey area as to how those proceeded. Virtually billions of rupees had been taken without authority, which was the core of the problem.
JC: Were you aware that the established practice followed by the MB over a long period of time is that when major decisions are to be taken with regards to policies and measures which can affect the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka and or economic and price stability, financial system stability, the Monetary Board will first direct the departments of the Central Bank which deal with the relevant areas, study the issue and submit a detailed board paper and then the MB will consider the paper, discuss the relevant issues. And only thereafter a decision is taken on such policy changes
PM: This was the procedure they have followed earlier.
JC: In those circumstances, when you directed Mr. Mahendran to consider issuing treasury bonds by way of public auctions, in accordance with the economic policy of the government and you expected that he would comply with due procedure and take appropriate steps, did you expect him to first advise the MB of your direction and discuss it at the MB and proceed with regards to that
PM: Well, I advised him about it. I thought he will follow whatever the procedure which was followed at that time. But there was also an issue. If we were going for private placements again we would have had to pass a resolution getting specific authority. There was a big vacuum which had to be filled one way or the other. But some procedure had to be followed.
JC: If so, did you expect Mr. Mahendran to discuss the issue at the MB on how to proceed with a possible shift from overwhelming dependence on private placements to a public auction system for the issuance of treasury bonds
PM: No I did not give such directions.
JC: Of the money which was needed for February 2015 for payments to contractors on account of road development and other projects which may not have been previously accounted for by the previous Minister of Finance in 2014, would you agree that the requirement of 13.5 billion rupees on 02 March 2015 which had been computed by the Treasury Operations Department was not connected with the additional requirement of 15 billion rupees which was urgently required as determined at the meetings on 24 and 26 February 2015, as mentioned in your answers
PM: They were two separate requirements. Generally, all expenditures are noted in the Budget. What had happened in the previous years was that there had been many projects approved which were not shown in the Appropriation Bill, simply because of the IMF limitations. So you got around by these IMF limits by not including them in the books. They have paid off when necessary. We had actually two streams of payments to make. One is what is in the Appropriation Bill and one is outside that. And for highways, only for that year including land compensations, there was about 75-100 billion rupees to be paid off. In fact, last week, I received a letter from a Singaporean company which had to be paid for doing a part of the Northern Expressway in 2013/2014. No one knew about this until we got this letter last week. Even now we have various claims coming in, and in the case of Sri Lanka these payments are not in the books but the liabilities are on the banks and if this goes bad we will still have to fund the banks to about five to six hundred million US dollars. We are just going through a forensic examination on this issue at present.
Telephone calls
Justice Chitrasiri sought clarifications from the Prime Minister about telephone calls from Mahendran, which transpired as evidence in the previous weeks proceedings.
The Prime Minister pointed out that he could be contacted through the telephone number recorded in evidence, but he was not able to answer all the calls. Justice Chitrasiri asked if the Premier could recall the content of the four calls which had transpired in evidence.
I can remember He did tell me not to worry and that there is enough money raised. Then in the afternoon he gave me a call to give me details as to what had happened at the auction and that they had taken 10.5 billion rupees at the auction. However, I cannot remember all the four conversations, Wickremesinghe said.
Auction vs Placement
Attorney-General Jayasuriya sought clarifications on the auction system.
RW: First we went over to the public auction system. We still did not know what the extent of the debt was or what we had to pay. We had long-term and short-term debts which had to be funded. If we did not fund them, we would have become an indebted country like Greece. Subsequently, Governor Coomaraswamy took over. We had a big discussion from the beginning, and then we got down a specialist from the US Treasury. The specialist finally gave us this system.
The Prime Minister submitted three documents on liability management, low inflation and also the IMF agreements on macro-economic liberalization integrated in the local economic policies.
AG: Are you aware that in 2015 when a similar change took place, a similar procedure was followed
PM: We could not conduct any exercise in the Treasury or in the Central Bank because the figures were not there. It took us the whole of 2015 and a part of 2016 to dig up all these figures. And then this was done as a result of what we did from 2015. It was not possible to have done it in 2015.
The Attorney General then questioned the Prime Minister on the issue of conflict of interest between former governor Mahendran and his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius.
AG: Following the uproar on 27 February 2015 auction, the continuation of this conflict of interest between former Governor Mahendran and his son-in-law was raised. In that context, did you have any opportunity to verify whether assurances given to you by Mr. Mahendran have been kept
PM: Well, this happened at the end of February. I did speak to him earlier in January and they told me he is resigning from the PTL director post, which he did. I was also told that he (Aloysius) was going to develop his Mendis Distillery Company. In fact he (Aloysius) showed me two of his products at a party (laughter). Other than that I had no idea about his affairs. Earlier, the former governor (Cabraals) sister was in the director board of Perpetual Treasuries -- which we pointed out -- and asked Aloysius to resign. Then I appointed the Gamini Pitipana Committee. If anything was found by the Pitipana Committee against him, he had to resign. But they found nothing against him. There were various issues that came up. With regards to an issue raised by Mr. Mahindananda Aluthgamage it was about the Minister of Finance. I did ask the minister and he said no such issue is there. However there was an inquiry going on with regards to Aluthgamage, and I believe the file has come to your department to decide whether to prosecute or not to prosecute. (loud laughter)
AG: So there was no specific information that Mr. Mahendran did keep his word
PM: I had no information that Mr. Mahendran had deliberately misled me. The Pitipana Committee also did not have any information to that effect. And I do not think even the COPE had any findings in that matter. After the Pitipana Committee, the matter was handed over to parliament. The first COPE committee brought Arjun Aloysius down and examined him. The second COPE committee brought Mr. Mahendran and questioned him extensively. So once the matter reached Parliament, I did not interfere. I also wanted it to be done by parliament because the parliament has the power over public finances and for it to establish the principles; the parliament has to be in control. We established the Parliamentary Finance Committee with the Chairman and now we are passing legislation to give it a budget office, so that they will be in complete control. There will be a provision for them to take information from the Central Bank so what happened earlier will not take place in the future.
The Attorney-General asked the Prime Minister what action he had taken to ensure the integrity of the Treasury Bond issuance following the Pitipana report
PM: As I told you earlier, Mr. Mahendrans continuation depended on the findings of the Pitipana Committee. I asked them if it is necessary to ask Mahendran to resign, they said no. But they asked to go into the relationship between the PTL and the Bank of Ceylon. Presently, we are in the process of drafting a new monetary law. I have asked the Central Bank for its input. Once we receive that, we will have foreign consultants opinions into consideration as well. I could not run a parallel inquiry while the COPE was sitting. They would have accused me of bad faith.
When asked by the AG, the Prime Minister said he was not aware of a policy decision imposed upon state banks to coordinate and bid lower at bond auctions in March 2016. There was no policy decision. It was only said not to go for speculative bids. Only speculative bidding was discouraged. The Premier said.
He also outlined the crisis situation with regard to debt management and other financial demands that the new government had to deal with when it took office in January 2015.

Police have no hidden agendas - IGP
Sri Lanka Police do not have hidden agendas. It has the state agenda to serve dutifully for the public of the country Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasindara said in Galle.
He was addressing the special forum of the Civil Security Committee members , officers of Community Policing Unit lead by religious dignitaries of Galle Police Division held yesterday at Galle Town Hall. It was a programme to raise awareness over the recent incidents of violence that took place at GIntota in Galle.
Police department does not work to elevate anyones personal image or to serve for the individual being of any person. We do not have hidden agendas. Nevertheless we have the state agenda to serve the masses of the country. We are obliged and bound for the execution that national agenda he further pointed out.
The IGP in assessing the lessons learnt from the recent communal unrest in Gintota, Galle said that the police including religious and community leaders and state officials failed in handling and controlling the progressing of communal violence in Gintota.
We have to be modest. We all failed. The incidents that occurred in Gintota are black mark for us all. However we have to correct our mistakes and deficiencies and reorganized all civil organizations to avoid happening of such disgraceful and shameful events in future.
Police should strive hard. I hope the participation of at least 25 members from each of the Civil Security Committees of the 8 Grama Niladhari Divisions that were connected to the last Weekss incidents of violence. But the attendance is very poor. This shows that we fail in fulfilling our obligations. We have to understand the reality and modestly accept that we all failed in accomplishing our duties and obligations.
Patronizing one ethnicity or religion with maliciousness and on personal prejudice the incidents of violence are unavoidable. If we are interested only on our personal property and gains divisions among us are obligatory. Hence we have to think as one nation and one country. Our country is Sri Lanka and we are Sri Lankans.
The incidents of disunity occur out of brutality. Now we have concentrate on how to start afresh from the point where we failed. We have suffered more than enough owing to our inability to understand the social reality. The person who love the country, their family and their children cannot sponsored inhumanity.
Some sections of Social Media including certain national media also tried to inflame the communal unrest through spreading fallacious news. They tried to aggravate the situation working in par with certain vicious agendas. I urge all media institutions and media persons to work with responsibility for the national course of ensuring peace and harmony among all ethnic and religious groups of the country. Media is a national asset. They have a national obligation.

Police sticker scam in Hatton
A group posing as the Police has been selling stickers to three-wheeler drivers in Hatton, collecting a substantial sum of money, said drivers of the Hatton Three-wheeler Association.
The sticker, highlighted with the official Police logo and colours of white and blue, contains details of the Police station such as the phone number, area, the Police emergency contact number and a popular phrase used by a State television channel on its accident prevention campaign. They have sold the tickets for Rs. 150 a piece.
Alarmingly, the group has also handed the drivers a form to be filled with their personal information and details of their vehicle.
These stickers have been sold not only in Hatton, but also in Bogawanthalawa, Norwood and surrounding towns on November 18. As suspicion began to grow over the stickers, the drivers had questioned them and said they would complain about this to the Police and media. Thereafter, the group had fled the area.
When Hatton ASP Dassanayake was contacted with regard to the scam, he said the campaign had no involvement of the Police and that it was probably an act by an organization or certain individuals. Interestingly, he admitted that the forms containing personal information of the drivers were handed over to the Police by the group. The ASP who did not perceive anything wrong in the campaign added that it was up to the driver to paste the sticker on his three-wheeler or not.

Politicians arrived at erroneous conclusions - Bond Commission
The Special Presidential Commission, inquiring into the Central Bank Bond issue, in a statement yesterday, described many of the various statements made by several persons,in the political arena, in relation to evidence with regard to the telephonic communications between Arjuna Aloysius and several persons, including several Members of Parliament,as been based on misconceptions and are factually erroneous.
Following is the full statement;
The attention of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond issue has been drawn to various statements made by several persons in the political arena, which have been published in the media, and which relate to the evidence with regard to telephonic communications between Arjuna Aloysius and several persons including several members of Parliament and also telephonic communication between Arjuna Mahendran and several persons,.
Many of these statements appear to have been made based on misconceptions and are factually erroneous.
We wish to make it clear that, on the orders of the Commission of Inquiry, made in terms of the Provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, the mobile telephones and other electronic devices used by Arjuna Aloysius and Arjuna Mahendran were examined by the CID.
This examination revealed the telephonic contact and electronic contacts which Aloysius and Mahendran had with a large number of persons.
The identities of the persons who received ,or, initiated such telephonic and electronic communications, with Aloysius, and, Mahendran were ascertained where the officers of the Hon. Attorney Generals Department who are assisting this Commission of Inquiry considered that doing so was relevant to the mandate issued to this Commission of Inquiry.
This entire process was based on the data found on the mobile telephones and other electronic devices used by Arjuna Aloysius and Arjuna Mahendran and also information provided lawfully by Telecommunication service Providers.
The telephone records of any Member of Parliament were not obtained and were not examined.
With regard to the evidence led on the last day of proceedings I.e on 16th November 2017 only the dates and times of telephone conversations and electronic communications were produced in evidence.
The contents of any conversations or communications were not obtained and have not been produced in evidence before us.
It is only this evidence which was presented to the Commission of Inquiry by the officers of the Hon. Attorney Generals Department who are assisting this Commission of Inquiry on 16th November, 2016 I.e 4 days ago.
In the case of Aloysius mobile telephone, some text messages had been extracted several month previously. Those text messages were produced in evidence in August of this year I.e more than 3 months ago.
The claims that the telephones of several Members of Parliament and other persons have been tapped or recorded in the course of this examination, are utterly false.
This Commission of Inquiry does not intend to make any further investigations in this regard as we have to terminate the reception of Evidence and will, from now on, engage solely in continuing with the preparation of our Report.
Our mandate does not require this Commission of Inquiry to embark on any such further investigation.

Securing the social licence to operate
Asia has achieved remarkable growth and prosperity over the past decades. It is not without costs though. Part of the regions rapid expansion happened at the expense of its environment and scarce natural resources.
To ensure that our economies can continue to develop and grow sustainably, we need to continuously ask ourselves: what intervention do companies have to make today to be operating years from now.
For many companies, there is a constant balance between generating growth and returns, and minimising negative impact on the environment, health and safety. Instead of turning away companies that cause stress to the environment and community, a more practical solution is for governments and banks to work with them to meet sustainable standards.
Because banks are able to influence capital allocation by assessing and managing risks, the industry is well positioned to play a bigger role in the development of sustainable finance. It is not about exiting sectors because they cause harm to our environment or community; these industries support many jobs that provide for families and sustain economies. It is more about supporting practices that promote sustainable business, employment and growth while being socially responsible.
The mission of providing finance responsibly can be met with predicament though. Banks thrive by financing clients, but they encounter a dilemma of balancing economic gains with environmental and social (E&S) impact when sustainability risks arise from these financing decisions. Banks can also become vulnerable to reputational risk from charges of their clients environmentally and socially inappropriate behaviour. But as an international financial institution that does most of its business in emerging markets, we are cognizant of our responsibility and the difference we can make through our choice to bank the right companies.
Since 1997, we have implemented a comprehensive approach to managing E&S risks. Our Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) framework applies standards adopted from the Equator Principles to assess and manage E&S risks in projects. By being an active member of industry bodies, we also commit to understanding and promoting guidelines and policies to help clients address challenges and capitalise on sustainable growth opportunities.
Take for example our ESRM team, which acts as an in-house independent advisor on sustainability-related issues. It either lends support to a financing deal by working with willing clients to achieve the right E&S standards, or concludes that others sustainability goals are misaligned with what our Bank stands for. The teams role spans from initial risk assessments and detailed due diligence to designing time-bound action plans tied to loan conditions. This is less about clients checking the right boxes, but more about our team working with these clients at every step of the way to ensure the desired outcome.
But why should companies invest time and resources to meet stringent standards that could compromise near-term gains And how relevant are responsible business actions to Singapore
Situated at the end of the Malayan Peninsula between Malaysia and Indonesia, Singapore is no stranger to the perennial haze caused by forest fires used to clear land for agricultural production and sale. The prolonged haze in 2015 resulted in disruptions including schools closure and suspended delivery services by fast-food companies. For the first time, consumers in Singapore boycotted products from companies involved in causing the haze, and had retailers withdraw those brands from their shelves. It cost the country some S$700 million of economic losses[1].
The realisation hit home. The need for sustainable practices has gone beyond building a green environment; it is also about the people and their community.
Remedial actions were taken. In October 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore issued guidelines on responsible financing. A month later, Indonesias banking regulator announced that green financing would be compulsory for all banks in Indonesia by 2018. In 2016, the Singapore Exchange introduced sustainability reporting on a comply or explain basis to increase non-financial disclosures transparency. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is a supporting partner of the Collaborative Initiative for Green Finance in Singapore, an initiative that is being driven by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs in collaboration with the UN Environment Inquiry. A report that will outline the opportunities and possibilities to better mainstream Green Finance in Singapore has just been published this week.
Opportunities based on sustainable development principles could help the private sector unlock US$5 trillion in business opportunities and create 230 million new jobs in Asia by 2030, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission said in June 2017.
Banks success as a business is intrinsically linked to the health and prosperity of their markets. While we help clients that meet sustainability standards to build sustainable results, it is also about working with those who are not compliant today but are committed to making the right changes.
As rapidly-evolving sustainability benchmarks up the ante on corporate responses to the growing social demands on organisations, helping companies to secure their social licence to operate can only become the way forward. Without this intent, we risk losing the forest for the trees.

Shakira postpones tour dates due to vocal cord issues
Shakira has been forced to postpone the European dates of her world tour until 2018 due to vocal issues.
The Hips Don't Lie singer was due to kick off her El Dorado World Tour in Cologne, Germany earlier in November 17 but she had to postpone several dates due to "strained vocal cords" but was hoping to get back on the road by November 17.
However, Shakira has now revealed she has a haemorrhage on her right vocal cord and, even though she had been on vocal rest, she still hasn't recovered, and will be postponing her forthcoming gigs.
In a lengthy Instagram post, the star confessed to her fans that the past few days have been "some of the hardest of my career" and her "nightmare continues" while she battles her health issues.
"It pains me not to be able to sing this month, for those have done even the impossible to get tickets and accompany me throughout different countries of Europe," she wrote. "In all the years I've been singing, I've never been faced with a situation like this. As such, and with a heavy heart, I must that I find myself obliged to postpone my European tour until 2018, to allow my body several necessary weeks, dedicated to my complete recovery."
The 40-year-old thanked her fans for understanding and said that she will always remember those who have been supportive.
"I hope to overcome this difficult trial and to return to the stage as soon as possible, to once again hear your voices singing along with mine," she continued.
It is not known when the European leg will take place in 2018. The North American trek is scheduled to begin on 9 January in Orlando, Florida.

Shields ends All Black dream with Wasps move
Wellington: Wellington skipper Brad Shields on Monday confirmed a move to Wasps in 2018, ending his All Black aspirations but opening the door to a potential switch to England for the 2019 World Cup.
The highly rated 26-year-old captained Wellington Hurricanes to a Super Rugby title in 2016 and led the side against the British and Irish Lions this year.
Hard-working and physical, the loose forward is regarded as unlucky to have never been capped by New Zealand, despite being named in two All Black training squads.
He is eligible for England via his British parents and Sky Spots reported that Eddie Jones will closely monitor his progress in the English Premiership as he looks for World Cup options.
Shields will join Wasps after completing the 2018 Super Rugby season with the Hurricanes.
"It's good to have my playing future confirmed nice and early so I can focus 100 percent on the Hurricanes," he said.
The All Blacks have a strict policy of not selecting foreign-based players, making Shields ineligible after he leaves the Hurricanes.AFP

Sri Lankan alternative for Mixed-Voting system
It is learned that the proposed, imported Mixed-Voting system, is designed to elect more than 225 parliamentarians through FPP and PR on an ad hoc 50:50 basis. The declared objective of FPP is to assign an MP from the area to be responsible for each electorate. In our view, the introduction of this complex system merely to assign central Government MPs to peripheral electorates through a high-cost General election exercise is preposterous, superfluous and meaningless, as it leads to, MPs usurping the main role of some 455 Provincial Councillors and of 4486 local Govt. members at grass root level who are already unproductive.
The latter figures work out to an average of 26 politicians for each electorate! Now, it is shuddering to hear that the number of local Govt. members will increase by another 3,500 to inter-alia accommodate female members.
As a result, each electorate will have 44 unproductive politicians in the future! People never asked for these frightful increases in the numbers of our unproductive politicians breeding bribery and corruption at the expense of the Tax-payer. Besides, a practical necessity for MPs to maintain an Umbilical cord connection with the grass root level voters should not arise at a time the Preference Voting system stands to be abolished.
Unproductive political fraternity
Surely, it is not good governance to duplicate functions on the one hand and waste tax payers money on the other, on the expansion of the infrastructure to accommodate the increasing numbers of our unproductive political fraternity. The writer has submitted a comprehensive package of proposals on Electoral reforms several times during the recent past through the press with copies to Public Committee on constitutional reforms, Constitutional Assembly, Election Commission, Presidents office, PMs office a few concerned Party offices, Civil Organisations and individuals to of no avail. In essence, the proposals address the following important national imperatives triggering from our emerging political culture, which are not adequately dealt with under the imported Mixed Voting system which is practiced only in 30 countries out of 213!
Resolving ethnic conflict by mandatory recognition of equality of all citizens of Sri Lanka as Sri Lankans bereft of Race, Religion or Caste differences by giving an equal value to all votes at any General or Provincial Council election buttressed with the introduction of an all-party Cabinet (35 to 40 Portfolios) based on proportionate national vote obtained by each party big or small.
Introduction of Grama Rajya concept acceptable to all communities by depoliticizing Local Govt. elections to allow independent persons to be elected as ward members by the local people supported by steps to increase the efficiency of much-maligned Public Service, Police and the judiciary. With depoliticisation, the present fiasco of delaying LG elections would never have occurred!
Improving the effectiveness of Provincial Councils which now remain as white-elephants by streamlining the existing Decentralized Political administration with specific allocation of functions to avoid duplication and wastage of resources.
Decentralized budgets for provinces to be effectively utilised by discontinuing separate allocations for MPs at the centre.
Hoodwinking the voter by false promises to be stopped by transforming Party Election Manifestos to legally enforceable documents.
Wasteful and unproductive electoral system to be replaced by simple, cost and time saving electoral reforms such as substituting Preference Voting system with District merit lists of Parties carrying names of political professionals selected under robust national criteria leading to avoidance of Bi-elections, Hung-Parliament and Crossovers et al.
Reducing exorbitant, unproductive expenditure incurred by the political fraternity by rationalising the numbers, salaries, allowances and the role responsibilities of all politicians including the Cabinet.
Cutting down wasteful expenditure by holding Elections on specified dates.
Simplifying the work-load of the Elections Dept. paving the way for Election results to be announced before midnight.
Removing the draconian powers remaining, if any, of Executive Presidency while maintaining the post to deal with Provincial Governors and other executive functions to ensure enhanced productivity of the country as a whole.
Making Executive President a Statesman cum Care Taker by prohibiting participation in Party politics during his tenure of office.
Steering committee deliberations
Readers will appreciate that the above proposals constitute a Model of our own anvil with Social equality, Justice, simplicity and passion for high productivity forming its Metal Plates. Therefore, looking for examples from other countries is superfluous.
At last, we are happy to learn that citizen concerns will be addressed at steering committee deliberations after the current session of the constituent assembly. We therefore, appeal to all sensible citizens, academics, politicians and civil activists to carefully study the above proposals with an open mind and persuade the authorities to dispense with the redundant and complex Mixed-Voting system that will breed more unproductive politicians draining the resources of our country already burdened with a colossal debt portfolio and low productivity.

Trump declares North Korea 'sponsor of terror'

President Trump has announced that the US is re-designating North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, nine years after it was removed from the list.
In a cabinet meeting, he said the move would trigger "very large" additional sanctions to be announced on Tuesday.
But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later admitted that "the practical effects may be limited".
Trump blamed the country's nuclear programme, and support for what he called international acts of terrorism.
While announcing the decision at the White House, the US president said it "should have happened a long time ago".
In September, the US proposed a range of United Nations sanctions against North Korea, including an oil ban and a freeze on leader Kim Jong-un's assets.
It followed the North's sixth nuclear test and repeated missile launches.
North Korea joins Iran, Sudan and Syria on a list of countries that are deemed to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
The country has been on the list before but was removed in 2008 by the administration of George W Bush as part of negotiations on the North's nuclear programme.
The campaign to reinstate it intensified after the American college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after he was released from North Korean custody.
Move makes talks even less likely
Secretary Tillerson hasn't given up on a negotiated solution to the stand-off with North Korea.
He told journalists he still hoped for diplomacy. But the decision to put Pyongyang back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism will almost certainly set back the possibility of any opening for talks, at least in the short term.
The chances of that happening were slim anyway. And it might prompt a backlash from North Korea, perhaps by way of another missile test.
The Americans have had some success in getting other countries to tighten the noose on Pyongyang, including from China.
Tillerson's goal remains to eventually force the regime to back down and agree to negotiations aimed at giving up its nuclear weapons programme, something Pyongyang has refused to do.
China on the other hand, is pushing for talks now, alongside the pressure. It won't be happy about anything that makes that less likely
Speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Tillerson, the top US diplomat, said the designation was meant to hold North Korea accountable for recent actions it has taken "including assassinations outside of their country" and "using banned chemical weapons".
He admitted that given existing sanctions it was "very symbolic" but also said new measures could "disrupt and dissuade some third parties from undertaking certain activities with North Korea".
"The practical effects may be limited but hopefully we're closing off a few loopholes with this," he said.
Kim continues to pursue nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions. He has made no secret of Pyongyang's plans to develop a missile capable of reaching the US mainland and has claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb.
Last month, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that the threat of nuclear attack from North Korea was increasing.
Monday's announcement comes after the president returned from an extensive tour of Asia last week.
