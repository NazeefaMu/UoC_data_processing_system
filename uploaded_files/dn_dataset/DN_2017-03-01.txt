bigger and stronger- Starc
New Delhi: Mitchell Starc may have won the opening duel against Indian skipper Virat Kohli by getting the star batsman out for a duck in the first Test, but the Australian fast bowler insists the battle has just begun.
Starc triggered India's downfall in last week's first Test in Pune by claiming the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli in quick succession in the first innings before left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe took charge. Australia bowled out India for paltry totals of 105 and 107 in the two innings, with O'Keefe taking a total of 12 wickets as the visitors wrapped up a 333-run win inside three days.
Kohli, who has been in red-hot form in recent months, had a rare failure with scores of 0 and 13 in his two outings. Guilty of chasing Starc's wide delivery outside the off-stump, Kohli gave away a catch to Peter Handscomb at first slip and the batting soon fell apart on a sharply turning wicket.
"We know (Kohli) is going to be another key wicket for the rest of the series. There's six more times we've got to get him out to really cement this series," Starc told reporters.
"We know he'll come back bigger and stronger, but he's one I'll take over Pujara at the moment," Starc said when asked to rate the importance of his twin strikes in Pune.
Starc and Kohli are former team-mates for the Indian Premier League (IPL) side Royal Challengers Bangalore, and the Australian is well aware of how dangerous the Indian skipper can be once he gets his eye in.
"He's a class player, we all know that. He's scored a mountain of runs already this year. We're going to have to be wary of that Virat comeback," Starc said of Kohli, who has scored double centuries in four successive series.
"We are really happy that it happened that way for us, but we know that one Test is not going to win us the series. It's three important Test matches to go."
After the next Test in Bangalore, the two teams are also due to play in Ranchi and Dharamsala. AFP

Box-office Stokes deserves IPL windfall - Botham
London: Ian Botham says "box-office" Ben Stokes deserves every penny of the more than 1.7 million ($2.1mn) that the England all-rounder will rake in playing in the Indian Premier League.
Stokes set a record for an overseas player in the cash-rich Twenty20 competition when Rising Pune Supergiants shelled out for him at last week's auction.
The 25-year-old Stokes has come up through the ranks at Durham, where Botham is the newly appointed chairman having finished his illustrious playing career with the English county.
Botham, one of the outstanding all-rounders of his generation, said he was glad that Stokes -- set to have fresh responsibilities with England as vice-captain to new Test skipper Joe Root -- was being well-rewarded.
"He is getting for the IPL what most guys going to China to play football are getting for a fortnight's wages," Botham told a news conference at Durham's Chester-le-Street headquarters.
"Cricket needs to move and I think players deserve the rewards. It's a precarious living. You can have an injury and never play again and I think people realise that now."
Stokes's aggressive style has been compared to that of Botham in his pomp and the former England captain said: "I am very pleased for Ben. He is box office -- that's why he went for what he went for (in the IPL). "His intention is not just to play, but to win, and that's the kind of guy he is. AFP

Prisons Dept., Police cannot shirk responsibility
The Law and Order and Southern Development Ministry in a statement to the media stated that neither the Prison Department nor the Sri Lanka Police could shirk their collective responsibilities in the recent Kalutara Prison shooting.
The ministry in its statement released yesterday expressed its regret over the unfortunate and serious incident took place on Monday (27) where five inmates and two prison guards being shot dead in front of the Kalutara Prison while they were being transported to courts.
The current legal framework stipulates that the Prisons Department is responsible for the prisoners and their security and when transporting dangerous criminals, they have been advised to seek police assistance, stated the ministry.
Prison officials and the police have been given necessary training on measures to be taken when transporting such prisoners in addition to being trained in the handling of weapons. Hence the Sri Lanka Police nor the Prisons Department cannot evade their collective responsibility in this matter, the statement said.
In response to recent statement made by Prisons, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister D.M. Swaminathan, who assigned blame to the police, the Law and Order Ministry stated that the former could not absolve all blame from the Prison Department by merely blaming the police.
The more productive measure to the general public would be to identify the main responsibilities of all the main departments and their shortcomings and to work towards meeting these challenges better in future. But for that all should first accept responsibility, the ministry stated. The ministry stated that as a responsible government, they were duty bound to take action against all responsible officers in the Prisons Department as well as the Police and to expedite the arrest of the suspects responsible in the shooting.

11 Signs you might be broke
You might be broke if
1. Youre living paycheck to paycheck. If youre spending every dollar you take home, you are, by definition, broke. More than 75% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck (with little to no savings), which means that, right off the bat, at least three-quarters of us are impecunious.
2. You have credit-card debt. Theres no such thing as good debt. The debtor is always slave to the lender.
3. You have student-loan debt.
4. You have a monthly car payment. Ahem.
5. Your income dictates your lifestyle. It should be the other way around: we should work to earn enough money to live, not live to earn enough money to buy shit we dont need. Until he breaks free from consumerism, the hoarder is slave to his hoard.
6. You arent saving for the future. We know, we know: youll start saving tomorrow. But of course tomorrow never comes, because tomorrow will be today tomorrow, and tomorrows tomorrow will never be today. Ergo, begin today. Your life literally depends on it. See 5 Difficult Steps Toward Financial Freedom.
7. Youre not healthy. Unhealthy equals depression. Yes, if youre unhealthy, statistics show that youre likely depressed. If you cant enjoy life, no matter how wealthy you are, then youre broke in a different way: youre broken. The richest man in the graveyard might have the most lavish tombstone, but hes still dead.
8. Your relationships are suffering. Too often we forsake the most important people in our lives in search of money or ephemeral pleasures. We believe that our loved ones will always be around or that theyll understand. But when youre careless with something for long enough, it breaks.
9. You argue over money. Troubled relationships tend to end for one of two reasons: arguments over money or arguments over sex (or both). Even if the relationship doesnt end, it is difficult to grow if yallre constantly bickering about finances. (P.S. If youre arguing over sexor the lack thereofthen somethings broken.)
10. Youre not growing. It doesnt matter how much cash you earn: if youre not growing, youre dying. We feel most alive when we cultivate a passion, drudge through the drudgery, and live our lives with purpose, autonomy, and mastery.
11. You dont contribute as much as youd like. Your worth isnt determined by your net worth: real worth comes from contributing beyond yourself in a meaningful way. It was MLK who said, Lifes most persistent and urgent question is: what are you doing for others Giving is living, and its much easier to give when youre no longer worried about money.

49 Group, the most royal of them all
In 1949, a group of 96 students were successful in gaining entrance to Royal College having sat an open competitive exam. About 60 of them were from Royal Prep, while the balance was from other schools such as St Thomas Mt Lavinia, Trinity College Kandy, St Josephs and St Peters. All students were about 10 years old and they were examined mainly on general intelligence and general knowledge, English, Sinhalese and Arithmetic. Although Royal Prep bore the same name, there was no automatic entry to Royal College unlike several years before, and several years after.
The Head Master of Royal Prep was A F De Saa Bandaranayake, while the Principal of Royal College was J C A Corea - the first Ceylonese Principal. Initially, most of these boys did not take studies seriously as a large number were from affluent families, being children of professionals, but once they got into their respective disciplines, there was no turning back. Quite a number of them have reached the zenith of their profession.
Royal College is indisputably the best school in the Island. All parents clamour to get their children into Royal, but not all of them are lucky enough. Everyone thinks of other public schools as second best. Royal and St Thomas (Mt Lavinia), are the most prestigious, like Eton and Harrow of England.
Royal was founded in 1835 by the then British Colonial Government, mainly for the education of the sons of the Britishers, under the Principalship of Dr Barcroft Boake, a product of Oxford University. Though the school was initially called the Colombo Academy, it came to be known later as Royal College. On the panels of the College Hall are the names of those who distinguished themselves in the field of intellect.
Also, in the College Hall hang the portraits of those who rendered yeoman service to our country. Some amongst them are C A Lorenz KC, the Acting Queens Advocate, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan Acting Attorney General and his brother Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam of the Ceylon Civil Service, Dr C A Hewavitharne and his sibling Anagarika Dharmapala. Of the Politicians of recent times were two heads of state: Sir John Kotalawala and President J R Jayewardene, while H Sri Nissanka QC, a well-known criminal lawyer and one of the founders of the SLFP also adorn the Hall.
D S Sennanayake, Dudley Senanayake and S W R D Bandaranaike were distinguished products of the school known by Royalists as the other school, namely, St Thomas.
Civil Service
This batch came to be called the 49 Group. According to the statistics compiled, it is perhaps the best batch that Royal turned out in recent times. It is said that 32 of them became medical doctors, most of them consultants, while six entered the legal profession, two of them becoming Presidents Counsels, two others becoming Judges of the Supreme Court, three entered the Ceylon Civil Service and 18 became Engineers.
It is estimated that about 68 percent of this Group became professionals. While in school, each one of them fought for the last place in class! But when they commenced their respective disciplines, they shone over the products of other schools.
Some surgeons of the 49 group are Ranjit de Silva  who captained Royal at cricket, Priya Samarasinghe, Geoff Vanden Driesen, Gamini Goonethilake, S R Ratnapala, whilst some of the well-known physicians are Henry Rajaratnam, J B Pieris, Gamini Jayakuru, Brendon Gooneratne, the latter distinguishing himself in Australia. His wife, Yasmin Gooneratne, a Professor of English in Australia, has several publications to her credit Another wife of a member of the 49 Group is Professor Lalitha Mendis, who reached the pinnacle of the medical profession. She was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Director of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine. She is the wife of the late Dr Lalith Mendis.
The other physicians are Danilo de Kretser, Tissa Cooray (WHO), N T de Silva (UK), H S Karunasekera (UK), Leslie Muthukuda (UK), Dan Perimpanayagam, Yasa Rajapakse (UK), Disampathy Subasinghe (UK), V Dharmapalan (New Zealand), and the late R S B Wickremesinghe  who was the Director of the MRI.
Of those who took to Law are two well known Presidents Counsels: Jayantha Gunasekera (former Secretary of the Bar Association) and the late Chula de Silva. Two other lawyers S W B Wadugodapitiya and P Edissuriya ended up as Judges of the Supreme Court, whilst A Balachandran worked in the UN. T K N Thilakan (District Judge) and Kumar Ponnambalam both died a few years ago. Alavi Mohamed, a Barrister, also died several years ago. M N B Pieris is a civil lawyer, in Colombo.
Harsha Wickremasinghe, D G P Seneviratne and Dr B S Wijeweera entered the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service.
Of the Engineers that come to mind are Professor C L V Jayathilake (a Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya), Dr Susantha Goonethilake, S C Amarasinghe (former GM of the Electricity Board), Dr Sri Bhavan Sri Skandarajah  Sri Bhavan in May 2013 staged a six-day fast in Canada in support of the LTTE diaspora, H S B Abeysundara (Chemical Engineer), L H Meegama, C Ramachandran and Bandula Yatawara are also among them.
Perhaps the cleverest of them all was Chelvanayagam Vaseeharan, a math prodigy, who was to be appointed Professor of Mathematics.
Successful businessmen
In this class were two leading businessmen: Cambridge-educated Upali Wijewardene of the Upali Group and Lal Jayasundera, Chairman of Hayleys. Ratna Sivaratnam headed another conglomerate, Aitken Spence, whilst K Manikkavasagar was a Director of Glaxo. Arjuna Hullugalle and Upatissa Attygalle are successful businessmen.
V H Nanayakkara and P H J S Ariyapala both Bachelors of Science, joined the Staff of Royal College. There was one member of the 49 Group who distinguished himself as a clever investigator in the Police Force. If he had not joined the Police, surely he would have been on the other side of the Law! That was none other than Rahula Silva. It is reported that he was charged in several cases of violence. In all these cases he was successfully defended gratis, by his classmate Jayantha Gunasekera, a well-known criminal lawyer.
There is the very talented Artist Laki Senanayake, who worked with Geoffrey Bawa, whilst A A Wijetunga and K Sivapragasam became Senior Assessors in the Inland Revenue Dept. K L Gooneratne is a talented Architect. Late Bimal Padameperuma functioned as Chairman Engineering Corp, and D C Wimalasena was Chairman, Petroleum Corp.
T D S A Dissanayake, a prolific writer, first served in the UN. Later he was our Ambassador to Indonesia.
There were two members of this Group to whom life was a ball! They were Aru Sellamuttu and Ranjit Kiriella. Nimalasiri Fonseka, a bright spark in school, lives the life of a Squire in England.

All political parties united in drafting the Constitution: Kiriella
Tamil MPs opposed when the constitution was being drafted by Sirimavo Bandaranaike and J.R. Jayawardene. This is the first time in the countrys history that all political parties are working together in drafting a constitution including the Tamil parties, said Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
The Minister expressed these views at the commencement of development of a road which the British captured during King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghas reign in Medamulana, Teldeniya. The Minister said during the past Presidential election they spoke of the need for a new Constitution at meetings. During the Parliamentary Election we spoke of a need of a new Constitution. Only the people who strived for President Maithripala Sirisenas victory understood the necessity of a new Constitution. All political parties in parliament are included in an oversight committee which is involved in drafting a new constitution. This has never occurred before. No Tamil party participated in drafting a Constitution during Sirimavo Bandaranaike and J.R. Jayawardenes rule. We will put the constitution to a referendum and see what the peoples verdict is.

Amana Bank records Rs.102 mn PBT in 2016
Amana Bank continued its positive growth momentum in core banking, leveraging on its strategic focus of being primarily an SME and Retail Bank in 2016.
Financing Income crossed the Rs 4 billion mark by end of 2016, corresponding to YoY growth of 40% whilst Net Finance Income during the same period grew by 30% to Rs 1.9 billion.
The Bank continued to gain from Net Fee and Commission Income which recorded a growth of 46.3% in 2016 to reach Rs 246.5 million. Total Operating Income during the year under review grew by 17.7% to reach Rs 2.4 billion. Despite the impressive growth in Core Banking, the Bank was able to record only a Profit Before Tax of Rs 102.8 million for the year, owing to the loss on impairment of Rs 149.1 million from non-core banking activities. This is attributed to recognizing the impact of underperforming capital market investments which were prevalent in the portfolio.
The Banks Total Assets crossed the Rs 50 billion milestone during the year and closed at Rs 54.3 billion, a growth of 13.8%. Owing to the strong demand for its multitude of products and services, the Banks Deposits and Advances grew by 22% and 16.3% to read at Rs 46.9 billion and Rs 38.4 billion respectively in 2016. Chairman Osman Kassim said Amana Bank has been growing significantly with overwhelming customer acceptance of its unique banking model and we look forward to further acceleration in our growth journey strengthened by the forthcoming capital infusion. Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer said although the one-off impairment has had an impact to profits,the Net Assets were not affected as a result, due to such losses being captured in the Banks reserves previously, and set off against profits in the fourth quarter.

Behind the glass bead curtain
An internationally favoured writer in English, Dr Lakshmi Kannans, latest work recounts in fictional terms the realities in the lives of a few characters in British India in a very interesting way marked by a flow of English writing that is remarkable. You would enjoy the carefully used selective words and phrases the writer employs which are effective in bringing out the nuances in detail as one notices in French writing even in translation. I am not exaggerating. University students in English Departments will find it a valuable tool for their dissection and thesis content writing.
The novel is not only successful in structure but also rich meat in substance as a window to show about many things in Brahman families then with their practices, conventions, rituals, child marriages and the like the in neighboring India.
It is better for me and you to tell the theme and plot of the story clearly if I give what the blurb of the book published by Vitasta Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2/15, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi, 110 002 in 2016 priced at Indian 299 Rupees:
Kalyani and Athai. Two feisty women, sail through the turn-of-the century Madras Presidency under British rule, despite archaic and tyrannical customs such as child marriage and gender bias.
Kalyanis child marriage ends her formal education because of a prevalent superstition that married girls would be widowed if sent to school. Tutored at home by the intrepid Susan OLeary of Irish origin. Kalyani joyfully oaks in Shakespeare and Bacon along with OLearys humour.
Packed off to her husbands home at the onset of puberty, she faces the taunts of her retrograde females-in-law as she has grown taller than her husband Natarajan.
Kalyani battles her way through funny situations to evolve as a successful badminton coach with the support of her husband, father-in-law and grand mother-in-law.
Ambujam, her mother-in-law mocks her English and English education but is forced to seek Kalyanis help for her daughter Karpagam, rejected by her husband for not knowing English.
Athai, a child widow, is fired by a relentless quest for education. She emerges as an intellectual who is far ahead of her times in addressing womens issues. Her family discovers an astonishing secret about her when she dies.
As you would see, Lakshmi Kannan, the novelist unobtrusively in a sense, one of the pioneer feminist writers in India. She is bilingual- Thamil and English. Her first novel was in her mother tongue. The English title of the book reads Going Home. That too dealt with social issues. The novel under review- The Glass Bead Curtain-, is in English. She translates her works by herself.
We learn that  she has published extensively her critical essays on gender issues, language issues, on the art of translation and the afterlife of a translated work he has presented papers in various national and international forums including the International Feminist Book Fairs in Canada and the Netherlands.
Dr Lakshmi Kannan is a scholar in English. Humble and modest. I have met her on two occasions in New Delhi, where she lives.
She has received Resident Fellowships from international writing Program at the University of Iowa (USA); Charles Wallace Trust with the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK); the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla and Sahitya Akademi, Delhi and was a British Council Visitor to the University of Cambridge (UK).
Raving reviews of her chiseled writing in English has already appeared in Indian and foreign journals.
I enjoyed reading this novel for the implicit social comment and meticulously constructed structure of the novel and the beautiful and effective language used. This is evident in several passages in the novel. There is a superb description of how badminton should be played as explained by the main character Kalyani.
The humour and sarcasm come out nicely. The story is narrated by a writer named Shailaja. Interesting observations of writers and writing are recorded where sarcasm is conveyed subtly.
To demonstrate an example of the writers style of writing here is a short passage at the opening of the novel:
She attended some of the book launches dressed in her casual best and made the usual polite noises. Or she stood back and watched the typical drama unfolding  a swanky event in a big hotel, the evening- dotted with stylish, high profile people, a celebrity to release the book, followed by the wines and the multi-cuisine dinner, after which, at times, one heard nothing more about the book Many of the books launched with so much fanfare sank without a trace. But who cared (Pages 2 & 3)
The narrator Shailaja calls her enclosure at home where she spends most of the time writing  The Glass Bead Curtain. Shailaja wrote on the top of the sheet, THE GLASS BEAD CURTAIN, all in upper case. Two lines below, she wrote Chapter One, What God Left Out.
She wrote on till midnight. She just could not stem the flow of her writing concludes Lakshmi Kannan.
It is worth to be put in your library to relish from time to time.

CA overrules preliminary objections by Gnanasara Thera; case fixed for argument
The Court of Appeal yesterday, decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet filed by the Attorney General over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court amounting to Contempt of Court on January 25, last year.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal two-judge-bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena fixed the matter for argument on May 16.
When the charge sheet was read out before the Court of Appeal, Gnanasara Thera informed Court that he was not pleading guilty to the charges.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution. At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Car registrations down by 40%, three wheelers by 50%
Motor car registrations have come down by 40% on a month and month basis mainly due to drop in financing share of motor cars. The three wheeler segment came down by nearly 50%,according to the JB Securities monthly review.
Implementation of the budget proposal to restrict credit to new cars (50% LTV) and three wheelers (25% LTV) is the primary factor accounting for a plunge in registrations.The full impact of the directive will only be felt this month, the report said. However there have been a surge in Hyundai Eon cars (100% increase)According to JB Securities monthly review in contrast there have been an in increase of used cars, especially Toyotas and also electric cars are picking up.
There was also a big jump in Hybrid used cars where Axio witnessed a large increase (200+) while there was also an increase in Mini Vans(268% increase) with the biggest mover being Suzuki Every.
Three wheelers may be a menace on the road but it has been a huge contributor in creating inclusive growth both in terms of being a production asset (taxi) and/or personal vehicle providing mobility to the owner which in turn increases his radius of employment opportunities,ability to work flexible work hours due to not being reliant on public transport, access to markets.
The segment also saw Bajaj losing market share to TVS, the J. B. Securities said.
The report also says that mini trucks have come down by 20% while the registration for Buses have gone up by 40%.

CBK joins AUW International Council of Patrons
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga has accepted an invitation to join the eminent international Council of Patrons of the Asian University for Women (AUW) in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The University, which is the product of east-west foundational partnerships (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Open Society Foundation, IKEA Foundation etc) and regional cooperation, serves extraordinarily talented women from 15 countries across Asia and the Middle East, including Sri Lanka.
The university provides them with a pathway to service-oriented leadership via an internationally recognised liberal arts undergraduate programme. Students at the university represent a range of backgrounds and many are the first in their family to attend university. This is made possible due to the universitys commitment to empower young women with potential, bolstered by the support of strong scholarships where merited.
Since AUWs founding in 2008, 53 Sri Lankans have graduated from the university and 10 currently attend. As of 2016 a Sri Lankan member of the first group of graduates (Class of 2013) from the university has now become the first AUW alumna to complete a Masters in Public Policy at Oxford University. Meanwhile, others contribute in roles at leading organisations such as UNDP/UNV, World Vision, Good Neighbors International, American Corner Kandy, Asiri Group, Center for Environmental Justice and others. Efforts are currently underway to expand Sri Lankan student representation, build national networks of support and strengthen regional ties amongst Asian and Middle Eastern countries.
As of February 2017, the universitys Vice-Chancellor is Professor Nirmala Rao (OBE), the former Pro-Director at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), UK. In 2015 the university launched its Pathways for Promise initiative welcoming young women from garment factories and from refugee populations to attend a pre-undergraduate programme with hopes of then pursuing a bachelors degree at AUW.

Ceylinco Insurance posts record Rs 4.7 bn after tax profit
Ceylinco Insurance, the holding company recorded a consolidated after tax profit of Rs. 4.7 billion, for the year ended December 31, 2016.The profit before tax stood at an exceptional Rs . 5.9 billion.
Contributing to this remarkable performance, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance recorded profits after tax of Rs. 1.3 billion and Rs. 2.9 billion, respectively.
Ceylinco Insurance Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Ajith Gunawardena said Ceylinco Insurance sector, in 2016, remained far ahead of competition. Thus, the Insurance sector managed to return an impressive premium income of Rs. 31.1 billion in 2016, with Ceylinco General Insurance recording Rs.16.1 billion, marking a growth of 18.9 % ; an increase of over Rs.2.5 billion year on year, just as Ceylinco Life Insurance registered a premium income of Rs. 15 billion, marking a growth of 11.7 % ; an increase of Rs. 1.5 billion.
Ceylinco Life Insurance Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, R. Renganathan said in 2016 they embarked on a huge market expansion programme once again. Not only Ceylinco Life but the entire life insurance industry benefited through this.
The year 2016 marks a thirteen year period of unbroken market leadership for Ceylinco Life Insurance in the long term insurance segment. This is an incredible achievement, given the context of ever-increasing competition and the short - sighted tactics employed by smaller players in the market, in a bid to achieve short-term growth
Ceylinco General Insurance Managing Director Patrick Alwis commenting on the remarkable performance of Ceylinco General Insurance said  the premium income of our flagship brand Ceylinco VIP alone stood at a staggering Rs.9.9 billion, with Non Motor Insurance contributing an impressive Rs.6.2 billion, allowing the total premium income of Ceylinco General Insurance to record yet another fantastic year. Ceylinco General Insurance has maintained its unassailable lead. This is in the midst of stiff competition. What we have achieved in 2016, is all the more important, as the industry is not a level playing field, with government entities still enjoying distinct advantages. Despite such challenges, we have worked hard and worked together, and we have exceeded expectations, once again. Ceylinco General Insurance paid claims amounting to Rs. 10.4 billion during 2016. The sharp increase in claim settlement is a result of the large number of claims we paid, during the floods in May 2016. Claims were paid within a period of 14 days, enabling our customers to return to normalcy in the fastest possible time. Some customers had only insured their vehicles, but not their homes, while some had insured their shops, but not their houses. However, Ceylinco General Insurance, looking at the situation from a humane angle, decided to pay a percentage to compensate the damages to their homes as well.

CID seeks AGs  advice on Astrologer
The CID conducting investigations against the Astrologer Vijitha Rohana Wijayamuni for allegedly exciting feelings of disaffection for President Maithripala Sirisena, after making a prediction that the President would die on a particular day in January, informed Court that they have sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding future legal action against the suspect.
He is currently out on bail and further magisterial inquiry was fixed for April 4 by Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
The CID had arrested the suspect on January 31, over an offence he allegedly committed under Section 120 of the Penal Code and section 6 of the Computer Crimes Act after sharing a video on social media forecasting the death of the President on January 26 this year.
The CID informed Court that the first video released by the suspect predicted that the President would die on January 26 and later he posted another video proposing another date to that effect in a manner creating disaffection amongst the public. The suspect Vijitha Rohana Wijayamuni, a former naval officer, was found guilty for attempted murder, when he assaulted then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi during his visit to Sri Lanka in 1989 to sign the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord.
Section 120 of the Penal Code states: Whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs; or by visible representations, or otherwise, excites or attempts to excite feelings of disaffection to the President or to the Government of the Republic, or excites or attempts to excite hatred to or contempt of the administration of justice, or excites or attempts to excite the People of Sri Lanka to procure, otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any matter by law established, or attempts to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the People of Sri Lanka, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such People, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (01-03-2017)]
SLTB lacks strategic planning
It is no secret that the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is incurring heavy losses despite possessing the physical assets and the manpower, far in excess in terms of numbers, to run a better and more streamlined service.
In my view, what this ailing government-owned, service-oriented organisation lacks is strategic planning to tap the potential and rake in the revenue from identified viable routes.
There are loss-making routes, no doubt, but what about those where theres ample potential to make money and offset the losses to some extent, so that the SLTB can even, hopefully, breakeven There is a silver lining, and if theres a genuine effort made, it can be spotted amidst the dark clouds.
Let me cite examples of how the SLTB has virtually abandoned two lucrative routes, which even private bus operators find it difficult to service due to heavy commuter traffic.
Route No. 155 (Angulana-Mattakkuliya): There are no SLTB buses operated on this route despite this being the only bus service along the Galle Road which cuts across the Colombo University, Nelum Pokuna, University of Performing Arts, National/Eye Hospitals, Town Hall, Maradana, Armour Street, Kotahena and beyond.
Not only patients seeking OPD treatment plus visitors/employees of these two important hospitals, but also scores of university students depend on this only public transport link to their destinations. But the SLTB, in its wisdom, has completely abandoned this route. The end result is private busmen holding sway and operating jam packed buses with commuters balancing on the foot-board like acrobats. (This happens particularly at Bambalapitiya junction where train passengers also link up for their onward journey).
The SLTB Mattakkuliya depot injects some buses from Town Hall which serves no useful purpose at all, as by then, most of the passengers, including university students, have disembarked after a harrowing journey akin to Jews being transported to the gallows!
Route No. 154 (Angulana-Kiribathgoda): This again is the solitary link along Galle Road to Jawatte (SLBC/Rupavahini Corporation), BMICH, Borella and the Kelaniya University. The SLTB thinks if fit to operate a few buses from Bambalapitiya Railway Station. The route is overcrowded by the time they reach the junction (near MC).
While commuters, particularly women suffer the most with sex perverts also preying on them, the SLTB operates plenty of buses on the Galle Road to Pettah which invariably run half empty as 99% of the private buses on this route are also Pettah-bound.
It beats logic why the SLTB bigwigs cannot use their common sense and divert more buses to profit-making routes without washing their hands off and allow the private bus mafia to hold suffering commuters to ransom.
It there are joint timetables between the two service providers, surely they can be readjusted in line with passenger well-being because it is the prime responsibility of a government to ease the suffering of the masses.

Compensation for Welikada Prison Riot victims

The Committee appointed to investigate the Welikada Prison riot has recommended a sum of Rs. 2 million is paid to the families of 16 victims who lost their lives.
A further sum of Rs. 500, 000 will be paid to each victim that sustained injuries.
The Committee decided that compensation was unnecessary for 11 prisoners, as they were killed while trying to escape the prison.
The proposal to pay compensation to victims of the riot was put forward by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
The Welikada Prison riot occurred when prisoners took control of the prison after objecting to a Special Task Force search for hidden arms, drugs and mobile phones, on November 9, 2012.
Twenty-seven prisoners were killed in the resulting gun battle, 40 were injured.

CTCs 2016 performance highlights significant dip-in government revenue
Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) says that its contribution to Government revenue, through excise tax fell to Rs. 87.4 billion during the year ending December 31, 2016.
The company notes that the dip in its tax bill was a result of an unprecedented 43% price increase due to an excise increase in October and the introduction of 15% VAT in November.
The company delivered record excise gains for the government of Rs. 72.6 billion during the first 9 months, a 16% increase compared to 2015.
However, according to the companys full year results, government revenue from excise in the fourth quarter-fell by Rs. 13.2 billion compared to third quarter of 2016. It is anticipated that this will continue to impact both the companys and the governments revenue in 2017. As a result of the business impacts faced, the company closed 2 leaf depots and reduced factory shifts by a third, in early 2017.
With legally manufactured cigarettes becoming more expensive and unreachable to average consumers, the company warns that a large percentage of cigarette consumers would be forced to turn to smuggled cigarettes or cheaper substitutes such as beedi. As prices stand currently, smokers can purchase around 10 beedis for the price of one cigarette, while smuggled cigarettes are widely available for half the market price.
CTC notes that during the past year, law enforcement agencies have continued to work towards curtailing the spread of unauthorized and illicit tobacco products reaching the local market with a total of 1,842 raids.
However, based on the increase in the number of detections which have taken place since the price increase, the company notes that it is apprehensive that high prices in legal cigarettes has accelerated the influx of smuggled tobacco products.
Company results also indicate that expenditure in 2016 was greater than that of the same period of the previous year as a result of a 10% increase in raw material costs due to the rise in imported tobacco leaf.
Increased importation of leaf is a consequence of, among others, farmers being pressured to stop cultivating tobacco, and thereby putting the livelihoods of over 20,000 persons involved in the tobacco farming sector at risk.
The companys profit after tax stood at Rs. 12.56 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Dr. Asim testifies at Presidential Commission on CB Bond issue
The communication to issue the controversial Treasury Bonds on February 27, 2015 was made by the Monetary Board to the Public Debt Department, Additional Director of the Statistics Department of the Central Bank, Dr. Mohommad Zeid Asim said.
When asked if it was a request made by the Monetary Board, Dr. Asim said the information came only as a communication not a request or a direction.
He was testifying at the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday.
He also said the cash flow request was received only seven days before the auction took place.
Asim pointed out to the Presidential Commission that usually such a request would come ten days or two weeks before an auction.
He also said the request was dated February 20, 2015. However to the best of his Superintendents knowledge, it was received on February 23, 2015. He said, the original plan of the Public Debt Department was to use direct placement instead of the auction method at the questioned auction.
He also said the auction was planned by the Public Debt Department to be held on February 26, 2015.
However, the TOD wanted to have it on another day, which is February 27, 2015, Dr. Asim said.
Asked if the member from the Treasury was present at the Domestic Debt Management Committee meeting which was held before February 27, 2015, Dr. Asim said that the Treasury representative was absent in the referred meeting and the one following that.
He also said to the Commission that the Domestic Debt Management Committee had initiated on preparing the borrowing plan for the month of March, 2015 when the Monetary Board communicated to the Public Debt Department to conduct the 30 year Treasury Bond auction within a week.
It also pointed out to the Presidential Commission that certain heads of CBSL departments were transferred in February 2015 which is before the questioned treasury bond auction took place.
Asim has been the Additional Superintendent at the Public Debt Department of the CBSL until September 25, 2015.

Draft legislation on Truth Commission to Cabinet within next two months
Draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission is to be presented to Cabinet within the next two months, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera at the High-Level Segment of the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva yesterday.
Our resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm, asserted the minister as he delivered the progress report on Sri Lankas human rights and accountability mechanisms.
The government he said was also studying the report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, in the context of designing the relevant Mechanisms for Truth-seeking, Reparations, Justice, and other reconciliation processes. In August 2015, Sri Lanka co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 titled Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka, which was adopted unanimously by the Council on 1 of October 2015. Fifteen months later, the government returned to Geneva to list out what it had done during the extension given by the UNHRC.
Amidst allegations that the government has not done enough to promote reconciliation and accountability, Minister Samaraweera said; the forces of extremism and regression on both sides of the divide are creating road blocks for narrow, short-term political gain. While stubbornly refusing to acknowledge any of the far-reaching gains we have made in the last two years, they argue that we have either done too much or too little.
He however noted that recommendation of the GSP+ concessions from Brussels and MCC compact assistance from USA were in recognition of the progress made in Sri Lanka in the last two years.

The Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday ordered the Superintendent of Welikada Prison that former MP Duminda Silva be produced before Court on April 6 in connection with three corruption cases following a panel of medical experts observation that the accuseds health condition is fit to attend in Court sessions. On a previous occasion, the Additional Magistrate issued an order on the Director of the Colombo National Hospital that a medical report pertaining to the health condition of former MP Duminda Silva be obtained from a panel of medical experts.
The former Parliamentarian was not brought before Courts yesterday by prison authorities in connection with three corruption cases filed by Bribery Commission.
On a previous occasion, the Prison officials had informed Court that Duminda Silva was not fit enough to be brought before open Court even on a wheelchair.
On January 5, Former MP Duminda Silva was brought to the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court premises in an ambulance by prison authorities.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Parliamentarian had failed to declare his assets and liabilities in accordance with the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No.1 of 1975, for a period of three years since 2011 to 2013.

Earlier, defence counsel appearing for the former MP informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Atygala that his client was willing to plead guilty if the court would impose only a fine.
The Bribery Commission officials told Court that according to the Assets and Liabilities Law, the Court has jurisdiction to impose a fine of Rs.1000 with one year jail term for a person who found guilty to the charges. Subsequently, defence counsel informed Court that his client was not pleading guilty to the charges and moved for a trial.

Empty lobby
It is almost passing midnight. The lobby is nearly deserted by now. Though its dark, through the railing I could see the white waves of the sea. The humming of the waves never ceases. My untangled hair is dancing with the sea winds. I closed my eyes and listened. I feel as if my very soul is filled with the perpetual buzz of the sea.
Though imprisoned at the dark depth of my heart, the never fading face of him, flashed upon my inward eye, like a thunder bolt striking through the infinite sky. I remembered the moments spent together. Holding our hands we walked along the wet beaches under the starry sky, letting the unruly waves to cleanse our feet. Remembering the soft kisses placed upon my forehead and yearning lips, I woke up from the trance I was drowned in.
The lobby is entirely empty by now. I felt my blood being warm amidst the salty sea winds. A fiery sensation was over powering the frozen memories hidden at the corner of my heart. Once again after years, I longed to see his blank face with speaking eyes, to feel the warmth of his finger tips on my bare skin and to sense his gentle breath, wrapping me all over.
I heard the clock striking. It is midnight. The lobby is completely isolated. I walked up to the railing and climbed the stairs down to the beach. I could feel the moist of the sand beneath my feet. I let my feet to be soaked in the coldness of the waves, while by body was aching with the warmth of the cherished memories.

Federer fires on return from Melbourne heroics
Dubai: Roger Federer showed few signs of rust after a month off following his Australian Open heroics in sending Benoit Paire packing at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Monday.
Federer, chasing a record eighth title at the Dubai showpiece, outclassed the tetchy Frenchman 6-1, 6-3 in what was his first match since winning an 18th Grand Slam in January in Melbourne against Rafael Nadal.
The timeless Swiss, who had been unsure of his form and fitness following the layoff and a leg injury, is yet to lift an eighth title at any event having achieved seven in Dubai, Wimbledon, Basel, Cincinnati and at Halle.
"I'm happy with how I played, I was able to stay aggressive," the 35-year-old said. "I couldn't have had a better first-round start.
"There were some break points to be saved and I returned very well for a first round.
"The serve in the beginning was a bit off maybe, but I think also playing at night here for the first time it's always just a different ball when you toss it up with the lights, so that's going to get better as I progress in the tournament."
Federer, who has a training base in the UAE, defeated Paire for the fourth time without a loss with the Frenchman jeered for tossing a racquet in the second set as he was crashing to defeat.
Paire also had his ankle strapped trailing 4-1 in the opening set and then lost serve as Federer took a 5-1 lead.
The Swiss wrapped up the first set after less than 30 minutes with a service winner. The second set was equally one way as Federer went through in well under an hour before attending an ATP presentation on court to honour the 500-level Dubai event's quarter century.
"I missed playing here last year (knee surgery). I've played here for so many years, seen the tournament grow," said Federer, who is competing in the event for the 13th time.
"Especially after Australia, fans and myself know how special it is for me to be back on the court. It was a nice welcome."
Fourth seed Gael Monfils returned to Dubai for the first time since 2008 and advanced over Egyptian wildcard Mohamed Safwat, the number 199, 6-4, 6-3.
Spanish sixth seed Roberto Bautista Agut beat Russian hope Karen Khachanov 6-1, 7-6 (7/4) while 2014 semi-finalist Philipp Kohlschreiber moved to within two victories of his 400th career win after he defeated eighth seed Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) "To achieve my record would be great," the 33-year-old German said. "It would put me in the semi-finals.
"But I still have a few years to play on the tour so I'm pretty confident that I'm going to make 400-plus, hopefully." Spain's Marcel Granollers put out Czech Jiri Vesely 6-3, 6-2 while Guillermo Garcia-Lopez defeated Serb Viktor Troicki 6-4, 6-3. AFP

Festina lente: Sri Lankas story at UNHRC
When the national unity government came to power in January 2015, many believed it would be the end of the international communitys concerns over alleged war crimes and accountability mechanism.
Many international players pushing for accountability in Sri Lanka, including the US and the UK, had a friendly approach towards the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration as the new government claimed it was ready to ensure rights of all ethnic and religious minorities.
The term post-war accountability was anathema to the Rajapaksa government as its leaders were busy basking in the glory of triumphalism and Sinhala-Buddhist supremacy. Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, at one point, refused to even acknowledge that civilian parties were caused harm during the final phase of war.
Hope
It was in this context that the new governments rise to power gave off a glimmer of hope to the international community: Their faith was buttressed when the Sri Lankan government, in October, 2015, co-sponsored a resolution initiated by the US and a few other countries in order to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.
Co-sponsoring the resolution, however, was a great responsibility for the newly appointed Sri Lankan government. It was, in a way, a gamble in the local political domain.
By co-sponsoring the resolution, the Sri Lankan government unconditionally agreed to implement a number of proposals to ensure accountability and strengthen reconciliation, including the setting up of a special judiciary mechanism with the involvement of foreign judges and prosecutors.
The other commitments included the establishment of a commission for truth, justice, reconciliation and non-recurrence, an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and an Office for Reparation and to implement fully and credibly to advance accountability for serious crimes by all sides and help achieve reconciliation.
It was obvious that such commitments were hard to digest by the majority Sinhala-Buddhist voters who viewed the calls for accountability with suspicion. The issue of prosecuting members of the security forces over war crimes is a concern for the traditional Sinhala-Buddhist electorate. That was one reason why the government had to tread carefully on the accountability front.
Review
The progress made by Sri Lanka on the implementation of the recommendations made by the October 2015 session will be reviewed by the member nations and other international stakeholders at this months session of the UNHRC.
The biggest problem for the Sri Lankan government at the March UNHRC session would be its inaction on the hybrid judiciary mechanism to prosecute war crimes.
The government appointed a Consultation Task Force (CTF) on reconciliation mechanisms to seek public views and prepare a report last year. The Task Force, in January, this year, presented its report to the government with the setting up of a hybrid court with international judges as its main recommendation.
From the governments perspective, the establishment of a hybrid judiciary mechanism is a hard pill to swallow. It will give the ultra-nationalist camp supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa ammunition with which to attack the current administration on many fronts. It will also make the government highly unpopular with the Sinhala-Buddhist electorate that amounts to 69% of the total eligible voters in the country.
This concern has pushed the government to reject the Task Forces proposal for a hybrid court. Several key members of the government, including Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne, bashed members of the task force, calling them NGO members with agendas, just for recommending a hybrid court.
These remarks and the governments resistance to a hybrid judicial mechanism may cause problems for the Sri Lankan delegation, led by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, at the March session of the UNHRC.
Solutions
Another problematic area is the governments failure to formulate a political solution to the North and East problem. The key stakeholders of the problem, including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), have so far failed to arrive at a consensus on the nature of the political solution.
The slow progress with regard to the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), as promised in 2015, will also be an issue.
The Sri Lankan government to Geneva will have to justify the governments failure to make significant progress on the TRC front before the Council.
The issue of Police abuse may also be raised at the UNHRC session in March. Security sector reform was one of 25 undertakings by Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council resolution adopted by consensus in October 2015.
Human Rights Watch, an international human rights watchdog, has claimed that the Sri Lankan government has failed to repeal the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act or take serious measures to reduce torture in custody.
Its crucial that the Human Rights Council consider closely whether Sri Lanka made progress in the security sector as well as its other commitments such as transitional justice, said Brad Adams, Asia Director of the Human Rights Watch last week.
Nearly 18 months after making important promises to the council, Sri Lankas leaders appear to be backtracking on key human rights issues, including reforming the police.
The Minister of Law and Order, however, has embarked on a comprehensive programme to address the issues in the Police sector.
In November, last year, a new division was established under the provisions of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 to assist and protect victims of crimes and witnesses. SSP Jayantha Gunathilake was appointed the head of the new unit.
In addition, the government also introduced a code of conduct for Police officers, last year. The National Police Commission was appointed under the provisions of the 19th Amendment to strengthen the Police service and ensure checks and balances.
Aside from the progress on the law and order front, legislations such as the OMP and the RTI bills will help the Sri Lankan delegation convince the member nations of the UNHRC of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administrations will to implement a comprehensive mechanism for reconciliation and accountability.
Quite obviously, the Sri Lankan governments desired outcome at the March 2017 session would be to get the UNHRC to agree to a simple extension of time to implement reforms, claiming the government has already embarked on the process, but it needs time and space to proceed with it.
It has been reported that the Sri Lankan government may seek an extension of a further 18 to 24 months to implement the co-sponsored resolution. They will also call for financial support for the processes of this implementation.
However, it is important to understand that convincing member nations of the UNHRC to give the government more time and space will not be an easy task: This is the governments third year in power and various groups have been exerting pressure on the UNHRC to tighten its hold on Sri Lanka on the accountability issue.
There is the risk of a fresh resolution on Sri Lanka, to exert more pressure on the government to implement the recommendations of the previous with international monitoring.
Developments
In an important development, Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan, a key stakeholder of the UNHRC issue, met with a delegation of Senators from France at the Opposition Leaders office in the Parliamentary complex, on Monday.
At the meeting, Sampanthan briefed the delegation on the constitutional making process, stating that the new constitution should possess features that will give more powers to the provincial councils concerning matters of socio-economic development.
Commenting on the UNHRC session, Sampanthan stated that very little had been achieved on the UNHRC 30/1 resolution, which was cosponsored by the Sri Lankan government.
Sampanthan went on to state that an extension of time to the government to fulfill its commitment to the resolution should be granted only under strict conditions. He also asserted that the resolution should be implemented in its entirety and that the government should take all steps necessary to ensure reparations, guarantees of non-recurrence, accountability, and justice.
The France delegation comprised Marie-Christine Blandin, Senator of Nord Department, Chairwoman of the France-Sri Lanka friendship group, Mean-Marin Schuh, Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka, Mireille Jouve, Senator of Bouches-du-Rhone Department Patrick Chaize Senator of Ain Department, Olivier Delamare Debouteville, Senior advisor and Isabeele Miscot, Deputy Head of Mission of the Embassy of France.
Meanwhile, in a separate development, eight Parliamentarians of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have written to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) chief requesting him not to give more time to the Sri Lankan Government to address the accountability issue.
The TNA in the letter said that the UNHRC had already given the government ample time to address the accountability issue and has added that giving more time will set a bad precedent.
The letter was signed by TNA Parliamentarians S. Sritharan, S. Yogeswaran, C. Nirmalan, S. Adaikalanadan, K. Kodishwaram, S. Siddharathan, S. Viyalendran and S. Anandan.
Interestingly, TNA Leader R. Sampanthan, Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran and six other MPs had not signed the letter. They are of the belief that the UNHRC should only grant more time to the Sri Lankan government on a condition that it would be carried out with international monitoring. However, the statement by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera at the 34th session of the UNHRC, has outlined the Sri Lankan governments position. We expect the draft legislation on the Truth-Seeking Commission to be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers within the next two months. Our resolve to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations remains firm, his statement read.
While taking the allegations of continuing incidence of torture seriously, it is reiterated that the Government maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards torture as also demonstrated by the Presidents participation against torture last year. Although the National Human Rights Commission has recently indicated to us that there is a downward spiral of incidents, even one incident of torture is one too many. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, the Police Commission, the Ministry of Law & Order and other relevant agencies are working together to prevent and combat torture. As in many other areas, this too is an area in which we require technical assistance, and I hope that countries with experience in this area will come to our assistance.
Constitution drafting
The Constitution drafting process is for us both central and essential not only for democratisation, but also for ensuring non-recurrence of conflict. As this Council is aware, the Parliament of Sri Lanka, in April 2016, unanimously adopted a Resolution to prepare a draft Constitutional Bill for the consideration of Parliament. As we approach the 70th year of our nations Independence, we seek, for the first time in our countrys modern history, to engage in this process wholeheartedly as an exercise that would unite our people who have been divided for far too long.
The Parliamentary process and referendum are for us, imperative. We want to ensure that this Constitution, the 3rd Republican Constitution, unlike those before, that did not involve consensual and consultative processes, would reflect the true aspirations of our people.
An exercise where, after years of conflict, the executive, legislature and sovereign  that is the people of our country  will unite to define and chart our nations future, guaranteeing equal rights, justice, and dignity for all citizens, honouring the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-lingual character of our nation, upholding the right of citizens to participate more fully in decisions that impact their lives, and guaranteeing non-recurrence of conflict.
This statement by the Foreign Minister indicates that despite opposition, Sri Lanka will press ahead with its request to festina lente - make haste slowly to meets the goals set by the United Nations Human Rights Commission, in 2015.

GMOA to continue trade union action
The GMOA decided to continue their token trade union action on the SAITM issue since relevant authorities did not heed their demands, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Accordingly, doctors in the Sabaragamuva Province will launch a token strike today, he said.
We conducted strikes in the Southern, Eastern, North Central, Wayamba, and Central Provinces successfully, he said addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
However, the trade union action will not apply for emergencies and childcare, he said. The GMOA was compelled to take these steps since the Higher Education Minister and the Health Minister failed to take actions to safeguard island-wide patients, he said. We urge the President to direct the Health Minister to publish the gazette notification on the minimum criteria of medical education standards. But it has still not been done. The Health Minister has still not signed for the recommendations of the SLMC technical Committee appointed to advise him in this regard, he said.
The SLMC has to give conformity certificates for medical degree awarding institutions in Sri Lanka. However, the SAITM had not obtained the certificate, and the Higher Education Minster must clarify this situation immediately, he said.
We urge the President to take over the Health and the Higher Education ministries and take these steps in 24 hours if the subject ministers do not want to do that, he said.
In the SAITM case, an Additional Solicitor General from the Attorney Generals Department appeared for the Health Minister, but the AG has not appointed a lawyer for the SLMC, he said.

HIV among SL youth on the rise
New HIV infections among youths in Sri Lanka shows an upward trend around the past five years. Earlier it was among young adults around 30 and 35 but now this age has reduced to 20 to 25. Currently, 2,557 persons are living with HIV in Sri Lanka. A total of 239 new HIV infections were reported from Sri Lanka last year, Former Country Manager UNAIDS Sri Lanka Dr. Dayanath Ranatunga said.
According to Dr. Ranatunga, the main reason behind this negative upward trend is the lack of education and knowledge on reproductive health. Unfortunately, after several decades of hard work by many health professionals and other relevant professionals, schoolchildren and youths in Sri Lanka do not have a system / method to gain scientific education and knowledge on reproductive health. He was addressing the workshop on `Reproductive Health and Rights organised by the UNFPA in Colombo yesterday.
Dr. Ranatunga pointed out that the current percentage of teenage pregnancies in Sri Lanka is between five and seven percent (15,000) and this is too high. The main reason for this situation is also the same, which is lack of scientific education and knowledge on reproductive health and sex which is vital for all teenagers.
The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Sri Lanka stood at 2.09 in 2016 and the Infant Mortality Rate is nine per 1,000 live births. The Maternal Mortality Rate is 33 per 100,000 in 2015.
UNFPA Consultant Attorney-at-law Kamani Jinadasa said men having sex with men (MSM) have become one of the leading causes for rapidly increasing HIV infections.
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) will bring in new bills soon on cyber crimes on children.
In the recent past cyber crimes have led several Sri Lankan women and children to commit suicide.

Impartial discharge of duty by institutions will earn public esteem - CJ
No institution deserves to survive in a democracy unless it earns public esteem; and it can earn the public esteem only by discharging its duties impartially and expeditiously, said Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday as he bid farewell as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka.
Citing his own contributions to make the judiciary more efficient, he said during his time, he implemented many measures to expedite cases in courts and to reduce the number of arrears of cases.
As an initial step, three Supreme Court benches were constituted from December 2015 and the Judges were sitting at least four days a week. As a result of these tireless efforts of my colleagues 1,636 cases were disposed in 2016 as opposed to 783 cases in the year 2015. There were 1,508 cases instituted in 2015 and 1863 cases instituted in 2016, whereas only 574 and 1710 cases were instituted in years 2013 and 2014.
Judges serving in the Magistrates Courts, the District Courts and the High Courts were directed to take up trials on a day to day basis. Due to trials being taken up on a day to day basis and the consequential workload, the burden on the members of the staff became unbearable and the Judicial Service Commission more recently was able to fill the vacancies in the cadre for scheduled public officers. In addition, 23 High Court Judges were appointed during the last two years out of which, 21 judges are carrier judges. Three judges were also appointed to the Court of Appeal and one Judge to the Supreme Court during this period, said the CJ as he ticked off his achievements during his tenure. After career spanning 40 years, the CJ also took time to advise new lawyers entering the field with, what is required of the young lawyers at the Bar are punctuality, a clear head, a good memory, strong commonsense and an aptitude of analysis and arrangement. The success of the judicial process often depends on the services of the legal profession. Its nobility has to be preserved, protected and promoted. An institution cannot survive on its name or on its past glory alone, said CJ Sripavan and called for a better relationship between the Bench and the Bar rather than any element of arrogance and superiority on one side.
As a Judge, I tried my best to discharge my functions, but it is ultimately for the members of the Bar and the public to assess my contribution, if any, to restore the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the development of law in this country, added the retiring Chief Justice.

Jaliya Wickramasuriya case: Revision petition for bail fixed for objections
The bail revision petition filed by former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya challenging Colombo Fort Magistrates decision to refuse bail, was yesterday fixed for argument on March 13.
Meanwhile, the counsel appeared on behalf of the petitioner informed High Court Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne that they were expecting to file an amended revision petition on the next date. Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya arrested for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy, had been ordered to be further remanded till March 9 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. At a previous occasion, Jaliya Wickramasuriya was brought to the Court premises by prison officials in an ambulance and subsequently brought to the Court room in a hospital patient bed. Thereafter, he was ordered to be admitted to a private hospital.
Filing this bail revision petition in the High Court, Presidents Counsel Shavendra Fernando moved to revise the Fort Magistrates order to refuse bail for the suspect on a number of occasions.
The defence had moved Magistrates Court that the suspects health condition (heart patient) be also considered as an exceptional circumstance to release the suspect on bail.
While refusing to grant bail, the Magistrate further observed that the suspects health condition cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance since the Colombo National Hospital can provide treatment for such an illness.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the amount during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

JKH bags overall crown at ACCA Sustainability Awards
John Keells Holdings (JKH) won the overall crown of being Sri Lankas most transparent company at the ACCA Sri Lanka Sustainability Reporting Awards yesterday.
JKH also topped the Conglomerates and Diversified category, while Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) further etched its corporate stewardship by emerging Runner Up overall and winning the Retail and Trading category. In the banking category, Sampath Bank emerged the winner while HNB came in runner up, while Expolanka Holdings was the runner up in the Conglomerates and Diversified category.
Winning the Financial Services and Insurance category was Union Assurance with the Runner Up being Citizens Development Business Finance, while in the Retail and Trading sector Runner Up was American & Efird Lanka.
John Keells Hotels and Aitken Spence Hotel Holdings were adjudged Winner and Runner Up in the Leisure and Connected Services and Nawaloka Hospitals won the General Services and Utilities category. Seemasahitha Sanasa Rakshana Samagama was the winner in the SME category and Vidullanka PLC emerged Runners Up.
It is inspiring to see the private sector leading the way on sustainability and recognizing institutions that have excelled in their efforts.
The UN system looks forward to engaging further on implementing and achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda to ensure that we leave no one behind, UNs Resident Coordinator in SriLanka Una McCauley said. Adding to this, President of the Member Network Panel of ACCA Sri Lanka Adrian Perera, said that what the world needs is a true wholehearted action, not for short term profits. These days Sri Lanka is facing energy, water and a food crises. While the solutions are at hand, we continue to take the easy path.
For example, Sri Lanka is blessed to be surrounded by the Indian ocean but still continues to import fish products from overseas. This is similar with our energy, food and water issues. Speaking on behalf of the panel of judges, Franklyn Amerasinghe commended the reports that had made the grade, saying that each had succeeded in the primary judging criteria of the 3Cs of Completeness, Credibility and Communication and thus infused best practices in sustainability reporting which is imperative to operating a sustainable business.
The Awards Ceremony, now in its thirteenth year and each year works on a theme, this year highlighted Sustainability and its many facets, underlining six of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The fifteen awards presented across seven industry categories demonstrated a comprehensive coverage of the three fundamental pillars of sustainability, namely economic, social and environment and were selected from nearly sixty applicants.

JO spreading rumours to destabilise government: Mujibur
The Joint Opposition is trying to incite an army coup by spreading rumours that the government is on a witch-hunt against the war heroes, UNP backbenchers complained yesterday.
Addressing a press conference at Sirikotha, UNP MPs Mujibur Rahman and Wijayapala Hettiarachchi said the Joint Opposition is engaged in a conspiracy to turn the countrys armed forces against the government through provocations.
They said the series of protests in and around Colombo is an organised attempt by the JO to sabotage the Governments work. We observe the protests blocking the main roads have become a trend. Daily there is a protest at Fort obstructing the routine activities of the commercial hub. These protests have negative impact on the countrys economy. We understand that defeated political elements are behind instigating these protests, MP Rahman said.
In the past, the street protests were the last resort when problems could not be resolved through negotiation. However, today the government is unaware of the existence of such a problem as they have not attempted to discuss it prior to protesting, he said.
He stressed that the government would be forced to take stern decisions to control these protests, if the trend continues unabated.
The Joint Opposition tries to create an impression among the military and general public that this government is against the war heroes. This is clearly a politically motivated stance. They know they cannot grab power through elections. They have no alternative solutions to the problems the country is facing. Therefore they simply try to sabotage all the governments work, he said.
Commenting on the shooting incident in Kalutara yesterday targeting a prison bus, MP Rahman said the government should take stern action to cripple the activities of the underworld. The suspects should be identified and brought to book, he said.

Journey to heal our souls
In March our past and future will be debated at the Human Rights Council. The purpose of this piece is to argue we have sufficient knowledge and means to show acknowledgement of our past.
As a country as have many others internal strife has been part of our history. More recently two insurrections in the South and the other in the Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Each has left scores as victims and victimizers. Back In 1971, I woke up in London learning of an insurrection in Sri Lanka. After the JVP was proscribed in 1983 once more an underground movement became overtly violent by the late 1980s. The Youth Commission report thought it had shown us how to prevent future recurrences.
LLRC report
In the North and East several more Government Commissioned platforms heard victims and recommended action. Here are references in LLRC report commissioned by former President Rajapaksa relevant to this article about our last war -
1. Some specific instances of death or injury to civilians
4.286 - The Commission stresses that there is a duty on the part of the State to ascertain more fully, the circumstances under which such incidents could have occurred, and if such investigations disclose wrongful conduct, to prosecute and punish the wrong doers. Consideration should also be given to providing appropriate redress to the next of kin of those killed and those injured as a humanitarian gesture that would help the victims to come to terms with personal tragedy, both in relation to the incidents referred to above and any other incidents which further investigations may reveal.
2. Conclusions regarding the conduct of the Sri Lankan Security Forces during the movement of civilians and combatants into cleared areas
4.319 -The Commission must also stress in this regard that if a case is established of a disappearance after surrender to official custody, this would constitute an offence entailing penal consequences. Thus the launching of a full investigation into these incidents and where necessary instituting prosecutions is an imperative also to clear the good name of the Army who have by and large conducted themselves in an exemplary manner in the surrender process and when civilians were crossing over to cleared areas, which conduct should not be tarnished by the actions of a few.
3. Channel 4 video
4.377- The Commission therefore recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka institute an independent investigation into this issue with a view to establishing the truth or otherwise of these allegations and take action in accordance with the laws of the land. Equally, the Commission feels that arrangements should be made to ensure and facilitate the confidentiality and protection of information and informants.
5. Human rights
5. 6 -There is an urgent need to assist the victims and their families to overcome the trauma they suffered due to the conflict, and to bring the perpetrators of any human rights violations to justice. There is also the essential need to ensure that lessons from these past incidents be learnt in a manner that they will never be repeated again.
5. 37- Reconciliation is a process. Closure is the first difficult emotive step in that long and complex journey irrespective of whether they are victims of conflict or victims of LTTE terrorism. This will also enable them to seek appropriate legal remedies including compensation.
6. b Reconciliation
8. - The development of a vision of a shared future requires the involvement of the whole of society. Acknowledging the losses and suffering of the past and providing mechanisms for recompense, social justice and for restoration of normalcy and expressions of empathy and solidarity, are steps aimed at redress.
8.149 Since reconciliation is a process and not a onetime event, the efforts towards that objective should be continuous and broad based whilst being fully supported by the elected Government.
Healing of personal and communal memories
In the words of Fr. Michael Lapsley the first step is for all of us to admit that we are a damaged people. I believe that we need a new national conversation to speak about our pain. We need a new language in which we can begin to speak about what we are still carrying deep within us that is still infecting us. We need to learn to listen to one another.
Whilst we speak about our pain we also need to build a moral society. However it does not help if we push an idea of family which excludes the reality of millions of our fellow citizens. We need to accept that many people live in patchwork families where there are single parents, as well as those where children have two fathers or two mothers. The question is how can our patchwork families with all their variety be supported to be places of care, love and nurture where our children can flourish and be secure.
He continues by asking, is it well with your soul Is it well with the soul of this nation Have our deepest wounds healed What about each of us here today, not to mention our fellow citizens Are we at peace with everything that has happened to us in our lives How much have our lives been shaped and misshaped by not only what happened to us but also to our parents and grandparents and great grandparents and our wider families
I argue we know enough to acknowledge our victims and acts of victimisers. A sample of a massive body of literature available is quoted here. We must invest on our people ourselves.
The moral injury to lives and the spiritual injury due horrendous brutal acts have to be acknowledged by wider society and not only by a section if we are to truly reconcile and prevent future relapses.

The Kalutara carnage
It appears that the term gun culture thuwakku sanskruthiya that was coined during the second JVP uprising in relation to the mindless killings that took place at the time via the then ubiquitous T56 could have relevance today too in this country, given the gruesome nature of the bloodletting we are witness to which has a resemblance to that which took place in the late eighties. Hardly a day passes without a killing in some corner of this country, a majority of which are contract killings either due to business rivalry or deep seated enmities. But surpassing all these are the gangland killings that takes place with regular monotony, with the use of the still handy T56.
Monday saw the most serious of these tit for tat killings where a prison bus was ambushed by a group said to belong to rival gang of one of the inmates who was being transported from the Kalutara Prison to the Kaduwela Magistrates court. It is the audacious nature of the attack, which, no doubt, would have shocked, not just the general public, but the law enforcement agencies as well. One recalls attacks of the nature that took place on Monday only in connection with bheeshanaya era where the armed wing of the JVP overran well guarded armouries, not to mention, attacks carried out on vital government installations.
In a well planned operation, carried out, with almost military precision, the armed gang ambushed the prison bus, their target - a rival gang leader. The prison bus is said to have come under a hail of T56 fire killing some of the inmates in the initial firing. The gang had then boarded the prison bus, dragged their target out on to the footboard and fired at him until he was pulp. A prison officer and a jailer too perished in the attack, after which, the assassins left in a getaway vehicle leaving behind the carnage, reminiscent of a blockbuster Hollywood gangster movie.
As usual the buck is sought to be passed. The Police spokesman says there are times when the police is called upon to provide escort to prison vans while at the same time saying that prison officers too have been provided with equal police training to meet with any contingency. However in this instance the prison officers were not equal to the task and, what is more, two of their men perished in the shooting while five others were injured, two of them critically. It is said that the prison officers too had fired at the attackers but that the gang fled.
This shows that they (prison officers) were not up to the challenge. It is not clear if the prison authorities had requested for police security in this instance. If not, it is indeed a glaring lapse, considering the nature of the mission. This is because the gang leader Samayang, in fact, was a high risk prisoner, on whose life an attempt was made earlier inside the same court premises.
This should have made the Kalutara Prison authorities seek police escort for the prison bus, particularly considering, the route which the vehicle was to take was through a jungle patch where the assailants had lain in wait. The Police, for its part, considering the risk involved, should have been more circumspect and deployed a police contingent to escort the Prison bus.
As usual, the police say it has deployed a number of teams to hunt down the killers and that some progress had already been made. The public will hope that the attackers will be eventually apprehended and brought before justice.
Mondays incident is no doubt going to be a challenge to IGP Pujith Jayasundera who has vowed to confront the underworld when he took office one year ago. But during this time a series of killings have taken place, both, gangland killings and contract killings. The same day the Kalutara incident took place the owner of a Wine Stores in Kurunegala was gunned down, although the motive was said to be robbery.
The police, today, is without the burden of war duties, as before, and should concentrate all its energies to combat serious crime. True, it has made several breakthroughs in some of the more prominent cases and apprehended the perpetrators. But the crime rate keeps on mounting, and, if the Kalutara incident is anything to go by, dangerous criminals are still on the loose, posing a grave threat to society.
The IGP should, hence, take special measures to bring the situation under control. A hunt should be carried out for illegal firearms, because, from what is witnessed, a large number of T56 and other illegal firearms are still in circulation. According to reports, the firing at the prison bus had been a professional job and there can be little doubt that those with a good weapons training had been among the attackers. The presence of army deserters among the assassins, therefore, cannot be ruled out which could also be a pointer to the source of the T56 weapons used, all amnesties to recover such weapons notwithstanding.

Lanka tour will showcase how far we have progressed  BD captain and coach
Captain Mushfiqur Rahim and coach Chandika Hathurusingha both expressed the view that the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka by Bangladesh was another opportunity for them to show the world how far they have progressed in international cricket.
Of late Bangladesh widely regarded as the minnows and as easy beats in international cricket has made vast strides towards erasing that title bestowed on them by opposing teams.
Former Sri Lanka cricketer Chandika Hathurusingha now coach of Bangladesh addressing the press conference held at Taj Samudra yesterday.  
However in the past three years under the guidance of Hathurusingha Bangladesh have proved more than a handful for any side especially in their own conditions.
The conditions in Sri Lanka are not going to be any different to what they experience at home and with the know-how of Hathurusingha as head coach and a few other past Sri Lankans in the teams support staff that includes Thilan Samaraweera (batting coach) and Mario Villavarayen (trainer) Bangladesh can fancy their chances on recording their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka.
You can have all the support staff you want and the knowledge of the opposition. It also brings a lot of pressure because what is important is that the players must take that to the middle and perform, said Mushfiqur at the media conference held at Taj Samudra yesterday.
You could say that we have a better chance of winning on this occasion than in the past because some of Sri Lankas top batsmen have retired and they are somewhat an inexperienced side going through a period of team rebuilding. We know beating Sri Lanka in their conditions is not easy. They showed that against the Australians recently, he said.
Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lanka cricketer and coach said that Sri Lanka has helped Bangladesh cricket progress in various ways. We have played more Test matches against Sri Lanka than against any other country. Bangladesh is today in the same position as Sri Lanka was when I was playing. This tour will give us a chance to show how far we have come in cricket.
Our preparations are no different to any other team. If we play to our potential we should have a very good chance. We are not taking Sri Lanka lightly, he said.
Hathurusingha said that he held no grudges against Sri Lanka for being ditched as coach six years ago. I have no regrets for what happened a long time ago. I am disappointed that I couldnt help my country but I am happy with what I am doing now.
Sri Lanka captain Rangana Herath said the Bangladesh series was another challenge against a team that is in the stages of rebuilding.
If we perform to our potential we will win. I have the utmost confidence in my batsmen that they will deliver, said Herath who led an inexperienced Sri Lanka side to a 2-0 win in Zimbabwe in his first stint as Test captain in November last year.
Commenting on the inclusion of left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara in the Sri Lanka Test squad for the series, Herath said that any bowler taking over 50 wickets a season regularly has to be good.
He has come a long way and he deserves to be included. Whether he will play in the series I cannot say. I am also a left-arm spinner like him and we have to strike a balance in the team. If he doesnt play in this series I am sure he will get an opportunity in the next, said Herath.
Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford said that one of the key areas that had affected the teams performance has been fielding and every effort is being made to address that shortcoming. We have a program in place where the boys are taught the basics in fielding techniques from the under 19 age group so that they will ready when they reach the senior level.
There is no quick fix to it. Fielding also includes speed, agility and fitness, said Ford.
Bangladesh open their tour with a two-day warm-up game at Moratuwa on March 2 and 3 before moving to the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle starting on March 7.

MAGIC ON STRINGS
The violin symbolizes Ananda Dabere, our own home-grown wizard on strings who has reached the dizzy heights over the last years. Directing The KRASHNA Chamber Ensemble, he was joined by Jude Pieris, a renowned classical guitarist as the soloist
Mozarts works are identified by their K or KV number. He wrote enormous number of scores so difficult for one to keep track that made conductors a huge question to make a choice for a performance. The unlimited variety for the instrument and voice spin the head. Most sonatas, symphonies, and chamber music were written in accordance with basic structure of four movements; ie; fast, short and light. Without doubt the advancement of the sonatas and symphonic forms were at their best. It was Mozart who raised opera to new heights.
Therefore, we must understand that conductors like Ananda Dabere have to reach out within the format of such establishment. They must pick the best for orchestration.
Ananda Dabere did gloriously right in the contemporary space of the Lionel Wendt theatre though not the perfect venue for stretching out, for this 40+ the ensemble, rose shattering the silence.
What sets him apart from the rest of the violinists is the art of his handling melodies laden with emotion and the aspects such as counterpoints and orchestration without effort.
Electing to play symphony No. 40 in G Minor (K550), he exploited all the potential for strings that Mozart originally scored for the piano. With its wonderful elegiac fragility of tone, there were gasps of rapture, applauded with delight.
JOAQUIN RODRIGO - Spain has never been more famous in traditional romantism in the last century than when her talented sons classic, CONCIERTO DE ARANJUEZ, 1939. He and his Turkish pianist wife, Victoria Kamhi moved from Paris to the little town of Aranjuez outside Madrid in 1939 after spending decades in Paris. The guitar concerto he named after this town become the favourite of the Spansih. It made him more that a great composer but a hero when they realised that Rodrigo was blind from the age of three but so in love with his country. All his works were notated and played through by his wife whose patience was his motivation and determination to get him where he is. Sangria was there and also the nostalgia and beautiful ADAGIO.
It is of great surprise that Rodrigo was not a guitarist though he composed one of the greatest scores for the guitar. He was a student of Paul Dukas known for his compositions on the French Horn and Piano and scored the famous THE SCORERERS APPRENTICE that may have influenced Rodrigo,
In the vicinity of all these. Dabere opted to present Rodrigo to the Lankan audience who have never heard him on this soil.
It was homage to this classical guitarit from our virtuose conductor, Ananda Dabere
The evening programme had Jaaquin Rodrigos SE ARANJUEZ.
01. ALLEGRO CON SPIRIT02. ADAGIO03. ALLEGRO
JUDE PEIRIS - Soloist - I was seeing and listening to him at the guitar for the first time and realized that guitar solo can stand up to any other instrument or even to a Symphony Orchestra. Such was his brilliance, this lecturer from the University of Performing Arts, Colombo. Caressing those strong strings gently and softly when it mattered, he rose to heights on a single guitar that is a weak-toned instrument as against an orchestra but marvelously strumming a score that was initially for four guitars. He was ably suppored by the Krashna Chamber Ensemble.
WOLGANG AMADEUS MOZART - Daughter, Parveen who sat next to me said she was sick of listening to Mazart at every orchestration and came only to listen to classical guitarist, Jude Pieris play Joaquin Rodrigo. I was in no mood to argue with her and let her through rest at that.
Tonights programme had Mozarts Symphony No. 40 in G minor (k. 550) in four movements. All apart from ANDANTE, were noisome and boisterous without as much as a sigh in between while the gentle Ananande Dabere conducted with vigor.
Arguably the most gifted composer in history. He is played often, every where, every time and all the time but with such accepted eagerness that there is no classical music spirit like his. There was never a child prodigy in music history to rival Mozart when at four years of age, he was playing Bethovens violin Sonata. Wrote the first symphony when he was eight. That was a miracle his father could not comprehend. He wrote his last symphony when he was thirty two.
Among his essential works,he composed :27 piano concertos4 Horn concertos2concretos for bassoon2concretos for clarinet and orchestra200 plus among chamber works for strings16 plus settings of the mass41 SymphoniesRELIGIOUS :- MusicAve verum corpus K 616Exsultate, jubiate, K165Laudate dominum (a setting for Psalm 116)Mass No. 18 in C minor great K 427Mass No 19 in D minor Requiem K 626and unlimited Opera.
BEDRICH SMETANA - Mein vaterland No. 2 Moldau the composition played tonight is better known VATAVA his celebrated works in dedication to his homeland especially the bustling Moldau river that flows through Prague. It is the second of six tone-poems that are symphonic.
Played by a pair of swirling flutes the work is all about its sources, Springs of the Moldau, joined by energetic clarinets and played on strings in swirling harmonies, a faourite among tonights audiences,. Clearlya wonderful score.

At the retirement of Chief Justice K. Sripavan, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), Geoffrey Alagaratnam asked that positions to the higher echelons of the judiciary be made through emphasis on undoubted merit and competence rather than experience alone.
Delivering the ceremonial farewell to the Chief Justice yesterday, the BASL President recommended that identified criteria be introduced to accommodate competence and merit through judicial audit or other mechanisms.Reliance on mere seniority for entitlement or promotions though perhaps a relevant criterion cannot and should not be a compelling basis. My Lords, maturity and wisdom we hope does come with age but it is not always necessarily so. Sometimes years only confers old age, said Alagaratnam.
With the recent clash between the BASL and the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) over the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court judge, based on the recommendation of the former, Alagaratnam took the opportunity to point out that the JSC needed to be more broad based as an independent body to include several other stake holders such as the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, the President of the Bar Association and perhaps representatives of other responsible civil society organizations. Such is also towards greater transparency in the matter of handling of matters related to tenure, promotions and disciplinary control over the minor judiciary in acknowledgement of the fact that the Judiciary serves and should represent the interests of society and is not an exclusive secret enclave shrouded in mystery. The enactment of the recent Right to Information Act should buttress and emphasize the need for transparency and openness, he said.
The BASL also praised Chief Justice Sripavan for having stepped forward in tumultuous times to try and instill integrity and confidence once again in the judiciary.
With new constitutional amendments set in place since CJ Sripavan took over, Alagaratnam observed that while these amendments helped secure the independence of the judiciary, constitutional or legal safeguards mean little unless the people within the structures and who work them do so with dignity and responsibility.
He also thanked the CJ for promoting a strong Bar and that the Bar itself needed to be seen as an equal partner with the judiciary.
As he wished for greater Judicial and professional independence, integrity and dignity in future, Alagaratnam said that he along with CJ Sripavan would soon step down from his post as President of BASL.
After all is said and done My Lord, the Chief Justice, it must be said that you did exercise dignity, patience, transparency, humility and consistency together with the required authority when discharging your functions on the Bench, quite in contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed under a few dispensations before you assumed office as Chief Justice, he added.

MR thanks MS for appointing Presidential Committee
Former President and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for having appointed a Presidential Committee to investigate into the controversial Treasury Bond scam.
Addressing a meeting at Diyatalawa, Rajapaksa said, Ranil keeps talking of the debt we left to the current government and that he is buried by it. But the papers now say that they tried to get the gazette to say that it was during my time that the Central Bank needed to borrow so much. I was gone by January 8, 2015, the gazette notification was printed a year later. It was lucky that the President appointed this committee. If not they would try to blame me for this as well, the former President said.
The Presidential Committee to investigate the bond scam is currently looking into the various procedures which led to the issuance of the bonds.
They are to visit the Central Bank today to observe the manner in which the Treasury bonds were issued.

Multiple celebrations for Niriella
Senior playwright and brainchild of Janakaraliya aka Makkal Kalari, Parakrama Niriella marked a significant chapter in his life this February. His masterpiece stage drama Sekkuwa celebrating its 40th birth anniversary and Janakaraliyas dignified completion of 15 years coincided with a felicitation to the maestro done in India.
Rangayana Drama and Theatre Institute at the Bahuroopi International Theatre Festival 2017 in Mysore, India felicitated Parakrama Niriella for the contribution made by him via Janakaraliya towards nurturing human relationships.
The Sri Lankan mobile theatre Janakaraliya is a multi-ethnic platform to share values, customs, traditions and cultures via drama, irrespective of one's religion, race, language or caste.
An event held at the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo subsequently to these multiple celebrations felicitated three sets of artistes contributed to Sekkuwa since 1976. A bonus for the audience was the opportunity to witness the newest version of Sekkuwa drama staged by Janakaraliya team.
Prior to staging Sekkuwa, literature and drama critic Sugath Watagedera and veteran journalist Kusal Perera made speeches. Sugath Watagedera said 1976 version of Sekkuwa was special because it shed light on political developments in the 1970s.
Gunadasa Amarasekera called the string of political dramas made in 1970s Papadam Dramas but Sekkuwa didnt belong to this category. Marxist ideologies were at its best in this era.
Niriellas Sekkuwa made emphasis on a machine used in the Colonial era called Sekkuwa or Oil Press. It is a manual machine used to extract oil from Copra. It made the operator rotate at one place without moving further. In the drama, Rala was the underprivileged folk who operate Sekkuwa while the owner of Sekkuwa, Mahathena or Lord was the rich man. The Lord takes loans from a rich country depicted as Otherworld in the drama.
Sekkuwa communicated the message; After winning independence in 1948 we still rotate at one place while making a particular segment in the society to enjoy all luxuries in life. Even today our country is stuck with foreign loans and the similar situation prevails, said Watagedera.
He added, Sekkuwa drama is made according to Sokari style and folklore is used to enrich the story.
Prof Sarachchandra made Maname based on Nadagam style. Niriella used Sokari and Kolam styles to make Sekkuwa. Further he blended the drama with attributes of Street Drama style championed by late Gamini Haththotuwegama.
Sekkuwa thus was made to be shown in New Arena style theatres where spectators could see it from four sides. Parakramas dramas; Sekkuwa, Charandas, Meti Karaththaya are made to be shown like this.
Niriella eventually ventured the television and cinema spheres and did noteworthy contributions to those spheres, said Watagedera.
Veteran journalist Kusal Perera said Sekkuwa drama brought to fore a clear political discussion via a common villager projected as Rala craving for a Sarubima or Greener Pastures.
Leftist ideology carried a significant influence to local Art sphere in the 70 decade thus artistes couldnt keep a blind eye to this scenario. R R Samarakone's Idama, Sugathapala Silvas Dunna Dunugamuwe and Niriellas Sekkuwa were dramas made in this context that sent vibes within the society. These dramas carried leftist ideology but they were made for the masses to watch and enjoy.
However those days Nationalistic ideas always revolved around Sinhala community thus other communities were sidelined. Even Rala in Sekkuwa projects hardships experienced by an underprivileged Sinhala community.
By 1978 Sri Lanka embraced an Open economic system. After 1978 a globalised economic system was adapted by many countries in the world including our country. After a decades time, Socialist system came to an end in the world thus Ralas craving for greener pastures with leftist ideology in Sekkuwa was challenged, said Perera.
He continued, When I watched Sekkuwa in 2010, I saw a difference in the drama. Parakrama with Janakaraliya team by this time had added a new part to the drama. They brought Rala to the present glittering context. Ralas attire now was different and he associated with a different society.
Market economy prevailing in the present context is based on consumption and makes emphasis on development. It doesnt make room for people to have a cultural life. We in this context do not have freedom and leisure to associate with culture or Art like earlier. Today we are on a rat-race. Reality shows on TV provide and instant enjoyment to reduce stress. In an economy that caters to fulfil consumers needs and wants with products and services, Parakrama Niriella still goes places with his Janakaraliya team. His efforts are being commended from quarters here and abroad that identify the value in them, concluded Kusal Perera.

Olga Korbut sells Munich medal collection
Los Angeles: Legendary gymnast Olga Korbut has sold her collection of medals won at the 1972 Munich Olympic games among a sale of memorabilia at an auction in the United States, auctioneers said Monday. Korbut, 61, captured the imagination of the sporting world with her spellbinding displays in Munich before competing at the Montreal Games four years later.
The Arizona-based former Soviet gymnast sold her medals through Heritage Auctions after falling on hard times, according to reports in Russia.
The sale of seven lots -- which included two golds and a silver from Munich -- raised around $230,000 (217,000 euros), the auction house said.
Her team gold raised $66,000. The other gold sold was her individual floor exercise medal.
Korbut's other individual gold medal, for the balance beam in Munich, was not part of the sale because it was stolen previously.
Korbut's groundbreaking displays in Munich were credited with widening the appeal of gymnastics around the world, with the diminutive Belarusian star known as the "Sparrow of Minsk" also changing the way athletes from behind the Iron Curtain were viewed. AFP

Peterites go out as firm favourites
The clash of the 83rd Battle of the Saints cricket encounter between St. Peters College Bambalapitiya and St. Josephs College Maradana for the Rev. Fr. Maurice Le Goc Challenge Trophy will be played at the P. Sara Oval on Friday and Saturday.
Of the 82 matches played so far the Peterites have won on 10 occasions.
According to form of the two teams St. Peters led by dashing batsman cum Sri Lanka national under 19 player Lakshina Rodrigo who is the son of famous cricketer Priyalal Rodrigo, will be coming into this game full of confidence and with a slight edge as they are unbeaten having recorded five outright wins against St, Marys College, Kegalle, St. Anthonys College Wattala, St. Sebastians College Moratuwa, St. Benedicts College, Kotahena and Maris Stella Negombo.
The Peterites posses a strong batting line up and they have four centurions in their side. Rodrigo tops the batting average and has scored over 900 runs this season while Santhush Gunathilake is the highest run getter for Peters with a tally of over 950 runs. They will be the mainstays of the Peterite batting department.
The other top scorers are Shalith Fernando close to 750 runs, vice captain Manelker de Silva 650 runs, Anishka Perera 500 plus runs, Ranmith Jayasena 400 runs and Vinul Gunawardena close to 350 runs will be expected to contribute and bolster the Peters scoreboard.
There is no shortage of armour in their bowling attack too and they will be banking heavily on two bowlers left-arm spinner Mohammad Ameen Miflal their top wicket-taker with over 100 scalps and off-spinner Chathura Obeysekara who has taken over 75 wickets. They have plenty more in the spinning department with off spinner Sachin Silva who has taken nearly 30 scalps along with Santhush Gunathilaka 30 wickets and Manelker de Silva 20 to give the senior duo the backing in the bowling department.
St.Peters will be once again coached by their 1998 captain who scored a breathtaking 159 in the big match and Sri Lanka national cricketer Malinda Warnapura, who guided them to a sensational double by winning both the big match and the limited over encounters convincingly under all-rounder Vinu Mohotty last year.
Warnapura said, We have won five games this year due to having a balanced side with skipper Lakshina and Santhush leading the way in the batting department. We are also lucky to have a fabulous bowling coach in Crishantha Peiris who knows our pulse and the legacy of our college being a Peterite himself. He has produced three wicket-taking match winners in spinners Ameen who has got 100 wickets under his belt, Chathura 75 scalps and Sachin 30 wickets. This is the main reason we have recorded five outright wins. We will give our everything against the Joes to finish on a high.
An outcome of the match will depend on who will have the upperhand of scoring more runs in the first innings due to the 60 overs restriction.

Phelps frustrated by Rio doping fears
Washington: US swimming legend Michael Phelps has spoken of his frustration at the possibility rivals were using drugs at last years Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Phelps, in written testimony released ahead of his appearance on Tuesday at a US congressional hearing into drug use in sport, said he and teammates were left wondering whether they were competing on a level playing field in Rio.
It followed a build-up to the Games dogged by drugs scandals and revelations of a state-backed Russian doping program across multiple sports.
Rio was also unique because of increased doping concerns, Phelps wrote in his statement.
In the year leading up to the Games there was uncertainty and suspicion. I along with a number of other athletes signed a petition requesting that all athletes be tested in the months prior to the Games.
Unfortunately, the uncertainty remained even through the Games and I watched how this affected my teammates and fellow competitors.
We all felt the frustration, which undermines so much of the belief and confidence we work so hard to build up to prepare for the Olympics.
Phelps, 31, retired from swimming after Rio, his fifth Olympics, adding five more gold medals to boost his all-time tally to 23.
The American superstar said the suspicion that some rivals throughout his career were cheating had consistently rankled him.
Throughout my career I have suspected that some athletes were cheating and in some cases those suspicions were confirmed, Phelps wrote.
Given all the testing I and so many others have been through I have a hard time understanding this... I cant adequately describe how frustrating it is to see another athlete break through performance barriers in unrealistic timeframes, knowing what I had to go through to do it.

The lost village
Only in my dreams I see my village nowThe one I saw six decades agoWhere is the lane from the main roadTo the winding river at the villages endIts been replaced by a carpeted roadWhich looks very busy during the day.Small houses with big gardens aroundIs a rare sight in my village now.Instead, we see clusters of cottagesSurrounded only by small lands.They are covered with potted plantsNot with the bushes and trees of the village.More than anything that I missIs the lovely breeze that blew through my villageRich with the scent of the village floraCooling and refreshing, how I loved it then!Hot winds which sweep through concrete floorsAre the ones that kiss the villagers now.

Long live our dear old school
Dear mother Princess after many decadesWhen I look back while passing your wayThe building is the same appearance not changedTears drop from cheeks will the building tooWhite uniform, tie, white socks and shoesSmartly we walked in with books in handSunshine or rain we never feltBoth were equal our bodies never fadeThe stairway is the same though now cannot climbWe used to hop, skip with two to three jumpsThe classroom is the same, same old windows and doorsChildren have changed the school is the sameThe yellow and red huge trees still bear flowersThe floor below is covered red and yellow petalsOn same petals, they walk on once we didThe drains and the roadway doth run the sameWe have grown old, but not you dear motherYou will live centuries without an end of lifeWe bid farewell at our journey to heavenYou weep for us, there standing  Princess

Hunger games
There I was sitting in my car - looking at the blue ocean.The Rising sun was bright - bringing with it the day's warmth.Here I wait - until my phone rang.To be of service - to my mum and dad.No breakfast - only the morning tea.Hungry I was - as hungry could be.Five-star hotels at my back - with all their glamour.Yes, I can afford - in this manner.My hand went to the car key - ready to ignite the engine.When a skinny little girl - knocked on my windshield.She wore an old shalwar - torn and soiled.Her hand was pointing at me - asking for kindness.Then she took her hand - towards her mouth.Indicating she's hungry - and whether I could help.Her lips were dry - and hair untidy.I rolled my shutter - and gave her a fifty.She thanked me - with a slender smile.And went off - and joined a group nearby.Five cars away from mine - was an ice cream truck.My eye's turned teary - with my heart pounding a touch.She held two ice creams - giving one to a smaller girlwho was holding on to her dress.There I was still - sitting in my car.The five-star hotels - still where they are.But my hunger left me - remarkable it was.Guilt and happiness were filling - and unstoppable it was.Look at our country's disparity - I thought to myself.I know it's normal - I know we all think the same.

Rajitha orders all prison hospital doctors transferred
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered the Deputy Director General (Medical Services 11) Dr. Amal Harsha De Silva to transfer all doctors attached to the Prison Hospital, a Health Ministry spokesman said.According to the Spokesman, Minister Dr. Senaratne had given this order to Dr. De Silva during the meeting of Institutional Heads held at the Health ministry on Monday.
Earlier one doctor attached to the Prison hospital was transferred due to various complaints received against him in connecting with the support given by him to certain politicians to get admitted to the Prison Hospital. But the officials informed Minister Dr. Senaratne that the said doctor is still in the hospital without accepting the transfer given to him, he said.
Considering all facts Minister Dr. Senaratne gave the new order and also instructed Dr. De Silva to take disciplinary action against the doctor who ignored the transfer given to him, he added.

Ranjan, Anuruddha in fisticuffs
The Divulapitiya Pradesheeya Sabha Coordinating Meeting was suspended amidst much commotion yesterday as an argument between Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Gampaha District MP Indika Anuruddha led to a scuffle.
The meeting was called at 3pm under the oversight of Ramanayake and Western Provincial Councillor Chandana Jayakody, who are co-chairmen of the committee. Divisional Secretary, H.M.L.S. Herath involved in the Akaragama earth excavation incident was also present.
At 5pm, however, discussions turned to the granting of licences to sand, clay and rock mining. Ramanayake then brought up the incident of sand mining in Waraadala and questioned Kotadeniyawa Police OIC D.D. Wickramasinghe on it. The OIC replied that he had raided the place and that a report on it had been forwarded to the District Secretariat through the Negombo Police Director.
In this instance, Anuruddha mentioned that the committee had received many petitions prior to this too and it was just rumours that those who have been granted the licence to mine 500cm3 were mining 60,000 cm3. With the latter being a statement made by the President in the soil excavation case in Divulapitiya, Ramanyake asked Anuruddha not to speak about it as none could counter the Presidents statement. Anuruddha, however, insisted that he would speak on the matter to which Ramanayake reminded that it was he who was chairman of the meeting. Ramanayake added that he would continue to speak on behalf of the Divulapitiya people and that 48 people have thus far been killed due to the case and that he would not mind being the 49th. The Deputy Minister also took a swipe at Anuruddha to allege that he too was hand in glove with the illegal miners.
He asked that the MP make the statement that he took Rs 14 million for soil excavation, which he made under cover of privileges in Parliament, at the meeting. This fired up an argument between the two which led to supporters from both sides rushing into the aid of the other and causing fisticuffs. The police, ministerial security, Councillor Chandana Jayakody, MP Edward Gunasekara tried their best to separate the two. The fight lasted for around 45 minutes by which time meeting was suspended.

Ranjan Madugalle: Proud that traditions, values and spirit are still upheld
Ranjan Madugalle is a name synonymous around the world for his role as the chief ICC match referee a position which all Sri Lankans are proud of. A product of Royal College, Madugalle had a distinguished career at school captaining them in the Centenary Match against traditional rivals S Thomas College Mt Lavinia in 1979. An accomplished top order batsman Madugalle later went onto represent and captain his country at international level before retiring rather prematurely at the age of 29.
A few excerpts from him ahead of the 138th Royal-Thomian cricket match that commences at the SSC grounds on March 9.
Q: What led you to take up to cricket at Royal
RM: I grew up in a home which always had a ball around. So, if it was not cricket, it would have been rugby or tennis. I had my formative education at Trinity College, Kandy and thats where I learned the basics. I moved to Royal College when I was 11 and cricket just flowed on from there. The first XI cricketers at that time at Royal were players like Asitha Jayaweera, Jagath Fernando, and Gajan Pathmanathn. They were the ones that inspired our generation of cricketers at Royal.
Q: Comparing preparations for and during a season for a cricketer during your era whats different now
RM: The first thing that strikes me is the amount of matches that a young schoolboy cricketer now plays during a season. In our time, we played a maximum of around 12 games whereas todays schoolboy cricketer plays around 20-25. Thats a lot of cricket for a young man as I firmly believe that there should be adequate breaks/rests between games so that he has the opportunity to rest his mind and body. The other difference is that in our playing days there were no tournaments. So to battle for points was not a priority but to learn, improve skills and enjoy were the objectives. When you play too much of cricket during a season, it also leads to pitches not being at its best as nature is such that pitches do need preparation, care and rest. Average pitches do not produce quality cricketers. The other difference that I see is the level of fitness and preparation leading into a season which is greater than what we ever did which is very good. This prepares a young cricketer to face the rigours of modern day cricket. Its now common to see a 15-year-old at a gym pushing weights. Whereas the only weight that I carried as a 15-year-old was my cricket kit bag to and from practice!
Q: The Royal-Thomian cricket match has been played for 137 years. What differences do you see in the RT matches from when you played and now
RM: Its nearly 38 years since I last played a Royal-Thomian. Its only in my last year, which was the Centenary year; this encounter became a 3-day match as opposed to a 2-day match. Thats a difference it requires a different approach skills-wise, mentally and physically, as during the school season the games are played over two days. Im glad that from then to now, the spirit in which the players have played the game in this great encounter have been of the highest order, upholding the values, traditions of the two institutions and this noble game of cricket. What have changed remarkably are the peripheral aspects and the commercialization of the game. We now have a dedicated bunch of old boys from both schools who run this game almost like a company to ensure that they maximize on commercial opportunities, generate income which is then channeled back to the schools to develop the sport and also contribute towards some worthy causes. In our time, a joint committee ran the game but we were not in that era of commercialization. Therefore, my fervent wish is that this aspect doesnt encroach or intrude on to the core product, which is the Royal-Thomian cricket match.
Q: What was it like to be captain of the school, club and country
RM: To represent ones school and country is an honour given to very few. Therefore, I felt specially privileged to have had represented at the three stages of my cricket career. Its during these stages you carry the hopes and aspirations of your school and country and it was with special pride that I stepped onto a cricket field knowing the significance and the importance of those I represented. Therefore, to have had the ultimate honour of captaining your school and country is something that cannot be explained in words but something that I will treasure for the rest of my life. This is not about a singular achievement, its also learning about life, making friends, competing at the highest level with great intensity, but in the spirit in which this game of cricket is meant to be played.
Q: What are the non-negotiable elements of discipline you would like maintained by both sides in the Royal-Thomian series having seen and played national and international cricket
RM: The non-negotiable aspects I would like the players to maintain would be playing according to the laws and the spirit, respecting the umpires, respecting your opponents for who they are as much as you would respect your own players and always to think that the game is bigger than the team and the team is greater than you. Some of these are aspects of discipline but the others are values which have been the cornerstone and the bedrock of this game for centuries.
Q: How would do you see the Royal Thomian in the next 20 years
RM: I would like to see the game played the way it is now, high in intensity, but in good spirit, skills and fitness levels improving with the advancement of modern science and one aspect that is inevitable in the day and age we live is the introduction of technology to ensure that we arrive at the best decisions. We can be the innovators of that. I am also sure the event organisers will make this encounter more attractive, marketable and current so that the future generations will enjoy The Big Match the way our forefathers and we did. Hope I live to see that day.

Reading Corner for Vajira Sri Childrens Development Centre from JIT
Just In Time Groups (JIT) goal is to create reading corners in orphanages and rural schools for children who are lacking this much needed knowledge development resource.
Reading even for just a few minutes a day has a myriad of benefits and helps shape a childs personality.
This was Just In Time Groups third CSR Project that was completed under their CSR initiative Today a reader-Tomorrow a Leader. The selected project location was Vajira Sri Childrens Development Center in Pita Kotte, established in 1983 with 30 destitute children who were the victims and lost their parents due the civil war in Northern Sri Lanka.
Just In Time Group chose this home due to the fact that they greatly lacked books for the children and an engaging and attractive space for the children to read.
Just In Time Group and its staff contributed in creating this mini library a reading space for these children which was received with much excitement by the children and the staff.
Just In Time Group contributed their time and resources in painting the space and decorating it to make it attractive for the children and donating the home with a fully equipped library and activity corner complete with arts and crafts and most importantly books to let their imagination and knowledge soar.
Vajira Sri Childrens Development Centre is in the care of Rev. Dr. Hunupalagama Vajira Sri Nayaka Thera whose commitment from day one has been for the development and betterment of these kids. Each child has a story of their own, and a smile that makes you appreciate the blessings we have.
Working to create a better future every day for our countrys children and youth is a cause Just In Time staff are very passionate about, and Just in Time Group (www.jithpl.com) has already launched its corporate internship programme to further this initiative and the CSR programme Today a ReaderTomorrow a Leader to inculcate the habit of reading in children across the island thereby playing our part in shaping future well rounded leaders.

SAITM CEO shooting stage-managed
Initial investigations into the shooting incident in which SAITM Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne escaped unhurt, reveal that it appears to have been staged, the Police said yesterday.

Samsungs acting head indicted on bribery charges
The acting head of Samsung is to be indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges connected to a corruption and cronyism scandal centring on South Koreas impeached president, Park Geun-hye.
Lee Jae-yong and four other Samsung executives will almost certainly face trial over accusations that South Koreas biggest conglomerate donated millions of dollars to foundations run by a close friend of Parks in exchange for government favours.
Later on Tuesday, Lee, who is officially Samsungs vice-president but has in effect run the company since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, will be charged with bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and committing perjury before parliament, prosecutors said on the final day of their investigation into a scandal that has rocked the countrys political and business worlds. The four executives, who all face the same charges as Lee except perjury, are the Samsung groups vice-chairman, Choi Gee-sung, and president, Chang Choong-ki, as well as Samsung Electronics president, Park Sang-jin, and executive vice-president, Hwang Sung-soo. Some of the executives will resign and leave Samsung, but Lee is expected to stay on as de facto head of the company if there is a trial. The firm, whose group revenues are equivalent to a fifth of South Koreas GDP, has so far declined to comment on the charges, but this month it said it had not paid bribes nor made improper requests to the president seeking favours.

Savvying in cyber
Understanding their own identity has helped them establish themselves in the music scene. Giving life to old hits as a means of popularizing and preserving them for the future, the cyber based band Api Machan has creates vibes among music lovers.
Though they are only about four months old, Api Machan has over 9000 hits in their online video channel. Their voice ranges superbly infuse life to the good old hits, giving them a nw vibe which appeals to the modern music lovers.
Shooting for a music video
Madhawa Hewawasam, a recording engineer, composer, music producer and lyricist by profession, is the manager of the group. He has penned his first song Alen Vela Ganna sung by Athula Adhikari and Samitha Mudunkotuwa in 2011. Motivated by the feedback he received for his work he ventured further in the field and penned many more lyrics.
Once a song becomes popular many more songs which are similar to the original are released to the market. They are almost carbon copies of the original because they encompass similar lyrics and tunes. These lack quality. I was disappointed by this aspect and set my lyric writing aside for a while. It was during this stage that I felt that reviving old hits has become a necessity today, he said.
He notes that Api Machan does not cater to the popular ringing tone market but moves towards the classical styles of the golden past.
We are composing a few songs of our own now. We have already released two songs Hansa Bottuwe with Sumith Mandanayaka and Me Nagaraya Aluth Wela which was released for Valentines Day this year. Hansa Bottuwe has received over 41, 000 views up-to-date, Madhawa said.
Speaking about how the bands name originated Madhawa said that they noticed that they addressed each other as such whenever they proposed to engage in some activity.
Hence we decided to name ourselves in the same manner. The name too generated interest because it is funky. It is no use naming ourselves with a name which is foreign or difficult to pronounce as we want to get close to the music enthusiasts, he said.
There is a lot of music that is being created these days which is aimed solely at making money. They lack depth as well as quality.
People listen to these songs because they have no other choice. We aim to create a fan base with the taste for quality music and songs. Once they learn to recognize and appreciate the real thing, then they would be up for originals of superior quality, he added.
Api Machan consists of five members. They originally started off with four members but decided to add one more individual as an extra member just in case one cannot make it on a particular day. The extra became a permanent member in the group and all five sing as well as play music instruments. They use minimal instruments in their music so that their vocals dominate the tracks.
Norman Fernando, Dhanushka Edirisinghe, Nisal Sutheekshana, Harsha Withanage and Manuja Mahawatte make up Api Machan. Thiwanka Mihiran is the video director of the team. Subash Lakmal and Chathuka Madhuranga also support Api Machans efforts.
The voices of the band members too vary from each other. Dhanushka has a Western voice and accent. Nisal was in the first 16 in the Derana Dream Star Season 6. Harsha has a base voice. He won fourth place in Sirasa Super Star Season 6. He and Dhanushka have both been trained under Kasun Kalhara. Harsha has also been a disciple of Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa. Norman originates from Kandy and has the talent to imitate the voice of original artistes. Manuja has a voice which can handle a variety of styles. He became the second runners up on Derana Dream Star Season 3.
A bulk of Api Machans audience are between 25 to 35 years. Only 48 per cent are home Sri Lankans while 52 per cent are Sri Lankans living abroad. Over nine percent of their fans are from Australia.
We have had comments from fans abroad stating that their children have never listened to Sinhala songs. However once they have listened to one of the old hits we have sung and released on Youtube, they have become fans of these old hits and are now listening to them continuously, Madhawa revealed adding that he considers this quite a triumph indeed.
Making money is not the objective of their venture. They do not make money out of the videos that have uploaded in Youtube. Nor do they perform at weddings or gigs.
Due to this reason nobody can accuse us of making money out of these songs. We have credited the songs to the artistes and lyricists who own them. The original work is also inserted into the web along with our version. Since our efforts popularize these old songs, the owners can actually make money via Youtube by establishing their rights, Madhawa added.
Queried if they have plans to include a female member to their group the team adds that though they might invite female vocalists to sing with them for some songs, they do not have any plans to rope in one as a permanent member.
Often, we have to venture far and go through various hardships to make the perfect videos. A girl cannot undergo or overcome most of these hurdles, Madhawa explained.
The team ventures far and wide when they are on the hunt for video locations. Thiwanka leaves no stones unturned when he is engaged in his work and this is evident by the quality of the video. A three time Presidents Award winning short film cinematographer, Thiwanka obtained his Higher National Diploma in Design at Sri Lanka National Design Institute in Katubedda, Moratuwa. He also has a sound engineering training and a design diploma to his name.
We hope to collaborate with other artistes according to the songs requirements. We are currently in the process of doing another number with Madumadawa Aravinda, Madhawa expressed adding that they hope to make their own music style and set their mark in the local music industry.
Talking about their future plans Madhawa added that thought they are planning to venture into originals, their motto would always be to maintains their standards without following the trends of the music scene. Semi live performances is a path they hope to take but they would continue to function as a Youtube band and keep the music enthusiasts superior taste for Sinhala music alive across the globe.

Scientifically speaking
An average science professor may not be understood as a person who is destined to take up religious studies as a serious detour from his mainstay. But it had happened in the case of a well-known chemistry professor from the university of Kelaniya. That was a decade ago.
He is remembered as Professor J K P Ariyaratne. Towards retirement, he took up science and Buddhism as a comparative study enhancing the output of a number of research papers as well as creative pieces. Before his demise a decade ago, when I met him on the campus he gave me a copy of his book titled as Two Buddhist Sutras viewed from Science. As a reader and teacher interested in the field of comparative studies, both literature and communication, I wanted to browse the text.
It took some time. And now I am back with the book.
The book running to 160 printed pages, consisting of five chapters each linking to the other is an analytical study of two foremost Buddhist suttas: Dhammachakkappavattana and Anattalakkhana Suttas. Both suttas were delivered to the Buddhas first five disciples. Professor Ariyaratne tries to drive in the significance of the two suttas from a scientific point of view.
This is a collection of several essays connected to each other as a result of a uniquely personal experience that Professor Ariyaratne had during a lecture. It was on the topic of chemical bonding, delivered to new advents of the University of Kelaniya. The primary foundation lecture has gone a long way with subsequent study and concentration. The Buddhas philosophy is based on two key factors: suffering (dukkha) and its cessation (dukkha nirodho).
Professor Ariyaratne was inspired by Professor Fritjof Capras The Tao of Physics. The inspiration I imbibed is indeed immense, says Professor Ariyaratne as a starting point. Then he continues: In the early 1980s, I realised spontaneously a certain parallel between one important aspect of chemical bonding and the second Noble Truth (as taught by the Buddha). I wrote this slim volume for the purpose of relating my exceedingly exhilarating experience and the subsequent development of my thoughts concerning the interface between Buddhism and Science.
Admittedly, the reader of the text may find an interesting brain teasing analysis basically subdivided into two categories. The first grouping is The Scientific Method of that Never Ends. The second grouping is Buddhist Philosophical Procedure that Can Come to an End. In the first group, there are four segments diagrammatically displayed.
They are in the first category written as follows:
1. Making observations and gathering data.
2. (This leads to) the analysis and synthesis of data, making deductions.
3. (Leading to) understanding through hypothesis, confirmation of our understanding through experiments.
4. Apply for our material benefit, research (using appropriate methods and techniques).
Then come the segments in the second grouping. They go as follows.
1. Observing our internal and external worlds.
2. (Leading to) analysing the observations and realising mutual relationships.
3. (Which leads to) achieving some understanding confirming by experiencing. Achieve further understanding continue to repeat the process.
4. (Leading to) practice for our supra-mundane progress. This leads to the perfecting of the technique of insight meditation. This is the knowledge of reality or perfect enlightenment.
This ultimate goal is denoted as the cessation of the arising the I concept in the mind, (Nibbana).
In his blissful stipulation, Professor Ariyaratne denotes that when a person perfectly understands the above-laid reality of nature, he loses all attachment to all things, all persons and all conditions. The complete comprehension of the reality leads to the perfect liberation of the mind and freedom from all ills. Thus he states that the perfected mental state is indeed estimation or Nibbana which in turn is known as Nibbanam Paraman Sukham. Perhaps as a reader one may feel that this is an innovative form of thinking on religious communication, where a dialogue cum discourse could be formulated on Buddhism  Science as a subject.
The intimacy in reading the pages are built on the experimental and inspirations derived. He neither reports or summarises what others say. Instead, believes in creative thinking. Professor Ariyaratnes ultimate analysis leads to the conclusion that physical attraction, repulsion, and stabilisation pertaining to the existence of a salt crystal. In a world full of human conflict causing agony, a blissful experience as undergone by a senior science professor may be a gift to the contemporary society. I have recently come across several creative artistes who do not believe in therapy via concentration and meditation.
For that type of personals perhaps, Professor Ariyaratne shows the way to a better frame of mind via a scientific method. For me, this work cannot be considered as either a strict religious interpretation or a strict scientific interpretation. It is more of a blend of both areas interlinked through personal experiences gained by teaching and contemplation.
Professor Ariyaratnes main contribution though was confined to chemistry where he specialised in organic metallic chemistry, he gradually diverted his interest to social sciences, philosophy and allied fields culminating in Buddhism.
As Professor Ariyaratne points out, the Buddhas teachings are helpful scientific means and ways of looking at sensory experiences that help us to understand them. They are not commandments. They are not dogmas that we have to accept or believe in. Instead, they are guides to point to the way things are.
They remind us scientifically to face them ourselves to be awake, alert and aware that all that arises passes away.

Shopper sentiment improves on the back of retail growth
Greater consumer confidence could bring about higher returns from Sri Lanka's retail sector, though the possibility of a further tightening of monetary policy by the country's central bank might offset any near-term gains.
Sri Lankans have an improved view of market conditions, according to the latest MasterCard consumer confidence index released in mid-January, with a 2.1-point increase in sentiment levels from the previous year, taking the country's score on the index to 40.1.
This moves Sri Lanka from having a pessimistic outlook to a neutral one, and, while still well short of a positive score of 60, suggests a greater willingness to spend.
The result of the latest survey marks a modest turnaround from the previous MasterCard report issued in August, which recorded a 4.2-point fall in sentiment.
This was on the back of a 25.2-point drop in the February 2016 report, in which MasterCard suggested that consumer confidence had fallen in part due to uncertainty about the local currency and its impact on buying power.
Across 2016 the rupee fell 3.9%, after a far sharper decline of 10% the previous year. With the currency deprecating by another 1.6% since the start of this year, further retreats could feed into inflationary costs and potentially weaken demand for imported goods.
Growing retail activity
The incremental improvement in consumer sentiment was also reflected in the steady if unspectacular increase in retail and wholesale activity in the third quarter of 2016, the latest period for which data has been released by the Department of Census and Statistics.
Retail and wholesale trade posted a 4.6% increase year-on-year (y-o-y) in the third quarter.
While this was in line with the 4.7% expansion of the wider services sector, it was above the 4.1% y-o-y rise recorded by the broader economy.
Expanding reach
Another factor supporting growth in the industry is the expansion of retail outlets into areas away from main population centres, with opportunities for further development as disposable incomes rise, according to Ashok Pathirage, chairman and managing director of retailer and mixed operations company Softlogic.
The rest of the country also holds substantial growth potential, as the private sector is now focused on geographical expansion, he told OBG. Indeed, the rise of mixed-use developments - an integration of commercial, residential, recreational and institutional space - is on an upward trend in regional markets.
This could see more investments in quality retail spaces across secondary urban centres in Sri Lanka over the next few years, which in turn should open up new markets to retailers.
Downside risks, upside gains
While retail activity is gaining some traction, a possible further tightening of fiscal policy could rein in growth in consumer spending.
Though the central bank kept its benchmark interest rates steady at its February monetary policy committee meeting, the bank may come under pressure to raise rates late in the first quarter or early in the second due to upward movements in inflation.
Core inflation climbed to 5.5% in January from 4.5% the month before and in the upper range of the central bank's targeted bracket of 4-6% for 2017.
Offsetting the risks of unwanted inflation and higher interest rates are the forecasts of solid growth this year, with both the IMF and the central bank maintaining a positive outlook.
Though the IMF marginally cut its projection for growth in December, the 4.8% expansion it forecasts is well above the global average, while the reserve bank's 5-5.6% growth outlook is even more bullish. Even at the lower end of the scale, such growth, if achieved, would feed into disposable incomes and subsequently the retail chain.

Song that never withers
I sincerely believe that to be an artiste, one must first be a human being. Reality, however, is not that stark. Artistes are human beings, yes, but this does not make them perfect. That is why they clash with each other and why critics and writers try to dig out the divine from the imperfect in them.
That is also why there are obituaries and those who praise the dead. Moreover, not every human being is a humanist. Not everyone can cross the terrain from the one to the other. In this context, artistes are a veritable bunch. They dont just house human beings, they house humanists.
Gunadasa Kapuge was not perfect. To be perfect, however, isnt necessarily to be a humanist. He was certainly the latter. He had his career, his ups and downs and his moments of doubt. Politically he was far away from us, yet so near. To say that he touched our souls would be a clichd way of putting it, but that is the truth. This is a tribute to Gunadasa Kapuge.
Best work
I know of people who say they cant bear listening to his songs. True. His best work came out, not in his political tracts but in his affirmation of the human spirit. In what he sang and how he sang, he spoke about the resilience of collectives, how they were able to rise up despite the injustice that adorned our society. When people say they cant bear listening to him, it is not because they dislike him. It is because he awakened that deeply repressed, and yet potent, quality in us: the ability to empathise, to look at those less fortunate than us and be moved. That defined him and in turn defined the way we looked at him.
Ellamulla Kapuge Gunadasa was born on August 7, 1945 in Thanabaddegama, Elpitiya. He was educated at Dharmasoka Vidyalaya, Ambalangoda and later at the Haywood College of Music. This would be followed by a studentship at Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow, after which he returned home and joined Radio Ceylon. He started out as a radio assistant, graduating up the ranks and eventually becoming a program producer (in 1975) and the director in charge of the Rajarata Sevaya (in 1981). It was through the Raja Rata Sevaya that a new breed of politically sensitive performers came up, among them Karunaratne Divulgane.
Kapuge had a voice. It was politically mature but was still able to speak about other, more worldly themes. His first single, Dasa Nilupul Thema, persuaded his superiors to mark him as a Grade A vocalist, after which he moved into a solo career, the theatre, and the cinema. While his credits are many and certainly deserve more than a passing reference, nevertheless I am more concerned in this column about the man behind the performer, and the performer behind the work.
What was it about him that entranced us First and foremost, he came from the South at a time when that part of the country was fermenting revolution and was engaged in an extensive liberation campaign. That campaign would end with two insurrections, the second being the bloodiest such we have ever seen (and hopefully ever will). Being a part-Southerner myself, I know that it is a veritable paradox, housed by both fundamentalists and humanists, by those who pander to extremist tenets and those who reflect on the world quietly and poignantly. I am not sure whether Kapuge belonged to the latter category, but I am sure that his work strongly indicated that he did.
Lost songs
That is why I believe his Kampana was a more successful manifestation of the political song and lyric than Nanda Malinis Pavana. While Pavana depended on both Malini and Sunil Ariyaratne, Kampana was Kapuge through and through. With it, he gave us his best, delving into themes which were repudiated and even scorned at by the musical establishment of the day. Malinda Seneviratne once referred to them as his lost songs. I agree. They were lost not because we didnt want to listen to them, but because we couldnt.
I know of people who say they cant stand listening to two of his most powerful songs, Ula Leno and Sumano. Both were written by that other man of the village, Ranbanda Seneviratne, and both delve into death and decay. Of these, Sumano is the most difficult to sit through: it is about a husband lamenting his dead wife. Ula Leno is not as difficult, but it is deeper and more reflective. I used to think that it was merely a tribute to the ula lena, who is condemned to live a lonely life in the wilderness. But then I heard these lines, and I was startled by how it seemed to relate to us:
The wind is cold
But the forest is ours
All you have are your wings
And all I have is my hut...
Here Kapuge is not just praising the bird. He is looking at it. He is emboldened by it. He is sharing its loneliness. That is why, when I heard later that Ranbanda was writing of the failed insurrectionists from 1971, and the condemned lives they had to lead later on, I was not in the least surprised. For Kapuge was not the ula lena, but the men, women, and children (enslaved as they were) who could only embrace their cruel fate. In other words, if Nanda Malini and Sunil Ariyaratne taught us to protest, to reject injustice, Kapuge taught us to look at that injustice with open, teary eyes. He didnt resolve our suffering, but made us dig deeper, opening the crevices we were on and helping us understand why we were the frail, weak humans we were.
He could embrace the overtly political if he wanted to, and he did that in the eighties. In "Uthuru Kone", for instance, he sang of the diversity we were (and are) blessed with, of the Tamil brother and the Sinhala sister we have in one family. Like the songs from Pavana, however, these were too specific, too narrowly defined, and too crassly spouted for them to gain the lease of life his earlier work had in abundance. Id like to think that this is why the Kapuge of the seventies is more remembered than the Kapuge of the eighties.
The English language is not poetic and raw enough to sum up the quality of his songs, I am sorry to say. If I were asked to comment on his work, I would say that they were unrefined, coarse, sometimes vulgar, and always sincere. I would also say, more pithily, that they were all dukbara (brimming with sadness). I believe the latter word sums up not just his songs, but his compositions as well: even in Tharawo Igilethi, and more manifestly in Dharmasiri Bandaranayakes Bawa Duka, he unearths the potent, debilitating inevitability of suffering. Tharawo Igilethi I have unfortunately not seen. I have, however, seen Bandaranayakes film.
Harrowing fatalism
Bawa Duka is chock-a-block from beginning to end with Buddhist iconography, symbolising the oppressive nature of tradition and its uneasy cohabitation with the clergy. It needed a composer who could epitomise the harrowing fatalism of history, of the caste stratifications and the structures of power and patriarchy it perpetuated. Bandaranayakes preferred composer before this had been Khemadasa. But Khemadasa was too colourful, too much the Mozart, to imbibe that kind of worldview. It needed a contemplative man to articulate the sansaric suffering the film depicted. In going for Kapuge, I therefore personally believe Bandaranake made the correct choice.
But then Kapuge was Kapuge. He didnt sing, he brooded. He didnt compose, he weaved.
Just the other day I came across a man who had everything to say about Ranbanda Seneviratne. I relented and told him to pour out his feelings to me. Apparently hed listened to Landune and had gone through each and every line, accentuated by Khemadasas poignant melody. Hed listened to how Ranbanda asked whether the landune was another Patachara or Kisagothami and why she was condemned to cohabit with men she never met again, infuriating a society that ignored and condoned those same men.
I asked him what happened next. I wept, he said. I asked him why. I dont know, he replied. I asked him whether that was possible. One does not need reasons to cry, he observed.

Special Circular preventing students from being used for protests
A special circular was issued by the Education Ministry yesterday preventing students from being used for protests during school hours. In accordance with the circular issued under the signature of Education Ministry Secretary Sunil Hettiarchchi addressed to Provincial Education Secretaries, Provincial Education Directors and Zonal Education Directors, with copies to the Inspector General of Police, Provincial Chief Secretaries and Principals of National Schools,using students for protests has been banned and prohibited.
Besides, under this circular no outsider or outside groups are allowed to enter schools or address students without due permission.
The Ministry has issued the circular since it has been revealed that certain parties are trying to spread extremist ideas among school students against carrying out governments policies and plans.
This situation badly affects the teaching and learning process in the school system and moreover a hindrance to maintaining students discipline.
Under the circular, all principals are advised not to grant permission for the holding of any meetings, discussions in schools without prior approval from the Education Ministry Secretary, Provincial Education Secretaries or Provincial Education Directors.

Sri Lanka, Seychelles join to fight drug menace

Seychelles President Danny Faure praised President Maithripala Sirisenas campaign against illegal drug trade and said his country would extend the fullest cooperation to Sri Lankas endeavour to stop drugs and narcotics smuggling.
He gave this assurance when he called on President Sirisena at the Presidents Official Residence on Monday. The two leaders discussed a range of bilateral relations, especially about close cooperation in tourism, fisheries and agriculture.
President Faure said Seychelles too is facing the menace of drug smuggling and said the two countries could share intelligence on drug smuggling in their joint fight against drugs.
President Sirisena, referring to the powerful drug cartels said many political leaders fear to talk against the drug mafia and said he was glad that President Faure fearlessly speaks against drug smugglers. I consider you as a dear friend with a common cause, President Sirisena said.
President Faure commented, I am strongly with you in our common fight against the drug menace. He thanked Sri Lanka for providing high professionals to Seychelles and said, Our students learn from Sri Lankan teachers, your doctors look after our health and your legal experts provide us excellent judiciary services. He said former Attorney General of Seychelles, Anthony Fernando is a Sri Lankan and he is now a respected judge.
Now we do not go to Europe for legal expertise, we come to Sri Lanka, the Seychelles President said.
President Faure invited President Sirisena to be the chief guest at the function to be held in October 2018 to mark 30 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Seychelles Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Michael Benstrong, Presidential secretary Aude Labaleine, Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon and Seychelles Ambassador David Pierre also participated in the discussion.

Sri Lanka WebAds takes virtual advertising to new level
Gayendra Wickramarathna, an IT specialist cum social media geek, as well as an innovator with many first times and novel innovations to his credit has redefined the words Virtual Advertising, by conceptualising SriLankaWebAds Portal.
That's Mobile Video Marketing - the latest trend in online advertising, beating the traditional newspaper and TV advertising and now catching on in the world.
A cyber platform for a virtual trade or business video directory is created for the first time in Sri Lanka, as an eye catching and a colourful pictorial 'one stop shopping mall on the worldwide web. Wickramarathna, an old boy of Royal College and his friend Wineendra Weeraman who is in the legal profession and an old boy of D.S. Senanayake College,recently launched Sri Lanka's first Virtual 4KUHDVideo Advertising E-Commerce platform, going a step further by amalgamating a 360 Degree Four (4)Dimensional Spin-View of a customer's product.
This in fact is a rarity among the world's e-marketing platforms too.SLWA takes Sri Lankan business ventures to the world.
Mobile data traffic is increasing at a huge rate, even in Sri Lanka, and a new study from Cisco confirms that by 2020, video will account for a staggering 75% of that traffic. That's up from 55% in 2015. The statistics for North America are even higher, coming in at over 77%. By 2020, there will be more than 11.6 billion mobile connected devices, exceeding the world population
Cisco's latest annual Visual Networking Index forecast (VNI) states that mobile data traffic has grown 400-million-fold over the past 15 years, and the increased number of users, mobile devices, and innovations in technology are driving mobile video consumption through the roof. The study predicts that by 2020, there will be more than 11.6 billion mobile connected devices, exceeding the world's projected population at that time (7.8 billion). That's going to have a huge impact on video traffic.
Mobile video traffic predictions for the future
Mobile Video Traffic Predictions for 2020 - By 2020, over 75% of global mobile data traffic will be video content.In U.S. video will account for 77% of total mobile data traffic by 2020, up from 61% in 2015.Video accounted for 55% of mobile traffic in 2015.
Smartphone use in watching videos increase
Smartphones will account for 81% of total mobile traffic by 2020 - up from 76% in 2015.4G connectivity share is predicted to surpass 2G by 2018 and 3G by 2020.By 2020, there will be 432M global WiFi hotspots (inc household) - up from 64M in 2015.There will be 3x more mobile connections than people in the UK by 2020.7 trillion video clips will be uploaded in 2020 - 2.5 daily video clips for every person.Global mobile data traffic will reach 30.6 Exabytes per month in 2020, up from 3.7 Exabytes in 2015
What's going to drive the increase in video consumption between now and 2020 Unsurprisingly, it will be the ease at which consumers can access high-end mobile devices, and how they use them to access online video footage. Smartphones have become so sophisticated that they are capable of generating 41x as much traffic as a basic mobile phone, tablets even more so with the capability to drive 113x more traffic.
Mobile video marketing strategy is needed for Sri Lankan Business enterprises
Video is set to have the highest growth rate of any mobile application in the next 5 years, which is why a Mobile Video Marketing strategy is essential for brands. India is far ahead than Sri Lanka. Sri Lankans are too slow in getting on board the Band Wagon, which leaves them way behind world standards and thus becoming losers. Very high infrastructure rates - politically motivated - are another stumbling block.
40% of baby product consumers actually live in homes without children
A 2015 study by Google/IpsosMediaCT found that 40% of baby product consumers actually live in homes without children! This is also true for 52% of baby product influencers. Who are these people Well, they could be grandparents, cousins, friends, or co-workers. And their #1 way of finding out about these babyand children products is via a search engine - whether that's Google, or YouTube. In other words, search is social.
SriLankaWebAds holds the largest amount of categories for an E-Commerce site
SLWA holds the largest amount of categories which are very explicitly depicted in Hi-Rez photos for any e-commerce site in the world.It's layout is in an unorthodox manner. As an example, the Home & Garden section has all the subjects included forbusinesses who would want to advertise their products relating to Home Building, from a Septic Tank to a Granite Tile.An internal search engine is included for users to search for a category or company.
Local Businesses should take this opportunity now
Local Businesses should take this opportunity now, provided by SLWA to advertise their services / products to improve their sales. They should understand that by advertising in a virtual trade or business directory, a person who wants to build a house as an example, can surf SLWA and find various dealers in the same subject and get quotes from them, in the comfort of his bedroom. It is a virtualised Yellow Pages trade directory.
Wiki insists that the government should drastically reduce the charges for ICT related tariffs, so that more entrepreneurs could capitalize on this and earn more revenue thus generating more cash flow amongst citizens and the government via taxes.
Voice Messaging and Appointment Scheduling
SLWA has a feature where a customer can be contacted by a voice message or scheduling an in-office appointment. It is an interactive portal. This too is a rarity for local e-commerce sites.
Individualistic and doing what others dare do
Being individualistic & doing what others don't do, the site sportsa very vibrant color profile filing up the entire monitor screen with the content and with a logo on a rare color combination of pink and blue depicting males and females in a backdrop of an universe, meaning the site belongs to the whole world, making it stand out amongst many drab commercial websites.
Photoshop graphics, animations, web designing, backend programming, photo cum videography, video editing and search engine optimisation are all handled single handled by Wiki himself who is a professional in all these subjects and now proved beyond doubt.
Many Awards & Accolades to Wiki's credit
Wiki has won awards in Photoshop as well as photography and represented Sri Lanka through ICTA at the 1stManthan Awards, held in New Delhi, which is South Asia's largestIT Awards. Out of the Sri Lankan contingent he was the only person to have held discussions with international IT personalities, do a presentation and his profile included in the officialManthan website in 2008. This was on his own Sri Lanka Almanac VidhyuthKoshaya Portal, the name coined by Wiki himself & the word Portal used for the 1st time in Sri Lanka in 2006. One of the pioneers in innovative web designing in the country.
Innovative design for the National Youth Services Council website
Wiki designed the website for the National Youth Services Council under the Ministry of Sports, where the menu icons were free standing rotating Lotus flowers on a black background, when it was a taboo to use black on websites. He says he was even rejected by a so called leading professional institution, not on websites but on marketing, but he stood his ground& succeeded. The site was launched in Scotland during the International Youth Services Council gathering and was appreciated by the Duke of Edinburgh due to it's innovativeness. He further states that most people are stereotype & orthodox, the reason why Sri Lanka has not become a designer's or an innovator's paradise.
Recipient of a World Bank CAP Grant
A grantee on a project named Indigenous Building Methods Using Indigenous Knowledge, Wiki showed the world how ancient monuments such as Jethavanaramaya which was the 3rd tallest building in the world at that time, only to be dwarfed by the 2 Pyramids in Gaza, was built using basic raw material & indigenous knowledge.He has nearly 100 subjects digitized on Anuradhapura for the 1st time in the history of Sri Lanka. He officially handed over his rights recently to another company recommended by ICTA.
4K UHD videos are the latest in video standards
SriLankaWebAds also hosts many 4K UHD videos of a customer which is another 1st time in the world for a Cyber Advertising company. 4K is the latest video standard with a resolution 4 times higher than the present 1080p horizontal resolution nearing 3840lines. SLWA would visit the location of a customer and videograph his factory or products which cannot be taken out to the SLWA studio.SLWA does a complete 4K UHD cinema resolution documentary using a large sensor 4K video camera on a client's business, service or product and then promote it through the internet for a worldwide audience.
SriLankaWebAds Channel on YoutTube the world's largest video search engine
Wickramarathna,says his next step will be to host Blue Ray videos with a higher quality than 4K which still hasn't even come to Sri Lanka's TV standards. In Japan he points out that 8K TV transmission is been tried out by NHK and shows how backward we are in the electronic broadcasting field. YouTube and Netflix now supports 4k videos and SLWA have their own channel named SriLankaWebAds on YouTube which permits them to run videos 15mts in length.
SLWA were the first to upload a 4K
SLWA were the first to upload a 4K video filmed with a real 4k video camera and not a GoPro type, in Sri Lanka.Customers can view their viewer rankings on SLWA, through Analytics which Google provides us. Google bought over YouTube which has over a billion users - almost one-third of all people on the Internet - and that audience will get larger now that Pakistan has lifted its ban. SLWA gets a customer's video ranked in the latest #1 search engine- the Video Search Engine-YouTube!
360 Degree 4D SpinView product advertising will take your company to the next level
Wiki's recent trip to USA enabled him to purchase modern equipment at B&H Photo in New York, which is the largest photo retailer in the world. Wiki's novel idea of making 4 dimensional multi spin views of a shoe as an example, makes it real cool for a client to get the feel of touching the product and even having a look at the sole of the shoe by turning the image by the finger on a smartphone or with the mouse on a desktop. This is definitely a first time in Sri Lanka and a rarity in the world too. He has made a sample for a Baker where the Cake can be rotated to see the filling of the cake and then the icing or the topping can be seen in an enlarged view separately.Going one step further he even spins a SUV to see all the sides of the Jeep and also the interior in one photo, all filmed in 4K. From a massive Jeep to a miniscule Gem or a Wedding Ring - Wiki spins them all.
SriLanka WebAds has accounts with all the major social media platforms
SLWA has many social media platforms where a client's profile cum documentaries are uploaded and linked back again to a website that a client has. Wiki leading in the field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in Sri Lanka has another exceptionality, where he makes a Thumbnail of a video of the client appear in the first few Google Chrome search pages, when a surfer searches for a certain name of a trade or service.
Video Thumbnail appears when searched for client's trade
This colorful little thumbnail attracts the eye of a surfer and makes it tempting to click on it. As an example, if a surfer searches for Sri Lanka One Day Printers, a thumbnail appears of a client's video which he has made on one of the first two pages in Google Chrome. SLWA is linked to Google pages too. Out of hundreds of thousands of websites in the world, only a handful of websites are capable of making this happen, thus proving Wiki's SEO capabilities. Wiki further states, that many proudly tell him that they have a website and do not want our services. But, he explains that having a website without getting it ranked according onit's' subject is worthless.
A surfer who knows that A person has a website, will visit or contact that business directly, but a person who doesn't know that X company manufactures a Y product, will search for that Y product on the internet. This is what most people do not understand Wiki says. Also, if anyone searches for a company name by typing the name of the company, obviously that URL would come 1st, but rarely of a product that particular company offers. This is Search Engine Optimization- which SLWA does. SLWA's forte is ranking a company or a product through Videos, which is a difficult and a rare task.
SLWA uses the latest web technology
SLWA uses the latest html5, css3, responsive, bootstrapping & mobile friendly technology. It is also a secure site using the https security certificate, so that customers are safe with their data with us, says Wiki, an ethical hacker during the 2008 / 2009 period.
Smartphone ready
With Mobile Video Marketing and 360degree SpinView E-commerce platforms becoming the latest trend in the world with a gigantic market share, SLWA is not only a responsive' site, but mobile friendly' too, where words are readable automatically rather than increasing the size by dragging it with your fingers. Wiki says that he has seen many multinational and leading companies in Sri Lanka still using outdated technology in their corporate websites. We have our own App on Google PlayStore too, he proudly says.
Signing an Agreement with Universal Granite
Wineendra says that they promote and market the client's services or goods locally &globally 24/365. Unlike TV commercials, a surfer could go through a customer's site as many times as he wants and whenever he pleases.
A newspaper is cumbersome and an advertisement is read and the paper thrown away. But, an online ad can be watched time and time againwithin a minimal space of your palm. The amount paid for a yearly newspaper ad measuring a measly 4 inches by 3 inches is only a fraction cheaper, than the amount paid for a slot in SLWA with all the perks mentioned herein.TV and Newspaper advertising is simply incomparable with virtual advertising. We make a Portal for a client with equipment used for documentary making and don't worry him for content. We do it all.
He further states, we sign an agreement with the customer initially for 1 year as with all internet related matters.
We provide the customer about four to five 4K UHD video clips which they can use for their own promotions too, including for TV or Cinema advertising, plus Search Engine Optimization and global promotion through our many Social Media platforms having a large amount of followers worldwide.SLWA audience is global according to Google Analytics.
This novel concept is the first time in Sri Lanka and maybe a very few in the world, if at all.

Supreme Court accords farewell to Chief justice
The outgoing Chief Justice K. Sripavan was accorded a ceremonial farewell by the Supreme Court yesterday.
Chief Justice K. Sripavan retired from service yesterday upon reaching the retirement age of 65. Justice Kanagasabapathy J. Sripavan was Deputy Solicitor General, a Judge, President of Court of Appeal and puisne Justice of the Supreme Court before being appointed Chief Justice on January 30, 2015. He was educated at Hindu College, Jaffna between 1962 and 1972. He joined the Sri Lanka Law College in 1974 and passed out as an Attorney-at-law in 1976. Chief Justice Sripavan enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law on August 23, 1977 and practiced law at the Unofficial Bar of Sri Lanka between 1977 and 1978. He then joined the Attorney Generals Department as an acting State Counsel on February 13, 1978. He became a permanent State Counsel on January 1, 1979. He was promoted to Senior State Counsel on March 3, 1989. The following are the speeches made by outgoing Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC, President  Bar Association of Sri Lanka at the ceremonial farewell.
Full text of speech by Chief Justice K. Sripavan at the farewell yesterday
Mr. Attorney General, Mr. President of the Bar Association and members of the Bar, you do me and the Court great honour by your attendance. I doubt very much whether I deserve any of the praise so generously bestowed upon me.
I was not inclined to accept a felicitation this time as I had the privilege of having four ceremonial welcomes. However,after considering the request of the President and committee members of the Bar Association to revive once again the old traditions of the Bar, I was compelled to concede to the request of the Bar. So, we have all gathered here today to revive that old tradition of this court. As I stated earlier this is the 5th ceremonial occasion that I am addressing you in the confines of the vast hills. The first was when I took office as a Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2002, and then in March 2007 when I was appointed the President of the Court of Appeal, thirdly in March 2008 when I was elevated to the Supreme Court and the fourth occasion was when I was appointed as the Chief Justice in January 2015.
After more than four decades in Hulftsdorp, engaged in the administration of justice in this country, I am bidding farewell to all of you. This moment gives me mixed feelings. I will be missing the daily glance of your smiling faces in this great judicial institution. Most of you have appeared and argued hundreds of cases on various subjects before me both in the Court of Appeal and in the Supreme Court. I was appointed the Chief Justice during a momentous and historically significant period of this country. I am extremely fortunate that I received great strength and support from several members of the official and the unofficial Bar and that is the reason I achieved this position. To be in the precincts of this great institution itself is a great honour and to be a Judge and later Chief Justice of this Court, is the greatest fulfilled dream of my life.
As a Judge I tried my best to discharge my functions, but it is ultimately for the members of the Bar and the public to assess my contribution, if any, to restore the independence and integrity of the judiciary and the development of law in this country. During this span of almost forty long years in the system, I have witnessed the joys and the pain in the eyes of litigants, who throng the courtrooms in their quest for justice. I have often said that no institution deserves to survive in a democracy unless it earns public esteem; and it can earn the public esteem only by discharging its duties impartially and expeditiously. It is true that large arrears are pending before our Courts. But there is a tendency in many quarters to exaggerate the number of arrears of cases. Therefore, as the Chief Justice I tried my best to improve this institution. As an initial step 3 Supreme Court benches were constituted from December 2015 and the judges were sitting at least 4 days a week. As a result of these tireless efforts of my colleagues 1636 cases were disposed in 2016 as opposed to 783 cases in the year 2015. There were 1508 cases instituted in 2015 and 1863 cases instituted in 2016, whereas only 574 and 1710 cases were instituted in years 2013 and 2014. Judges serving in the Magistrates Courts, the District Courts and the High Courts were directed to take up trials on a day to day basis. Due to trials being taken up on a day to day basis and the consequential workload, the burden on the members of the staff became unbearable and the Judicial Service Commission more recently was able to fill the vacancies in the cadre for scheduled public officers. In addition,23 High Court Judges were appointed during the last two years out of which, 21 judges are carrier judges. Three judges were also appointed to the Court of Appeal and one Judge to the Supreme Court during this period.
Justice Cardozo[1] once said about Judges 
 There is in each of us a stream of tendency...which gives coherence and direction to thought and action. Judges cannot escape that current more than other mortals. All their lives, forces which they do not recognize and cannot name, have been tugging at them ...inherited instincts,traditional beliefs, acquired convictions and resultant is our outlook on life, a conception of social needs, a sense of 'total push and pressure of the cosmos' which when reasons are nicely balanced, must determine where choice shall fall.
Mr. Attorney, Mr. President, thousands of lawyers are practicing in this country and over 700 lawyers were enrolled here just few weeks back. I know many of them do not have sufficient work. Some of the young members of the Bar still face several difficulties. I can only wish them all success in their career. My only advice is - what is required for the young lawyers at the Bar are punctuality, a clear head, a good memory, strong commonsense and an aptitude of analysis and arrangement. If they possess these qualities, difficulties in their profession would vanish, like the morning mist before the Sun.I am duty bound to say that a social duty is cast upon the legal profession to show the people beacon light by their conduct and actions. The poor, the uneducated and exploited mass of the people need a helping hand from the legal profession, admittedly, acknowledged as a most respectable profession. The Bar is an extension of the system of justice. An Attorney is our officer of Court. He is a master of an expertise but more than that, accountable to the Court and governed by a high ethic. The success of the judicial process often depends on the services of the legal profession. Its nobility has to be preserved, protected and promoted. An institution cannot survive on its name or on its past glory alone. The glory and greatness of the Bar depends on its continued and meaningful performance with grace and dignity. The legal profession being noble and an honourable one, has to continue its meaningful, useful and purposeful performance inspired by and keeping in view the high and rich traditions consistent with its grace, dignity, utility and prestige. The majesty of law and the dignity of the Courts cannot be maintained unless there is mutual respect between the Bench and the Bar. There should be a proper amity between the Bench and the Bar rather than any element of arrogance or superiority on one side. Proper coherence will bring best out of the judiciary and make the justice delivery system of the country more effective.
It is the constitutional duty of this Court to protect the rights of the people and uphold the democracy and rule of law in this country. The foundation of the judiciary is the trust and confidence of the people in its ability to deliver fearless and impartial justice. When the foundation itself is shaken by acts which tend to create disaffection and disrespect for the authority of the court by creating distrust in its working, the eddifice of the judicial system gets eroded. This Court enjoins far-reaching influence in constitutional history and progress of this country. This court has protected the interest of the people and safeguarded the independence of the judiciary. Through landmark decisions, this court has considerably strengthened our democratic foundations and commitment to the rule of law. This court has also contributed to the strengthening of country's national unity. It is a great fortune that I could be a part of the judicial system of this country.
Therefore, I consider myself to be privileged to have been part of this court, privileged to have walked with my distinguished colleagues here who gave me nothing but kindness, courtesy and respect, privileged to have sat with the eminent judges of our courts, privileged to have listened some of the best arguments from the best lawyers of this country and privileged to have been able to bask under the glory of this court. I could not have wished for more!
Mr. Attorney, Mr. President, when I lay down my Office, I remember all those who have helped me in discharging my duties in various capacities.
I wish to thank my superiors at the Attorney Generals Department where I had the pleasure of serving for 25 long years and for the interactions I had with my seniors and juniors which substantially contributed to my success. Today I wish to place on record my indebtedness and gratitude to the Attorney Generals Department, where I had the golden opportunity to work with six Attorney Generals.
My most significant recognition, is also to all of the judges, including those who have retired.Without exception they are men and women of considerable capacity and dedication with many of whom I have had the closest of interchanges of a jurisprudential character,whilst sitting on the bench of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. I shall miss the stimulation of their intellectual intercourse, personal support and above all their friendship. I am indeed grateful to my sister judge and brother judges of this court as well as the other honourable judges of the Original Courts for gracing this occasion.
I also wish to once again thank the members of the Judicial Service Commission, specially my two brother Judges, Hon. Dep and Hon. Sisira De Abrew, who always stood by me in the discharge of my functions relating to the JSC and the Judges Institute.
I am thankful to the Honourable Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice Mr. Jayamanna for allocating funds for the training of judges as and when requests were made.
I also wish to thank the Marshall, the staff and members of the Superior Court Complex Board of Management for the cooperation extended in administering and managing this court complex.
I have interacted with many members of the court when attending to day to day affairs of the court. As a collective and collegial body of men and women I could not have asked for a richer or more satisfactory experience. It is invidious to single out particular people, however, I should acknowledge the particular role of the Registrar, Supreme Court Mrs. Jayasekera for the contribution made to ensure the smooth day to day administration of the Supreme Court Registry.
I am greatly indebted to my Secretary Ms. Anandhi Kanagaratnam for her dedication sometimes under great stress, which has been of highest order.
I wish to record my deep appreciation of the work done by my private secretary Mrs. Nanayakara, who comes to office at least half an hour before I come and arrange the files which I have to attend in the course of the day and had served me since my appointment to the Supreme Court in 2008. I also wish to acknowledge the contribution made especially by those currently in office, Jagath, Roshan, Gamini and Chandima who have done so much to help me in the press of these last two years in office.
My special thanks goes to my driver Manjula and my personal security officers for their unfailing punctuality and absolute devotion to duty.
On a personal note I remember with gratitude my parents who taught me
the basics of life and my alma mater Jaffna Hindu College. My family remains the most important bond of my life. To some degree my role as Chief Justice has expanded our horizons. I thank my wife Jayanthy for selflessly putting up with my extremely hectic work schedule and attending to the needs of the family and continuing to be my perennial source of strength. My son Thaya and daughter in law Nira deserve to be mentioned for their unwavering support given to me at all times.
Today, I step out of judicial office and go into what I know will be a stimulating new phase of my life. I know that the time is now right, when I feel the energy to do other things. I am happy to be moving on! The greatest service to mankind is to share with others the joys of living.
The more you give benefit to others, the more you do good to yourself.I am confident that this institution will be placed in charge of a person who would be a fearless defender of citizens rights so that the future of this institution would be safe, secured and protected in his hands.
This court has got an array of excellent lawyers and I can only say that I am extremely fortunate to have discharged my functions in this court amongst these lawyers who have made history in the profession.
With these words, I once again express my deepest gratitude for the honour, you have done me today and thank every one of you for your kind presence this morning.
Full text of the statement by Geoffrey Alagaratnam P.C.,
President, Bar Association of Sri Lanka at the Ceremonial Farewell to Chief Justice K. Sripavan
Your Lordship the Chief Justice, the Honourable Attorney General, His Lordship the President of the Court of Appeal, the Honourable Solicitor General and their Lordships of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, Learned Presidents Counsel and Honourable Judges of the High Court and the District and Magistrates Courts,colleagues and distinguished invitees,
We are gathered to bid farewell upon the retirement of Your Lordship the Chief Justice from the Apex Court of our land. No doubt all things must come to an end.
Your Lordship's appointment as Chief Justice came in the midst of tumultuoustimes. Our land had seen the back of an era and a Rule,which in every senseis best forgotten though it also reminds us of what should never be. Several events preceded your appointmentbeginning from the ouster of an incumbent Chief Justice to the installation of another whose memory has as it were been erased from the annals and records of our legal history. Since then the legal system and our land has been on a promised journey to restore and repair the Rule of Law and Democracy. Though over two years has lapsed since Your Lordship's appointment, we have a very long way to go. There is work in progress, a path begun by your Lordship, but by no means been smooth and even. We still continue to grope for the light and live in hope.
We of the Bar have in our own way striven to ensure professionalism at a greater level though here too there is more to be done.
As Chief Justice, Your Lordship has no doubt been accommodating and inclusive in asserting that a strong Bar and a healthy relationship and cooperation between the Bench and the Bar is critical if the legal system is to be effectiveand serve any useful purpose. We are conscious that a strong Bar is vital more so for the Independence of the Judiciary as the judiciary, in keeping with the dignity of a sacred office, does not and is not expected to have a voice of its own.
We have set out on the path of constitutional amendments, to secure the independence of the judiciary as well as its integrity, competence and transparency and the independence of the profession. Many measures are envisaged and many mechanisms are being looked at.
But we are reminded of the reality that constitutional or legal safeguards mean little unless the people within the structures and who work them do so with dignity and responsibility.
Whilst we do accept that a strong Bar is important, it cannot be ignored that the Bar itself is an equal partner with the judiciary, a reality which has to be faced upto.
Quite apart from that the contribution of the Bar to the independence of the judiciary cannot in any manner be underestimated. One need cite no examples to assert that the Bar has been at the forefront of defending the independence of the judiciary, sometimes even at risk to life and limb.
Admittedly also the contribution of the Unofficial Bar and the Official Bar to the jurisprudence emanating from our Apex Courtsis not a matter for doubt. We recently witnessed the passing away of Judge C.G Weeramantry, who at the age of 42 joined the Apex court, from the Unofficial Bar and also remembered him on the 20 February 2017 for his outstanding contribution to our law and beyond which is well known. Lest we forget we have had erudite members of the Bar, from Late Justice Mark Fernando, Late Dr.A. R. B. Amarasinghe, together with many others presently among us who adorned our courts. These individuals are among many others who meaningfully contributed in addition to many who also joined the judiciary from the Unofficial Bar at various levels of judicial office. Our memory serves us little if we are unable to recall the contribution of the Unofficial Bar to the judiciary at all levels Members of the Unofficial Bar in particular, have in the past and in keeping with our accepted rich traditions joined the judiciary through a sense of challenge and while recognising the call of duty with an element of sacrifice and more often not due to the non availability of pursuing any other calling in life.
We cannot but fail to remember that there has been a rich tradition of the judiciary comprising members of the career judiciary, and those of the Official and Unofficial Bars. The ratiocommonly referred to is 4 : 2 : 1, of career judges and members of the Official and Unofficial Bars respectively. In other words the judiciary if it is to be healthy and rich in approach and jurisprudence needs a mix of persons drawn from all these organisations. The Judiciary cannot be under the monopoly or control of any one of these organisations.
One of the areas related to the judiciary which the Bar has urged,apart from the mix of personnel in the judiciary, is the emphasis on persons of undoubted merit and competence occupying positions in higher judicial office, such as the High Court and higher courts. Towards this there has to be identified criteria to accommodate competence and merit through judicial audit or other mechanisms.
Reliance on mere seniority for entitlement or promotions though perhaps a relevant criterion cannot and should not be a compelling basis. My Lords, maturity and wisdom we hope does come with age but it is not always necessarily so. Sometimes years only confers old age..
The Bar has also consistently maintained that the composition of the Judicial Services Commission should be broad based as an independent body to include several other stake holders such as the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, the President of the Bar Association and perhaps representatives of other responsible civil society organizations. Such is also towards greater transparency in the matter of handling of matters related to tenure, promotions and disciplinary control over the minor judiciary in acknowledgement of the fact that the Judiciary serves and should represent the interests of society and is not an exclusivesecretenclave shroudedin mystery. The enactment of the recent Right to Information Act should buttress and emphasise the need for transparency and openness.
This need for a broader composition is especially where under previous dispensations there were claims of victimization and discrimination ofmembers of the minor judiciary due to the idiosyncrasies (to put it mildly) of some of Your Lordships' predecessors.
The call for a wider and broader body as representative of the JSC comes more to the forefront today in the hope that the JSC will have, the mettle to withstand and to display greater independence, transparency and consistency in its positions and deliberations bereft of external and internal pressures. The matter of appointments to the judiciary, especially the High Court and above, are specified in the Constitution and fortuitously with greater clarity after the enactment of the 19th amendment. The Constitutional Council plays its role for the apex courts while your Lordships in the Judicial Services Commission and the Attorney General, together with the President of the Republic have been identified as the persons, and the only persons , conferred with the authority or powers to appoint High Court judges. Such constitutional role having been discharged by your Lordships, no other procedure, formalities or pre-requisites apart from the impliedsuitability of a candidate can have constitutional relevance in this process of appointment.
No doubt, an informed process of consultation and verification, with important stakeholders will go a long way in ensuring the best persons are appointed. Yet, such informed consultation processes cannot be, I state here with responsibility, criteria for determining the validity of an appointment or for ex post factojustifying or varying the constitutional role undertaken and/or responsibilities of persons entrusted with the task of such appointments and which have been discharged. This duty cannot be abdicated.
Article 111(2) of the Constitution of our land is beyond ambiguity when it stipulates that ,
Judges of the High Court shall
(a) On the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and such recommendation shall be made after consultation with the Attorney General.
Thus it is the recommendation of your Lordships in the Judicial Services Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General that is material in the matter of such appointment. Any other informal consultation process, though laudable, whether defective or not, can have no bearing on the exercise of the obligation cast by Article 111(2)(a) of the Constitution on your Lordships and goes without saying that when such recommendation is provided it has been done with due care and diligence.
It is most unfortunate that there should be confusion on such a fundamental position.
I trust the words of the Prince of Denmark,in Hamlet,would not be relevant to us, when he said; Oh Judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason!
The judiciary and the Bar have enjoyed a healthy relationship of cooperation. It is our earnest endeavour that the judiciary and Bar will continue to collaborate in the interests of justice There is more to be done towards Judicial and professional independence and for its integrity and dignity. What the future holds we cannot predict. As I said there is still work in progress. You leave today and so would I. My prayers and hopes for the profession and the judiciary is greater professionalism, a sense of responsibility and dignity which is fundamental and critical if any system however perfect, is to work.I hope my prayers will be answered.
After all is said and done My Lord, the Chief Justice, it must be said that you did exercise dignity, patience, transparency, humility and consistency together with the required authority when discharging your functions on the Bench, quite in contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed under a few dispensations before you assumed office as Chief Justice. We thank Your Lordship for this.
We wish you well.

TNA may have objections in allowing government more time: Saravanapavan
As a TNA member I would not rush to say that the party has no any objection in allowing more time for the Government to implement the UNHRC recommendations, TNA Parliamentarian Easvarapatham Saravanapavan said yesterday.
He said eight TNA parliamentarians already had informed the UNHRC in writing not to grant any longer for the Government to implement its recommendations.
We should not rush to make such statements since we have to allow the UNHRC to calculate as to where the process is, MP Saravanapavan said. As we are the weaker community, its in the hand of the Government to solve the issues, he said.
Saravanapavan said the Government is discriminating the minority and added that the law is implemented differently on different communities. He questioned as to why these different communities should have different laws. He said they voted for Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Election and the Government to bring about Good Governance. But is seems that they do not understand the definition of the Good Governance.
The power is in the hands of the President and he has to resolve these issues, the MP said. But they do not resolve the issues. At the next election Maithripala Sirisena, Ranil Wickremesinghe or someone else would come and tell us why we should vote to them. But they try to fool us. They are not genuine, the MP said.
They always ask for time to implement those recommendations, MP Saravanapavan said. Why does it take so long for the Constitutional Assembly. Why should we give them more time when our people are on roads, he asked.
He said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera is telling at the UNHRC that reconciliation in the country is successful. The MP said it was totally false. How could the reconciliation take place when our people are on roads and protesting to get their own lands from the government MP Saravanapavan questioned. Why does it take long to release those lands in Puthukudiirippu, Keppapulam and Walikamam he asked.
He said TNA leader R Sampanthan had had to come into agreements before. Had they had come into agreements with them before, the things would have been in a different shape. But now we are on the verge of distrust.
He said the new generation of the Tamil outside the country are concerned over this matter, and they would not take weapons again, but they would take a different measure if the issues were not addressed properly.

Trump promises 'renewal of American spirit' in speech to Congress

President Donald Trump has promised a "renewal of the American spirit", in his first speech to Congress.
The president said a "new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp", opening a "new chapter of American greatness".
Trump condemned recent vandalism of Jewish cemeteries and a hate crime in Kansas that left an Indian man dead.
His primetime address aimed to boost his low approval ratings after a bumpy start to his presidency.
Trump speech in full
In Tuesday night's hour-long speech, Trump said of recent alleged hate crimes, "we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms".
He also touted his decisions to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and order work to start on a wall along the US-Mexico border.
Trump added that "real and positive immigration reform" was possible, opening the intriguing possibility of a major policy shift.
That line came hours after he told news anchors off the record at a White House lunch that he might be open to granting legal status to undocumented immigrants.
In his address to US lawmakers, the Republican president also talked tough on the issue, saying: "By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone."
It was a conventional presidential address, delivered conventionally. Any other year, that would be unremarkable.
In the age of Trump, however, where the ordinary seems unlikely, Tuesday night's proceedings proved decidedly unexpected.
Many of the ideas were the same - the calls for increased border security, the denunciation of illegal immigrants, the pledge to rebuild the US by buying American and hiring American, the warning that US allies must pay their fair share - but the delivery was smoother. For once, Donald Trump's delivery was spoken, not shouted.
As is typical of such addresses, the text was light on policy and marinated in cliches and political pablum, touching on most of Trump's agenda in vague generalities.
The president did lay down some markers, however, particularly on priorities in the upcoming healthcare overhaul, the size of his infrastructure spending plan and, at least elliptically, his support for border taxes.
In the end Trump did no harm and may have helped ease the concerns of Republicans rattled by a rocky start to his administration. Now Congress has to turn those promises into reality. Even with this speech, it will not be an easy task.
But the most thunderous ovation of the night came when a war widow wept as Trump paid tribute to her husband.
Navy Seal Ryan Owens died in a US raid on a suspected al-Qaeda base in Yemen, days into Trump's presidency.
"Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity," Trump told the grieving Carryn Owens, who sobbed.
It was one of the rare moments when lawmakers on both sides of the aisle applauded.
Despite the president's appeal for both parties to "unite for the good of our country", Democratic lawmakers barely clapped and some openly laughed at parts of the speech.
In his concluding remarks, the president - whose political honeymoon has been soured by acrimonious spats with the media - said "the time for trivial fights is behind us".
Among US First Lady Melania Trump's guests in the gallery on Tuesday night were three California residents whose relatives were killed by people in the US illegally.
At least a dozen Democrats brought as their guests young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children.
Former Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear delivered the Democratic rebuttal to President Trump's address, accusing Republicans of planning to "rip affordable health insurance" away from those most in need.
Trump's popularity hit a historic low for modern presidents after a month in office - just 44% of Americans think he is doing a good job, according to the Real Clear Politics poll average.
In a Fox News interview broadcast earlier on Tuesday, Trump gave himself an overall "A plus" for effort, but added that "in terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C plus".
Trump's first month in office was also overshadowed by a high-profile court defeat to his controversial travel ban and the firing of a top aide.
National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to quit after it emerged he had discussed US sanctions with a Russian diplomat and misled the White House about the conversations.

Unimaginable Donald Trump
Liz Crokin is an award-winning author, a seasoned journalist and an advocate for sex crime victims. Liz began her journey at the University of Iowa where she received a bachelors in journalism and political science.
Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semitic and Islamophobe -- did I miss anything....yup he is also deplorable. The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul.
As an entertainment journalist, Ive had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him Ive never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire couldve potentially sold a lot of magazines and wouldve been a Huge feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesnt drink alcohol or do drugs, hes a hardworking businessman. On top of that, hes one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.
Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness hes committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears.
eIn 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hills family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hills pleas for help in news reports.
eIn 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didnt hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.
eIn 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Jejune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.
eIn 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: Weve paid off your mortgage.
eIn 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach , Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump put the light on Palm Beach not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination. Foxman also noted that Trumps charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.

Walk among miracles
I have basically chartered my life says Sarath Kotagama, Emeritus Professor of Environmental Science, University of Colombo. A lot of people consider me very unorthodox and a Maverick, because to me I had to break through says Kotagama. Outstanding Personalities features this nature extraordinaire who feels that he is yet to achieve the Nobel Prize.
Q: Professor Kotagama, why do you love nature and care about life in all its wondrous forms
A. It has a lot to do with where I was brought up, my childhood. It was a village background. We didnt have the luxury of the city at all. I was basically born in Bandarawela. My upbringing was in Bibile even more remote than Bandarawela. During my formative years from a young age I was brought up with nature. I believe that that was a deciding factor. I lost the luxury of being in that habitat for 365 days. I was educated in a boarding school. So I had to go to school for three months and then come home again for one month and go back again for three months. So after five years much of my life was in a boarding. In the boarding you are with a lot of other children and in an artificial set up. So when we went back home that was real luxury for us. My father owned a lot of property so I had the opportunity to run around and do what I liked. There were a lot of streams and jungles all around.
There was no tuition and there was nothing called homework like what is happening today. So when we went home it was a real holiday. We had our village friends. The next house is 300m  400m away. The village structure meant we were higher in the status. So we had limited friends. So I went to the boarding away from the village and my village friends went to village schools. So when I come back for the holiday we become one and we enjoy that. They were basically the wild kids and we were the refined kids. That distinction was there but that enabled us to become friendlier with them because we were free to go anywhere in the premises of our own property. There were no television or radios. All that was left to us was to venture into the wild.
That was the basis of my association with nature. I will not say I did not enjoy the city with the newness the city presented, but to compare it with what was in the wild, I preferred the wilderness to the structured surroundings of the city that was there at the time. Reflecting on todays situation, a lot of children are not able to experience that wilderness. I was fortunate to experience the real wilderness. My schools were also sort of in a wilderness area.
Bandarawela also was in the wilderness. Today it is totally different. But that was what it was like at that time. All that was the background in which I grew up. But in my education, we were encouraged to appreciate nature and be more outwards. I will always remember the butterflies that flew over the grounds. At S.Thomas Gurutalawa, one weekend you have to leave the school premises on a hike. We were given bread and a can of salmon fish. Four of us were put together and we were told to hike. No guidance of a teacher or master. So it was full of outdoor adventure.
So like that we had many standard hikes at school. And when you go to a certain location you need to report to a person. So we did our own cooking and then we jumped into someones property and picked some vegetables.
We had real fun! So my teachers enabled us to be more nature oriented. At Gurutalawa we had to do farm. We had a roster. So at 4am in the morning, you have to get up and go to the farm and clean the chicken pens and collect the eggs, wash them and pack them off to the market. You do all of this before breakfast. You have to clean the cattle-sheds and wash them. So you enjoyed nature.
Q: When you see the destruction of nature all around you  the cutting of forests and the destruction of eco systems do you feel a sense of anguish at the senseless violence against nature Would you like to comment on how you feel
A. Yes I do feel a certain anguish. I have been trained in some process. I have had the opportunity of being a scientist. When you look at a problem you have to look at it in a balanced way. If someone is cutting trees you cannot jump the gun and tell him not to cut. It does not work. If someone is doing something wrong there is a reason behind that. Humans were born to do something different in nature.
When we look at the history of mankind, when we evolved and where we are today, 98 percent of our livelihood has been with nature. It is only the last 2 percent where we have been engaged in destruction. If 98 percent of our lives were with nature, how have we changed But it is that 2 percent that have made us different from the 98 percent. The conveniences that were in the livelihood of one as a hunter gatherer, till 12,000  15,000 years ago, and from there onwards to this 2 percent now is far different. The conveniences for you to get water on a tap, have electricity when you want, get seated in vehicle and drive, those conveniences did not exist then.
So you have enabled oneself to achieve conveniences through the process of unfortunately changing the natural format. Today we need these conveniences, but not at the expense of nature. This destruction is mostly happening by people who dont appreciate these times. The task is that I have personally seen the naturalness and I personally see the destruction.
Many people who have been born and bred in this modern era in the last 20 -30 years, they did not see the difference. During their formative days, they did not have a passion for what is natural. If you were born and bred in a four walled house, in the conveniences that we are loving to have, seeing the difference is a difficult task. Very unfortunately 99 percent of the destruction that is happening today is purely to achieve something that is of convenience today.
In the so called developed world there is no nature. So we are now doing what they did 10- 30 years ago. Can you find a natural forest in Europe Just imagine if we transform ourselves into that time, when they started destroying the naturalness They came through that phase and now they are in a situation where they tell everybody else  dont do this! We do blame them for what has been done. But we have to blame ourselves for what we are doing ourselves!
Q: What do you consider the milestones you have achieved in your career Are these milestones everything to do with protecting nature
A. I did what I wanted to do in life. I chartered myself towards where I wanted to go and today I am right at the top in terms of what I can do. I had the resolve to achieve what I wanted to achieve.
I have done a lot of research and contributions to science, I have taught and theorized things for the world in different ways and aspects, so if there is anything I have to achieve it would be the Nobel Prize but that is for someone to give not for me to ask! I have done the maximum- academic work and social work. There can be more! I am exemplary and I take pride in my accomplishments. I am very content that I did it my way.
Q:What is the message you want to give to society
A. I started becoming an environmental person in 1968, there onwards we were fighting the very thing we said we didnt like what was happening  cutting down of forests, pollution, all that we didnt like. But now we have a basis for why those things happened. We know the outcome of all of what has happened. The causes, background and reasons for pollution. We have all the evidence with us now. If we are to not look at that anymore and go forward, we are doing something very wrong to mankind. Because mankind is supposed to be intelligent.
The one who has the capacity to see the past and put it in perspective of the present and decide the future. So what do we have in the past We have come a pathway which is causing all these issues. We do have the benefits and the conveniences but there is very clear evidence that we are in a mess environmentally.
So if that is the present what do you project to the future You dont want to project what is bad for the future You want to project what would be better for the future. So you should change. To be more environment friendly. But how do you do that Being human, the advantage of experiencing the past is there. Other animals dont have that. And even if they have that, it is very short. It is not what they live for.
The smaller animals do not have it at all. They dont have a past memory that can make them do better for the future. We are the only animal who has this capacity. And if we cannot make use of it for the future, then there is something wrong. My message is dont forget the past, because that is very important environmentally. People are all equal but cultures, society and attitudes are not equal. Because these are all constructs that have come about over the years. The important factor is how to live with these. So, be yourself, but you have to be with everybody. You cant be alone. Humans are a social animal, so you have to be social.

## Title: Welcome Bangladesh and Hathuru

Welcome Bangladesh and Hathuru
The Bangladesh cricketers are with us for a series of two Tests, three One-Day Internationals and two T20 Internationals but unlike previous tours this one will be quite different. That difference comes in the shape of their head coach who is none other than former Sri Lanka cricketer and one-time shadow coach to the national team Chandika Hathurusingha.
Ever since Hathurusingha was appointed head coach of Bangladesh in May 2014, he has managed to change the fortunes of the team and turned them into a fighting and winning unit who has started to believe in themselves. Priority was given to discipline which eventually leads to success. No one was spared not even Bangladeshs star all-rounder Shakib-Al Hasan who was suspended for six months by the Bangladesh Cricket Board for his serious misbehaviour with Hathurusingha who had just stepped in as the team coach. This is reflected in their performances since Hathurusingha took over. Test match losses which were frequent during the pre-Hathurusingha era has now become few and far between. Since Hathurusinghas advent as coach Bangladesh has lost only seven out of 15 Tests and won 4 which include a historic maiden Test win over Alastair Cooks England side.
Where Bangladesh has made great strides is in the fifty-over One-Day Internationals where they have won 21 out of 30 matches, lost 16 and two ending in no-results. This includes historic series wins over Pakistan, India and South Africa and for the first time in their history a quarter-final place in the 2015 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand.
Over the years Bangladesh has found Sri Lanka to be a tough opponent to beat in the Test circuit and their record proves it  14 losses in 16 Tests. But under Hathurusingha who would know the strengths and weaknesses of his own countrymen and how they play their cricket, Bangladesh could fancy their chances of breaking that long standing hoodoo. Last October they recorded their maiden Test win over England and in Test matches they have frequently run up big first innings totals scoring 595-8 decl against New Zealand at Wellington in January this year  their second highest Test total, and since Hathurusingha took over gone over the 500-run mark on two other occasions against Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Bangladeshs highest Test total is at Galle - venue of the first Test of the upcoming series. On their last tour to the country in 2013 they piled up a massive 638 all out with Mushfiqur Rahim, the captain setting the pace with a brilliant double century. He was supported by Mohammad Ashraful (190) and Nasir Hossain (100) who also made hundreds. On that flat Galle track a total of eight centuries were scored that included a century in each innings from the great Kumar Sangakkara.
One of the main reasons why Bangladesh has not been able to beat Sri Lanka is because of the presence of the Big Three  Mahela Jaywawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan who have proved to be their stumbling block many a times. Of the 31 Test centuries Sri Lanka has scored against Bangladesh the trio has contributed 16 in toto.
The upcoming series sees a young Sri Lanka team in the stages of rebuilding following the retirements of the Big Three and although they struck it rich against Steve Smiths Australians whitewashing them 3-0 in July-August last year, Bangladesh who are a subcontinent team as much as Sri Lanka will know how to handle spin and they have some top quality spinners in their line-up as well.
Following the retirements of Jayawardene and Sangakkara two classy players of spin, the Lankan batting has been exposed badly especially against the turning ball where their top order batters have been found wanting. With their most experienced batter in the lineup skipper Angelo Mathews unavailable for the series because of injury the onus will be heavily on the rest of the batters to up their game and deliver if they are to prevent Bangladesh from creating history on Lankan soil.
Since their elevation to full membership of the ICC in 2000, Bangladesh has come a long way as a Test playing country and after 15 years they are showing some signs of becoming a tough competitive unit under the guidance of coach Hathurusingha. So it will be a historic occasion for the Tigers as they also call themselves when they play their 100th Test match at the P Sara Oval  a venue for many of Sri Lankas memorable Test matches notably the inaugural Test against England in 1982 and their first Test victory against India three years later.
It would be pertinent to refresh the memories of the cricketing public how Hathurusingha ended up coaching Bangladesh and not Sri Lanka. He was being groomed to take over as head coach of the national team when he was made shadow coach under Australian Trevor Bayliss. Hathurusingha had worked himself up the ladder by being a successful coach with the Sri Lanka A sides. However the decision to take disciplinary action against Hathurusingha over some trivial incident by the interim committee headed by DS de Silva in 2011 saw him pack up his bags and go to Australia where he enriched himself by coaching one of the top state sides New South Wales and later the Australias A team before taking up his present appointment with the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Sri Lankas loss has become Bangladeshs gain and the signs are ominous for the upcoming Test, ODI and T20I series.

When Rights do us wrong Pratap Bhanu Mehta
The inclusion of socio-economic rights in the Constitution does not directly lead to improved living conditions for the poor and better overall governance. Furthermore, guaranteeing these rights would transfer powers from the legislature to the judiciary, bypassing the democratic process, said Chief Executive of New Delhis Centre for Policy Research and expert in Constitutional Law Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta.
Speaking at a public forum organized by the Advocata Institute last week, Mehta argued that the drive to Constitutionalise socio-economic rights would not solve governance problems that many nations face as Constitutionalisation has not proved more effective than the traditional process of representative politics.
This comes as Sri Lankan legislators mull drafts of the new Constitution at a time when there is significant international momentum to include socio-economic rights in constitutions, as evidenced by Brazil and South Africas extensive protection of these rights.
But according to Mehta, the drive to constitutionalise socio-economic rights is both desperate and misguided. He mentioned that many of the countries that had guaranteed these rights had a history of political failure and that by guaranteeing socio-economic rights, they seek to correct these breakdowns in government.
We have a fascination for constitutionalizsng socio-economic rights because we think in the absence of making them justiciable constitutional rights, our legislators, ministers and members of parliament will not actually create conditions for their realization, Mehta said.
Distrust of the political process, for Mehta, is a driving force for increasing the scope of rights protections in Constitutions throughout the international political landscape. People believe that judges would give decisions that would improve their quality of life more than legislators.
But this idea is erroneous since most governments lack institutional know how to deliver these rights.
The paradox is that if you were in a country where the legislators did not give you these things as part of the normal give and take of representative politics, it is highly unlikely that even if you constitutionalise them and make them justiciable, you would actually have effective institutions that could deliver these rights, he said.
Even if you constitutionalise socio economic rights, while judges make rulings in favour of the people, it is still up to the government to carry out these rulings. Mehta pointed to a case in India where the government was ignoring the ruling and despite a contempt of court case that is the works, the government had not budged from their stance but continues not to honour the verdict.
Moreover, the idea that socio-economic rights guarantees could act as replacements for broad reforms of the political processes was fundamentally flawed, he argued.
If you think that constitutionalising rights was going to be a substitute for solving governance problems, then I am sure that you are in for a rude shock, while this is largely what the comparative evidence was telling us.
Mehta pointing to Scandinavian countries as examples of those who had achieved many of these rights protections by using the legislative and democratic processes in favour of actually constitutionalising them.
The idea that constitutionalising a right is a necessary condition for achieving a particular goal, is simply a false idea, he said.
Furthermore, the very conception that judges are more beholden to the people than politicians and capable of delivering rights is also misguided.
We have an idea that judges as a class and as an institution, would be insulated from politics, because they are insulated from politics and they would do those things you want.
If a society reaches a point where it feels it needs to repose more trust in judges than it does in politicians, then you probably have a deeper corrosion of democracy. You are in much bigger trouble, he said.
Mehta indeed, repeatedly circled back to his belief that representative politics and neither the authors of the constitution nor members of the judiciary, should be responsible for guaranteeing various rights.
After having defined constitutions as social contracts that citizens who will be governed by these documents must find legitimate, Mehta argued that constitutionalising socio-economic rights closes the space for political, economic and social debate.
We could all agree that having more healthcare is a good idea, that having more education is a good idea, that having better workers welfare is a good idea. But we might disagree on the institutional architecture thats going to produce that outcome, he said.
Instead of silencing those who disagree with constitutional methods of solving these issues, Mehta once again pointed to his preference for democratic politics to determine how to solve these issues.
Yet another issue the Indian scholar cited was the necessity of having solutions to socio-economic problems open to iterative re-examination as global, national and regional circumstances change.
For example, people could disagree as to how to best protect workers rights. And, as the economy changes, a certain course of action might present itself as the best option. It is easier to adjust to this change through legislative processes than to literally re-write the Constitution.
The challenges, the danger of constitutionalising is that you may be constitutionalising on premises that shift very fast due to economies change and so forth, he said.
Better for Poor
While many proponents of guaranteeing socio economic rights in the new Constitution point to the supposed benefits for the poor and dispossessed, Mehta vehemently argued that at least in India, rights protections have not sufficiently aided the underprivileged.
While explaining that during the 1990s, the Indian Supreme Court promulgated all sorts of universal rights, such as the rights to shelter, health and education, Mehta argued that these protections had not caused governance or quality of life to improve.
With respect to the right to education, Mehta argued that the quality of schooling had actually declined since the right was passed.
The court pronounced the right to education and we now have a right to education bill as a result. But this right to education bill was passed the day Indias enrolment in primary education had already reached 100%. So the right came after the fact. But more importantly, the right focuses largely on the input side of education.
So you must have a school of so many square feet with other requirements which have absolutely no bearing on learning outcomes. In fact, Indias learning outcomes had worsened after that right was pronounced, he said.
He also pointed to the failings of Indias right to a clean environment as evidenced by the fact that the country had some of the worlds most polluted air and water.
Though Mehta did admit the guaranteeing socio-economic rights did not pressurise the executive for administrative problems, he argued that a central issue in guaranteeing these rights is that the courts still relied on state political mechanisms to enact their rulings.
Beyond a point, the courts did not have the power to actually have these rights enforced.You can promulgate these rights, but the courts do not beyond a point, have the power to design appropriate remedies, he said.
The final case he examined was Brazils right to health, which he claimed had worked to empower the rich instead of the poor.
There are over ten thousand right to health cases per year in Brazil and according to Mehta, the rich are using their money and power to win better treatment which the state must pay for.
The fact that Brazilians have an unspecified right to health, allows people to demand expensive treatment, like dialysis machines, that the court could grant. But the cost is borne by the Brazilian taxpayer, so this right to health permits those with access to good lawyers and disposable income to drain the healthcare budget, thereby leaving out the poor.
It is for reasons such as these that Mehta argued that if Sri Lanka chooses to include socio-economic rights protection in its constitution, which he said he believes would happen, the country should clearly specify what these national laws and practices are.
My only recommendation for consideration is that if any constitution does end up with socio-economic rights, it should at the same time provide a clear legislative framework to put underneath those rights, he said.
Most of Mehtas talk focused on the downsides of including these rights in the constitution, but he did that guaranteeing these rights has expressive value and could allow courts to hold the executive to account on some procedural issues.
That being said, he warned that constitutionalising the rights without proper legislative frameworks could end up being disastrous to the country.
You risk having the worst of nightmares, which is an economy governed by courts, power taken out away from legislature and democratic processes and a perverse outcome where the rights can be used more to buttress the rights of the privileged than to protect the weak and the vulnerable, which is what the rights are meant for, he said.

Where Tigers roam
In her newest research work on Tiger mechanism across the world, Priyanka Kurugala attempts to present a sharp analysis on the people of Sri Lanka who had faced the LTTE terrorism that destroyed the heritage of the country whilst grabbing rights of the majority leading to declined human ties. She tries to bring out something about the Buddhist struggle on rebuilding their grossly vandalized heritage beyond the period highlighted by LTTE terrorist activity.
Unpalatable bitter truth would naturally lead to hyper criticism and is expected to be controversial in the present day. Nobody generally raised their voice against Buddhists and their heritage in Sri Lanka, but on the other hand, she talks about the victimized Hindus in Sri Lanka who have undergone a struggle of their own to protect tangible and intangible cultural values amid turbulence. Influences on mainstream Catholics, Christians, Muslims and other ethnoreligious minorities practicing their cultures have also been discussed.
To surface this message, Priyanka Kurugala was able to use her exposure in the local and foreign stages and knowledge that she had accumulated through books, newspapers and internet. It has been Sri Lankan Tamils such as Thramalingam Logeswaran whom she met in Europe, who still prefer living in the sovereign unitary island that paved the way to the development of this product.
Migrations of Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus have not only led to transforming the local culture, it has also influenced the European culture, not forgetting the political landscape.
The author has brought in thoughts of political leaders, leaderships of organizations, scholars and politicians who contributed to prevent every episode of the countrys tri-decade of terror. This book is an investigative piece of literature that is a genuine attempt to reflect each event of relevance, experience and dialogue leading to separatism and surrounding gloomy realities.

Zootopia would be the crash of  animated Oscar winners
By the time the Oscars ceremony rolls around, the emotion associated with its more predictable results has already been absorbed or dissipated: Whatever feelings La La Lands all-but-certain Best Picture win might provoke, the fact that its been the agreed-upon front-runner since early last September means weve had ample time to reconcile ourselves to that result.
But every year, there are a handful of Oscars results that excite the passions of even the most jaded awards-watcher, whether its because of a surprising win/loss or simply the staggering (in)justice at play. If the pundits are right, theres little chance that anything other than Zootopia will take home the award for Best Animated Film on Sunday night. But that likely, long-predicted win is still going, to use an appropriately animalistic metaphor, to stick in my craw.
Zootopia is not a bad movie, exactly, although it is, by a conservative estimation, the fourth-most-good of the Best Animated Film nominees.
It lacks the visual splendor of Kubo and the Two Strings, the wistful simplicity of The Red Turtle, the old-school expertise of Moanato say nothing of the too-painful-for-live-action trauma of My Life as a Zucchinibut its solidly made, nicely acted, especially by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, and it lands the occasional great joke. (Whatever you think of the rest of the movie, the scene of sloths going about their business at the Department of Motor Vehicles at a speed that would make molasses impatient is a clinic in comic timing.) Its a movie you can watch over and over againsay, at the behest of a particularly insistent second-graderand not get sick of.
But thats not why Zootopia is going to win. No, Zootopia has apparently risen above the rest of the pack because its an Important Movie, and that is where our troubles begin. It took critics no time at all to pick up on the idea that the movies central conflict, in which a minority population is stigmatized and threatened by a fearful majority, could be read as an allegory about systemic racism. Although predators, represented by wily fox Nick Wilde (Bateman), and prey, like dogged rookie cop Judy Hopps (Goodwin), have lived side-by-side for generations, the memory of a time when they were natural enemies still lingers, and its easily exploited by the movies villains, who contrive to make it seem as if the predators are returning to their instinctive prey-eating ways.
Suggesting Zootopia can heal the legacy of racism is grandiose, and, in the service of getting the movie an Oscar, mildly obscene.
The Root headlined its Zootopia take, Yes, Disney Has Made a Movie About White Supremacy and the War on Drugs, and Slates Dan Kois wrote the movie was 100 percent about racial profiling. But to paraphrase Roger Ebert, what a movie is about matters less than how it is about it, and that ought to hold especially true when it comes to crowning one the best of the year.
Zootopia is, as nudge-nudge lines about how only a bunny can call another bunny cute and sheep dont like people touching their wool without asking, most definitely about race, but its about it in a glib, shallow, and occasionally racist way. Its Crash for kids.
Zootopia only gets a passand then somebecause its a movie aimed at children. Its a welcome issue for a kids movie to tackle, Kois wrote, and it should be interesting to see what kinds of responses this well-marketed, highly-anticipated soon-to-be-blockbuster receives, and what conversations between parents and children it sparks.
Zootopia does indeed spark those conversations: As I left my screening, I walked by a black father with two young boys, one of whom asked him why one group of animals was so mean to the other. The man asked back, Why do you think But it ought to spark other conversations as well, about how much credit we give a Hollywood movie for simply acknowledging that racism exists, and about the implications of telling that story in a context where the majoritys fear of the minority actually has a rational basis. The violent history of Zootopias predators isnt a fiction created for the purpose of oppressing them. Its history, however distant, rooted in an instinct that, the movie eventually suggests, can be suppressed but never fully eradicated. Once a predator, always a predator.
Especially with a little adult guidance, children are perfectly capable of taking the parts of Zootopia that apply to the real world and leaving the rest. But the grown-ups who vote for Academy Awards should know better. Instead, theres every sign the academy is preparing to pat itself on the back for making the relevant choice in the animated film categorya self-serving narrative that the movies directors and producers have heavily promoted on the awards campaign trail.
Its become a more important topic since  Disney released the movie, co-director Bryan Howard told IndieWire. And having it in this form in a movie, with animation and animal characters, can bring some healing to a country that feels pretty torn up and on edge.
Zootopia is a decent enough movie, but suggesting that it has a part to play in healing the centuries-old legacy of racism or the more recent trauma of Trumps election and the resurgence of open white supremacy is grandioseand when that idea is deployed in the service of getting the film an Oscar, mildly obscene. Its also more than a little odd that the narratives about how Zootopia will bridge Americas racial divide never seem to include Moana, which unlike Zootopiaor, for that matter, the Japan-set Kuboactually cast actors of color in its leading roles.
Voting for Zootopia is a way for academy members to pat themselves on the back for their social awareness, and perhaps also a preemptive inoculation against the inevitable charge that in picking La La Land over Moonlight or Hidden Figures for Best Picture, theyve once again opted for bleached-white Tinseltown escapism over stories with real-world relevance. (La La Land is more complicated than those arguments suggest, but thats another essay.) Zootopia doesnt deserve Best Animated Film, but more to the point, academy members dont deserve the pats on the back theyll give themselves for voting for it.
