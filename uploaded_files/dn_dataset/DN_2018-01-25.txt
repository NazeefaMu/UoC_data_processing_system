SPEAK UP!
For youngsters looking to ready themselves for the real world, public speaking is a must. Building confidence in public speaking is an important life skill with many important real-life applications. Toastmasters helps youngsters across the world to voice their opinions on a public stage without passing out. 
Speech contests are a Toastmasters tradition. Each year thousands of Toastmasters compete in the Humorous, Evaluation, Table Topics and International speech contests. Shamen Sameera from Serendib Toastmasters Club became the second Sri Lankan to win the Humourous Speech Contest Championship of District 82 Toastmasters International at Reverberations 2017 held in Chennai, India, from December 1 to 3, 2017. The 26 year old competed against around 700 Toastmasters from Sri Lanka and India to win the competition.
Humorous Speech is poles apart from stand-up comedy. You deliver a structured speech which includes a story. You need to insert humour into the tale. The speech should not exceed seven and a half minutes. The judges grade you according to the reaction of the audience. Therefore you need to connect with the viewers to score, Shamen said.
Shamen SameeraPictures by Ruwan de Silva
He noted that they are allowed to select any topic of their choice and practice their speeches. Love, marriage, social issues like traffic etc are some of the most frequent topics that past contestants have focused on. Shamen wished to try his hand at giving something different to the audience.
I selected topics like being bullied and cowardice. Such speeches also embody a message like just because you look fragile you need not give into such treatment. You need to survive and stand up to such people. I wanted people to accept the fact that it is ok not to be a very aggressive person. I also informed them not to put themselves down because they feel afraid when I spoke about being a coward at Reverberations 2017, Shamen explained.
He believes that this out of the box thinking was his success formula.
Everybody has faced odds that they cannot beat. Therefore they were able to relate to the topic. I kept my terms simple so that even a small child is able to understand my jokes. Sometimes contestants get carried away and they try to incorporate humour which is not appropriate for everyone. The best kind of humour is the kind that is directed at your own self. I follow this rule and make sure that everybody is laughing with me, he added with a smile.
The judges were scattered among the audience. The contestants have no idea who they are. Therefore they need to give equal attention to each and every member in the audience.
Shamen notes that generally the speakers deliver their speeches with a straight face. However Shamen took a different route yet again and managed to win over the audience with his strategies.
How do you expect others to laugh if your speech cannot make you laugh I did not hide the fact that I am enjoying myself on stage. So I joined in with the audiences laughter. I connected with the audience by smiling and waving at them even on the way to the stage, he said adding that he believes that is why people reacted to his speech more than they did to those of the other contestants.
As an active Toastmaster Shamen has been contesting in all four types of Toastmasters contests: International Speech Contest, Evaluation Contest, Table Topics Contest and Humourous Speech Contest at the Division Level in Sri Lanka for three consecutive years. He notes that the Table Topics Contest is the toughest because you are not given any preparation time since the topic is given then and there at the contestant chair.
However for Sri Lankans, the most challenging competition is the Humourous Speech because Indians are gifted with the ability to make the audience crack up. They have a simple storytelling technique too, he stressed.
He said that since he has taken part in the competition for three continuous years, he felt that he has taken a stride forward to better his techniques each year.
An old boy of Royal College, Colombo, Shamen said that he has been mainly focusing on his studies during his school days.
Receiving the award for winning the Division Humorous Speech Contest of Division F
I was very studious. I even slept for about three of four hours a day because I was so into studies. I was not involved in extracurricular activities but soon realized their worth when I took part in the CIMA Global Business Challenge. I had all the knowledge with me to win that competition but when it came to delivering the presentation I felt that I could not deliver my ideas in a manner which will convince the judges to send me from the Sri Lankan finals to the global finals. I realized that I need to brush up my soft skills. I joined Serendib Toastmasters club in early 2015, he recalled how it all began.
Queried on what makes a good speaker and Shamen said that a person has to be patience and humble enough to learn from others.
The three trophies he won at the Humorous Speech Contests
Accept others advice and try to sharpen your skills. Spend time on gathering more knowledge by listening to other speakers on the Internet. Pick a role model and take whatever you feel suits your setup. Build up your own unique identity without being a copy of another, he opined.
Shamen had ranked Island 11th and Colombo district sixth place in the Commerce stream at the 2010 GCE Advanced level examination in 2010. He graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree at Colombo University with first class honours. He is also a CIMA Sri Lanka prize winner and had achieved world rank sixth place in the TOP CIMA case-study examination held in May 2013. He is the Vice President for Public Relations of Serendib Toastmasters for 2017/18.
Shamen is employed at the Strategy and Risk Department of L B Finance PLC. He was a part of the team which had been instrumental in setting up of the first overseas subsidiary of LB Finance PLC in Myanmar recently.
He notes that he has two role models: Bimal Perera who is his supervisor at work and Americas Got Talent 2015 contestant comedian Drew Lynch.
Lynch has a stutter but despite his disability he inspires people by getting on the stage and delivering brilliant speeches. I was motivated by his talent, Shamen expressed.
Becoming a member of a Toastmasters club adds immense value to your life. There is nothing called a free meal. You need to sacrifice a bit of your time to gain something. Consider it as an investment. If you can invest in one area and develop in multiple areas I believe that you can achieve greater success in life. I was a Toastmaster for about one year when I faced my first interview. I managed to pass it with flying colours because I was able to project my talents in a manner to win over the interview panels trust and confidence. Now I have the ability to go to board meetings and do presentations because I know how to address the listeners and what they wish to hear, he concluded.

Speaker turns down Ravi's request
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya turned down a request by UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake to make a special statement in Parliament yesterday on the grounds that it does not come under the purview of a Privilege Matter or Personal Explanation.
The Speaker, rejecting the repeated requests by the MP, stood his ground that he could not allow the MP to make the statement as per the Standing Orders. He asked the MP to abide by the decision of Parliament.
Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who was in the House with a ten page prepared statement in hand, insisted that he wanted to read out certain sections of the Bond Commission report. I secured a copy of the report through an RTI application after a payment of Rs 5,000.Why cannot I read it he questioned.
The Speaker told MP Karunanayake that he may speak on the Bond report on the date Parliament takes up the debate in that regard.
I dont understand as to how this Parliament does not provide an opportunity to speak when the privileges are impacted. I have very clearly and emphatically mentioned that I would be making a statement today. I am lost for an answer. The Parliament staff came up with flimsy answers. After 24 years in Parliament I see an absolute case of injustice. I must be told as to why Im not permitted, Karunanayake complained.
Karunanayake argued that precedence showed that MPs had been allowed to make similar statements in the past under Privileges. We came to usher in good governance and I have always acted in line with good governance principles, he commented.
The Speaker said it was very clear that the statement does not fall under the Privileges. That is the explanation that I can offer you. I am saying this to you with due respect for your seniority, the Speaker replied.
If you do not allow me to read out my statement in the House, I will send it to all the media and websites telling them that this was what I was going to disclose, warned MP Karunanayake.
That is your decision. I act according to the Standing Orders and I have the final responsibility with regard to them, the Speaker replied.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena said they would like to hear what MP Karunanayake wanted to say on the content of the Bond report. A heated exchange of words occurred thereafter between MPs Karunanayake and Gunawardena which ended up in insulting remarks at each other.

Conference on Disarmament
Sri Lanka assumes   Presidency
Sri Lanka has called on member states of the Conference on Disarmament (CD)to seek to bring back the necessary attention at the highest political levels to the CD, in order to maintain the integrity and credibility of the Conference, as well as to create forward movement and momentum,states a press release from the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN, Geneva.
Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha made this call yesterday (January 23) on the occasion of Sri Lanka assuming the responsibility of the CD as its first President of the 2018 session. Sri Lanka assumes the Presidency of the CD after 11 years.
Addressing the plenary, Ambassador Aryasinha noted that Sri Lanka assumes the Presidency of the Conference at a time this august body has critical challenges and some opportunities before it. He said the challenges include the prevailing complex global security environment, the increasing threat posed by non state actors - with global anxieties about nuclear weapons at their highest since the end of the Cold War, the advancement in military technology, as well as parallel discussions and deliberations that are taking place outside the Conference. The Ambassador observed that it is imperative that the Conference gives due recognition to the contributions from civil society, the academia and entrepreneurs in the field of disarmament.
The Ambassador said though presently facing a two decade long impasse in the CD, there also are reasons to be hopeful. The CD had made progress at times when the international security environment was even more complex and challenging, it is the forum where all key stakeholders are available to engage, and with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the entire UN architecture reformulating its work programmes to better respond to the realization of the SDGs within its respective mandates, the CD could also contemplate as to how its work could contribute to the collective realization of the 2030 Agenda, given the importance of durable peace for sustainable development, and vice versa.
Ambassador Aryasinha said to enhance international security, the pace of multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation must be accelerated, taking into account the security interests of all States and on the basis of the principle of undiminished security for all.
He noted that the CDs continued inaction sets a negative precedent by not measuring up to effectively preventing or responding to new and emerging security challenges through the adoption of appropriate international instruments.
He urged all Members States to avoid the temptation of subjecting the work of this Conference to the vagaries of the ever changing international strategic landscape, and instead to endeavor to harness its potential to build common ground to achieve collective security
In this context, he emphasized that the ultimate burden rests on all Members of the Conference, to remain engaged in trying to build mutual trust and confidence as well as to find common ground in order to reach consensus. He urged delegations in Geneva, to while defending respective national positions in the CD, to communicate and advice the respective capitals on where flexibilities and new thinking could pave the way to positive developments and to deliver tangible results. We should also seek to bring back the necessary attention at the highest political levels to the CD, in order to maintain the integrity and credibility of the Conference, as well as to create forward movement and momentum, he added.
Ambassador Aryasinha who recalled Sri Lankas steadfast contribution and consistent engagement in the field of disarmament over several decades, reiterated Sri Lankas commitment and dedication to work closely with all members of the CD, in an open and transparent manner in discharging its duty as the President of the Conference.
Addressing the opening session of the CD, UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu said, the time had come to ask once again what the CD and the entire United Nations disarmament machinery was prepared and able to do to effectively address the challenges posed by the present state of affairs. She went on to reiterate the commitment of the UN Secretary-General to the Conference on Disarmament and to considering how to give new momentum and impetus to global disarmament efforts.
Speaking in the general discussion were Peru, Bulgaria on behalf of European Union, Germany, Norway, Brazil, Sweden, Mexico, Turkey, Romania, Canada, Australia, Spain, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, France, United Kingdom, Belarus, Netherlands, Indonesia, Chile, and China.
The Sri Lankan delegation to the Conference on Disarmament included Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Mrs. Samantha Jayasuriya, Minister Counsellor Sashika Somaratne and First Secretary Mrs. Mafusa Lafir.

Can still qualify with a loss, on a better net run rate than Zim
Sri Lanka face dominant  Bangladesh
DHAKA: Its make or break for Sri Lanka as they face host Bangladesh in the final group match of the one-day tri-nation here on Thursday.
Sri Lanka have managed to overcome their run of defeats at the start of the series and the loss of their captain Angelo Mathews to keep themselves in the contention for the final.
They were also handed a lifeline by Bangladesh, who beat Zimbabwe in the last game, to keep the series open.
Now up against hosts, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will hope to complete their turnaround and seal a spot in the final.
They will once again look to Thisara Perera to provide them an all-round impact as he has been doing throughout the tri-series.
Sri Lanka can still qualify with a loss, given that they have a better net run rate than bottom-placed Zimbabwe. They will, however, hope to not leave it to that chance.
Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal said that the initial losses in the tri-nation tournament spurred the team on to complete a turnaround and make the final.
Sri Lanka lost their opening two games respectively against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and were needed to win both their remaining games as well as have other results go their way if they were to make it to the next stage.
The managed to beat Zimbabwe in their third game, while Bangladesh handed them a further lifeline by beating the African country again. Now, Sri Lanka are left with their fate in their own hands. A win would see them through to the final against the hosts, Bangladesh.
In this kind of tournament, if you lose the first two games, its always tough. But sometimes, it gives you more confidence and morale to come back strong, Chandimal told reporters at Dhaka.
As a team, were looking at it that way. We will have something up our sleeves as a team, and were hoping to get a good result tomorrow, he added.
We need to play it like any other game. We need to focus on what we can control. Thats what were going to do as a team.
Chandimal added that they know their opponent will be tough to beat as their performance on home soil gives them an edge.
We all know that Bangladesh - when they are playing on home soil - are really good as a team. Theyve played some outstanding cricket through this series, so the credit goes to the Bangladesh team, said Chandimal.
We can all make mistakes. Cricket is like that. Theyre on their home soil but as a team we need to play to our strengths. Thats what we want to do.
Chandimal said that injuries remained a major concern for them in the recent past as it hampered their balance. They have already lost Angelo Mathews and Kusal Perera due to injuries.
In the last one and a half years, injuries have been a major concern for us. Once the players get injured, you cant get the right combination. We have concerns, but the boys will come back strong.
Chandimal added that the management isnt very sure of what kind of wicket they will be playing on on Thursday.
They are preparing 2-3 wickets. We couldnt tell which wicket they are going to give tomorrow. Were still looking to see what they are going to give tomorrow. Im not sure why its that complicated. Were ready to play on any wicket, he summed up.
Bangladesh, on the other hand, have been on a rampant run. Three wins in as many games, and all with a bonus point, shows just how dominating the hosts have been in the tri-series.
Unlike in the past, they havent relied on one or two players to put up a show, instead getting performances from multiple angles to put in clinical efforts in their three wins. They would want to wrap up the group stage with another thumping win.

Stripe to ditch Bitcoin payment support
Stripe, the firm which helps more than 100,000 businesses do financial transactions online, is to scrap support for Bitcoin payments. It said Bitcoin users now saw the virtual currency largely as an asset to be traded, rather than something to make payments with.
Fewer online merchants wanted to accept the cryptocurrency, it added.
Rising fees and longer transaction times as a result of price fluctuations also lessened its appeal, Stripe said.
Customers of the US-based payments firm pay a fee to Stripe each time it processes a payment. Clients include Lyft, Deliveroo, Grab and Target. In 2014, it became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments.
At the time Stripe said it hoped Bitcoin would become a way for people in places with low credit card penetration or prohibitively high credit card fees to do transactions online. But the virtual currency was now better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange, it said.
There has been a huge surge of interest in the digital currency over the past year or so, driven largely by its rapid increase in price. But that demand has also led to huge swings in price, with Stripe saying the volatility meant the time needed to complete a sale had risen. By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the wrong amount, Stripe's product manager Tom Karlo said in his blog. Bitcoin transaction fees had also risen a great deal resulting in a decrease in demand from Stripe's customers to accept Bitcoin payments, he said.
For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of US dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires, Mr Karlo wrote.
Because of this, we've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we've seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. (BBC)

Tea industry fares better in 2017
The Sri Lanka tea industry has fared better 2017 with total crop increase of 5 percent from 292m/kg in 2016 to 307m/kg in 2017 despite the many setbacks, including a temporarily ban on tea exports to Russia, Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
Speaking at an annual review of the Tea Board, the Minister of Plantation Industries said that although there has been a considerable drop in exports to countries like Iran and Syria last year, access and opportunities to new markets have paved the way for a positive outlook.
During 2017, the cumulative Colombo Tea Auction fetched an average price of US$ 4.07 per kilo as against US$ 3.19 per kilo in 2016. We have increased the price and the Colombo Tea Auction fetches the best price in the world, he said. Weve increased our production and are looking at ways to ensure stringent quality checks.
In 2017, Ceylon Tea exports was at 289 million kg and export revenue was at Rs.233 billion.
Turkey has emerged as the largest buyer of Ceylon Tea with 35.4 million kilos followed by Iraq with 31.4 million kilos, Russia with 31 million kilos and Iran with 24.9 million kilos.
Exports to the Middle East have dipped due to socio-economic unrest and political instability. It is noteworthy that in spite of the various geo-political conditions prevailing in the Middle East and North Africa, around 53% of exports goes to this region, with Iran, Jordan and Lebanon accounting for 12%, 17% and 19% respectively.
The Minister also stressed that China remained the fastest growing market for Ceylon Black Tea. A quantity of 9.9 million kilos was exported in 2017 with an increase of 30% in volume terms over 2016. An analysis of the past 5 years also supports this fact with exports having been 3 million in 2012.

Top Tips  for radiant skin
Exfoliate
This one is an age-old piece of advice, but today, theres lots of different products to choose from to help you exfoliate for your skin type. Whichever one you choose, make sure it forms an essential and regular part of your skincare routine. You cant expect to have glowing skin without first removing the dulling debris on its surface.
Drink Water
Water is perhaps the most important and glow-inducing ingredient for your skin. If you dont keep your cells hydrated, they wont be healthy, and you will have a very dull and fatigued complexion.
Drinking at least 2 litres of water a day will not only help to keep your skin moisturised, but will also flush out toxins from your system so they dont build up in your cells.
If you dont like drinking plain water, try a fruit infusion. You can use different fruits, such as Strawberries, Lemons and Apples, which all add flavour without any nasty ingredients. Plus, the vitamins and antioxidants from these fruits are brilliant for your skin too.
Do a Facial Massage
If you suffer from the occasional breakout, dullness or skin fatigue, it could be that your circulation is poor and toxins are building up in your skins cells.
A facial massage helps to encourage circulation and lymphatic drainage, so that these pollutants in the skin are removed. Once they are flushed out of your skin, you will notice an improvement in its appearance, as it will look a lot healthier and more luminous.
Facial massages can also help to relieve sore and stressed out areas on your face, reducing tension headaches, under-eye puffiness and congestion. If you have sinus problems, and suffer from blocked noses, streaming eyes and sore temples, try massaging all round your face and you will notice a considerable difference in how you feel in only a matter of days.
Get Beauty Sleep
Alongside water, sleep is an absolute beauty essential. When you dont get enough sleep, it shows up in your skin, your mood and your mental energy.
While you sleep, your skin works to repair itself. So, if you are suffering from breakouts, dehydration or dullness, its during the night that your skin will revive and rejuvenate.
Try incorporating overnight beauty treatments into your regime to help the process along and keep your complexion glowing. One of our favourites is the Darphin Ideal Resource Overnight Cream, which works in synergy with your cells to support them as you sleep. It also removes surface dead skin cells so you awake looking fresh and bright.
If you do suffer from restless nights and struggle to get some shut-eye, try using a sleep remedy, such as a pillow spray. The This Works Pillow Spray contains Lavender, Vetivert and Chamomile, to soothe anxiety and tension and help you drift off to sleep easily.
Double Cleanse
Cleansing is a clear way to beautiful skin. Not only does it help to remove the makeup from the day, but it also removes all dirt, oil and impurities so your skin can actually repair itself overnight. That is of course, when you double cleanse.
A single cleanse unfortunately just isnt strong enough to remove all the grime from your skin. Using an oil-based cleanser to start will attract all the oil from your skin, and then your second cleanse can be used to actually deep clean your pores.
Try Cliniques Take the Day off Cleansing Balm as your first cleanse. Its balmy formula melts into the skin upon application to dissolve all makeup and dirt on your skin. Plus, its fragrance free formula is suitable for even the most sensitive of skin types. Then, go in with the Lancme Miel En Mousse Cleanser, which transforms into a velvet like foam to deep cleanse.
Eat your Vitamins
Eating vitamin-rich foods, including vegetables and fruits is a sure-fire way of improving the health of your skin and the appearance of your complexion.
Try adding in foods like Salmon and Tuna, which are rich in Omega Fatty Acids to keep the skin hydrated and moisturised, while Watermelon and Cucumber are brimming with water and antioxidants to keep your skin protected against environmental aggressors.
Read more about our 3 favourite recipes and ingredients for glowing skin on our blog.
Use a Face Mask
If you are suffering from a dulling complexion that needs an instant pick-me-up, a face mask is a quick way to solve it.
Look out for words like radiance, detox and charcoal; all of which usually correlate to masks that either infuse the skin with hydration, or decongest it to remove the dead skin that could be causing the dullness.
Do Exercises
Exercise is such an easy way to get glowing skin as the increase in heart rate pushes blood around the body and encourages the removal of toxins. By doing just 30 minutes of exercise 3 times a week, you will soon notice an improvement in the health of your complexion, as well as in your overall mood and energy levels too.

Turner studied about  mental health for  Dark Phoenix
Actor Sophie Turner has said that she read a lot on mental health issues to prepare for her role in X-Men: Dark Phoenix.
According to source, the The Thirteenth Tale star, who will reprise her role of Jean Grey in the film, believes the movie is also a personal story apart from being an amazing superhero story.
Once I got the script through, I realised that not only were we telling this amazing superhero story, but we were also telling a very personal story as well. One which required research into mental health issues because that is a big part of what drives the story, Turner said.
I mainly drew inspiration from multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia, as it really is about duality, this movie. Darkness and light - thats all within her. This sense of her being a completely other persona and struggling with that, she added. PTI

The Taste of Britain Curry Festival at Hilton Colombo
Very Simple, Very Tasty and of Course Very British!
A team of British chefs are here in Colombo to showcase their talent at this British food promotion, which is organised by the UK trade magazine, Curry Life.
Hot, mild, creamy or dry, any way you like it, the fact still remains: CURRY has come to be the UKs number one national food. The curry, which originates from the Indian Sub-Continent, now outsells even fish and chips. Some twelve thousand curry restaurants in the UK cater to ever-increasing love of British curry cuisine.
In the UK We have a well established National Curry Week which is celebrated in October each year,  said British High Commissioner James Dauris at the media launch held on Tuesday.
Curry powder started to become available in the UK in the 1700s and the first curry powder recipes were published in 1780.
The taste of Britain Curry Festival, is indeed a celebration of a branch of British cooking which has its roots in the historical relationship between Britain and the Asian region, the High Commissioner noted.
Speaking at the media launch Festival Director & Organizer Syed Belal Ahmed said that the British Cuisine is doing fantastically well.
The aim of the festival is to showcase the best of British Cuisine and the work of some of the UK's most creative chefs. The festival team will also be going on a food trail to taste local cuisine in Colombo and get inspiration from the famous Sri Lankan dishes for their menu back home in Britain, he added.
Rupert Rowley, one of the most experienced and celebrated Michelin Starred chefs in the UK, heads the Taste of Britain team to Colombo. The other award winning chefs are Vijay Singh Panwar from London, AbulMonsur from Chatham, Kent and Syeduz Zaman Kamran from Warrington, Cheshire and Shamsul Islam, Food Hygiene Specialist, who provides food safety and quality compliance. They are here to produce a range of new dishes giving a spicy twist to traditional British meals as well as classic high street favourites like Chicken Tikka Masala, Balti and Ceylon dishes.
British food for me is a passion. My hobby is cooking. Every day we see new things, so many new ingredients, so many new ways of cooking. It is not only about cooking, but also about trying new things, said Michelin Star Chef Rupert Rowley at the media launch.
Rupert will be showcasing Sri Lankan seafood inspired British menu, while his curry chef colleagues will offer a classic British curry menu during the festival.

WH Smith High Street sales still falling
WH Smith's High Street sales have continued to fall, but the bookseller and stationer has had another rise in sales at its travel outlets.
In the 20-week period to 20 January, sales in High Street stores were down 5%, with like-for-like sales falling by 4%, in line with expectations.
The company said this was partly down to fewer spoof humour books being sold compared with the same time last year.
However, total sales in travel were up 7%, with like-for-like sales rising 3%. Total sales were flat year-on-year and like-for-like sales down 1% over the 20-week period.
Like-for-like sales, a common measure of retailers' performance, strip out the effect of new store openings.
The pattern, both on the High Street and at travel outlets, was unchanged from earlier in 2017. Group chief executive Stephen Clarke said: "Our travel business now accounts for almost two-thirds of the group's annual profit and we continue to deliver strong sales growth across all our key channels.
"This was driven by ongoing investment in the business and continued growth in passenger numbers in our airport stores over the Christmas period." He added that the company's UK store programme was on track, with 15 new units expected to open this year.
The new large airport stores at Gatwick and Stansted opened during the reporting period and both performed well. The company will continue with hits cost efficiency programme and expects full-year cost savings to be about 12m, slightly ahead of its target. BBC News

''You Must Live Till You Die''
If I were given the chance to meet three favorite writers I have never met, I know I will spend an awfully long time trying to choose from a long list; some might be violets by the mossy stone, like the Nepalese poet, Prakash Subedi, some might be world renowned like Zadie Smith, Hanif Kureishi, Toni Morrison. But one writer I am certain I would never want to meet is Salman Rushdie. For all I know that steely glint in his eyes would freeze me to death; in that sardonic half-smile I might read disapproval and contempt. And yet, I have read most of his books and liked some and been confused by the others, from Midnights Children to The Satanic Verses to Haroun and the Sea of Stories and now, The Golden House out last year. Perhaps my fears have no ground. Judging by the stories of those who have met him, Salman Rushdie might not be a big bad wolf after all.
According to Jack Livings, who interviewed Rushdie for the Paris Review For a man who occasioned such furor, who has been lauded and blamed, threatened and feted, burnt in effigy and upheld as an icon of free expression, Rushdie is surprisingly easygoing and candidneither a hunted victim nor a scourge. Clean shaven, dressed in jeans and a sweater, he actually looks like a younger version of the condemned man who stared out at his accusers in Richard Avedons famous 1995 portrait. My family cant stand that picture, he said, laughing. Then, asked where the photograph is stored, he grinned and replied, On the wall.
Laura Gianino, writing in the New York Times recalls how she met him at a book launch. Having written her thesis on his most notorious novel she says she summoned her courage and marched over to him. I hovered until he turned to me, kind but expectant. I realized that I had nothing prepared for this moment, so I quickly offered the first thing that came to mind. The Satanic Verses, I said, changed my life.
Well, thats good, Salman Rushdie said, laughing and raising his glass. Because it ruined mine.
It certainly did. According to Rushdie himself in an article he wrote as a third person narrative in the New Yorker about that fateful day in 1989 when the world was exploding around him, he felt annoyed with himself for having forgotten the name of the BBC reporter who told him that his old life was over and a new, darker existence was about to begin. She called him at home, on his private line, without explaining how she got the number. How does it feel, she asked him, to know that you have just been sentenced to death by Ayatollah Khomeini It was a sunny Tuesday in London, but the question shut out the light. This is what he said, without really knowing what he was saying: It doesnt feel good. This is what he thought: Im a dead man. He wondered how many days he had left, and guessed that the answer was probably a single-digit number.
Lucky for him and for us, his life did not end in less than ten days. Instead, he went into hiding in the months and years that followed and was protected by the Metropolitan Police of the British government. The officers assigned to keep him safe advised him to choose a new name pretty pronto.
He thought of writers he loved and tried combinations of their names. Vladimir Joyce. Marcel Beckett. Franz Sterne. He made lists of such combinations, but all of them sounded ridiculous. Then he found one that did not. He wrote down, side by side, the first names of Conrad and Chekhov, and there it was, his name for the next eleven years. Joseph Anton.
Jolly good, the officers said. You wont mind if we call you Joe. In fact, he did mind. He soon discovered that he detested the abbreviation, for reasons he did not fully understandafter all, why was Joe so much worse than Joseph But Joe grated on him almost from the beginning. Nevertheless, that monosyllable was what the protection officers found easiest to master and remember. So Joe it had to be.
He had spent his life naming fictional characters. Now, by naming himself, he had turned himself into a sort of fictional character as well. Conrad Chekhov wouldnt have worked. But Joseph Anton was someone who might exist. Who now did exist. Joseph Anton, he told himself, you must live till you die.
So far, he has kept his promise. Born in Bombay in 1947, on the eve of Indias independence, Rushdie who now lives in New York was educated in his hometown and in England, where he spent the first decades of his writing life. Talking about his childhood he says I grew up kissing books and bread.
Thanks to the fatwa the name Salman Rushdie is today, better known around the world than that of any other living novelist.
But his reputation as a writer has hardly been eclipsed by the political assaults. In 1993, he was awarded the Booker of Bookersa medal honoring his novel Midnights Children as the best book to win the Man Booker Prize since it was established twenty-five years earlier. His latest novel, The Golden House, is a modern epic of love and terrorism, loss and reinventiona powerful, timely story told with the daring and panache that has kept Salman Rushdie a literary and cultural force for decades. When asked if hes worried readers including the President of the USA will be offended by his treatment of gender or other identity issues, in this book, he mused, (Trump) doesnt read, does he then laughed, a little bitterly. Ive offended people before.
But, not intentionally, at least not when he wrote The Satanic Verses. The ironic truth was that, after two novels that engaged directly with the public history of the Indian subcontinent, he had seen The Satanic Verses as a more personal exploration, a first attempt to create a work out of his own experience of migration and metamorphosis. To him, The Satanic Verses was the least political of the three books.
Irans Ayatollah Khomeini, however, didnt think so. But in 1998, President, Mohammed Khatami, denounced the fatwa, and Rushdie now insists that the danger has passed. (Even though in 2016, Forty state-run Iranian media outlets jointly offered a new $600,000 bounty for his death).
Talking about how he works, Rushdie says when he is writing it is rather unusual of me to come out in the daytime.
He also says that at times the characters he creates begin to have their own way. Here is how he describes how he wrote Shalimar. Something strange happened with this book. I felt completely possessed by these people, to the extent that I found myself crying over my own characters. Theres a moment in the book where Boonyis father, the pandit Pyarelal, dies in his fruit orchard.
I couldnt bear it. I found myself sitting at my desk weeping. I thought, What am I doing This is somebody Ive made up... I couldnt bear the idea of telling a storythat its so awful, I dont want to tell it, can something else happen And then you think, Oh, nothing else can happen, thats what happens.
If you are Joe Anton, alias Salman Rushdie, thats sure what happens. What more would you expect from a writer who believes The only people who see the whole picture are the ones who step out of the frame.

Interesting facts
1. The author knew he was to become a writer since he was five years old.

4. In his defense, the author pokes fun at religious fanatics of all faiths.

6. Salman Rushdie was appointed Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 because of his immense contribution to English literature.
7. Rushdie quietly mentors young Indian writers.
8. Among many honors bestowed on Mr. Rushdie are a Book Prize, Golden PEN award, author of the year in various countries and, of course, a fatwa.

President will effect changes if necessary
President Maithripala Sirisena will effect whatever changes he deems necessary and appropriate to fulfill the pledges made to the people in his election manifesto, Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane said.
He was responding to a question by a journalist with regard to a possibility of a cabinet reshuffle at a media conference held at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Yapa Abeywardane said that for the first time in history, President Maithripala Sirisena leads a coalition government of two main political parties.As far as economic policies are considered, the UNP is capitalist and the SLFP, a socialist political party. So the President had to consider both policies before taking some decisions,he said.
But now he has decided to take over the economy in order to take swift decisions which will be beneficial to the country. he added.
The State Minister extended an invitation to the people to join hands with the President to fight against corruption. People can do it in a democratic manner by casting their votes for the SLFP at the upcoming local government election, he said.
The President has practically proved his willingness to create a corruption free country by taking strong action towards fighting corruption. For the first time in history, two reports of the Bond Commission and the Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate into serious acts of fraud and corruption have been presented in Parliament, the State Minister said.

Those who robbed public funds should be punished
Special Assignments Minister Dr Sarath Amunugama said at Wettawa, Galagedara, that individuals who robbed public funds without any shame should be given the maximum punishment without regard to their status.
Addressing a local government election rally the Minister said: Those who have robbed peoples money should be severely punished irrespective of their position. Some people who have robbed public property and public funds without any shame have now attached the patriot label to themselves and surrounded by their henchmen are trying to shine in all their glory. Therefore public opinion, the demand of the people, is that those who robbed the peoples money the public funds, should be punished. The President is now engaged in punishing those who robbed government funds through the bond scam and in recovering that money. In the same way action will be taken to bring the other robbers also to justice before long.
Theft, fraud and corruption will not reign in a country, if the law functions properly. Therefore, it is the duty and responsibility of those who govern, to ensure that the rule of law prevails. People can be protected and the security of the country ensured only if the law functions properly. Therefore, we should seek to implement the law to the letter. If a countrys governance is allowed to be overwhelmed by theft, thuggery, and bribery, there is no future for that country nor security for its people. That is the reason for the decline of some African countries. The people of our country are mild and beautiful. That beauty should not be allowed to be dirtied by the sinful hands of politicians.

Afghan Save the Childrens office attacked
AFGHANISTAN: Gunmen blasted their way into Save the Childrens office in Afghanistans restive east on Wednesday, witnesses and officials said, in an ongoing attack that has wounded at least 11 people.
After blowing up a car outside the British charitys compound in Jalalabad city, the attackers used a rocket propelled grenade to storm the complex. I can hear two attackers... They are looking for us, an employee hiding inside the building told a friend in a WhatsApp message seen by an AFP reporter. Pray for us ... Inform the security forces, the man begged.
Nangarhar governor spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP the attack started at 9:10 am shortly after staff would have arrived at the office. A group of armed men then entered the compound. So far 11 wounded people have been brought to hospitals, Khogyani added.
Mohammad Amin, who was inside the compound when the attackers launched the raid, told AFP from his hospital bed that he heard a big blast.
We ran for cover and I saw a gunman hitting the main gate with an RPG (rocket propelled grenade) to enter the compound. I jumped out of the window, Amin said.
Afghan TV news channels showed a thick plume of black smoke rising above the compound and what appears to be at least one vehicle on fire outside the office. Another witness told AFP: It might be a complex attack. I am hearing gun fire from inside Save the Children compound.
Wednesdays assault comes days after Taliban gunmen stormed a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, killing at least 22 people, mostly foreigners.
Insurgents armed with Kalashnikovs and suicide vests attacked the landmark Intercontinental Hotel, going from room to room searching for foreigners during the more than 12-hour ordeal.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Jalalabad attack and no one from Save the Childrens office in Kabul was available to comment.
The attack on Save the Children is the latest violence to strike a foreign aid group in war-torn Afghanistan.
The International Committee of the Red Cross announced in October it would drastically reduce its presence in the country after seven employees were killed in attacks last year.
The decision by the charity, which has been working in Afghanistan for over three decades, underlined the growing dangers for aid workers, who have increasingly become casualties of a surge in militant violence in recent years.
Nangarhar, a restive province bordering Pakistan, is a stronghold for the Islamic State group and also has a significant Taliban presence.
US and Afghan forces have been carrying out ground and air operations against IS fighters in Nangarhar.
While Afghan security forces are conducting most of the fighting against IS and Taliban militants, US troops operate alongside them in a training capacity and are frequently on the front lines.
The last major attack in Jalalabad was on December 31 when an explosion at a funeral killed 18 mourners and wounded another 13. There was no claim of responsibility.

The Party leaders had agreed to have the Parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission Report and the PRECIFAC report on February 20 and 21, during the party leaders meeting headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday.
The Speaker said the President had notified him that he intends to call a party leaders meeting next week and explain to them matters pertaining to the reports and respond to their concerns.
The JVP and Joint Opposition tried their best to get the debate on two special sitting days before the election. But the government turned down the request claiming that the MPs and ministers were fully engrossed in the election campaign.
Joint Opposition group leader in Parliament, MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the Government had scheduled the debate for the latter half of February despite calls from the Opposition to hold the debate before the upcoming Local Government elections.
We urged the Government to have the Bond report debate before February 10. However, the view of the Government was different. They insisted that as there were no scheduled Sittings before the elections, the debate would be held on the February 20 and 21, he said.
MP Gunawardana said that it would be a two day adjournment debate, listed to be moved by the JVP and the Joint Opposition.
He noted that the Opposition had brought up the issue with regard to the missing Bond report documents at the Party Leaders meeting.
He had demanded that the Speaker obtain the missing Bond report documents as soon as possible, as the full report is required if a proper debate is to be held, he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had informed the Party Leaders that he expected to receive the remaining bond report documents within the next week and the MPs would be provided with the missing sections thereafter.

While he can still take his appeal to a higher court, the decision could rule Lula out as a candidate for Octobers presidential election.

The ex-leader, who governed from 2003 to 2011, had been favourite to win.

## Title: Brow  rising!

Brow  rising!
Be it hair or brows, you need to understand how your hair grows and how to work with what you have, rather than trying to go with your whims. Perfectly shaped eyebrows can make a statement and are envied by many. If eyebrows really do frame your face, they had better be on point. Here is some expert advice for grooming or taming your unruly brows.
Aftercare post eyebrow threading
Avoid the following for at least 24 hours after eyebrow threading:
<U+F06E> Touching the area as the pores are open and infection can occur.
<U+F06E> Sauna, steam room and hot tubs as the pores are open and infection can occur.
<U+F06E> Swimming as irritation can occur.
<U+F06E> Perfumed products.
<U+F06E> Applying make-up to the area as the pores are open and infection can occur.
Apply a cold compress to the area if irritation occurs within the hour following a treatment.
Follow this general homecare advice as well:
<U+F06E> Apply a soothing antiseptic cream (such as aloe vera) to calm and sooth any redness.
<U+F06E> Groom the eyebrows into shape using a brow/lash brush.
<U+F06E>To maintain a nice brow shape, it is advisable to return for an eyebrow tidy in two to four weeks.
Flattening eyebrows which stick up straight
Trim your eyebrows to remove hairs that are too long and unruly. To do an accurate trim, comb brow hairs upwards towards your hairline. Use your small grooming scissors to trim any brow hairs that extend beyond the upper eyebrow line. Hold the grooming scissors at one end of the brow line and slowly follow along the brow line for a clean cut. Repeat the same steps for the opposite side.
Smooth clear mascara over the eyebrow. Pull the wand out of the tube and apply it directly to the eyebrow, similar to combing through the eyebrow. This will keep thick eyebrows in place after you have combed them into your desired shape.
Growing eyebrows naturally
1. Castor oil
Castor oil is one of the most effective remedies to boost the growth of your eyebrows. It contains protein, vitamins, fatty acids and antioxidants that nourish the hair follicles and promote hair growth.

2. Olive oil
Olive oil is also good for your eyebrows. Being rich in vitamin E, olive oil can help your eyebrow hair grow faster and thicker. It will also help keep it dark-hued.

3. Milk
You can also use milk to grow your eyebrows thicker. Milk contains protein as well as other nutrients that nourishes hair roots and improves hair growth.

4. Egg yolk
The hair of the eyebrows is made up of keratin protein, and egg is a great source of protein. Thus, it can help improve the health of your hair, which in turn will make your eyebrows thick.
Disadvantages of threading

<U+F06E> Pain
Depending on the threaders skill and your skins sensitivity, eyebrow threading may be painful. Several hairs can be pulled out with one roll of the thread. If you have very thick eyebrows, eyebrow threading will involve more pulling and therefore more chances of feeling pain.

<U+F06E> Infection
Since eyebrow threading removes hair from its follicle, the hair follicle may get infected. Bacteria may grow in the tiny pockets left by the pulled out hair. The condition is known as folliculitis and it often appears as small, white-headed pimples around one or more hair follicles. They may itch and in mild cases, they will often go away in a few days.

<U+F06E> Allergic reaction
In some cases, the threader may apply some soothing lotion after threading the eyebrow. The pores are open at this time and if you have sensitive skin, you may develop an allergic reaction to it. To prevent any allergic reactions, make sure any lotion or gel used is hypoallergenic and you are not allergic to the any of the ingredients in it.
Threading tips

<U+F06E> Your facial hair doesn't have to be a certain length to go for threading. However, excessive facial hair threading will leave you with an irritated skin. That is the reason you should not overdo it.

<U+F06E> Avoid exfoliating your skin on the day of your facial hair threading appointment. When your skin is exfoliated, it becomes more sensitive with threading, and this might lead to redness.

<U+F06E> Hydration is the key to making your skin less sensitive before threading. Make sure to load up on water. It is a small trick you can use to prepare your skin for facial hair threading.

<U+F06E> Before you start the facial hair threading process, wash your face with ice-cold water! You can also massage the area with an ice cube. This will numb your skin, and will make everything a little less painful.

Taking its name after the Colombo 03 street on which it is located, Caf Bagatalle, emerges as a gastronomic haven from among Colombo citys restaurants and cafes, for anyone and everyone in search of health food.
Conveniently situated in the premises of the Colombos mens sartorial landmark - The Envoy Mansion  at the Bagatalle Road / Duplication Road angle, what sets Caf Bagatalle apart is its sole focus on healthy and wholesome food and beverages. With a growing interest in health food among large numbers of Sri Lankans and expatriates living in Colombo, Caf Bagatalle thus provides the ideal setting for making life changing decisions.
The brainchild behind Caf Bagatalle is the widely travelled, Sri Lankas menswear guru Fouzul Hameed who himself is a fitness fanatic and a relentless advocate of healthy food and healthy living, and thus, a healthy lifestyle.
Joining this project as a consultant is Chef Rajendra Prem Kumar who brings with him years of wide ranging and rich culinary experience gained both in Sri Lanka and overseas destinations such as Germany, Vietnam, Bangkok, Hawaii, Algeria and South Africa.
Fouzul Hameed said that a lot of thought went into the creation of Caf Bagatalle. Our mission is to make this a holistic offering to our fellow Sri Lankans. Both men and women tend to neglect themselves after a certain age. This should not be so. The older one gets biologically, the more one should take care of ones food and exercise. Caf Bagatalle offers exactly that to its discerning customers who try to make conscious decisions concerning their lives. The Caf offers everyone a chance to make healthy choices and conveniently so without having to compromise on quality and value for money, Hameed added.

Misleading bill board
Daddy, please dont drink and drive. This is a board displayed on the roads in Colombo to advise the drivers not to consume alcohol and drive vehicles.
But the word daddy gives a confusing meaning to this display board. It gives the idea that it is all right to drink. What is bad is to drink and drive. Son is telling the father it is all right to drink. But dont drink and drive. This is not acceptable to our culture.
Sri Lanka is a religious country. No religion will encourage people to drink alcohol.
Drinking is a bad habit. Drinking even a small amount of alcohol is bad for health. You waste money. There will be family problems when you drink regularly. Your children and relations will not respect you.
These boards are prepared by the Police department. We very kindly appeal to the authorities to change the board wordings.

Action is currently being taken to control the spread of dengue in the Kalmunai Regional Director of Health Services (RDHS) division, Health Department officials said.
Mosquito-control activities in the Sainthamaruthu DS division of the Kalmunai municipality have made progress, Sainthamaruthu Health Medical Officer Dr. U. L. Ajwath said.
The Sainthamaruthu MOH office and Kalmunai Municipal Council has launched a dengue-prevention programme in the Sainthamaruthu MOH limit areas, under the guidance of Kalmunai RDHS Dr. A. L. Alawdeen.
Mosquito eradication and awareness programmes are presently being conducted throughout the division. State and private sector workshops, institutes, schools, beaches, and homes, were inspected for mosquito-breeding grounds, Sainthamaruthu Health Medical Officer Dr. U. L. Ajwath said. Health authorities also made door-to-door inspections to inspect on mosquito-breeding grounds and to educate people on the significance of eradicating such places.
Residents promoting mosquito-breeding locations, were identified and warned. Uncleared garbage is another reason for the spread of dengue fever, officials said. Immediately after rains, low-lying areas along the coastal belt are inundated, and are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Emirates, Dilmah celebrate 25 years of exclusive brewing in the sky
As Sri Lanka celebrated the 150th anniversary of Ceylon Tea in 2017, Emirates marked its25 year partnership with Dilmah, the countrys premier tea brand.
A collaboration that began in 1992 has resulted in a select range of 10 types of tea being produced exclusively for Emirates passengers on flights worldwide, catering to a wide palate of taste and sensory preferences.
More than 9.6 million tea bags made in Sri Lanka by Dilmah are served on Emirates flights around the world per year. Both brands have grown exponentially since their collaboration began and today Emirates, the worlds largest airline by passenger kilometres, takes the Dilmah brand to more than 150 destinations on six continents. At the top of the airlines exclusive tea selection is the Emirates Signature Tea  a single-estate tea made from Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe 1 leaf growing at an elevation of 1020 meters above sea level on the Dombagastalawa Estate, in Sri Lankas Nawalapitiya region.
The Emirates Signature Tea is really a very special tea that we are honoured to have crafted for Emirates passengers, said Dilhan C. Fernando, Director at Dilmah.
Our emphasis was on offering passengers a signature and therefore uniquely Emirates experience in tea, so we integrated Rose as a defining element of the cultural heritage of Emirates airline, added Almond to balance the richness of the Rose especially for male guests, while using an ingredient that symbolises good health and luxury in the Middle East.
The hint of Ginger has a functional element in restraining the extravagant aroma and flavour of Rose and Almond while emphasising the natural goodness that the tea offers  for Ginger, like tea, is potent in its human health benefits.
The aroma and taste elements in the Emirates Signature Tea are designed to work in elegant pairing with food, but the tea can be a dessert in itself.
While savoury dishes with nuts or leafy vegetables in them work well with the tea, it is also an excellent accompaniment to most desserts including chocolate, caramel or light cake.
Were proud to offer gourmet food and beverages as part of our commitment to a superior passenger experience. Food and beverages are at the heart of our on-board offerings which is why its so important to have the right partnerships in place and is why we continue to invest in and support world-class local suppliers like Dilmah, said JoostHeymeijer, Emirates Senior Vice President, Catering.
The teas offered to passengers flying with Emirates are chosen on the basis of the popularity of different types of tea such as Earl Grey, but also looking at trends and functional expectations such as a certain intensity of flavour and the need to cater to different preferences like minty or citrus infusions.
In general, black teas are the most popular among passengers in Economy Class, while passengers in First and Business Class seem to favour Moroccan Mint and English Breakfast tea.

Facebook invents new unit of time called  flick
A Facebook engineer has invented a new unit of time called a flick. The flick has been designed to help developers keep video effects in sync, according to a description on the code-sharing site GitHub. A flick, derived from frame-tick, is 1/705,600,000 of a second - the next unit of time after a nanosecond.
A researcher at Oxford University said the flick wouldn't have much general impact but may help create better virtual reality experiences.
Flicks are defined in the programming language C++, which is used to generate visual effects for film, television and other media.
Flicks give programmers a way to measure the time between media frames without using fractions. Matt Hammond, lead research engineer at BBC Research and Development, said this can reduce errors such as stutters in graphics.
When the numbers used are not integers, errors can gradually creep into computer calculations. These errors can build up over time, eventually causing inaccuracies that become noticeable, he said. Flick's creator, Christopher Horvath, publicly shared his idea on Facebook in early 2017, according to the GitHub description. He then made modifications to the new measurement based on feedback from comments.The Oxford University researcher, who asked not to be identified, said that flicks may help virtual reality developers deal with latency, or delay.
Very often in academic literature, you have this notion of presence and immersion, he told the BBC.
Immersion is the engagement you feel with a computer game. Presence is the notion of your brain feeling that you are there.
Presence is very, very easy to break. I think perhaps a very fixed way of describing these time steps allows for developers to have a bit more flexibility in dealing with latency issues and making sure videos stay in sync.
A flick is not the first unit of time designed by a major corporation. Swatch introduced Internet Time in 1998, which divides the day into 1,000 .beats.
The measurement - equal to one minute and 26.4 seconds - was designed to eliminate the need for time zones. It has not caught on globally. (BBC)

Fast bowlers dominate first day
Johannesburg: Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara hit half-centuries for India but South Africas fast bowlers dominated the first day of the third and final Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Wednesday.
India were bowled out for 187 despite contrasting innings of 54 by Kohli and 50 by Pujara.
South Africa were six for one at the close.
Kohli and Pujara put on 84 for the third wicket but there were no other major partnerships. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who made 30 batting at number eight, was the only other Indian to reach double figures.
South Africa picked a five-pronged pace attack and the Indian batsmen were under pressure all day on a pitch which offered pace and sideways movement.
All five bowlers took wickets. Kagiso Rabada took three for 39, while Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Andile Phehlukwayo took two apiece. Lungi Ngidi only took one wicket but it was the key one of Kohli, who was caught at third slip by AB de Villiers.
Kohli won the toss and decided to bat on a hard, well-grassed pitch in cool, overcast conditions.
As in the first two Tests, Kohli was batting early in the innings after both openers were dismissed inside the first nine overs.
While Pujara played a dogged, defensive innings, Kohli attacked when the bowlers strayed in line or length.
Pujara took 54 balls to score his first runs and battled for 261 minutes and 179 balls, hitting eight boundaries, before he was caught behind off the medium-paced Andile Phehlukwayo.
Two dropped catches and a wicket overturned because of a no-ball hampered South Africa on a day when the bowlers were able to extract considerable sideways movement off the pitch.
Kohli, who made his runs off 106 balls with nine fours, was the beneficiary of both dropped catches. He was put down when he had 11 by Philander off Rabada and on 32 by De Villiers at third slip off Morkel.
De Villiers made amends when he held a sharp chance off Lungi Ngidi to end Kohlis innings  but South Africas star batsman did not field after tea while receiving ice treatment on a bruised right middle finger suffered when he held the catch.
Philander took the first wicket when he had Lokesh Rahul caught behind and bowled a remarkable first spell of one for one in eight overs. He was later denied a second wicket when Ajinkya Rahane, on three, edged him to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, only to get a reprieve when replFast bowlers dominate first dayys showed he had over-stepped the bowling crease.
Rahane made only six more runs before he was leg before wicket to Morkel shortly before tea.
Pujara faced 31 balls without scoring a run in Philanders first spell and was beaten several times as well as surviving an unsuccessful review for a leg before wicket decision which showed the ball hitting the bails in the umpires call zone.
South Africa suffered an early blow when Aiden Markram edged an outswinger from Kumar to wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel in the third over.
Both teams selected all-seam attacks, with no spinner in either team.
There is good grass cover but the surface is nice and hard. If we bat first and bat well its an advantage, Kohli said at the toss.
We played some really good cricket at this ground last time and we are looking to correct the mistakes we made in the first two games. AFP

Former President Chandrikas mediation helps solve Dadagamuwa garbage issue
The unhygienic manner in which garbage was being disposed of in the Attanagalla, Veyangoda, Gampaha and Dadagamuwa areas was solved permanently due to the mediation of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
People in the Dadagamuwa and Veyangoda areas have been undergoing severe hardships for six years since huge amounts of garbage, including both degradable and non-degradable waste was been dumped in a private land in the Dadagamuwa area.
The owner of the land earned millions monthly by allowing five Local Government Institutions to dump garbage at the site without considering the environment impact, health issues and difficulties faced by the people.
However, when the issue was brought to the notice of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the dumping of garbage has been banned at this site from January 2. The daily collection of garbage which was been dumped at this site earlier is being sent to Kerawalapitiya from January 2.
The garbage dump site has caused severe environment, health and social issues. Ground water, air and the surrounding environment has been severely polluted. It is speculated that the authorities, including environmental officers had not taken any action regarding this illegal garbage dump site, eventhough the site is situated in a semi-urban area, former President Kumaratunga said.
She added that as a long lasting solution to this issue, moves have already been taken to dispose of garbage in a proper hygienic manner at an abandoned 300 acre state land. The new garbage dumping site will not pose any environmental threat nor cause pollution as garbage will be disposed of at this site using modern technology.
Former President Kumaratunga said that she had to use her good offices and overcome several obstacles to solve this long standing issue and thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for the speedy action taken in this regard.The Dadagamuwa garbage mountain.

Human-elephant conflict on the rise in Anuradhapura
The invasion of wild elephants into remote villages in the Anuradhapura district, is on the rise again. The prevailing drought is also a main factor for the increasing human-elephant conflict, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News.
"During last year, wildlife conservation authorities took measures to minimize the human-elephant conflict, having identified the areas where the menace was on the rise, by putting up electrified fences and driving away herds of wild jumbos into distant reservations. But, I was convinced at recent field visits and briefings at forums such as district agriculture committee sessions, and based on reports being submitted by divisional secretaries and farmer organizations, that there is a rapid increase in the invasion wild jumbos into human habitats at present, leading to conflict," Wanninanayake said.
"It is evident that the habitation areas once cleared of wild elephants, are now being haunted and dominated by them, while most of the protective fences remain destroyed.
The information I gathered indicated that several areas previously not threatened by wild elephants, are now becoming vulnerable to invading jumbos," he added. He said according to farmer organization representatives and wildlife officials, the blocking of traditional elephant corridors is worsening the situation.
The government agent, referring to the proposed solution to prevent the expansion of the jumbo menace, said until long-term strategies come into effect, he has instructed the district wildlife conservation assistant director to set up a task force consisting of wildlife officials, civil security guards, and volunteers, to take immediate action to thwart any sudden invasion by wild jumbos, under the circumstances.
Further instructions were issued to wildlife authorities to keep adequate stocks of elephant crackers and to distribute quotas to the needy divisional secretaries, as there was a complaint by village organizations that they were denied elephant crackers when asked for.
It was reported that during the last two years, as a result of the conflict, 23 persons and 70 wild elephants were killed in the Anuradhapura district.
Wanninayake further said the other actions to be taken in addressing the menace are the mapping of traditional elephant corridors in the district, along with the re-construction of electrified fences constructed during last two years, and the removal of unauthorized constructions along the traditional routes of wild elephants. A detailed report on electrified fences planned to be erected in 2018 and an appropriate plan ensuring the systematical operations to redirect roaming elephants into distant reservations are to be submitted soon.
Divisional wildlife conservation officials said the protective fences are purposely destroyed or made to inactive by timber racketeers to gain access to jungle areas, and some villagers damage the fences to get accommodation to usher herds of cattle into the forest for feeding.
The dearth of adequate wildlife conservation officials, transport facilities, and civil security personnel being released to assist wildlife conservation activities, adversely affects relief work.

Kandy SC causing heartburn for all coaches
Greetings island rugby hearts and all who have taken to our much talked about union code.
Sri Lankas history and ever increasing fan base are really justifying rugbys self styled .reputation as the islands most popular sport by a long touch kick
This is clearly seen by the interest already generated for the upcoming Singer schools season, and the packed Nittawela cauldron for the Saturday skirmish between a step up CH and the high riding Lions...
It was a huge task for our Maitland marauding warriors to outthink and outshine Kandys vastly experienced glam side..especially up there.
The team list if carefully observed can cause heartburn for all coaches planning to beat Kandy or at least some pride in theory ....from a vastly one sided encounter. 50 points have been rattling the manual scoreboard with alarming consistency.
Captain Gayan W a visibly inspired leader with plenty to smile about this season, much praise about their professionalism and performance in the middle, a bonus of sorts.
CH&FC this season has been a team with the biggest hearts and most generous thoughts ...gifting four games in round 1...Army, Havies, Police and Navy were an open door policy much to coach Laggas surprise and despite clear definition of the job in hand.
However, they have stamped their class and mind to fight back, in more terms than any team this season.
I am in awe of those experts who subsequent to leaving their comfy all knowing deck chairs...would have not seen how much strike venom is in the CH tank...what an enthralling 80mins of intense skill and strike power on both sides ..Mandy dominating and punishing all mistakes to lead at half time.
Maximum credit to the likes of Sasanka, Satya, Rohita and a Yoshita who has been fierce both in attack and defence.
Kandys 8 holding their own in the sets...But not allowed to settle and dominate with significance. Udangamuwa, Lema, Soyuru, punching holes but stopped in their tracks...especially Dimitri who didnt stop trying.
Had it not been for the combined finishing by Ratwatte, Sooriyabandara and Marija...mustering all their experience ...Kandy were almost beaten and saved face in the last 2mins with a Pereira twin try to wrap it up and massive relief ....then raucous celebration by the faithful.
Contemplate the knockouts and wet your impact drunk lips with considerable delight ..its going to be bruising and relentless rugby for us to enjoy each weekend.
Kandy, Havelocks, Navy and CH have shown that nothing is impossible...and will look to grab all they can ...watch out for Police and Air Force who have found belief and points last two weekends.
Its too compulsive not to claim some expertise etc....plenty of rugby surf options to beef your deck chair social media soapbox
Opinions are everything these days of rapid sharing ...glad Sri rugby finally decided to have regular TMOs at all games ...But vital to have those big screens and attached emotions or physical emogies as part of the island game.
Seems difficult if facilities, especially for decision making, arent the same at each ground.....standard basics at all venues is fundamental to the quality of rugby and the process of fair play....and essential to the final results.
Big hand to Muthuthanthri, currently in NZ and making the cut to play for Auckland in their provincial 7s tournament...it is fabulous news and a logical step up for the Sri 7s captain ...who has shown huge commitment and dedication over the last 5 seasons..
Muthu opens that door and is a classic statement of the 7s class available here in paradise.
I am looking at more Sri islanders like Ranjan Danuska, Jason D, and Srinath Sooriya B ....we certainly have good Sri rugby friends in Auckland and also in Wellington...which simply means that it is more than a one off trip.
Lets look forward to more regional interest from Japan and Hong Kong ...especially after our U18, and U20 7s came home as Asian champions in 2016...
Glad to see that Kevin Kutty Dixon has recovered from his jaw injury and very much back in stride for round 2 and the rest of this domestic season. He will be listed for the Asian 7s starting in March with the Borneo 7s and much pressure to change last years fortunes. Danushka Ranjan most likely to retain his Sri captaincy ...given his scintillating form and try accumulator...
Its all to anticipate and glow knowingly...Sri rugby is getting stronger Asia wide and its a matter of high priority that we get it absolutely on the button for our 7s ambitions.
Waiting for that day when we dominate rankings, put pressure on teams and are feared for our skill to finish.
Blessings to all Sri islanders who make the grade.
Asian games and Commonwealth games...here we go.
Bula bula the Sri heart for more!

Kandy survive CH onslaught to move towards title
Kandy Sports Club maintained their lead in the points table and also their unbeaten record when they powered themselves to a hard fought victory over CH & FC 34-23 at Nittawela on Saturday. This was the most looked forward to match in the tournaments second round where CH & FC had two consecutive wins prior to this game.
Kandys scrambling defence had to be at its very best to keep CH at bay. The defending league champions were given a tough time by CH before winning. It was a combination of their sheer hard work, grit and determination that they were able to overcome a gallant CH team. Kandy came out firing on all cylinders and played a very bruising game. They stood up to the challenge and stuck to the game plan with all the players rising to the occasion.
The CH lads gave their best, but Kandy knew how to turn on the heat at the right moment. There were some good individual play, but CH failed to use them and paid for it dearly. The good work of their back-row forwards was fine, but their backs struggled with handling errors. CH packed with some good players, should have done much better in this game but failed to drive home the advantage, due to poor co-ordination. Sad to say Kandy school product Samuel Maduwantha was not in his normal form, and had left his kicking boots at home.
The ongoing strength and conditioning training have been a big help with the Kandy forwards and the backs making all the difference in such a well contested game.
The second half was an absolute teaser, CH & FC were by no means awful, but every time they made a mistake, Kandy capitalized. Playmaker Fail Marija operating from the fly half position cut holes everywhere and also fullback Nigel Ratwatte.
From 77 per cent territory and possession in the first half Kandy had to survive on 21 and 23 per cent after the break. CH comeback in this half was a dramatic transformation at the scrum.
In the first half, Kandy was dominant, though CH did not falter. They did not break, keeping the champions at bay for the final half an hour of the game with their defensive resistance. They had saved the best of their play for this game.
What a terrifically-entertaining match! All credit to the Kandy players who outclassed the hard fighting CH XV, who put real pressure on the defending champions.
Kandy play their next game on Saturday at Welisara against second placed Sri Lanka Navy.

Kohli & Co did not gain anything playing Sri Lanka - Harbhajan
After a hectic 2017, which saw the Indian team play the likes of Australia, England, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Harbhajan Singh feels that the home series versus Sri Lanka could have been avoided. Singh also said that he preferred Bhuvaneshwar over Sharma as the former is more of a match-winner.
The sight of a disgruntled captain in the form of Virat Kohli approaching the post-match media conference to address the press gathered is something that Indian fans will tend to remember for the entire duration of the South African tour.
His aggressive attitude during the interview was a clear sign of frustration and disappointment after suffering a series loss in their very first outing of 2018.
Few could blame the captain for the disappointing show put up by the Men in Blue against the Proteas. 2017 was a packed year for the Indian team as they played the likes of England, Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand and Sri Lanka (twice home and away). With such a crowded schedule, fatigue and injuries were bound to take its toll on this young Indian squad.
Even before the Sri Lanka series, Kohli had voiced his concern about the lack of rest for the players and even had a meeting with the CoA regarding the same.
Harbhajan has also been critical of the BCCIs decision to play the home series versus Sri Lanka in November and December, which was immediately followed by the tour of South Africa.
Look, I believe the last Sri Lanka series at home served little purpose. We hardly gained anything out of it. Rather a few players could have gone to South Africa early. If not Dharamsala could have been a great place for preparation, Harbhajan said, reported PTI.
Its high altitude, cooler weather, seam movement along with bounce would have given them ideal preparation before a tough assignment like South Africa.  PTI

Mahanama, the first to become Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in successive years
Former Sri Lanka captain and ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama said that schoolboy cricketers should be willing to make sacrifices, rather than looking for short cuts to success.
Young schoolboy cricketers must have a genuine willingness to work towards their targets with dedication. There are no shortcuts, said Mahanama in a recent interview with the writer.
The stylish former Sri Lanka top order batsman said the schoolboy cricketers during his era did not get many opportunities to play international matches at under-19 level. I had played for Nalanda for five seasons but we had only two tours. But the present day players get more and more opportunities. I wonder whether the players are making full use of those tours, he said.
Mahanama feels that there should be a balance on the number of matches a school team has to play during a season to maintain the quality of the game. True that we need to give more opportunities to outstation teams but that should not happen at the expense of quality, he said.
The former Nalanda captain said the countrys first and the premier school cricket awards show has always motivated schoolboy cricketers at the end of each season, recognizing their hard work. These events motivated us as emerging cricketers. It is always a great motivation when you know that your achievements are being recognized, he said.
Mahanama is of the view that his crowning glory as the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1983 and 1984, was a major milestone in his career. To be adjudged the best schoolboy cricketer and being honored for the hard work during the season was a great encouragement. I was privileged to achieve one of my dreams,
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year on successive years was a memorable one. It was my stepping stone. Becoming the best Schoolboy Cricketer made me even more determined to work harder to reach greater heights, he said. As a kid, I had watched former Nalanda players such as Bandula Warnapura in action. We had full houses for all those inter-school games. It was a passion. The school authorities too encouraged the boys to watch matches, he added.
Mahanama, recalling his days as a schoolboy cricketer at Nalanda College, said that it was a great feeling to have their names on the teams fixture card. Even the old boys made it a point to skip all other engagements to watch their school teams matches. It was a great honor for us to see our names in the fixture card - first as a player, then as a coloursman and later as vice-captain or captain. I still have preserved those Nalanda fixture cards with me, Mahanama said.
The first to win the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year on successive years in 1983 and 1984, Mahanama is one of the greatest stars who had emerged through Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest.
A proud product of Nalanda College, Colombo, Mahanama was had a huge following in school cricket during early 80s. He first won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1983 with a rich harvest with the willow. He continued to let his willow to do the talking in the following year too and his superb form won him the title for the second successive year in 1984.
Although former Ananda captain Arjuna Ranatunga too has won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice prior to Mahanama but Ranatunga did not win the crown on successive years. Ranatunga first won the coveted title in 1980 after Ranjan Madugalle but failed to repeat the following year in which Rohan Buultjens of St. Peters won the prestigious title. However, Ranatunga, in his final inter-school first XI season for Ananda was crowned Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year once again in 1982.
Following Ranatunga and Mahanama to join the select band of schoolboy cricketers to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title twice each were Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995), Lahiru Peiris (2004 and 2005), Bhanuka Rajapaksa (2010 and 2011) and Charith Asalanka (2015 and 2016).
The last of those six rare occasions was witnessed two years ago when Richmonds Asalanka won back to back titles. In his last interview with the Sunday Observer, Mahanama urged schoolboy cricketers to work hard to achieve their targets in a disciplined manner, maintaining the high traditions of the game - instead of being remote-controlled.
It was his late father Upali Mahanama who had been a tower of strength behind the celebrated cricketers success story.
To me, he was a great source of encouragement. He stressed the importance of adding values and discipline to our lives. Then I was lucky to come under the watchful eyes of Lionel Sir (Lionel Mendis) Mahanama recalled the early part of his distinguish career. He set us targets from our young ages and groomed us well, he added.
Mahanama pointed out that Schoolboy Cricketers should be given adequate rest between their games. During our time, we had enough rest between the games.
Most importantly, we were taught to respect the game, its culture and to follow team ethics. Even the coaches and masters in charge during our time conducted themselves in an exemplary manner to earn respect. We had the highest respect and regard for the umpires, he said.
The heavy load of matches per season, compared to the past, does not give adequate time for schoolboy cricketers to rest or recover between the games.
It is not the quantity but the quality that matters. Most junior cricketers tend to depend totally on the messages sent by their coaches and masters in charge, for on-field decisions. They are being remote-controlled at the middle. Hence, they are not in a position to stand on their own and take decisions. Winning at any cost should not be the motto, Mahanama pointed out. Mahanama said that deteriorating standards in school cricket has prevented producing youngsters who could directly march into the national team, as in the past.
In the past, players such as Ranjan Madugalle earned their places in the national squad directly from school level. Unfortunately, we do not often find consistent players in school cricket, geared up to face that challenge, he said.
Mahanama, who turns 52 in May, has represented Sri Lanka in 52 Tests had an aggregate of 2,576 runs with four centuries and 11 fifties. His career best innings of 225 was registered against India in 1997, sharing a record partnership of 576 runs with Sanath Jayasuriya (340) at Premadasa Stadium in Colombo helped Sri Lanka record the highest team total in a Test.
He made a half century in his last Test for Sri Lanka - against South Africa at Centurion Park in 1998. Mahanama has played in 213 One Day Internationals for Sri Lanka to enjoy an aggregate of 5,162 runs with four centuries and 35 half centuries.

Mandatory womens representation a credit to PM - Sajith
At a time when other party leaders were unconcerned about giving pride of place to women in society, Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had taken measures to ensure mandatory womens representation in Pradeshiya Sabhas, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting of the UNP Tissamaharama central organisation held near the Tissamaharama bus stand premises. Nearly 8,000 women members of the Eksath Lak Vanitha Peramuna were present at the meeting.
Minister Premadasa who predicted a certain UNP victory at the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha election, said that after setting up a UNP administration they would announce a special womens Hambantota district which would be fully implemented without paying mere lip service for the welfare of women in the district.
He said vast crowds which got stranded without gaining any progress after following other political parties and individuals in the past had now flocked behind the UNP to ensure a convincing victory for the party.
The Minister said Tissamaharama today was witnessing giant strides in development. People were being given land allotments and title deeds to their lands.
New Udagama housing schemes were springing up in all parts of the electorate. Youth were being offered respectable state jobs. A new UNP controlled Pradeshiya Sabha would organise free tuition classes for needy students. Minister Premadasa said certain sections of the opposition were engaged in bankrupt politics by resorting to character assassination.
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said Minister Premadasa is such an efficient and demanding Minister that one had to be on ones toes 24 hours a day when working with him.
The village and the country would attain quick development if they followed his strategy. He had had rendered a colossal amount of work for the welfare of people even when he was an opposition Parliamentarian, Minister Fernando said.
He said to people who question them as to whether they were happy about the Yahapalanaya government, he would say they were extremely happy about ensuring the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena They were happy about the law and order situation. People were free to point out any shortcomings in the system so that they could correct them.
Citing an example, he said President Sirisenas brother was involved in a motor accident where the victim succumbed to his injuries. The Presidents brother had to languish in remand custody for 14 days. Thereafter he was produced in court and released on bail. The President never personally intervened on behalf of his brother. This was the essence of Yahapalanaya. Could people witness such non-interference in the countrys legal system during the Rajapaksa regime, he asked.

Ministry of Education  signs MoU with SEC
The Ministry of Education (MOE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) on January 24, 2018 to formalise the provision of trilingual financial education among school teachers and students in Sri Lanka.
Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary, MOE and Vajira Wijegunawardane, Director General, SEC entered into the MoU on behalf of the Ministry and SEC. 
Financial literacy encompasses many concepts such as financial awareness, knowledge, skills and capabilities. For many years, the SEC has been imparting capital market knowledge across the country for all sections of the society. SEC's mission to provide financial education starts from the school level by providing sound financial knowledge among school teachers and students. 
Moreover, since the subject of capital market is at present included in the Business and Accounting Studies for the G.C.E (Ordinary level) and Business Studies for G.C.E (Advanced level) curricula, the SEC will ensure that their capital market awareness initiatives will cover the contents in the school syllabuses.
The agreement will continue to enable the SEC to impart capital market knowledge to students and teachers in all 98 zones in Sri Lanka throughout a period of three years in association with the National Institute of Education. For the year 2018, the SEC is committed to conducting awareness programmes for teachers in 32 zones and for students in at least 32 zones. 
In addition, under the agreement basic financial education will be incorporated into more grades in the school curricula and the existing curricula will be updated. The SEC also anticipates publishing a handbook for Advanced level Business studies students and telecasting a television quiz programme on the capital market on state television.
Yesterdays MoU signing is yet another affirmation of SEC's continued partnership with the MOE to equip school teachers and students with financial literacy competencies to promote financial inclusion.

Pakistan beat South Africa for place in semi-finals
A composed 74 not out from Ali Zaryab ensured that the hard work of fast bowlers Muhamad Musa and Shaheen Afridi did not go waste when he guided Pakistan to a three-wicket victory over South Africa in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Super League quarter-final in Christchurch.
In front of broadcast cameras, left-handed Zaryab compiled a cautious but attractive 111-ball knock, with five fours, that took two-time champions Pakistan to their target of 190 in 47.5 overs after the pace-duo of Musa and Shaheen had shared five scalps to help restrict South Africa to 189 for nine.
The victory over the 2014 champions means Pakistan will now play the winners of Fridays quarter-final between India and Bangladesh in the second semi-final in Christchurch on 30 January.
The 2004 and 2006 champions have to be thankful to Zaryab, who was not perturbed even as the Asian side was reduced to 111 for five after all-rounder Jason Niemand gave South Africa a glimmer of a hope with the wickets of captain Hassan Khan and Muhammad Taha.
But in Saad Khan (26, 62b, 3x4), Zaryab found an able partner and added 65 crucial runs for the sixth wicket, which proved to be decisive in a low-scoring affair.
This was Zaryabs third half-century in the tournament and second successive player of the match award after his 59 in another low-scoring match against Sri Lanka had ensured Pakistan not only qualified for the Super League but eventually topped their group ahead of Afghanistan.
South Africa 189-9 in 50 overs (Wandile Makwetu 60, Jason Niemand 36; Muhammad Musa 3-29, Shaheen Afridi 2-30)
Pakistan 190-7 in 47.5 overs (Ali Zaryab 74 n.o., Saad Khan 26; Jason Niemand 2-31)

Attack on Kataragama Police Station:
Former PS Chairman, supporters used brickbats causing heavy damage to vehicles, property
After the Kataragama shooting incident on January 21 at around 12.45 am, the former Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman who is contesting from the Podu Jana Peramuna, Chanaka Amil Rangana and a group of his supporters had attacked the Kataragama Police Station with brickbats and damaged a jeep and a motorcycle.
Further, the Police Station name board, six windows of the building and other damages too were also damaged by them, said State Law and Order Minister Piyasena Gamage in Parliament yesterday.
He further said that a lorry which was detained at the Police Station was also damaged due to the attack launched by this group.
Therefore, two teams of Police personnel had been deployed to conduct investigations into the incident, but so far the report with regard to the estimated damages caused due to the attack had not been received, he said, adding that once the reports are received, the IGP had been instructed to initiate necessary action against the perpetrators under the Public Property Act, noted Gamage in response to a question posed by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Orders 23/2.
Meanwhile, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake pointed out that there is no proper signalling system for the Police to stop drivers or people travelling on roads. In the shooting incident in Kataragama recently, the Police claim that while the rider had been ordered to stop, he had not done so. However, the villagers and the pillion rider claim that the Police had shot him while he was trying to stop. This is not the first shooting and certainly not the first such death. This sort of incident eventually results in the loss of life and impacts on innocent families. In such an instance, it is understandable that the relatives and villagers get upset and violent. If this situation could not be understood by the Police or the Government, then they dont seem to be people of this country.
Therefore, he said that there should be a proper signalling system enforced to indicate to the people when the Police expects them to stop. In some instances, he said they jump onto the road, flash a torch or just wave their hands. How are we to know what the proper signal to stop is Therefore, in the end, innocent lives are lost due to this minor issue. Hence, it is high time that the authorities come up with a proper signalling system that would indicate to drivers and road users what exactly the Police expect them to do so that we could prevent such future tragedies, he noted.
Encroaching in our territorial waters:
Proper judicial process needed to curb invaders : Amaraweera
The process of releasing foreign fishermen who are taken into custody for entering our territorial waters and engaging in illegal fishing would only be possible through a proper judicial process and the Sri Lankan Government has suspended the provisions for foreign governments to mediate in their release, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He said the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) (Amendment) Bill was brought in to increase the fines for foreign fishing boats that encroach on Sri Lankan territorial waters, adding that there were other countries who were far more interested in this Bill than Sri Lanka itself.
The minister said so while moving the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill Second Reading in Parliament yesterday.
Amareweera noted that despite having a sea area of over eight times the size of Sri Lanka, we have the right to international waters, over 10,000 inland tanks and 116 lagoons in the country, we still import fish, Maldive fish, dry fish, tinned fish and sprats in large quantities. We are trying very hard to reduce this amount. Hence increasing of fines is one such step in this endeavour. We intend to also engage in many other efforts in order to reduce the import of fish and increase the countrys exports. One of the first victories since we came into power was the lifting of the fish export ban. In comparison to 2016, fisheries exports had shown an increase of 44 percent in 2017. This year too we intend to improve this standard even further.
The Fisheries Minister said measures have also been taken to improve and uplift the fresh water fishing industry as well. In this respect, we intend to establish three fishing zones known as Aquaculture Industrial Parks, within the country. We have already allocated land in the North for this purpose and we hope to establish a 3,000 acre aqua industrial park in the North this year. We also intend to commence another aqua park in Batticaloa. In Hambantota we have commenced a crab city and intend to add another shortly.
He said Rs. 1,000 million had been allocated by the Finance Ministry for the development of lagoons, while 10 of them have been identified for initial development.
He added that currently the fisheries sector is the countrys 11th highest export earner and by 2020, it was intended to reach third place. This is a difficult task but we have implemented a mechanism to reach this goal, he said.
Previously, when a foreign fishing craft entered our waters illegally, we could only fine them an amount not more than, 1.5 million. This was a very meagre fine and as such, these foreign fishing boats did not hesitate to keep encroaching on our waters repeatedly. But now we have increased the fine from a minimum of Rs. 6 million to 175 million, through this amendment to the Act. He said.
The minimum fine will be Rs 5 million for boats less than 15 metres, Rs 20 million for boats between 15 and 24 metres, Rs 100 million for boats between 24 and 45 metres, Rs 150 million for boats between 45 and 75 metres and Rs 175 million for boats that were more than 75 metres.
Amaraweera further noted that in addition to the fine for entering Sri Lankan waters illegally, a further fine could also be imposed if these vessels failed to store their fishing equipment properly. This fine could be between Rs. 4 million to 150 million according to the amended regulations. There are several countries that have staged protests in this regard and even burnt my effigy. But, this is fine as we cannot implement our laws to benefit them or suit their purpose, but we have to ensure the safety and the best of interest of our local fishermen. Hence, we will not hesitate to take stern action against anyone who encroaches on our territorial waters irrespective or who they are or where they are from. Hence, if foreign vessels enter our waters and illegally fish in it, they will be charged on both counts.
The Minister said additional fines would be imposed on foreign vessels entering the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka without a valid permit. Earlier, there were no fines imposed, but under new laws, fines would be imposed not less that Rs. 10 million and not exceeding 220 million. Further, if they enter our Exclusive Economic Zone and have deployed their fishing gear to engage in fishing activities, an additional fine would be imposed not less than Rs. 5 million to a maximum of Rs. 160 million. No one could object to us implementing laws to protect our countrys resources, he said.
Lack of translators hinder Tamil weather forecasts: Anura Priyadarshana
A special programme had been introduced in September 2017, to issue weather forecasts in the Tamil language to the Electronic and Print Media twice a day at 05.30 am and 12 noon in the 25 districts, but it had been a failure due to it not been implemented properly, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa in a ministerial statement in Parliament yesterday.
However, he said measures have to be taken to issue warnings of bad weather immediately to the relevant areas along with visuals.
The department had also taken steps to update the Tamil web site to some degree considering the limited resources available to the ministry. In order to provide round the clock translation services, at least four translators should be deployed. Due to repeated requests made to the National Languages Department to provide us Tamil translators, finally on December 20, 2017, they temporarily assigned one Tamil translator. However, he only provides translations only during five week days. Due to the lack of translators within the department, the National Languages Department had suggested that we obtain the services of the National Languages Translators Pool. Hence, the department is obtaining the assistance of translators from the translators pool in carrying out the required services within the department unhindered, he said.
The Minister noted that bad weather warnings are sometimes needed to be issued during the nights and during weekends.
Therefore, he said in that in order to address this situation, translators are required to be deployed for this task and the State Administration Ministry has taken measures to fill these vacancies at their earliest.
Without renewal of agreement:
JO questions validity of Govt.s continuation
The National Government's validity of continuation without the renewal of agreement between the UNP and the SLFP was questioned in Parliament yesterday by the Opposition MPs.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, raising a question under Standing Orders 23 (2), stated that the Government had exceeded the number of Cabinet Ministers stipulated in the Constitution. The National Government was formed subsequent to a Parliamentary motion in 2015. The UNP-SLFP MoU to work in a National Government expired on December 31. As per the Constitution, the number of Cabinet Ministers should be limited to only 30, he said.
MP Gunawardena, observing that the Prime Minister should be consulted by the President prior to any ministerial appointment as per the Constitution, inquired from the Prime Minister whether he was consulted over the appointment of State Ministers Shriyani Wijewickrama and Piyasena Gamage last month.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, informing that the Prime Minister would reply to the question on a future date, queried MP Gunawardena whether he is against the appointment of MP Wijewickrama.
No you keep her with you. She had done a somersault. That is irrelevant to what I asked. I am raising a serious question with regard to the violation of the Constitution, MP Gunawardena replied.
There is no legal problem. We are ready to accept any member who crosses over to this side, Kiriella said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake said the number of Cabinet Ministers had been increased to 48, while the number of Deputy Ministers had been increased to 45 under the pretext of the National Government. Now its time had expired. We would like to know whether the Speaker had received the renewal agreement of the two parties. The Speaker should be duly informed if the agreement had been extended, he noted.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told the House that he had so far not received any official communication over a new agreement between the two parties or an extension of the existing agreement.

One of the founding principles on which the vibrant socio-political revolution that took place on January 8, 2015 was based on the notion of nation building and the promise of building a state on the principles of one nation, one country imbibing equal citizens with access to equal opportunities. Many look at building the nation i.e. nation building commonly in terms of ethnic lines where national integration is purely based on bridging the differences which exists (due to a host of socio-political and economic reasons) between ethnicities in multi ethnic societies. But it has to be questioned whether such a narrow view of nation building can suffice given the context we inhabit now.
The Rajapaksa regime which was in power from 2009 to 2015 did have a golden opportunity to bring about national reconciliation and construct a strong nation state especially after of the war which ravaged the country for over 30 years. But the then ruling regime willfully failed to do function in any constructive manner which would have brought about nation building.
It spread violence and fear within the society through false ethnic propaganda which led to violent clashes between the Sinhalese and the Muslims like in Aluthgama. It spread terror through extra judicial abductions by spreading white van terrorism. It promoted nepotism, corruption, and ethno nationalism (by allowing organisations like the Bodhu Bala Sena and the Ravana Balakaya among many others) which severely fractured the already broken and fractured social kaleidoscope of Sri Lanka.
Rajapaksa led regime
One of the most destructive things done to Sri Lanka by the previous Rajapaksa led regime was the gross manipulation of the fragile under developed political culture of Sri Lanka which lacked and still lacks a cohesive nature. The Rajapakshas brought about a tribal extremely male dominated patriarchal system of governance where people were ideologically manipulated by the institutional state apparatuses to rally around a strong ruler and his clan.
The ruler was portrayed as a king and his family as saviours of the nation from what they termed and identified as neo-colonial political influences. Accordingly, fear mongering, the threat of imminent western invasions, inquiries into alleged war crimes and the threat of another ethnic upheaval was enough to keep the Sinhalese Buddhist majority under check. By manipulating this political climate, corruption and terror became wide spread but those who spoke against them were shown as unpatriotic or either as western NGO agents working on destabilizing the nation state under the auspices of dollars.
But it became evident that corruption done under such fear mongering could not survive for long as Sri Lanka still has reminiscences of democracy left.
Thus, all these combined negativities of the previous regime paved the way to bring about the political revolution which took place on January 8, 2015 with the election of a new President and the appointment of a new government on the promise of good governance.
Even after the conclusion of the parliamentary elections in 2015, the UNP which secured a victory joined hands with the SLFP for the first time in the history creating a new political culture within Sri Lanka with the promise of bringing about sustainable development through constructing (or it is fair to say reconstructing) the Sri Lankan nation state. Before going into specifics, I believe that it is important to understand the theoretical formulations behind what these concepts mean.
Politics of nationalism
Before going on the concept of national integration, let me explain the meaning of the term nation. The term nation tends to be used with little precision and is often used interchangeably with terms such as the state, country, ethnic group and race. Andrew Heywood in his book politics states that there is a difficulty in defining the term nation as it comprises a mixture of objective and subjective features, a blend of cultural and political characteristics. In objective terms nations are cultural entities: groups of people who speak the same language, have the same religion, and are bound by a shared past, and so on. Such factors undoubtedly shape the politics of nationalism.
This form of the definition of the nation then is problematic because it will lead to a breaking up of the state on cultural lines such as the case was in Sri Lanka and many other South Asian states. This in a sense leads us to forming a second definition of the term nation based on Subjective terms. Again as Heywood points out, the nation is a psycho-political construct.
What sets a nation apart from any other group of collectivity is that its members regard themselves to be a nation. What does this mean A nation, in this sense, perceive itself to be a distinctive political community. This is what distinguishes a nation from an ethnic group. An ethnic group undoubtedly possess a communal identity and a sense of cultural pride, but unlike a nation, it lacks collective political aspirations.
These aspirations have traditionally taken the form of the quest for, or however, they may consist of a desire to achieve a measure of autonomy, perhaps as part of a federation or confederation of states.
It becomes clear from this discussion that two opposing descriptions for the term nation exists.While one works on cultural elements while the other works on political aspirations. But when analyzed critically, one can clearly see that cultural nationalism or trying to build up a nation on cultural terms can result in deadly outcomes as was the case in Sri Lanka and other South Asian States.
Collective memories and traditions
This notion which states the nation to be essentially an ethnic or cultural entity is considered to be the primary concept of the nation. This notion can be traced back to the work of 18th Century German writers like Herder and Fichte. Herder emphasizes that the innate character of each national group was determined by its natural environment, climate, physical geography, working habits, attitudes and creative propensities of a people.
Above everything else, he made emphasis on the importance of language which he believed was the embodiment of a peoples distinctive traditions and historical memories. Each nation reveals itself in songs, myths and legends which proves a nation as its source of creativity. The nation then is built on collective memories and traditions instead of an overtly political quest for statehood where national and ethnic identities overlap. Cultural nations tend to view themselves as exclusive ethnic groups where the membership of the nation is seem to derive not out of a political allegiance, voluntarily undertaken, but from an ethnic identity that has somehow been inherited.
The view that nations are essentially political entities emphasizes civic loyalties and political allegiances rather than on a common cultural identity. This notion which shows the people bound together primarily by a notion of shared citizenship regardless of their cultural and ethnic background can be traced back to the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau. His writings which stressed on a general will as well as popular sovereignty are regarded as the founding seeds of looking at the nation as political communities. The idea that nations are political and not ethnic communities has been supported by a number of theories of nationalism.
The idea that nations are political, not ethnic, communities has been supported by a number of theories of nationalism. Eric Hobsbawm (1983) for instance highlighted the degree to which nations are invented traditions. Rather than accepting that modern nations have developed out of long-established ethnic communities, Hobsbawm argued that a belief in historical continuity and cultural purity was invariably a myth, and , what is more, a myth created by nationalism itself. In this view, nationalism creates nations, not the other way round.
A widespread consciousness of nationhood did not for example develop until the late nineteenth century, perhaps fashioned by the invention of national anthems and national flags, and the extension of primary education. Certainly, the idea of a mother tongue passed down from generation to generation and embodying national culture is highly questionable. In reality, languages live and grow as each generation adapts the language to its own distinctive needs and circumstances.
National identity
Moreover, it can be argued that the notion of a national language is an absurdity as it is extremely political in a serious sense. Benedict Anderson (1983) also portrayed the modern nation as an artifact, in his case as an imagined community. Anderson pointed out that nations exist more as mental images that as genuine communities which require a level of face to face interaction to sustain the notion of a common identity. Within nations, individuals only ever meet a tiny proportion of those with whom they supposedly share a national identity. If nations exist, they exist as imagined artifices, constructed for us through education, the mass media and a process of political socialization.
A political nation clearly then is one where citizenship has greater political significance than ethnic identity. Though there are many contentious political problems within USA, it has been described as a prime example of a political nation.As a land of immigrants, the USA has a distinctively multiethnic and multicultural character, which makes it impossible for it to construct a national identity on the basis of a shared culture and historical tires. Instead a sense of American nationhood has been consciously developed through the educational system, and through the cultivation of respect for a set of common values, notably those outlined in the declaration of independence and the US Constitution. Similarly French national identity is closely linked to the traditions and principles of the 1789 French revolution.
What such nations have in common is that, in theory, they were founded upon a voluntary acceptance of a common set of principles or goals, as opposed to an existing cultural identity. It is sometimes argued that the style of nationalism which develops in such societies is typically tolerant and democratic. If a nation is primarily a political entity, it is an inclusive group, in that membership is not restricted to those who fulfill particular language, religious, ethnic or suchlike criteria. As we can see, a political nation is always preferred over a cultural nation. In a way a political nation encompasses a cultural nation because culture will exist there and the outlook will be that of a salad bowl.
National integration
The question then is as to how people in actuality can build up a modern nation state. From the time of the Polis in ancient Greece to the modern nation state the fundamental political question has remained the same and that is as to how one can build up a nation building. Thus in this context various questions like what does the project of national integration entail What are the means whereby states might achieve this end Which of these means would enable states to achieve integration without counterproductive consequences What are the ethical limits to the desirability of this goal Thus, this becomes a very difficult concept to define as well as pin point. According to Swarna Rajgopalan three definitions of integration can be identified as follows.
1. Integration is a process whereby the cooperation over time of the several creates a more or less singular entity that in turn facilitates further action and change and in which the several repose their allegiance to a greater of lesser degree.
2. Integration is the states goal of realizing its constitutional self-image
3. Integration is a process of coming together in attitude, memory, and interest.
This process derives from and contributes to the development of constitutive individuals, groups, and units. The state bears the primary responsibility for directing the integrative process, which may involve a variety of relationships among the constituent groups and between those constituents and the collective
Myron Weiner one of the earliest contributors to the subject of national integration in the field of social science in his Political Integration and Political Development provided five definitions of the term integration focusing on the functional dimensions and usages attached to it.
Weiner defines national integration as a process of bringing together culturally and socially discrete groups into a single territorial unit and the establishment of a national identity and recognized it as a key issue to be tackled by the countries with pluralistic social order and offers public policy strategies for the achievement of national integration for those societies, namely the (a) the elimination of the distinctive cultural traits of minority communities into some kind of a national culture, usually that of the dominant cultural group and (b) the establishment of national loyalties without eliminating subordinate cultures. According to Weiner the first strategy is generally referred to as the policy of assimilationist and the second as the policy of unity in diversity.
According to this presentation by Myron Weiner, national integration is a process dealing with the ethnic diversity in society. Thus, there are two strategies to achieve it (In this light National integration is a means of community building which has to take place within a state for it to function effectively as a cohesive political unit and is an essential aspect of democratic state building. What is interesting is that the national integration efforts are conducted essentially in two means by the use of the policies of assimilation and integration.
Accordingly assimilation can be viewed as a political project which is attempts to eliminate distinctive cultural elements belonging to minority communities into some kind of national culture, usually that of the dominant cultural group. Assimilation is a rigid homogenizing process, a where boundaries are reduced and people are re-socialized. In such an instance a minority group loses its traditional identity and has to acquire a new identity which generally belongs to the dominant group.
Integration is a much more politically correct concept. It generally means the establishment of a closer interdependence between the parts of a living organism or between the members of the society. It allows and encourages diversity and the maintenance of group boundaries. With integration, ethnic groups can remain within their own boundaries with autonomy where they will be able to maintain their own distinct cultural traits and boundaries while they get an equal opportunity to participate in the larger and the essential process of production, distribution and government.
Thus when we look at this above discussion, it becomes clear that Sri Lanka from the time of British Colonialism has followed a policy of divide and rule where a cultural nation working along the lines of assimilationist policies were favored over a political nation working on the means of integration.
Historical examples
There are some prime historical examples to validate this fact. The breaking up of the Ceylon National Congress in the 1940s, the official language act of 1956, giving prominence to Buddhism in the constitution of 1972 and 1978, the riots which took place during the Black July and the recent violence against the Muslims are cases in points. The problem here lies in the very fact of the erosion of the minority cultural traits which leads up to definite discrimination and extreme marginalization. Even if they adapt and embrace the dominant cultural traits, fair participation within that dominant cultural nexus will be far restricted and controlled. What then follows is resistance against such discrimination which can escalate upto conflicts at various levels which was quite substantially visible before the political revolution which took place in 2015 as the previous Rajapaksa regime did everything contrary to the accepted political means of constructing a nation.
Their notion of the nation state was created on what one would term in a Janus manner where they took selective historical items to create the future of the country to serve their political needs.
This government which was the creation of the UNP inherited a state which is extremely fractured and broken. It was politically stunted and economically disabled. Tensions were ripe and despite the war being over there was no democracy or rule by law which made nation building a mere dream reduced to fancy rhetoric. The rhetoric and the dominant discourses which emanated from the propaganda of the previous regime suited a certain section of the population and the ruling elites. But it definitely did not serve the purpose for the others.
When you look at the present political climate within Sri Lankait becomes clear then, that the present government within Sri Lanka is on the proper path to construct a nation state. One must remember that these serious errors in governance and the inherent weaknesses of the political culture cannot be rectified or replaced within a short period of time. In order to do that, it is necessary that the foundations are laid and that it is built on over a period of time to bring about a vibrant new political culture.
As stated before national integration cannot be merely achieved by finding a solution to the ethnic issue alone. It requires that the state be free from corruption, that rule of law is established and democracy strengthened by establishing constitutionalism and a clear cut system of checks and balances.
In this light, the present government brought about some fundamental changes to bring back the lost glory of democracy, constitutionalism, rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The press of the state is largely free from the previous harassments it received and the judiciary is largely free from political influence it had to face earlier. The politicization of the public service too was largely reduced with the establishment of the independent commissions which became operational.
The 19th constitutional amendment reduced the term of the President to five years from six and it again specifically stated that the President of the state can be only elected twice. It further reduced the power of the President by not allowing him to dissolve parliament until four years pass after a parliamentary election. These of course are strong measures to protect democracy which will curtail the chances of authoritarianism coming into the state again.
In addition to these, for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, the leader of the opposition hails from the Tamils and the two major parties came together to form a unity government which actually was regarded by many as the dawn of a new political climate and a culture.
A new constitution with a wider socio-political philosophy is being drafted with policies promoting integration as opposed to assimilation which will definitely move the state towards the ultimate goal of one nation one country imbibing equal citizens who have access to equal opportunities. It is in these lines that the lands occupied by various parties in the North and East are slowly being released to its rightful owners and new development projects are brought to the country to generate employment and macroeconomic stability within the state.
One must remember that all these things will only serve as the mere foundations and that they have to be built up with time in order to totally revamp the corrupt political culture of this state. It will obviously take time. But we must salute this current government for the initiatives it has taken so far to build a political nation along integrationist lines which gives us citizens hope for the future.

Planting scheme to impede HE conflict
The Palmyrah Development Board (PDB) has made arrangements to initiate a scheme to plant palmyrah plants in a zig-zag style in order to prevent wild elephants and tuskers from entering villages at night; to impede the human-elephant (HE) conflict.
Accordingly, the Palmyrah Development Board(PDB) Kalpitiya Reginal Office has already handed over about 10,000 palmyrah seeds to the Wanatavilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha. This novel method would be an environment-friendly and natural way of protecting inhabited rural villages from wild elephants, as these elephants are presently destroying many crops, houses, and human lives in the Kurunegala and Puttalam districts of the North Western Province.
PDB District Manager S. Arul Seelan told the Daily News that seeds are bought from villagers at Rs. 5 each and grown to be used as a natural, protective fences to prevent wild elephants from entering villages.
This would be a long-lasting solution to the present HE conflict that claims 200 lives of wild elephants and 180 lives of humans, annually.

Policing the police
Talk about reforming the Police Department has once again come to the surface. This follows the tragic incident in Kataragama where a motorcyclist fleeing police orders to halt was shot dead by a constable, near a check point. The incident sparked violent protests, with the local police station coming under attack by angry villagers. The PC concerned has been arrested and placed in remand, while over 50 agitators too had been taken into custody, and, subsequently released on bail.
The tragedy, coming in the heat of an election campaign, no doubt, has placed the government in a difficult situation. Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka has taken to task IGP Pujith Jayasundera, and asked him, in no uncertain terms, to police the police. According to an English daily, the minister has told the IGP that the people's protectors must not be predators, because such incidents could breach the people's trust in the police. In a tweet, the minister had also stated that the Kataragama incident was not an isolated one but stems from the lack of training and professionalism. Hence, drastic reforms (to the Police Department) will soon be introduced with the help of foreign experts. He said: "the police themselves are subjected to the law. When quelling a tense situation or an ugly demonstration, justifiable force should be used, in strict adherence to operating guidelines. It appears that these fundamentals have not been followed in relation to the Kataragama incident, the minister has reportedly stated in his tweet.
It defies reason as to why the police constable in question had taken the extreme measure of opening fire at the fleeing motorcyclist. It is not as if the country is under siege, as it was, during the second uprising of the JVP in the late eighties. There was no reason to suggest that the motorcyclist was carrying with him explosives to blow up some government installation, as was common in those violence plagued days. In the old police manuals, an individual defying police orders could be shot below the knee, or, a motorist fleeing orders to halt, gave the police the power to shoot at the vehicle.
Is this what got the PC concerned to go into action, without using his better judgement Which, once again brings up the whole issue of the war mentality still affecting a majority of our law enforcement officers. Are these trigger happy policemen still in the service, without undergoing rehabilitation
As is common knowledge, during the war years, recruitment to the Tri-forces dispensed with all laid down criteria and background screening. Understandably, in the urgent need for augmenting manpower, to fight the enemy, the government could not afford such a luxury. The Police Department was no exception. As a result, plenty of bad eggs found their way into the services as well as the police. The large number of murders and armed robberies today, involving army deserters, are a direct consequence of this haphazard recruitment, though necessitated by the existing contingencies.
Similarly, the Police Department, too, may still have in its midst, criminal elements or those with a criminal bent, who may have not been able to shed the brutalized effects of the war years. It is no exaggeration to say that it is such tendencies that manifest itself, from time to time, leading to incidents as that witnessed in Kataragama. It is this aspect, more than anything else, that should engage the attention of the minister, who is contemplating sweeping reforms to the Police Department. The frequency with which incidents involving the police, that is been reported, too, should be taken into account. Like the minister stated, the police has not been given a carte blanche to act and the law enforcement too is subject to the law.
On the other side of the coin, the police, too, is today forced to act under tremendous pressure, to exercise restraint, and this aspect too should receive the minister's consideration. The frequency of the protests, their violent nature, and, the dimension these protests and agitations have taken, no doubt, places the law enforcement in an unenviable position. The police cannot merely standby and allow for a breach of the peace to take place, for it's prime duty is to protect the citizenry from harm. In performing this task, it is grossly unfair, nay, unbecoming, for the police to be held accountable for what may be seem as excessive use of force to quell unruly mobs bent on mayhem.
We say this because the police, recently, came under fire from the authorities for manhandling some university students who had lain siege of the Health Ministry building. This, after the students had damaged state property. The police had no alternative but to act the way they did There is also the ploy used frequently today to put Bikkhus in the forefront of any agitation and the police are unfairly blamed if some monk is manhandled. It is in this context that the term minimum force takes on special significance. Who is to judge the degree of force, to be used by the police, in a given situation

Pound hits $1.40 for  first time since Brexit vote
Sterling has extended its rally against the dollar to rise above $1.40 for the first time since the Brexit vote.
Analysts said the pound's recovery was helped by falls in the dollar and a rethink by some investors about the UK's economic prospects.
Others said that despite little development in the Brexit talks this month, there was some optimism about the UK's chances of securing a deal.
The pound rose by 0.3% to $1.4030 on Tuesday afternoon before easing back.
Sterling fell below $1.20 to a 30-year low against the dollar in the months after the UK voted to leave the European Union, contributing to a spike in inflation as imports became more expensive.
But the pound has seen a steady recovery in recent months, which benefits UK tourists visiting the US and could bring down the cost of imports.
Analysts pointed to a range of factors for the pound's rise against the dollar, which saw it also briefly touch $1.40 on Monday night.
There is definitely a feeling that Brexit is now far more likely to be soft, which underestimates the risk for more problems ahead in our view but for the time being is leading to demand for [the pound], said John Marley, head of FX strategy at currency advisers Infinity International.
French President Emmanuel Macron told the BBC over the weekend that the UK could have a bespoke trade deal with the EU.
Earlier this month, the pound surged after a news report that the Spanish and Dutch finance ministers had agreed to seek a Brexit deal that kept the UK as close to the EU as possible.
But others said the recovery in sterling was overdue.
Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there was an element of investors returning to business as usual for the pound.

In preparation for the battlefield
The political climate in the country continues to be volatile and friction between leaders of the major parties continue to escalate as the countdown is on for local government elections which will be held less than three weeks from now.
The incident that generated headlines and much comment this week was President Maithripala Sirisenas address to the Cabinet. Bringing a tape recorder to the meeting, the President informed the assembled ministers that he would record his speech.
What followed was an impassioned 35-minute speech where President Sirisena pointedly raised the issue of whether the government wished to fight corruption or not. The President was obviously reacting to remarks by United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians who had publicly queried the Presidents bona fides in establishing a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds.
Among them was State Minister for International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe who had declared that the President was dabbling in politics while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was busy developing the country. Colombo District parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar also raised eyebrows following reports that he had called the President a pickpocket President. However what Marikkar had said was that the UNP picked Mahinda Rajapaksas pocket to elevate Maithripala Sirisena to the Presidency.
Election campaign
Nevertheless, it was clear the President was not enamoured with these remarks, even though he would have known that they would have been coloured by the rhetoric of an ongoing election campaign. He also mentioned the names of several others- including Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando and parliamentarians Sydney Jayaratne and Nalin Bandara- as being unfairly critical of him. Thus, the President gave a piece of his mind while the Cabinet listened in stunned silence.
The President stated that he had opposed the appointments of both Ravi Karunanayake (as Minister of Finance) and Arjuna Mahendran (as Governor of the Central Bank) noting that their appointments were decisions made by the UNP faction of the government. Thereafter he posed the question as to whether the Cabinet felt the government should continue in this manner. He then left the meeting.
It was this interlude that generated the most controversy. Headlines in the following days newspapers were President storms out of Cabinet meeting, or words to that effect. An explanation provided by Cabinet Spokesperson and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, that the President left the meeting to answer a call of nature, did not help matters and only led to more conjecture.
UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP
What in fact transpired was that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and other senior ministers discussing issues with the President, leading to a resumption of the Cabinet meeting where it was business as usual thereafter. Among the issues resolved at the meeting was the controversial gazette allowing the sale of liquor to women, which was withdrawn by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera at President Sirisenas request.
Following these events, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe moved into damage control mode. The UNPs parliamentary group as well as the partys decision making body, the Working Committee were summoned for a joint meeting where party members were strongly advised to refrain from being critical of the President.
However, UNPers have noted that while they have been called upon to be measured in their criticism, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers have continued to be quite vocal in their criticism of the UNP. Among those who have been more vociferous in this respect have been Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekera, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Dilan Perera. They are also likely to be cautioned by the President to tone down their rhetoric against the UNP.
That this is a manifestation of the scramble for votes ahead of the local government election is obvious. The three major parties in the running, the UNP, the SLFP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) have had to map out campaign strategies aimed at capturing the imagination of the masses and this task is easiest for the SLPP.
Supreme Court verdict
The newly established party is not burdened with the problems of incumbency and has the luxury of opposing both the SLFP and the UNP. In this respect, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been in his element, taunting the government and making mischievous references to the episode at the last Cabinet meeting, attempting to make the case that the government is not functioning efficiently as it was during his tenure in office.
In contrast, both the SLFP and the UNP have to be more cautious in their campaign utterances. Also, they cannot be too supportive each other as well, because that will then mean that there is little to discern between the two parties for the average voter. So, it is a tightrope walk for the SLFP or UNP parliamentarian.
To overcome this, President Sirisena has evolved the theme of fighting corruption and restoring the economy. At a campaign rally this week, he stated that after the local government elections, he will take control of the economy, a subtle hint that the countrys economic performance has been under par under the stewardship of UNP ministers.
Similarly, he is also keen to emphasise on the anti-corruption theme. Referring to the Supreme Court verdict which ruled that his term of office will end in January 2020, the President stated that his answer to those who were querying the duration of his tenure was that he will leave office when all those who were corrupt are behind bars. A few days later he made a public appeal to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to join him in his fight against corruption.
If the UNP is concerned that the Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank bond sale has hurt its prospects at the local government elections, the SLPP should be concerned as well. That is because the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, recommended legal action against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. There is no doubt this will be an issue for much public debate as the contents of the report emerge into the public domain.
Meanwhile, causing concern for the President is the controversy involving Chief Minister of the Uva Province, Chamara Sampath Dassanayake who is alleged to have asked the Principal of a Tamil Girls School to kneel down in his presence. What might have otherwise been a local incident has now escalated into a full blown issue at the local government polls even though the Chief Minister is not even a candidate at the elections with the SLPP and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) having trained their guns on the SLFP over this incident.
President Sirisena directed Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundera to launch an inquiry into the incident and Chief Minister Dassanayake resigned as Provincial Minister of Education. On Tuesday Dassanayake surrendered to the Police, was produced in courts and was released on bail. However, calls are growing for him to step down as Chief Minister as well. Clearly, the election is having its effect not only the candidates at the poll but on politicians at the provincial and national level as well.
There will be more of this in the remaining two and a half weeks as the campaign hots up because the three major parties- the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP- are aware that their immediate political future will be determined by the outcome of the election.
For President Sirisena, a rousing endorsement would mean that he could continue with his Presidency consolidating his power both within the government as well as within the SLFP. Similarly, the SLPP is keen on a strong performance because they are well aware that a rejection of their party at the poll will signal the end of the dynastic politics of the Rajapaksas. As for the UNP, victory would have been theirs for the taking with the SLFP divided right down the middle, but they have scuppered their chances through the Central Bank bond sale issue. It will certainly be an interesting two and a half weeks to come.

President creating an environment free of corruption - Faiszer
President Maithripala Sirisena was creating an environment in the country that was free of corruption and he was a leader who rejected corruption during the period of this government as well as the previous one, said Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha.
The Minister said the statement made by some requesting people to vote for him to make him President and not to vote for the party he represents this time around is very silly. If he is a good person then the party he represents should also be good and we should vote for this party.
He was speaking at a series of rallies addressed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike in the Attanagalla electorate to garner support for the candidates contesting from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, on Tuesday.
More than 99% of the Muslim community voted for Maithripala Sirisena during the last presidential election and Muslims should vote for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party this time around too.
The President's hand should be strengthened for the sake of the Muslim community, the Minister said. You can remember how the Muslims had been beaten up and had been subjected to abuse. Whatever any one may say today, the Muslims are able to practise their religion in a peaceful environment.
Some were traditional UNP supporters, he said, but we should now begin a new era by voting for the SLFP.
Dring a visit to the Eastern Province, the Minister said, Some others are wearing a Muslim label and doing politics and we are well aware of their brand of politics which is purely business. Those leaders had always been selling the Muslim community and all Muslims should really be aligned with the majority parties.
He went on to say that the Muslim Congress has lost the confidence reposed on them by the Muslim community. Now the Muslim Congress has transformed into a three-wheeler party. After the death of Ashroff, Ferial Ashroff was chased out by leader Hakeem and those like Rishad, Ammer Ali, Najeeth Majith Athaula, Basheer, and Hassan, were all kicked out. This time the people will kick out the Muslim Congress at this election.
The Minister said, I am always with the Muslim community, but as Sri Lankans we should be together with Maithripala Sirisena and I am ready to give leadership to the Muslim community in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

Railway strike called off
The lightning strike launched by the Railway Locomotive Engine Drivers Union and the Railway Guards Union at midnight on Tuesday was called off last afternoon after discussions between the railway trade unions and the Railway General Manager.
Locomotive Engine Drivers Union Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the strike was launched regarding several demands on the non delivery of promises made by the Ministerial Sub Committee during the last railway strike and also about the shortcomings in the brake system of Chinese locomotives.
The other key demand is the failure to extend the service period of retired Railway Engine drivers working on contract basis.
The strike was called off after the Railway General Manager was agreed to extend the contract period of retired engine drivers.
Although,it was agreed during the last Ministerial Sub Committee not to punish those who participate in the last strike. This has not been done and it was one of the reasons for the strike.
Railway Guards Trade Union Chairman Janaka Fernando said there was a dispute between the railway guards and station masters on the handling of goods and luggae and this was also resolved through the discussions.
Meanwhile, it was revealed that Railway General Manager Mahanama Abeywickrama did not know anything about the strike.

Rosy vows to fight for equal rights for women
There is a group of people who believe that women are incapable of doing anything. Their ideas and messages discriminate against women. This situation has come about owing to the way women were treated during the past regime, said Rosy Senanayake, UNP Mayoral candidate yesterday.
She was addressing a campaign meeting at Torrington Road, Colombo.
Senanayake added that there will be 25% womens representation in the Colombo Municipal Council after February 10. That was made possible owing to the progressive actions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. She thanked him for facilitating this change in local government.
Sri Lanka still has laws that are discriminatory against women. At a time when equality between men and women is upheld, Sri Lanka continues to promote ideas and laws that discriminate against women. A democracy guarantees equal treatment of all, she said, adding that a womans right is a human right.
Disrespectful comments about me are spread owing to this discriminatory environment, where there are laws which determine what a woman can and cannot do; laws that permit men to do anything they wish, Senanayake said.
She denounced such patriarchal behavior. I will not hesitate to speak out against laws or attitudes that discriminate against women, she said, adding that she will continue to fight for equal rights for women.

Spore - Lanka  FTA unlocks new era for both countries
The signing of the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement between Singapore and Sri Lanka has truly unlocked a new era for both countries, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
Speaking at the Sri Lanka - Singapore Business Forum yesterday under the theme Unlocking a New Era of Partnership he said that for Sri Lanka, this is a landmark agreement.
It is the first trade agreement that Sri Lanka has forged in over 10 years. It is also the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka, which means its the first agreement that goes beyond goods and includes services, investment, economic cooperation e-commerce and more. It signals the commitment of our government to usher in an era of openness for Sri Lanka, and become a formidable economic hub in the Indian Ocean and its part of a broader strategy of looking east to renew our trade relationships. This FTA is our first agreement with a South East Asian country and we envisage this as a first step towards closer integration with ASEAN, and potentially be part of the RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the future.
The Minister said that Singapore has emerged as an important partner for Sri Lanka over the years. Singaporean state institutions and private companies are involved in infrastructure development, urban design, manufacturing, tourism, and technical training. Singaporean agencies have helped with the digitization of Sri Lankas Inland Revenue Department, which is already demonstrating results in terms of administrative efficiency and revenue collection.
Commenting on the Sri Lanka economy the Minister said that the government has taken numerous initiatives to re-orient the economy and make Sri Lanka a respected and formidable player in the Asian region once again.
The focus of the government is to shift the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports, and foreign direct investment. We are also committed to improving the ease of doing business and by next year you will see the results.
In addition to the agreement with Singapore, we will soon finalize comprehensive FTAs with India and China. We also recently regained the GSP Plus trade concessions to the European Union and have an ongoing trade and investment framework agreement with the United States and Australia. With our excellent strategic location, we have also become attractive for Belt and Road projects from China.
The Minister invited Singaporean firms to invest in these zones and to do business here to access the South Asian region and beyond.

Sampanthan also said Sri Lanka should remain united, undivided, and indivisible.
We will not accept a deceptive solution, we want genuine power-sharing arrangements where people will be able to exercise powers with regard to matters that are related to them in daily life, he said.
Unfortunately as a country we have gone on the wrong path, he added.
Sampanthan asked Prime Minister Lee to appeal to Singaporean investors to invest in the countrys North and East.
The young people in the North and the East are hardworking and dedicated, but unfortunately due to the war they have been deprived of jobs and opportunities to develop their skills, he said.

Prime Minister Lee said he would visit Trincomalee on his next visit, and added that he was thankful to the Tamil people of Sri Lanka for the contribution they had made toward the development of Singapore.
