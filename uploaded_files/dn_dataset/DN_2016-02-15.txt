Four-wicket Ashwin helps India clinch T20 series
Premier off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin's four-wicket haul helped India crush Sri Lanka by nine wickets in the third T20 international as the hosts clinched the series 2-1 in Visakhapatnam on Sunday.

Electing to bowl on what seemed like a flat deck, Ashwin (4-8) managed his best bowling figures in T20 cricket to skittle out the visitors for 82 in 18 overs -- their lowest score in the shortest format. Chasing a modest target, India cantered home in 13.5 overs to hold on to their top spot in T20s and continue their winning run before the Asia Cup and the World T20.

It was India's night all the way after Ashwin, who was given the new ball by skipper MS Dhoni, struck twice in the very first over to remove the Sri Lankan openers.

Already fielding a depleted side, the visiting batsmen struggled against a disciplined Indian attack, which had the right mix of youth and experience.

The Sri Lankan scorecard painted a sorry picture with just Dasun Shanaka (19) and Tisara Perera (12) managing double figures as the rest of the batting collapsed.

Sri Lanka though had a few moments to enjoy after top-scorer Shanaka smashed a couple of sixes during his 24-ball stay, but the visitors suffered from lack of partnerships.

Part-time spinner Suresh Raina also chipped in with two wickets.

India probably ticked all the boxes after their opening loss in Pune to not only bowl or bat well, but also get their fielding act together in the three-match series.

India's ground fielding was highlighted by Jadeja running out Seekkuge Prasanna with a direct throw.
With most of the pressure off their back, the Indian batsmen did their job to bring up another T20 series' win after their 3-0 triumph in Australia recently.

Opener Shikhar Dhawan, who hit a maiden T20 fifty in the team's last win on Friday, continued his fine run with an unbeaten 46 to help the hosts register their biggest T20 win in terms of balls remaining.

Rohit Sharma was cleaned up by Dushmantha Chameera but that was only a hiccup in India's march towards victory as Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane put on an unbeaten 55-run stand.

Dhawan remained the top-scorer in the series with 106 runs from three games while Ashwin was named the man of the series for his nine wickets.

It was Dhoni's first T20 bi-lateral series win on home soil as the World Twenty20 hosts hammered home their status as one of the favourites for the title in March.

Govt will implement all pledges - PM

The government will keep to all the pledges given to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivering a special statement in Badulla, on Saturday said.
He said that the national government was formed as the people wanted such a government and added that the people also expected a government which thinks differently.
"So far one party remained in power under party politics and no solutions were provided to the problems faced by the public. But the present government has begun to think differently with new ideas. It is our responsibility to work with the people," the Prime Minister said.
The Premier also emphasised the the necessity of creating a democratic society with all respecting each other.
"We should ensure the rights of all Sri Lankans. Then only we can create a better society and the world will accept us," he said.
Singing the National Anthem in Tamil is not an issue as both Sinhala and Tamil national anthems have been mentioned in the Constitution. The government had also taken an important measure to increase the female representation in politics and parliament.
But the pro-Rajapaksa group had caused a commotion in parliament when the Bill was tabled.
Their behaviour proved that they have no genuine concern for the country's women or their rights, the Prime Minister said. He said that pro-Rajapaksa group is only concerned about their own representation.
Referring to a harmful comment made on the TV recently, on the Danno Budunge song which was sung at a musical show to mark the Independence Day, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that stern action will be taken against electronic media stations who exceed their limit by insulting women in an unpleasant manner.
"Media institutions are not properties of their owners. They belong to the citizens of the country, of which nearly 52 percent are women. If media insults women, then they do not respect the majority of the population," the Premier said.
He said that anybody has freedom to criticize positively or negatively or praise an artistic performance of a person. But there is no freedom to attack a person in abusive language," he said.
The government would not tolerate any verbal attacks on individuals by the media, the Premier warned.
"During the previous regime, media personalities were told to attack those opposing the government or the rulers and their families. There seems to be remnants belonging to that era still haunting.
They cannot practice their habits under this government," Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the government would sternly implement the selection criteria when issuing transmission licenses to electronic media, taking into consideration any unethical conduct.
Commenting on the criticism levelled at the opera singer, he said he would inquire from heads of the relevant television station whether they have conducted a disciplinary inquiry over the controversial statement.
He also added that the government will not allow the media to attack individuals, women, religions or ethnicities. It is time the media conducted their work in a professional and ethical manner.
The government will take a more exacting path after discussions with Telecommunication Regulatory Commission officials when issuing the transmission license to electronic media, the Prime Minister said.

Only Parliament can introduce or change the Constitution - PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that Chief Justices cannot be allowed to introduce or change the Constitution as they wish, as, it is a duty of Parliament.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a ceremony organized to mark the 100th birthday anniversary of late President D.B.Wijethunga in Kandy yesterday.
He added that late President Wijethunga, who became the Executive President after the untimely death of President Ranasinghe Premadasa was an exemplary Executive President. The way he exercised his duties as Executive President is praiseworthy.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that after the 1994 election defeat, Wijethunga had to appoint a Prime Minister. Without violating the tradition or the opinion of the party, he appointed Chandrika Kumarathunga as the Prime Minister.
He said that the country's destiny took a different path in 2003, with a decision taken by the Supreme Court.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he was on a foreign tour as that time and does not know from where that decision came.

Opposition to proposed ECTA: GMOA claims government attacking organization

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) yesterday claimed that the government is attacking their organization and individual officers due to their opposition to the proposed Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA).
Current Secretary of the organization Dr. Nalinda Herath was on Friday summoned to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to record a statement regarding a document published by the GMOA in 2012.
According to him, the move is an attack on the organization as they were key organizers, of the protest against the ETCA held on Thursday. He claimed that the government is engaging on a vicious attack against professionals who voiced their opinion on the proposed agreement with India.
"The document is a guideline on licensing foreign doctors to practice in Sri Lanka which was developed by the GMOA in partnership with the Ministry of Health," Dr. Herath said.
According to him, the questioning was about a detail included in the document.
"There was a problem with unqualified Indian doctors performing cardiothoracic surgeries in Sri Lanka. There was an inquiry and we developed this guideline to approve any application to practice in the country. But this was not published during my time. So I was not able to give them any details," Dr. Herath said.
He has also been told that Dr. Anurudda Padenniya will also be summoned for questioning this week.

President took over SLFP leadership using Executive Powers - MR

Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he gave up the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) chairmanship after the Presidential election as he had no intention of splitting the party.
However he added that the SLFP leadership was taken over by President Maithripala Sirisena using his Executive Powers.
He was adderssing a meeting organized by a group of SLFP Local Council members in Negombo yesterday.
The meeting was organised following the SLFP Central Committee's decision to suspend the party membership of several Local Government members with immediate effect, it was reported.
The committee had decided to initiate disciplinary inquiries against the local councilors for allegedly acting against the party and its leadership.
Rajapaksa added that the decision of the SLFP members to work together with the United National Party (UNP) is unacceptable.
Quoting a Sinhala folk tale, he said that this is similar to the 'Gamarala'going to heaven by hanging on to the tail of an elephant.
"They are trying to see heaven by hanging on to the elephant's tail. What would happen if the Gamarala loses his grip" he asked. Rajapaksa claimed that over 95 per cent of SLFP Local Council members attended the Negombo meeting.
