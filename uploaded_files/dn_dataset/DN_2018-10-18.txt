Sharp potential in condo investment for Sri Lankan expats
Sri Lankan expats overseas are eyeing real estate as an investment opportunity, according to real estate sector experts.
This has come to light with the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee and many expatriates are looking for apartments that are already built by a reputed company in Sri Lanka, Iconic Developments Pvt Ltd officials said.
A recent report by KPMG said about 18 per cent buying apartments are Sri Lankan expatriates and 4 percent are institutional investors. This figure has increased substantially with the rupee depreciation, Rohan Parikh, Managing Director of Iconic Developments Pvt Ltd said.
The average year-on-year depreciation of the rupee from January 1, 2015 to September 21, 2018 was 9.2 percent per year. This has positioned aspiring expat condo owners in a significantly better position to purchase apartments, Parikh said. In the short span of 14 months since its launch, Iconic galaxy has captured the hearts and minds of investors and residents with more than half of its residences sold. Galaxy builds on Iconics success at 110 Parliament Road, with over 172 residences sold in 2 years, on time delivery and double-digit returns. Parikh added that their landmark residences, set in the heart of rapidly growing Rajagiriya, overlooking the Royal Colombo Golf Club, offered a lifestyle and amenities of a caliber never seen before  including an entire 2 floors dedicated to entertainment and fitness, with facilities such as a gymnasium, swimming pool, spa, crche, sports areas and more. Its mostly what those residing abroad have already experienced. Rohan Parikh said with Iconic Galaxy now poised to become a fitting sequel to the 110 Parliament Road story  one that will set a new standard in Rajagiriya. Its now a good time that expat Sri Lankans should ideally purchase apartments in Colombo, Parikh said. The KPMG report says 61 percent of the buyers of luxury condominiums are local investors, while 17 per cent are local end-users. During the past few months we noticed there was a major hike in the queries from locals residing abroad, Rohan Parikh, Managing Director Iconic said.
It also says the moderation in inflation in the first quarter of 2018 and the favorable inflation outlook as well as the continued negative output gap, compelled the Central Bank to end its policy tightening bias and reduce the SLFR by 25 basis points on April 4, 2017.
As witnessed by this report, Sri Lankas core economic statistics stand favourable towards aspiring expat apartment buyers. The GDP has grown marginally in 2017 and is now at Rs. 13.3 trillion while in 2016 it was Rs. 11.9 trillion. The countrys Growth rate is now 4.5 percent, he said, adding that with this backdrop, the countrys housing requirement is high. Around 100,000 housing units per year are needed to fill the housing gap, Parikh revealed, noting that in this light the demand for apartments is increasing.
There is stable economic growth. GDP per capita in 2017 was US$ 4,065. The government targets a GDP per capita of US$ 5,075 by 2020, propelling the countrys status to an upper middle income economy, Rohan Parikh said explaining the statistics adding that Colombo Megapolis Development Plan will boost the countrys economy further.
The Port City will be a game-changer with improvement in internal and external connectivity Sri Lankas urbanization growth will amplify from 0.3 per cent to 3-4 percent in the next 15 years, to reach an urbanization rate of 30 per cent by 2030. Parikh said. He said that Port City Development Project is a key focal point in the real estate landscape of the region.

Presidential Commission on SriLankan Airlines:
Surrendering of airlines internationally recognised certificate affected maintenance
The surrendering of an internationally recognised certificate given to SriLankan Airlines had caused for the limitation of the large scale (heavy) maintenance of aircraft since 2017, said Anura Bandara Gallella, Manager, Training and Standards of Sri Lankan Airlines testified before the commission yesterday.
He was giving evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on SriLankan Airlines yesterday,
SriLankan Airlines received the certificate issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2007, which allows the Airline to conduct mainly the Base Maintenance, Line Maintenance, and Workshop Maintenance by them. The companies registered under them should meet their standards and regulations and the EASA constantly supervises them through audits, Gallella said.
One of the findings that were pointed out by the EASA in December 2014 was that the Base Maintenance Hanger known as the 747 hanger of the airline was not equipped with a hanger door, he said.
The witness said that the installation of a hanger door was very expensive and airline was in a poor financial situation by then.
However, the witness told the Commission that the EASA even after an audit conducted in June 2017 was not fully satisfied with the conduct of the airline in meeting their standards that had been changed by them time to time. Therefore, the EASA and the airline had discussions and later came to a conclusion to surrender the maintenance certificate until the standards are met by the SriLankan. This was only for the base maintenance but not for the line and workshop maintenance. This was caused to limit such maintenance that required the EASA approval, the witness said.
The witness told that the hanger door was installed after 2016 and the airline was able to regain another certificate in May 2018, which allowed them to perform only a few tasks of the surrendered one. By this certificate, they had been permitted to perform the maintenance of A320 air crafts and the airline is expecting the approval from the EASA to conduct A330 aircraft maintenance in the future, he added.

Twilight  saga celebrates 10 years of changing the tide
Twilight is heading back to the big screen. Ahead of Halloween, the box office phenomenon is returning to theaters this month for a special two-night event in honour of the films 10th anniversary.
The movie, based on the best-selling novel by Stephenie Meyer, was released on November 21, 2008, and went on to gross nearly $400 million worldwide. The success of Twilight spawned four successful sequels and made household names out of its young cast, including Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart, and Anna Kendrick.
A decade later, the film is being re-released in more than 450 movie theaters nationwide. Special screenings of Twilight will take place on October 21 and 23.
The special screenings will be accompanied by a new featurette from director Catherine Hardwicke and actor Jackson Rathbone (who played Jasper Hale in the film), along with an exclusive sneak peek of the brand-new special feature Twilight Tour10 Years Later, from the upcoming Twilight 4K Ultra HD release, available at retailers on October 23.
We want to give fans an experience they could never replicate at home, says Tom Lucas, VP of studio relations at Fathom Events, the company hosting the screenings. Theyll be seeing Twilight in a movie theater on the big screen with other fans, sharing the passion and excitement in a communal environment.
We also see this as a chance to introduce the movie to a new generation of fans that were not old enough to see it in theaters 10 years ago.
Twilight became one of 2008s biggest box-office success stories - and one of the highest-grossing female-directed films of all-time.
The Twilight saga films, released by Lionsgates Summit Entertainment, grossed over $3 billion globally. The final film in the franchise, Breaking Dawn  Part 2, became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, with nearly $830 million worldwide.

Abbas destroys Australia  to put Pakistan on top
Abu Dhabi, Wednesday: Medium pacer Mohammad Abbas registered a five-wicket haul to steer Pakistan into a dominating position in the second Test against Australia in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
Abbas finished with five for 33 to bowl out Australia for a paltry 145 to give Pakistan a 137-run lead in the first innings on the second day at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.
Pakistan stretched that lead to 281 as they were 144 for two at close, with Azhar Ali not out on 54 for his first half century in the series and Haris Sohail was 17 not out.
With eight wickets in hand Pakistan were in a great position to force a 1-0 lead in the two-match series after the first Test ended in a fighting draw in Dubai last week.
Azhar, who fell for disappointing scores of 18, four and 15 in the last three innings, batted with resolve, having so far hit three boundaries.
But it was once again debutant Fakhar Zaman who lifted Pakistan with a brilliant 66 following up his 94 in the first innings, before giving a return catch to Nathan Lyon who took an evasive action but still managed to hold onto the ball.
Zaman hit seven boundaries in an enterprising knock.
Zaman said Pakistan were in the driving seat.
Yes, our position is good, said Zaman. If we score 100-150 runs more on Thursday then with a turning wicket we have a very good chance of winning this Test.
Zaman said he was lucky to have played this Test.
I was with the squad from the start but during the first Test I was about to return to Pakistan before, unfortunately, Imam-ul-Haq got injured and I got this chance of playing my first Test.
Mohammad Hafeez, who scored a hundred in the drawn first Test, fell to a lazy shot off pacer Mitchell Starc, caught at short mid-off for six.
Earlier, Abbas and spinner Bilal Asif (3-23) wrecked Australia for 145 in their innings.
Abbas had Shaun Marsh, in the fourth over of the day, for three and Travis Head for 14 before wrapping up the innings by trapping Starc leg-before for 34.
This becomes Abbass third five-wicket haul in a burgeoning career of ten Tests.
Asif had removed Aaron Finch (39) and in the last over before lunch trapped Tim Paine leg-before for three. Marnus Labuschagne offered some resistance during his 25 before falling to a freakish run out, backing up too far as a drive from Starc was deflected to the stumps by Yasir Shah with Labuschagne out of his crease.
Abbas, whose first wicket of the match made him the joint second fastest Pakistani to 50 wickets, gave Pakistan an early wicket in the fourth over of the day, removing Marsh with a catch in the slip.
He then had Head caught in the second slip to leave Australia at 56 for four.
Leg-spinner Yasir made it 75 for five with the wicket of Mitchell Marsh, caught close to the wicket for 13 before Australia lose two more to reach lunch at 91 for seven.
Afer the Tests both the teams will play a series of three Twenty20 international with the first in Abu Dhabi on October 24. AFP

Abigail Schaffter  presents first solo-art exhibition, Reflections



Reflecting on the complexities and simplicities of life at the same time, Abigail Schaffter will stage her first solo art exhibition on October 27 and 28 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. Titled Reflections, the art exhibition will feature the best of Abigails paintings accumulated since she began painting last year.
Serving at Peoples Church, Narahenpita as a full-time Pastor, Abigail is also the wife of prominent business personality Ramesh Schaffter and a mother of four.
Reflections she says, was born from a place of desolation and struggle. Feeling overwhelmed by my many responsibilities and stretched thin between home, college and work, I experienced a burnout last year. Through this experience, I found resilience from within and my unwavering belief in God kept me anchored throughout the long, difficult months. Over the period that followed, art was a lifeline. I lost myself in painting for hours, and discovered a blissful therapy in art. Late last year, whilst at a Christian retreat, I experienced supernatural healing from the Lord Jesus Christ. The burden of my burnout was lifted she stated.
Using oil, acrylic, watercolours, soft pastels and inks, the paintings trace Abigails journey and the lessons she has learnt. Reflections explore the reflections of matter on water, but also the souls reflection on what really matters. Threading through moments of stillness and quiet contemplation, the exhibition weaves together a celebration of beauty and the joy of living.
Abigails artistic talents were honed by another gifted artist and art teacher Rhuani Rambukwelle who is instrumental in making this exhibition possible.
Rhuani has been more than a teacher. She has spent hours guiding and supporting me every step of the way says Abigail.

Aedas, KWA, project architects  for Colombo City Centre


Aedas, a multinational focused on architecture and design together with the award winning Colombo-based architectural and interior design firm KWA Architects were the project architects of Sri Lankas latest international shopping mall Colombo City Centre (CCC) that opened its doors to the public on September 19.
CCC, the latest buzz and excitement in the city, is a collaboration of Abans PLC and Next Story Group. The mall which is gaining popularity from almost all segments is part of a massive 48 storey mixed development towering above the Beira Lake waterfront with over a quarter of a million sqft of retail space, 600 plus parking slots, 164-room city hotel and 192 luxury apartments.
Talking on the occasion, projects architects Simon Griffiths from Aedas with Thilan Koththigoda and Thushari Wijesundara from KWA Architects said, We are delighted to see the first phase of Colombo City Centre Development come to such a wonderful completion and it is heart warming to see how the people of Colombo have embraced this latest addition to their city.
The design from the outset has attempted to blend in with the urban context while including some features uniquely Sri Lankan. The car park screen inspired by traditional Sri Lankan weaving patterns features the colors of the Sri Lankan national flag and forms a unique identifying feature. In general, the car park faade is one of the most featureless elements in a high-rise structure. But in this instance we used it to celebrate the Sri Lankan identity of the building, architects Griffiths and Koththigoda added. The developers invested more than 100 million rupees into improving and upgrading the streetscape around the Colombo City Centre development for the benefit of the general public. Colombo City Centre Mall also features Sri Lankas first large scale food court with outdoor dining areas with stunning waterfront and ocean views and a six screen cinema multiplex.
The projects division of Jones Lang LaSalle Lanka was the post contract project managers of the project and Sanken Construction was the main contractor along with a large group of sub consultants and sub-contractors.
KWA Architects is an award winning architectural and interior design firm based in Colombo. Aedas is a multinational architectural and design firm operating from 14 offices from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. With their extensive presence in China and South East Asia, they are at the cutting edge of the rapid development and growth of emerging markets, and use this experience and understanding, to provide design solutions that will meet the demands of Asia of the future.

Avonet Technologies tied up with the University of Moratuwa, the premier engineering university in the country. This partnership will enable Avonet to access knowledge in the domain of decision sciences and the university will have the opportunity to work in real life commercial projects giving the much needed practical exposure to students.
Avonet, Director and Chief Operating Officer, Thilina Kumarapathirana said that the new partnership will enable their Affiniti brand to add more value to their end users. Business firms often talk about the use of big data and analytics. However, we see a huge gap between what firms can do and what they actually do in this space. We tied up with the best source of knowledge for mutual benefits and as a result Affiniti will have more pro-active features in time to come, he added.
Our commitment to client firms includes continuous improvement of the products in response to technology and market trends. Making your products future proof especially in the technology domain certainly demands new knowledge acquisition better than others. As big data, machine learning, analytics and artificial intelligence change the way organizations operate we ensure our pursuit of excellence in the CRM and loan recovery domains through this collaboration, said Avonet Technologies, Director and Chief Technology Officer, Sachith Fernandopulle. As a passionate team of innovative technocrats the Avonet team is very excited with the new partnership, he added.
Universities being the dominant players in creating and disseminating knowledge, we are much impressed with the opportunity to collaborate with a relatively young and quite promising technology firm. Certainly, this type of linkages is essential to support local firms to be competitive and also to align the universities and industry domains for sustainability and prosperity. Within a short span of time, we have been able to take several such initiatives said Prof. Niranjan D Gunawardane, Dean of the Faculty of Business. Dr Indra Mahakalanda, Head of the Decision Sciences Department of the University of Moratuwa said that it is timely that innovative technology firms work closely with universities to explore and exploit the emerging technologies to offer more value to the society.

Biz leaders share success based on Buddhist values
Business leaders are increasingly discussing on the need for incorporating fundamentals of Buddhist teaching with business strategies as a solution to empower the poor and powerless people in society.
The forum on Buddhist Leadership Practices in Business at the BMICH in Colombo on Tuesday was the venue to take this discussion forward and the panel members, mainly business leaders, emphasized on the need for practicing Buddhist concepts within their work places.
The forum was organized by the National Council for International Affairs of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC).
Managing Director of Lanka Tiles, Mahendra Jayasekara expressing his personal views under the theme, Business Success Based on Buddhist Values at the forum said, there is no religion that encourages the creation of wealth as much as Buddhism does. Many people believe that Buddhism discourages the creation of wealth and it is all about suffering. For me, there is no religion that encourages the creation of wealth as much as Buddhism does. Buddhism is based on creation of wealth. In my view, Buddhism is for the rich and the intelligent, Jayasekara noted.
Poverty itself is the suffering for the poor. You cant understand Dukkha and Dukkha Samudaya Satya unless you are rich. To understand that, you have to be rich, he said.
Quoting some of the suttas in Buddhism, he pointed out that Buddhas teaching has clearly mentioned that poverty leads to poverty; he said adding that Buddha has preached that the poor people cant understand the doctrines of Buddhism if they remain poor.
He further said that Buddha spoke about how to create money, wealth, how to do business, and conditions for successful businesses and noted that fundamentals of Buddhist teaching could also be incorporated into corporate sector to deal with problematic employees at any workplace.
Speaking at a separate session under the theme, Social And Environmental Responsibility For A Sustainable Corporate World, at the forum, General Secretary of Sarvodaya, Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne stressed that local businesses should adopt a transformative approach thereby voluntarily giving up wasteful styles of living, sharing part of their wealth to enable the poor to generate enough income to meet their minimum needs.
While taking steps to remove structural injustices that keep majority powerless and poor, he said businesses should also regard spiritual activities as uneconomical.
More importantly, business should not incite religious hatred among ethnic communities or batter businesses run by non-Buddhists in the name of protecting Buddhism. Religions should be used as a tool not as a weapon, he said.

'Black Widow' MAY BE ANOTHER PERIOD PIECE
Fans of Black Widow rejoiced at the revelation that the character is finally in line to get her own movie, and now we may know more about what it will actually be about. There a new rumour going around, and while it needs to be stressed that this is a rumour only, it would reportedly set at least part of the Black Widow movie at the turn of the millennium and involve the Y2K bug specifically.
The rumour comes via MCU Cosmic from an unnamed source, and so grains of salt must be taken because we cant even begin to verify it. Still, with the upcoming Captain Marvel movie being set in the 1990s as well, the idea that a Black Widow movie could be set at the end of the same decade is certainly plausible. Even if this rumour is true, it doesnt even mean the entire movie will be a 90s period piece, as it could simply mean that part of the movie could flashback to the decade and show a young Black Widow, approximately 16 -years-old based on what we know of the character, perhaps with a storyline that connects to the modern day.
Based on the previously established MCU timeline for Black Widow, this would likely still put the character in her Red Room years where she was still working for the Soviet Union. As such, the plot of the film could deal with how she broke away and eventually ended up working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Theres certainly no argument that this would be a story fans would very likely want to see on the big screen.

Buses using kerosene instead of diesel; Arjuna warns of danger
There could be a big crisis in the future if buses and lorries continually use kerosene instead of diesel, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday.
He said using kerosene in buses was illegal as it was sold in Sri Lanka to low income families, specially fishermen.
Bus engines are not designed to use kerosene and it is not safe and these unscrupulous methods should be stopped by giving a warning to users.
Even engines would have to be replaced if this method is used which is dangerous, as kerosene is more inflammable than diesel with very high emissions.
Eventhough CEYPETCO banned the distribution of Lanka Kerosene Oil (Red) for vehicles, several people obtain kerosene for their containers from sheds at night, he added.

Buying an existing  business reduces your start-up hazzles
Running a business from the scratch is always a juggling act, but you often have more balls in the air during those start-up years than at any other time in the life of the business. Beyond formulating a business plan, you have to develop a marketing plan, find customers, recruit employees, locate space and possibly incorporate. But when you buy someone elses business, much of these start-up tasks have already been done.
First, you will not be starting from scratch; the business already exists. Second, you will not have to create goodwill a favourable reputation in the community. That two important aspects have already been handled by the current owner. Third, it is quicker - everything should already be in place to hit the ground running.
But the main benefit of buying an existing business is that it reduces your risk. Of course, there is no guarantee that you will make money.
When you buy an existing business, you take a business risk, but it can be a calculated business risk. That is one thing that makes being in business so fun and exciting. Great entrepreneurs are not gamblers - rather, they seek to reduce risk as much as possible. The existing business has a track record and you can look at the books, see how much money it made during the past few years, and have a pretty good idea of how much it will make next year. You simply do not have that sort of information (or comfort) when you create a business from scratch.
Steps
Now let us review the steps you need to take
Ideally, you will look for a business in an industry in which you have some expertise or one in which your skills are transferable. It is most important to find a business that combines your interests with the ability to make a good living. That is a key consideration.
How would you find businesses for sale
There are four main sources for finding businesses that are being sold. (a) Online. You can check in your favourite search engine, and get a list.(b)The classifieds. The Sunday classified ad section of local papers will have a section called business opportunities. (c) Magazines. At the back of most trade magazines, there is usually a section for business owners selling their businesses. (d) Business brokers. Although they are not cheap, business brokers can be an excellent resource when searching for a business to buy. A good broker will have access to businesses that you did not know were for sale.
How do you find a business broker
Check business directories, online or printed. Ask your senior business friends, lawyer, peers, and industry associations for names of good business brokers. Get referrals from a trusted source.
If you are considering hiring a business broker, be sure to find out his background, proven experience and credentials. Whether he is qualified and certified. Check about his services. Check whether he handles business valuation or just negotiate the deal.
You need to find a dedicated practitioner who spends all their time selling businesses because he can bring in a network of contacts and also understands the principles of business valuation.
A business broker might charge you from 10 percent to 15 percent commission of the sale price of your company. Avoid any broker asking you for a large upfront fee to assess your business value or start an application process. Moat important of all, avoid the pressure: Never allow your business broker to put you in a pressure situation. Do not make a rush decision.
Selling your business is a complex matter. Work with your team of professional advisers for the best results.
Final test
Eventually, when you find a prospective seller,
do the following:
Get some trade references from the owner and call them. Speak with neighbouring businesses. Use your search engine and your contacts to find out all you can about the business and owner.
Who are the competitors How does the current owner deal with them What competitive advantages would you have if you bought the place Whether there are non-transferable intangibles. Find out how he succeeded (or failed). For example, some businesses succeed because of the owner has fantastic contacts, special skills, an in somewhere, that sort of thing.
Check whether there are any pending bank or legal issues. Is the neighbourhood stable Does the government or your potential competitors have any plans for the area Are the facilities in good condition Is the dcor outdated How is the plumbing and electricity
You certainly do not want to buy the place and then be stuck with major expenses. For this reason (as with a home purchase), any offer you make should be contingent on a successful inspection of the premises.
The reason you are looking at an established business is that you want to be able to project your profit and return with some accuracy. The only way to do that is to dig into the books with your accountant. Ideally, you want to see an audited set of books going back at least three years.
Business Valuation
What is Business Valuation
When it comes to valuing a business, you should consider three basic questions:
1. What does the business own Clearly, a business that has invested a lot of money in assets over the years is more valuable than a business that has not. Assets can take many forms: vehicles, equipment, contracts, intellectual property rights, goodwill, and plenty more. Of course, sellers tend to overvalue goodwill, and buyers tend to undervalue it. It is important, then, to realistically analyse the value of the business in the community.
2. What is the current capacity of business earnings (not current earnings)
3. Are there any intangibles to consider Does it have a great location, a favourable lease, fantastic employees These are the last things to consider.
Price  the biggest issue
There are few factors to be considered and used to determine the value of a business. There are three ways to go about calculating business value.
The first is called price building. The second method is called return on investment. The third is the multiplier.
Price building
This is a valuation method that simply looks at the hard facts - assets, goodwill, leases, real estate, and so on. Essentially, what you do here is list every asset and give it a Rupee value. For example, it might look like this: Seller: Machinery Rentals Company: Real estate: Rs. 12.5 million, Equipment: Rs. 4.0 million, Inventory: Rs. 2.5 million, Goodwill: Rs. 1.0 million. Total: Rs. 20.0 million. A price of Rs. 20.0 million may or may not be right for this business. Although it is hard to say, the price builder method indicates that it is.
Return on investment (ROI)
This looks at the business profit per year to helpthe buyer see the percentage return on his investment. For example, say that sellers Machinery Rentals Company is asking Rs. 20.0 M for the business. Is that fair
Using the ROI method, we would see: Net profit: Rs. 8.0 million and Business sale price is Rs. 20.0 million Using this method and these numbers the buyer would be getting a 40 percent return on his investment in a year. There are few investments out there that would allow a 40 percent ROI. Thus, a higher price for the business is probably in order. Of course, you can negotiate.
The last method is the multiplier. Using this method, you would again look at the earnings, but you would then multiply those earnings by some factor - it varies depending on the industry - to get a final price. A factor of 2 would result in a Rs. 16.0 million as asking price.
These are just simple examples. However, the battle is what that factor should be. All of these are complicated, and that is why hiring a business broker makes a lot of sense. Although you will pay a decent commission, it may be worth it to ensure that you get a good business at a fair price.
Getting ready to close
Aside from pouring over the books, your due diligence will take you on one or more tours of the actual premises. Peek into the nooks and crannies. By this time, you should be aware of both the positives and the negatives of the business, and you should get your questions about the problems answered.
Remember that no business is perfect - your job is to decide whether the benefits outweigh the burdens and whether the obstacles can be overcome. Once you have found a business that you really like, your vetting process must include a final analysis with your lawyer and accountant, even if you have hired a broker. Leases and financial statements are best left to the experts.
Once your team has concluded that the business is viable, it is time to negotiate a final price and get set for closing. As you negotiate the final deal, consider adding these provisions to the contract: Link the sales price to customer retention. Much of what you are buying is the existing customer base. But the clients, especially in a service business, may be more committed to the seller than to the business. Therefore, see whether you can link the purchase price to the number of customers who stay. Have the present owner stay for a while.
This can help with the transition, as well as customer retention. You will pay him or her a consulting fee, but it is usually worth it.

CHALLENGES FOR CREATING HUMAN-CENTRIC URBAN SPACES
Excerpts of a keynote address made by Ar/Plnr Dr. Surath Wickramasinghe at the Sixth International Urban Design Conference held recently
Cities are the manifestation of the cultural, economic and social acceleration that we have experienced throughout our contemporary history. In 1950, about two thirds of the population worldwide lived in rural settlements and a third in urban settlements. Today, 55% of the worlds population live in urban areas; a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. In Sri Lanka, currently 40 % live in Urban areas and will increase up to 60 % by 2030. See graphic I
However, the District Population in the Western Province is increasing with Urban sprawl specially Gampaha, Kalutura and Colombo compared to the other eight Provinces.
Consequently, issues pertaining to traffic congestion, parking, demand for housing, health, public open space, infrastructure services will become intolerable in the absence of planned development.
How can Cities adequately respond to these Emergent Challenges
Climate Change:
As the world warms, extreme weather patterns are becoming more frequent and intense. Sea levels are rising whilst prolonged droughts are putting pressure on food crops. Sri Lanka being a small island in the Indian Ocean in the path of two monsoons is mostly affected by weather related hazards. Floods twice a year, mostly due to monsoonal rain or effects of low pressure systems and droughts due to failure of monsoonal rain are the most common hazards experienced in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is also prone to hazards such as landslides, lightning strikes, coastal erosion, epidemics and effects of environmental pollution. See graphic II
Furthermore, high density populations and inappropriate Land uses such as Industries in Residential or Commercial areas will also have an impact on Climate Change. Many countries have already taken action or are taking action to overcome this phenomenon with long term solutions. The good news is that people, communities, cities, businesses, schools, faith groups and other organisations including those in Sri Lanka are taking action to come up with tangible solutions. One such solutions that most countries are using to overcome Climate Change is Renewable Energy so called Green Energy solutions such as Solar and, Wind Power are used to generate electricity for the use of public transport, motor vehicles and for other uses radically reducing polluting emissions by the consumption of fossil fuels.
With this changeover, there are environmental and economic benefits, not only in the Cities, but, also in rural areas. Therefore, an underlying solution to this problem will be to integrate Urban Design in its Development Plan.
Ideas for solving the Urban Issues in Colombo
The Governments Policy to relocate 67,000 families almost 50 percent of the population of Colombo City, living in high density underserved settlements in High Rise Apartments is favoured. These families are occupying Prime Land within close proximity to the City Centre. At present, relocation is done on an ad hoc basis, where small parcels of land are available. These are stand-alone projects and lack facilities for social interaction. Therefore, if 7-8 land parcels around 25 acres in extent are found in and around the City of Colombo, it is possible to relocate these families in comprehensively planned neighbourhoods with modern infrastructure facilities, access to nursery / primary education, recreation, leisure, entertainment, health care, social and cultural activities.
These neighbourhoods should be linked to an efficient transport network / LRT that will speedily provide the residents with communication facilities to reach their places of work and other important locations. This way it is possible to transform the communities living in these Apartments with a better quality of life and to be citizens with equal opportunities to compete with others. The implementation of these neighbourhoods could be on a Public Private Partnership Model.
Therefore, an underlying solution to this problem will be to integrate these neighbourhoods in the Urban Design being developed by the Megapolis Ministry / UDA for the Western Province.
The liberated land within the City of Colombo which is estimated to be around a 1000 acres, after the relocation of 67,000 families could be utilized for much needed mixed development, recreation / public open space, car parking and other needs for the projected population of nearly 01 million. With comprehensive Nodal Development, the objective should be to prevent sprawl and development along the major roads.
The objection to the neighbourhood concept will be to say that there is no land available in and around the City to comply with this proposal. The challenge is to find the land using alternative strategies, such as utilizing underused Government and Private Properties, Lands swapping with the Private Sector, Building above Low Lying areas, etc. Another reason that this concept may not be popular, will be due to the politically strong vote banks within the City being moved out from the current locations. If so, very little could be done to transform the City and provide a better way of life for the People, Community and the City.
Outcome of Singapores Concept Plan of 1971
Contrastingly, Singapores success story was that late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, got the best experts in the world irrespective of nationality to design a Concept Plan in 1971 almost 50 years ago, to guide the physical development of Singapore to ensure the optimal use of its limited land resources. At present, Singapores population is 5.7 Million whilst their national Land area has increased from 581 km to 723 km by careful seaward Land Reclamation Projects. Singapores population will increase up to 6.9 Million by 2030.
The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URAs) implementation of the Concept Plan, was in collaboration with all the Infrastructure Agencies for Transport Networks, Water Supply, Power, Telecom and other Land uses including Landscaping were integrated to support this single Concept Plan and time targets were set to complete each stage of the development.
The same concept plan, was further developed and periodically reviewed and updated, to meet the current needs, for example: the six floors high Public Housing originally designed Apartments are today 30 plus floors high with much better quality accommodation and facilities within the same area. The original framework of the Concept Plan has remained with the modifications incorporated.
However, in the reclaimed land area Mega Housing neighbourhoods were located on the periphery and within the Central area of the City, a new Zone was created for the Marina Bay Hotel Complex, Indoor Botanic Gardens, and aIndoor Sky Park, an Arts and Science Museum, Convention Hall, Exhibition and Entertainment facilities, a Casino and Shopping and Dining outlets being some of the projects in the reclaimed Zone.
Colombos problems due to ad hoc development without a Concept Plan / Master Plan
Several Master Plans have been prepared for the City of Colombo by successive Governments. Unfortunately, none of them have been fully implemented, hence, it has developed in an ad hoc manner by building wherever land was available, including Low Lying areas, resulting in inadequate Infrastructure beset by problems of flooding, drainage, slums and shanties, accumulation of solid waste and lack of public open space compounding to problems in the City.
Therefore, City of Colombo was compelled to provide piece-meal solutions at the discretion of the respective Governments/Ministers resulting in Infrastructure not being integrated and updated to meet the increase in population, and also the absence of an effective Urban Design, have caused the prevailing chaos in Colombo and other Cities.
Consequently, the success that Singapore had using the Concept Plan from 1971 was not the case in Colombo City and as a result, the onetime Garden City is today a Visionless City.
During the 1977 Government, there was a change in Urban Policy and the City of Colombo remained as the Commercial Capital, and the Administrative Capital including the Parliament was moved to Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte.
This was an excellent decision to ease the congestion in the City of Colombo. However, the complete transfer of the Ministries are yet to be moved to the new Capital and the social amenities, including schools not being provided, public transport not being modernized, communications between the two Cities are currently at a peak. Once again, the complete Master Plan for the Capital City was not fully implemented. Consequently, successive Governments, kept changing the concept.
Again during the period 2010 and 2015 after the internal conflict was over, despite not following a Concept Plan several Projects / Spaces such as; the Arcade with the Recreation areas at Independence Square, Race Course Development, the Dutch Hospital Rehabilitation with Restaurants, Shops and other Tourist related activities, Viharamahadevi Park, Sri Jayawardenapura, Waters Edge, the Waterfront Recreation areas around the Parliament, and several other locations within the City and elsewhere were fully implemented. This success was achieved by coordinating / integrating all Planning, Infrastructure Services, Road Design and Environmental upgrading, under a single Secretariat.
Implementation Policy
The prospect of the Megapolis Plan covering the Three Districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutura, being designed at present by Foreign and Local Experts, incorporates Five specialized designated Cities, the City of Colombo, Port City, Aero City, Techno City, and the Industrial City. The Megapolis Plan will be integrated incorporating Water Supply and Drainage, Power, Transport Networks, Landscaping and Land uses, for the future development. This is the way forward. However, there should be a Policy shift by the Government to ensure that the Megapolis Plan is speedily implemented, now that the required funding is available. The relevant Concessionary Agreements for all the projects should also be ready prior to implementation. If not, bottle necks are bound to happen and would cause delays during the implementation process, similar to the delays we have seen with the Port City Project implementation.
With the Agreements and Funding in place, the Government Policy should be to outsource projects to the Sri Lankan private sector firms as against to foreign firms, who are unlikely to work in collaboration with the local counterpart or even pay the local taxes and other levies to the Government. At present, Sri Lanka are producing Architects, Interior Designers, Structural, Civil and MEP Engineers, Planners, Urban Designers, Cost Consultants (Quantity Surveyors) and all other allied professionals. If the Sri Lankan firms need to obtain foreign expertise where necessary that is perfectly in order. However, the practice to offer even regional projects in Sri Lanka to foreign firms is a deterrent to the local professionals who are more familiar and knowledgeable regarding Sri Lankas environment, culture and history. The funding of these regional projects, are on loans obtained by the Government through International Funding Agencies such as World Bank, ADB and other Funding Agencies by the Megapolis Ministry and this practise to offer the work to Foreign Consultants should be discouraged. If not, the Local Professionals who are keen to work in Sri Lanka, after obtaining their free education in Sri Lanka, due to lack of opportunities, may or will migrate to countries requiring their expertise. Trust the Megapolis Ministry, BOI, and the other Government Ministries / Agencies will follow the Sri Lankan first Policy as the way forward.

Cheaper petrol variety soon
A new cheaper variety of petrol will be introduced shortly to cushion the effect of high petrol prices, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday.
This can be given around Rs.8 less than the normal petrol price available in the country.
The Minister said the required tests to introduce this new petrol is now being conducted successfully. The results have already shown that this type of petrol is suitable for three-wheelers and further tests are being conducted to check whether it is suitable for the motorcycles. This cheaper version is expected to be distributed through 100 filling stations across the country which have already been identified.

Citizens' Mail
Give back their land, not electric fences
So much has been written and so much is written today in a quest for a permanent solution to the burning issue of human/elephant conflict which started a little over ten years ago. One by one the encroachers started settling down until it blew out of proportion. I was also in the fray of writing on behalf of the confused elephant who suddenly found himself surrounded by encroachers. The then government should have seen the outcome of this and nipped it in the bud by stopping the inflow. There are thousands of families who have taken over elephant paths. It is a gigantic operation to evacuate each and every family and the longer the wait, more difficult the operation.
There is so much of untapped land that can come under small-time cultivation and if these encroachers are settled on small blocks, the elephants will have their land back and a new lease of environment will find its way.
Train accidents need to be addressed more seriously without holding post-mortems. Building bridges over strategic points where the elephants pass in one effective way and still better is the construction of a fly-over though it is a colossal project. The cost of which can be funded by a country like India with Meneka Gandhi negotiating who will do it gladly because of her involvement in this area. It is a matter of the President taking the initiative to do so. Deaths of elephants by train constitute five per cent which is alarming and deplorable. Most of the solutions evolved so far have been failures. How long are we going to watch this drama Think over Wildlife Minister, you have to decide.
I know for a fact bridges as well as fly-overs are built in many countries especially in Africa to intercept the dwindling elephant population. Funds to do so will not be a problem for Wildlife Minister nor the authorities as they collect a colossal amount of income. The Minister only needs the will to do so. The exercise is available in our country, so is the workforce. Dont we already have bridges over rivers in our country
Alternately, a highway spanning these elephant passages is another option.
Give back their land: not electric fences.
That belonged to them not so long ago and take a cue from our neighbour, India and the rest of the world without responding to political and social pressure which is the bane of the issue. If the DWC stand up to them and do what is right by elephants and be firm in their administration like elsewhere in the world with pressure, they will buckle down on the face of the failure of construction of electric fences along with the administrative boundaries that never yielded the expected results. The battle goes on with elephants pushed back in their habitats and illegal encroachers increasing with political backing. These politicians never realize the colossal harm created around forest reserves, some of which are the better habitats of elephants that resort to breaking of fences who meet with death. The irony of this is that sympathy is not with the innocent animal but with the outrageous culprits who is the encroacher. If encroachers who claim to be farmers meet with such deaths, they deserve it with no reservation.
While our elephant habitats are declining fast and furiously, elsewhere in the world, national parks and natural habitats are racing beyond tremendous capacity making way beyond the required to contain any number of their precious jumbos and in the meantime our elephants die at the hands of irreverent and irresponsible politicians who tie the hands of DWC officers.
Why is it that two thirds of elephants in our land who have home ranges go beyond areas controlled by the Department of Wildlife Conservation Is it because of what is taking place in the Sinharaja forest is also happening over here
What a sad state of affairs and the poor elephant is driven from pillar to post though born free.

ComBank expands scope of Green Loans
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced an expansion of the scope of its Green Loans to encompass technology and products that contribute to environment conservation and to include leasing of electric and hybrid vehicles.
Previously limited to households seeking funds for switching to solar power to reduce consumption of electricity from the national grid, Commercial Banks re-launched Green Loans and Green Leases now facilitate the purchase of energy-efficient household equipment, the installation of energy-efficient lighting for households, the purchase of hybrid or electric vehicles, solar panels and other machinery or equipment used for renewable energy, energy efficiency, emission reductions, water and wastewater management and waste management.
Offered at relatively low interest rates, these loans and leases are available to both permanent employees and self-employed professionals between the ages of 18 and 65, who have a minimum disposable income of Rs 50,000 a month, the Bank said.
Green Leases can be applied for 50% - 90% of the market value of the vehicles, solar panels or machinery/equipment financed, while Green Loans can be applied for up to 75% of the market value of energy-efficient household equipment, and installation of energy efficient lighting for households. These loans are subject to a maximum value of Rs 3 million and a minimum of Rs 50,000. Commenting on this loan category, Commercial Banks Deputy General Manager Personal Banking Sandra Walgama said, Sri Lankans are becoming more environment conscious, a commendable trait that we think needs to be supported. The launch of these new products that provide financial support to very specific environmentally-conducive choices of our customers is yet another move on the part of the Bank to encourage efforts to foster a cleaner environment.
The Banks Green Leases and Green Loans can be repaid within a period of seven years. Green Loan applicants have the option of repaying in equal monthly installments or on a reducing installment model. Green Lease customers too may choose to repay in equal monthly instalments or in structured rentals.
The general documentation process pertaining to security of the Bank will apply to these products. The current fixed interest rates per annum are 12.5% for up to three years, 13% for four years, 13.5% for five years, 14% for six years, and 14.5% for seven years, the Bank said.
The only Sri Lankan Bank to be ranked among the worlds top 1000 banks for eight years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 263 branches and 782 ATMs in Sri Lanka. The Bank has won more than 30 international and local awards in 2016 and 2017 and 20 international awards in the first eight months of 2018.

could make  Oscar history
There have only been seven occasions in Oscar history where the Best Actor and Best Actress awards have gone to a duo from the same movie. Its quite a rare Academy Award phenomenon, despite the fact that there are often Best Actor/Best Actress nominees from the same picture.
Two years ago, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both nominated for La La Land; Stone won, Gosling lost to Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea). Four years ago, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were nominated for The Theory of Everything with the former winning and the latter losing to Julianne Moore for Still Alice.
The last pair of Best Actor/Best Actress nominees from the same film to both win was all the way back in 1997. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won for As Good as it Gets. Prior to that ceremony, there had been six other Best Actor/Best Actress winners from the same film.
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga could well be the eighth pair of co-stars to both take home Oscars. Currently, they sit atop our odds charts in their respective categories for their work in A Star is Born. Its a love story that has been told before, four times in fact, but their natural performances make this the best version to date.
Lady Gaga has some serious competition in perennial Oscar bridesmaid Glenn Close, who stars in The Wife and is vying for her 7th nomination as well as Olivia Colman in The Favourite. Cooper has just as tough a group of competitors.
While Coopers character, Jackson Maine, is fictional, his performance is no less transformative. He learned how to sing and play the guitar. Behind the scenes, he co-wrote the screenplay and makes his directorial debut.

CPC, LIOC to jointly develop Trinco oil tanks
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka IOC (LIOC) will enter into a joint venture to develop and manage 85 oil storage tanks in Trincomalee apart from the 15 oil tanks that are already used by the LIOC.
Addressing a media briefing held at Ministry premises yesterday, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the project would be carried out according to an action plan of the government and within a stipulated timeframe.
Their conditions imposed for this joint venture were approved by the Cabinet recently. Accordingly, the land where the Oil Tank Farm is located in Trincomalee will belong to the government as per the agreement. LIOC will be allowed to continue using the 15 tanks subject to a timeframe to be agreed upon.
A set of 16 storage tanks out of 85 tanks will be assigned to this proposed subsidiary for development, and later, these storage tanks will be released to CPC for exclusive use, he added. We have planned to use these 16 oil tanks for fuel bunkering operations which will help to earn foreign exchange to the country.
Theses tanks will also be used to distribute fuel to the North and East halting the current transport of fuel from Colombo to these two provinces.The CPC now spends highly to transport fuel from Colombo to these provinces.
In 2003, the China Bay Oil Tank farm was handed over to the IOC on a 35-year lease agreement. However, there was a discrepancy in the financial clause which has led to a court case later.
However, in addition to the 15 oil tanks given to the IOC, the reaming 85 oil tanks are decaying for many years due to the lack of usage.This problem was not even rectified during the previous regime. A union leader who was interdicted for nine proven charges is heading CPC workers for the protest against this. He was with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but never acted to develop these decaying tanks.But when we try to develop them with the aim of earning foreign exchange, they shout unnecessarily, he added.
But, I must clearly said that if anyone tries to stage the protest causing inconvenience to the people, stern action will be taken against them. He further said that certain persons who engaged in transporting fuel from Colombo to North and East may not be happy with this as they will suffer loss of income.
A new agreement will be signed for this joint venture for the timeframe to be decided by the Cabinet and the private sector can also make their own investments to develop these oil tanks, he further added.

Daraz celebrates two years  in Sri Lanka
With a mere 1% of the retail market, online retail is a high potential industry in countries of the South Asian region. Introducing the technology and knowledge to countries such as Sri Lanka has always been a challenge, as a result of varying barriers such as infrastructure, logistics and finance.
Completing two years since its inception in Sri Lanka, Daraz Sri Lanka, Head of Marketing and Traffic Ops Naresh Krishnan speaking at the Seller Summit spoke about how the online retail platform has been revolutionized and the many enabling systems that have been introduced, for sellers and buyers alike.
According to Naresh, the online retail industry has undergone remarkable change over the past two years, with fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), giants beginning to use the platform in large scale.
The trend is a global shift as one sees all major brands investing more on online retail, as they see where the future lies. Sri Lanka too is fast absorbing the tendency where one sees many FMCG, mobile, automobile, health and beauty, and electronic brands increasing their online presence. The wide range of brands accessible on Daraz.lk is evidence enough for this growing trend. With our success in sales such as Black Friday, we saw a leap in the number of merchants, from well-known brands wanting to join us.
They have realized that online retail allows them to engage with their customers better. This has been a boost for the platform, and as a result we have been constantly trying to empower them more by introducing new systems, stated Naresh.
Daraz introduced an upscale seller system which enables the sellers to build their own brand. Daraz has developed a Smart Selling system, which breaks away from the traditional listing of a product on the platform under several categories.
The Seller App which will be launched in the near future will enable sellers to monitor their sales in real-time and on the go, providing more selling opportunities.
Apart from focusing on the direct selling facilities, Daraz has also concentrated on enhancing the support service for a seamless process. The company has developed their own logistics arm with its own fleet to ensure timely distribution.
In addition to a warehouse in Kelaniya, Daraz also owns a sorting centre in Armour Street. 11 Daraz hubs in key towns in the island ensure the widespread reach, as the hubs have their own teams including a customer service agent, store manager and logistics wing. We at Daraz are very ambitious. We are preparing ourselves for the future market while serving at the present. Therefore our goal is not to only increase traffic to the platform and sell, but also ensure that a reliable system is put to place, commented Naresh.
The Daraz Seller University is an initiative no other platform has created for local merchants.
This includes the Seller Self Sign-up system which enables merchants to sign up digitally without the hassle of manual documentation or personally meeting agents from Daraz.

Rain continues to stalk tourists
England win 21-over shoot out to take 2-0 series lead
PALLEKELE, Wednesday  Skipper Eoin Morgan scored his 41st half-century and his seventh against Sri Lanka to guide England to an easy seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a rain-truncated third ODI reduced to 21-overs a side at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
Morgan finished on 58 not out scored off 49 balls (7 fours) and with Ben Stokes who scored 35 not out off 24 balls (2 sixes, 1 four) put together an unbroken partnership of 73 off 57 balls to chase down a target of 151 with 15 balls to spare.
With four required for victory Stokes put an end to Sri Lankas agony by coming down the track to Amila Aponso and hoisting him for a straight six.
Despite losing wickets at regular intervals England continued to maintain a run rate in excess of eight an over which enabled their later batsmen to push for victory quite comfortably without taking any undue risks.
For that they had to thank dashing opener Jason Roy whos 41 off 26 balls (3 fours, 2 sixes) set the tone for the rest of their run chase.
With the win England assured themselves they cant lose the series. They can either draw it or win it.
Sri Lanka squandered a blazing opening stand of 57 off 32 balls by Niroshan Dickwella (36) and Sadeera Samarawickrama (35) to be restricted to a total of 150-9 off 21 overs after being invited to bat first.
Sri Lanka looked in good nick for a score close to 200 which would have given their bowlers some breathing space to set attacking fields, but England came back strongly after Tom Curran had broken the opening stand by dismissing Dickwella for 36 scored off 20 balls (8 fours).
From there onwards England took control of the game as Sri Lanka lost wickets at regular intervals with Curran and leg-spinner Adil Rashid causing most of the damage by capturing seven wickets between them.
Dinesh Chandimal tried his best to build up partnerships by holding up one end with a steady innings of 34 off 42 balls but the only support he got was from Samarawickrama who helped him add 35 for the third wicket and one of 28 for sixth with Dasun Shanaka who hit a rapid 21 off 10 balls with two sixes and a four.
Sri Lankas weakness against leg-spin was exposed with Rashid picking up four of the wickets to take the Man of the Match award.
Kusal Mendis returning to the Lankan ODI side as replacement for the injured Kusal Perera collected his third consecutive duck when he was dismissed first ball by Rashid. He was earlier out without scoring in the Asia Cup matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
CHANDIMAL SUFFERING FROM CONCUSSION
Skipper Dinesh Chandimal left the field during the England innings and was not present for the award ceremony.
Chandimal is not feeling well. He is a bit concussed and he is undergoing treatment, said Sri Lanka manager Charith Senanayake.

Fight the fat!
You have probably obsessed about having it and have been searching for a way to get rid of it. The good news is that you can do something about it. As common as cellulite is, theres also an awful lot of misinformation out there about what it is and how to get rid of it. So before placing blame, scheduling a cosmetic procedure, or spending a fortune on over-the-counter products read on to say goodbye to cottage-cheese thighs for good with these proven tricks.
Defining cellulite
Cellulite is a term for the formation of lumps and dimples in the skin. Common names for cellulite are orange-peel skin, cottage-cheese skin, hail damage, and the mattress phenomenon.
Cellulite can affect both men and women, but it is more common in females, due to the different distributions of fat, muscle, and connective tissue. Between 80 and 90 percent of women may experience cellulite at some point in their lives
Reasons that women get cellulite
The exact cause of cellulite is unknown, but it appears to result from an interaction between the connective tissue in the dermatological layer that lies below the surface of the skin, and the layer of fat that is just below it.The fat cells and connective tissue in this layer are arranged vertically in women.
If the fat cells protrude into the layer of skin, this gives the appearance of cellulite. In men, the tissue has a crisscross structure, which may explain why they are less likely to have cellulite than women.
Cellulite in men and women
Estrogen plays a role, plus women typically have more body fat than men. But the main reason is that the bands connecting skin and muscle are different on men than they are on women. Men have thicker bands, there are more of them, and they form a crisscross pattern (as opposed to the vertical pattern on womens bodies). That keeps the fat in place so that it doesnt pucker.
Skinny women and cellulite
Cellulite is often genetic. It also happens to women of all shapes and sizes.
Some women are more prone to getting cellulite than others because cellulite has its roots in skin structure and genetics. That is not to say that there is no way around cottage cheese thighs. Even if some of us may not be able to completely eliminate all traces of cellulite from our bodies, there are ways to reduce its appearance drastically.
Cellulite and aging
Hormones also seem to play a role in the appearance of cellulite. As women age, their bodies produce less estrogen-a hormone that helps keep blood vessels flowing smoothly. Less estrogen can mean poorer circulation, which can also mean a decrease in new collagen production and the breakdown of older connective tissue. Age also causes the skin to become less elastic, thinner, and more likely to sag. This increases the chance of cellulite developing.
Cellulite and genetics
Certain genes are required for cellulite development. Genetic factors can be linked to a persons speed of metabolism, distribution of fat under the skin, ethnicity, and circulatory levels. These can affect the chance of cellulite developing.
Treatments for cellulite
Acoustic wave therapy uses a hand-held device to transmit sound waves. It may work, but it can take several sessions.
Laser treatment may improve the appearance of cellulite for a year or more. It involves inserting a very small laser probe under the skin. The laser is then fired, breaking up the tissue. This can also thicken the skin by increasing collagen production. The thickened skin may reduce the appearance of the cellulite below.
Subcision involves a dermatologist putting a needle under the skin to break up the connective tissue bands. Results can last two years or more.
Vacuum-assisted precise tissue release cuts the bands using a device containing small blades. As it cuts the connective bands, the tissue underneath moves up to fill the space under the skin, removing the appearance of cellulite. This may last for three years, but data on its success is limited.
Carboxytherapy involves inserting carbon dioxide gas under the skin. Side effects include bruising and discomfort after the procedure, but some cellulite might disappear.
Endermologie involves a deep massage with a vacuum-like device that lifts the skin. The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved it as safe, but there is little evidence that it works, say the AAD. Ionithermie cellulite reduction treatment involves covering the affected area with a special mud or clay, then wrapping it in plastic before applying an electric current. It is not proven to be effective.
Radiotherapy aims to reduce cellulite by heating it, but any results are short-term. Laser-assisted liposuction removes small amounts of fat, but this may make dimpling worse. Research has not yet shown that it works to reduce cellulite.
Ultrasonic liposculpting targets and destroys fat, but again, research is lacking to show that it works.

Tips to reduce cellulite 
Load up on anti-oxidants 
Include plenty of antioxidant-rich foods in your diet, such as acai and other berries, red and orange fruits and veggies, and citrus fruits.
Antioxidants are your number one defence against free radicals, which cause damage to skin cells and can contribute to cellulite formation.

Go green 
Drinking green tea can help reduce the signs of cellulite. Green tea has been found to be effective for increasing energy expenditure and assisting with weight loss. It is also a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent free radical damage. Drink about three cups of green tea a day.

Healthy fats 
Replace saturated fats with healthy omega-3 fats such as oily fish, flaxseed and fish oils, and nuts. These help with blood circulation. Poor circulation reduces the bodys ability to deliver nutrients to skin cells, causing them to clump together, which can compound cellulite problems.

Exercise 
Regular exercise is vital. It burns calories to reduce fat, boosts circulation and can help disguise cellulite by increasing muscle tone under the skin. Exercise also improves lymphatic drainage, which carries toxins away from cells. If drainage is sluggish it will contribute to cellulite.

Cut out toxins 
A build-up of toxins in the body can affect the dermis and contribute to cellulite formation. Remove or limit toxins such as tobacco, alcohol, coffee and heavily processed foods containing high levels of sugar and chemical additives. Make sure you drink plenty of water.

Use herbs 
Try herbs. Dandelion leaf tea helps reduce fluid retention, as well as helping to flush toxins from the body. You can also use dandelion leaves in salads or fresh juices. herbal preparation from the dried leaves of the ginkgo tree, helps boost circulation.

Skin care 
External treatments such as coffee scrubs can improve circulation and reduce signs of cellulite. Use a coffee scrub twice a week. Moisten your skin under the shower, turn the water off, rub coffee granules into the affected areas for a few minutes, then rinse off.

Five things you can do to save the earth
Going green is easier than you think. There are little things you can do every day to help reduce greenhouse gases and make a less harmful impact on the environment. Taking care of the Earth is not just a responsibility -- it's a privilege.
1. Pay attention to how you use water. The little things can make a big difference. Every time you turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth, you're doing something good. Got a leaky toilet You might be wasting 200 gallons (757 liters) of water a day. Try drinking tap water instead of bottled water, so you aren't wasting all that packaging as well. Wash your clothes in cold water when you can.
2. Leave your car at home. If you can stay off the road just two days a week, you'll reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 1,590 pounds (721 kilograms) per year [source: EPA]. Combine your errands -- hit the post office, grocery store and shoe repair place in one trip. It will save you gas and time.
3. Walk or ride your bike to work, school and anywhere you can. You can reduce greenhouse gases while burning some calories and improving your health. If you can't walk or bike, use mass transit or carpool. Every car not on the road makes a difference.
4. Recycle. You can help reduce pollution just by putting that soda can in a different bin. If you're trying to choose between two products, pick the one with the least packaging. If an office building of 7,000 workers recycled all of its office paper waste for a year, it would be the equivalent of taking almost 400 cars off the road.
5. Compost. Think about how much trash you make in a year. Reducing the amount of solid waste you produce in a year means taking up less space in landfills, so your tax dollars can work somewhere else. Plus, compost makes a great natural fertilizer. Composting is easier than you think.

Food policy needed - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said it is important to implement a state policy regarding the production, security, quality and standards of food.
The President was speaking at the World Food Day ceremony at the BMICH on Tuesday.
World Food Day is celebrated on October 16 to commemorate the establishment of the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) by the United Nations. It is celebrated under the theme Our Actions  Our Future 2030.
President Sirisena said with the long history of food production as an agriculture-based country, we are a nation self-sufficient in food. Yet, one-third of crops are destroyed by animals. Due to the drought resulting from severe climatic conditions and floods, crops are often destroyed.
To ensure food security, a regular programme should be implemented, said the President.
President Sirisena also said he was grateful for the contribution made by the United Nations FAO in Sri Lanka. The students who were winners of the competitions held for World Food Day were also presented awards by the President. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Deputy Minister Faizer Kasim, FAO Director Brenda Brandon, FAO representative in Sri Lanka, Nina Brandstrup, and other local and foreign officials were present at the event.

Golden voice!
The golden voice of Bollywood, Sonu Nigam visited SL to sing SLs oldest running Radio jingle which was produced for Vogue Jewellers. The legendary icon of advertisements, first aired in 1962 has set a record by being aired for nearly sixty years since the first year of operations of Vogue. Adding another dimension to this iconic jingle, Sonu Nigam, one of the most internationally acclaimed Bollywood singers, has sung Mangala mudu, mala, valalu During his recent visit to Vogue Jewellers flagship showroom in Colpetty, the local media representatives and popular social media personnel had the opportunity of meeting him.
Scripted by none other than Sri Lankas most sought after, legendary lyricist of all times  the late Karunaratne Abeysekera, the lyrics of this timeless classic stand appropriate to-date. Maestro, the late T F Latiff, has done the music direction. The distinctive tune of this iconic jingle in its own old charm has remained unchanged although veteran artistes had sung several versions over the decades. The vocalist of the original version was veteran singer, Rupa Indumathi, while the re-make created in late 1980s was sung by the Queen of Sinhala music  Kalashuri Latha Valpola. Visharada Neela Wickramasinghe sang the latest version in early 2000s. However, with a view of reaching out to the young bridal market, recently Kavindya Adhikari and Nademal Perera sang an entirely different version to a different tune.
The late Chairman of Vogue Jewellers, Sarath Hemachandra pioneered several strategic moves. Back in the sixties, when the commercial hub was confined to Pettah and the Fort, he made a strategic move by setting up the Vogue head office in Colpetty in order to be in close proximity of the elite society who lived in Colombo 3, 4 and 7. Accordingly, Vogue was the first commercial entity that was set up in Colpetty. Vogue was constantly seen in the national newspapers, advertising its trendsetting designs, featuring top models, celebrities and fashion icons of both local and overseas arenas. This Radio jingle was created during the days of Radio Ceylon  Asias first and the worlds second Radio station. Renowned Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam singing this jingle makes it the first Sri Lankan jingle to be sung by an international artiste, states Vogue Jewellers.
Vogue showroom in Colpettty is the largest in the industry, displaying the widest collection of jewellery in Sri Lanka. The highest number of choices in bridal jewellery and the recognition of being the most trusted destination for 22 karat bridal jewellery make Vogue unmatched. Vogue prides itself of being Sri Lankas most awarded jeweller.

Government refutes reports of RAW hand in plots
The government refuted claims that President Maithripala Sirisena had made reference to the involvement of Indian Intelligence Service (RAW) in the alleged plot to assassinate him and other members of the government.
The assurance comes in the wake of unsubstantiated claims which have surfaced in international media outlets, citing that the President had made reference to the Research and Analysis Wing or RAW as it is otherwise known has a hand in the alleged assassination attempt. It was also alluded in the media that the Indian National who remains under CID custody was part of the ploy.
The government has refuted claims adding that the Presidents media wished to clarify that the President had not made references to the involvement of Indias intelligence wing.
The Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu had called on the President yesterday morning to discuss and clarify the matter. A statement by the Presidents media said that all matters were clarified during the meeting and bilateral relations were assured.
India and Sri Lanka have maintained cordial relations and cooperation since the inception of this government. Several highest level visits have taken place between the two nations that have resulted in strengthening cooperation in many fields.
The statement by the President media adds that given these circumstances, It is very unfortunate that some parties with vested interests resort to spreading such malevolent manipulations detrimental to the existing good relations between the two countries as well as the excellent personal rapport between the two leaders. 
In the said Cabinet Meeting on Tuesday, discussions had taken place on the alleged plot to assassinate the President. During the meeting, the President emphasised the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged assassination plot. Among other topics discussed at various times during the said Cabinet Meeting, was the development of the Eastern terminal of the Colombo port. The President highlighted the importance of Sri Lanka having a deep sea port terminal in the interest of national economy.

Halt this trend
Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is generally known for speaking his mind, an attribute which most cite as the cause for his loss at the 2010 Presidential Election. He is known to call a spade a spade and make sweeping statements not caring whom he rubs on the wrong side. However some of his utterances ought to be taken seriously by the authorities, lest the Government leaders be held in ridicule by the public.
Responding to journalists the other day on the fate that awaits IGP Pujith Jayasundera and if there was any truth in the speculation the controversial Police Chief was to receive a posting as Sri Lankas envoy to South Korea, Field Marshal Fonseka said that the country has a history of sending sacked IGPs as Foreign Ambassadors.
Of course, the Minister may have had in mind the posting received by a former IGP as the countrys envoy to Brazil under the Rajapaksa regime. This was after a youth who was among the participants of a massive protest in Katunayake against the Governments move to fiddle with their EPF benefits was killed in a police shooting. The Police Chief, instead of being hauled over the coals and subjected to a disgraceful exit, was given a kick upstairs, so to speak, and provided with a pleasant life in the exotic land of the Samba, at the cost of the taxpayer. It was the same mode that was applied for giving a diplomatic post to the Army Officer responsible for firing into the Rathupaswala protestors that killed three youths.
To any rational thinking mind this indeed is a dangerous trend. For, we will soon have a scenario where an IGP who enjoys the patronage of the powers that be ordering his personnel to deploy criminal force in dispersing protests knowing that a diplomatic post is there for the asking if things happen to go wrong. Needless to say, these ex-police or military officers who had so been privileged to serve as diplomats, without any qualifications for the job, would only feel obliged to serve their leaders who were responsible for affording such a privilege. The Ex-Army commanders and top military officers now disporting themselves with prominence at the Eliya and Viyath Maga political shows of aspiring Pohottuwa Presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, tell a tale.
The practice of appointing police or military personnel suspected of criminal acts, for diplomatic posts should be halted. Sri Lanka has already suffered the ignominy of some of its diplomatic postings of retired military personnel being rejected by the host country, whether the accusations against them were valid or not. This would not only be damaging to the country but liable for the countrys leaders to be viewed in poor light (for making such appointments).
It is incumbent for the Government to demonstrate its gratitude to the servicemen for their sacrifices made for the country, but such personnel could be provided with suitable occupations at home. Sri Lankas diplomatic service has already earned a bad name, for the appointment of misfits and relatives and cronies of certain politicians.
A trend also had emerged during the Rajapaksa era where Supreme Court Judges were made Ambassadors upon retirement. This led to much controversy, with the whole question of the independence of the judiciary called into question. Will any Judge act independently in a case challenging the State, when the prospect of an Ambassadorship is being dangled before his/her eyes. There was an instance where a former Chief Justice was appointed to the Court of St. James under the Rajapaksa Presidency, while another ex-CJ was made legal advisor to the President.
While no aspersions can be cast on the two retired CJs, how this will reflect on the public perception of the independence of the judiciary is the question. That our Judiciary is not without judicial officers with mettle was brought home by the defiant stand of the countrys first Lady Chief Justice, who stood up to the might of the Rajapaksas.
It is time that the whole matter of our Ambassadorial appointments be made transparent and above board. The routine rubber-stamping of appointments by the Parliamentary High Posts Committee (PHPC) should be brought under scrutiny. How such individuals such as Jaliya Wickamasuriya (USA) and Udayanga Weeratunga (Russia) passed muster with the PHPC is anybodys guess. With the Right to Information Laws now being made use by various civil society groups and individuals to bring irregularities to light, this aspect too should engage their attention.
It is not suggested that only career diplomatic should be called upon to man our Foreign Desks. There have been outstanding individuals, outside the Foreign Service, in the past, who held themselves with aplomb and brought credit to the country. It is however regrettable that our diplomatic service had turned out to be a veritable employment agency for the kith and kin of politicians, favoured businessmen and also political rejects. This administration has by and large avoided this situation and it should continue to be so. A professional Foreign Service is essential to project a good image of the country to the world.

Help mitigate climate change effects
President Maithripala Sirisena has called on senior engineers and lawyers in the irrigation sector to form a working committee to discuss ways of mitigating the effects of climate change, particularly with routing rivers up streams from the countrys Wet Zones to dryer areas.
When we know the effects of climate change and the affects it has on our country, why allow places to suffer due to floods, when we can come up with ways to route rivers or streams in a manner that water would reach the Dry Zones of the country, he queried during the Regional Conference of the Federation of Engineering Institutions of South and Central Asia.
The President commended the efforts made by engineers in the various fields adding that Sri Lankas has a proud history of engineers whove paved the way for projects that have stood the test of time.
He referred to the chief architects and engineers of the Gal Oya, Eng. J.S Kennedy, Parakrama Samudra Eng. Ismail and most recently Eng. Kulasinghe who mapped out Moragahakanda.
The country is indebted to these engineers and many more who continue to offer their services. It is my request that they continue to work for the betterment of the country.
This Conference is organized annually in collaboration with Sri Lanka Engineers Association and Eastern and Central Asian Engineers Federation. This years theme is, Challenges and targets in achieving sustainable development t goals.
The representatives of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal also participated in the conference which expects to uplift the professional cooperation between the allied countries of the Eastern and Central Asian regions towards establishing a productive mechanism, discussing issues and providing opportunities for Non Governmental Organizations engaged in the field of engineering education and training.
President Sirisena who addressed the inaugural session said that the severe challenges in achieving sustainable development goals are the variations of climatic changes, poverty, challenges faced in building a health safety public, corruption, and fraud.

The journey of  Vada Chennai  began in 2003
Actor-filmmaker Dhanush, who awaits the release of Tamil gangster drama Vada Chennai, said the films journey began in 2003 and that he is blessed to have been part of this project even though it took long to materialise.
Vada Chennai, directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Vetrimaaran and produced by Dhanush, is gearing up for release on October 17. The film chronicles 30 years in the life of a gangster from North Chennai.
The journey of Vada Chennai began in 2003 even before Vetri and I did Pollathavan. We wanted to work again after Pollathavan and I suggested we do Vada Chennai. Vetri understood neither did we have a market nor the budget to make such a film. Instead, we worked on Aadukalam, Dhanush told reporters.
Recalling how the project eventually fell into place, he said, After Aadukalam, we thought of working on Vada Chennai, but Vetri suggested we take a break from each other and join hands later. A few months later, Vetri called and told me that he wants to make Vada Chennai with Simbu and I was happy for them.
The project never took off with Simbu for reasons unknown. It came back to Dhanush.
When Vetri came back to me with the project, I told him I cant do it immediately. But I suggested we could work on some other script and we even discussed a film called Soodhadi, but it never materialised. Meanwhile, Vetri suggested he wanted to work on another film and that was Visaaranai, Dhanush said.
Finally, Vada Chennai went on the floors in 2016.

MEMORABLE MELODIES

It is certainly true that there will only ever be one Jim Reeves and Elvis Presley and although many singers have tried to emulate their unique voices, some have managed to come close to that of Elvis, but there is still not one who looks like Jim Reeves or sound like him. But it is indeed an honour for Sri Lanka to have someone who sounds perhaps the closest to Gentleman Jims voice. In fact this complement was not paid to him locally, but by the worlds largest Jim Reeves fan club in Holland.
He is none other than Sri Lankas very own Jim Reeves, Janaka Palapathwala, who welcomes you to his world on October 23 at the Bishops College Auditorium for yet another evening of soothing melodies of a bygone era.
Speaking to the Daily News on how he entered this field, Janaka said, Singing was my passion since my school days but I started singing only by around 2001-2001. I used to have concerts at that time too, but looking back now, I wouldnt call them real concerts. According to the Sri Lankan standards at the time, yes they were concerts, but if you look at it on international standards, they were certainly not concerts as such. However, after I left the country, and witnessed the classical and semi-classical type musical shows, the type of music I play is generally played with orchestras.
Having entered the stage professionally in 2014 and having held a concert that year he also held a second concert in 2015 as well. The first was titled its now or never, which is more of an Elvis Presley show and the other was a Jim Reeves show.
When he returned to Sri Lanka in 2014 he staged a show with 31 musicians which was directed by Harsha Makalanda. Even at that time he felt that Sri Lanka had not moved forward in the field of arts. Yes we have renowned musician in the calibre of Amaradeva, Victor Ratnayake, Nanda Malini to name a few, but although they play with orchestras, it is the same as it was done back then, he said, adding that he felt at that point that he should keep a bench mark so that others would follow. This is Janakas third concert in Sri Lanka and is still the only one who performs with orchestras compared to the magnitude of the show. This time around he will be backed by a 15 piece orchestra with six vocalists backing from the university western choir and Dinesh Subasinghe and his orchestra.
In 2014 and 2015 Janaka had two concerts and one was titled Its now or never which was an Elvis show and the other was The Jim Reeves Show. Thereafter, for the past three years he has been travelling the world performing in various countries and cities.
Talking about his next show in Colombo he said, Now I am back in Sri Lanka after around three years and this time I thought I would put all the artistes such as Engelbert, Tom Jones, Elvis and several others, together in one show. In fact I started as an Elvis fan and I was even called the Sri Lankan Elvis. But then I diversified my repertoire to Jim Reeves and other artistes. However, when I started singing Jim Reeves songs, people started embracing them more.
When asked about the complement and honour he was given in Holland he said, The biggest Jim Reeves fan club in the world is in Holland and hey said that I am the closest in the world to match his voice. In fact my poster and ticket is pinned on the fan club lobby. Yes, there are thousands of Elvis impersonators who are really good. However, there arent many Jim Reeves impersonators. Hence, this complement I got from Holland is indeed greatly appreciated.
The love for music started off as a mere hobby for Janaka, but having captured the hearts of many Jim Reeves and Elvis fans he decided to take his talents to a much higher platform. The demand was such that I had to travel around the world. When you have to travel so much to the tune of around 250 days a year, holding a steady job is impossible.
However, although he had left his full time engagement at Nation Lanka Equities to pursue his singing career, he is still on the Board of Directors of Nation Lanka Equities. I believe that if anything is done half heartedly you will not succeed, instead you must give it your all, to really be content that you have done it well. If you take for example musicians such as Victor Ratnayake, Master Amaradeva and Amarasiri Peiris, they are all superb violinists, but they dont call themselves violinists even within music. If you try to focus on voice and an instrument, it wont work. Hence, it should be solo focused.
For Janaka, this journey would not have been possible if not for the support and encouragement of his father. Talking about his biggest fan and mentor, his beloved father, Janaka lamented that his father, who was his biggest driving force, is unfortunately not here to witness his next show in Colombo. My father passed away last year. In fact, he is the one who coached me in pronunciation, voice modulation and enunciation which is very important. Even Jim Reeves had said that he had studied these three components which had been a huge asset in his singing career. Thats why there is such a distinct difference when an educated person sings and someone who just pics up a mike and sings, despite having a good voice.
So far Janaka has performed in Sri Lanka, USA, Canada, UK, Holland, New Zealand and Australia. Having travelled to the US on two occasions Janaka has held around six concerts there and he is already booked to perform again in the US in March-April next year. He said while the majority of his fans are the mature crowd over 40, he has a fairly big young following as well. As I see it, they are in fact the real fans as they are those who have not grown up with this music, but who have embraced it purely by liking it.
Janakas local concert will be held at the Bishops College Auditorium on October 23 at 7pm. He is slated to perform a wide repertoire of songs of Jim Reeves, such as Welcome to my world, from a jack to a king, Mexican Joe, distant drums, Adios Amigo and Elvis Presleys Jailhouse rock, a gospel song, he touched me, and songs of Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck a medley of songs, Oscar Harris, Glen Campbell and Neil Diamond.
This concert is organised by the Lions club International District 306 C2 in aid of the visually impaired persons and the funds go to the gift of sight fund. Even the Australian tour was in aid of the visually impaired. In fact, all my concerts are done to assist the needy and for a worthy cause wherever I have performed. In Toronto it was for the senior citizens who are being neglected in society, one was for flood victims, for drought victims and war victims, he said.
Since this concert is for the visually impaired, when asked if he would be performing the song Nobodys Child by Karen Young, Janaka was quick to respond saying, Oh I had not thought about it, but now that you mentioned, I certainly would include it, a male version of it.

High Speed Electric Train Production Plant as a BOI venture
Minister Senasinghe says Investment claim bogus
The project proposal to set up an integrated High Speed Electric Train Production plant as a BOI venture in Sri Lanka was a bogus project.
State Minister of International Trade, Sujeewa Senasinghe at the BOI alleged that this project was created to obtain BOI approval and then use it to channel black money and gains other advantages. Minister said that though this project was an Italian investment running into over US$ 500 million the registered company does not have a single Italian investor named in it. In addition three of the Directors listed in the company have financial irregularities in Sri Lanka and they are listed in the CRIB. He said that this is why this project did not get BOI approval and the investors then stooped to the low level to state that him (Sujeeva) and Minister Malik Samarawickrama had request 10% as a bribe to approve the project.
Minister said that similarly there was a proposed mega development project to build World Capital Centre (WCC), billed to be Asias tallest building with a US$ 2 billion investment and it too did not get approval as there were issues of the credibility of the investors.
Meanwhile Minister said the BOI always encourages genuine investors and in the first six months they have received US$ 1,428 million investment. This is a 130% increase as against the first six months of the previous year which was US$ 601 million.
We are hoping to end the year with over record US$ 2.5 billion FDI.
He also said that the depreciating rupee is also an advantage to attract FDI as manufactures could gain more for their products.

History of the cake-mixing ceremony dates back to the 17th century, when it marked the arrival of the h arvest season. During this time lots of fruits and nuts were harvested and prepared to go into the making of the traditional plum cake. The mix was saved up for the next harvest season with the hope that the coming year would bring with it another abundant year. This ceremony quickly metamorphosed to a close affair, with the family sitting together and soaking dry fruits in wine or rum and hoping that the fine flavour fills their Christmas with delectable sweetness.
Keeping up with this tradition Galle Face Hotel Christmas Cake Mixing took place at Caf/Museum area recently with the participation of its management.

N-E monsoon foretells dengue danger
The danger of dengue after a tough year is finally showing signs of easing, but experts warn that the oncoming northeast monsoon may reverse the positive trend, if we are not careful.
A 70 percent decrease has been reported in dengue cases when compared with the same period last year, and only 313 cases have been reported so far for the month of October.
The highest number of dengue cases  7,654  was reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number  4,308  was reported from the Gampaha district. The third highest number  4,300  was reported in the Batticaloa district.
National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU) Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera said there could be an increase in the coming weeks considering prevailing weather conditions.
He said the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa in particular, would be the most vulnerable areas in the country.
A total of 39,793 dengue cases and 43 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country until October 12 this year. The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,945 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,709 dengue cases. The number of dengue cases reported in the Western Province is 14, 421.
The districts where most cases were reported were Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy, Galle, Matara, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Kegalle and Kalmunai.
An urban disease
Dr Tissera said that dengue was mostly an urban disease. Mosquitoes breed in manmade containers, in small collections of water, and the possibility is very high in urban settings, he said.
He said dengue was a viral disease which spread easily. The main factors that influence the fast spreading of dengue are susceptible people and the abundance of mosquitoes, as it was a viral disease. External factors like weather conditions add to it and can lead to the breeding of more dengue mosquitoes.
Dr. Tissera called the dengue epidemic a cyclical phenomenon and added that uninfected mosquitoes get infected by people who are diagnosed with dengue fever.
And therefore the transmission continues.
We have to break this phenomenon at different levels. We are now conscious about the ways in which we can prevent transmission, he said.
Control measures
Dr. Tissera noted that they watch for specific areas of the outbreak of the disease, as cases are more easily identified when there is a cluster of patients caused by local transmission of the virus.
He added that when a cluster of patients is admitted or reported from one area, PHIs are immediately deployed to look into it and necessary measures would be taken.
The NDCU employed 1,300 field health workers last year at a national level as a part of source reduction campaign to support and help the public to remove water-collecting and mosquito-breeding points.
Dr. Tissera said the waste segregation campaign conducted by the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry greatly facilitated their dengue prevention campaign.
The Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Dengue (PTF) together with the NDCU initiated a process to supervise all construction sites to ensure they function under strict regulations and to ensure that no mosquito breeding sites are formed. The sites were provided with non-toxic lavisides as a temporary measure to get rid of mosquitoes. All these years they were fogging with the involvement of the PTF and the Health Ministry.
Now they are given lavisides instead of fogging. Only adult mosquitoes get killed by fogging. Lavisides destroy all mosquitoes, said Dr Tissera.
He said they hope this measure would minimise dengue cases among workers and neighboring communities. We cannot stop development projects. With the number of constructions happening around Colombo and its suburbs, we have to address these issues.
The other campaign is focused on schoolchildren. The Health Ministrys Epidemiology Unit has identified that schoolchildren have a higher chance of getting infected. And the NDCU has taken measures to control mosquito breeding places in schools with the help of the Education Ministry. We have allocated specific times to check places of water retention and parents are requested to come and clean the school premises, Dr. Tissera said.
School authorities have gradually paid more attention to mosquito breeding places and segregated garbage bags have been given to primary schoolchildren and they are planning to expand the project further, he said.
National Mosquito Control Week
The National Mosquito Control Week started on September 26 and ended on October 2, covering the entire island and was organised by the National Dengue Control Unit and the Presidential Task, with the intention of preventing and controlling a potential dengue epidemic with the onset of the northeast monsoon.
The programme was implemented in on all days in 50 high-risk MOH divisions and on five days in 125 dengue endemic MOH divisions, while inspection of school and construction sites was also conducted.
Dr. Tissera said that nationally, 175 risk areas were identified. For this purpose, 6,000 persons including members of Tri-Forces, police and civil defence force, formed into groups and inspected 350,037 premises.
He said they went from door to door educating people and ensuring that they would keep their properties mosquito-free and local government bodies also supported the campaign.
He emphasised that these places need to be frequently checked as the dengue cases can go up in the next few months due to the prevailing rains.
The total potential breeding sites in the North Western Province, Northern Province and Central Province was high. The total percentage of premises with mosquito larvae was 2.79 percent, while the Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Central, South and North Western Provinces recorded a higher value.
Percentage of potential residential breeding sites was 25 percent, while a larvae percentage of 2.5 was identified. The potential breeding sites within school premises was 60 percent, while the presence of larvae was over 14 percent. Potential breeding sites in construction premises were 64 percent and the presence with larvae was 10 percent.
Dr. Tissera said the current high-risk situation in schools and construction sites need immediate remedial action.
He said people are very well aware of how dengue is spread and the need for control of mosquito-breeding sites, but they just need to be reminded from time to time.

NUTRIENT-RICH YOGHURT
Yoghurt is often included on healthy food lists. Yoghurt is highly nutritious and is an excellent source of protein, calcium and potassium. It provides numerous vitamins and minerals and is relatively low in calories.
Yoghurt is a cultured milk product that is soured and thickened by the action of specific lactic acid-producing cultures added to milk. The lactic acid produced by the culture coagulates the milk protein, thickening the milk and adding the characteristic sour flavor. The starter culturesor probioticsused to make Yoghurt are Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
Health Benefits of Yoghurt
Other probiotics are often added to Yoghurt for their health effects. Some common ones are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidus. These probiotics can help maintain the balance of bacteria necessary for a healthy digestive system; boost the immune system, shortening the length and severity of sickness; and may reduce eczema in babies.
When taking antibiotics, many people suffer unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea, intestinal pain and/or bloating. This is because some antibiotics upset the balance of bacteria in the digestive tract. Eating foods rich in probiotics may help relieve these side effects of antibiotics.
Yoghurt is a component of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet designed to reduce the risk of high blood pressure. This diet, which includes three servings a day of low-fat and fat-free milk, Yoghurt and cheese, and 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables, has also been shown to reduce risk of heart disease and stroke.
Ways to Eat Yoghurt
Yoghurt is extremely versatile. You can dip it, spread it, freeze it, add fruit to it or eat it plain. Here are some other ideas:
*Make a breakfast parfait by layering Yoghurt, dry cereal or granola, and topping with your favorite fruit
*Top waffles or pancakes with Yoghurt and sliced strawberries
*Enjoy a mid-day snack by blending Yoghurt, fruit and juice to make a delicious smoothie
*Dip raw vegetables in plain Yoghurt
*Use Yoghurt for salad dressing and dips
*Serve plain Yoghurt on quesadillas, tacos, soups and chilias an alternative to sour cream

This year it hopes to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our oceans by partnering with Sri Lankas first marine conservation research and education organisation, Oceanswell.
Oceanswell was founded in 2017 by international award-winning marine biologist, ocean educator, National Geographic Explorer and pioneer of blue whale research in the Northern Indian Ocean, Dr. Asha de Vos. CJS will collaborate with Oceanswell on three projects, focusing on marine conservation research and education, in line with Oceanswells mission.
With the first of these projects called Eavesdropping on Our Oceans, Oceanswell will collaborate with fishermen, to understand the impacts of increasing ocean noise levels on local whale populations, in order to answer important scientific questions that will feed into policy decisions, and increase local awareness and engagement. Local students will be trained in acoustic monitoring techniques to build capacity and generate interest in scientific fields that are currently undeveloped in Sri Lanka.
The collaboration will also create an information booklet for whale watching tour operators, where there has been little done to increase the educational capacity of operators, despite the rapid explosion of whale watching in Sri Lanka.
Founder of Oceanswell Dr Asha De Vos speaks at the launch of the collaboration with CJS to initiate three projects for ocean conservation. CJS Chairman Akram Cassim at right.
This educational component can vitally contribute to the protection and conservation of ocean environments where whale watching operates.
The third project focuses on skills-development for individuals seeking careers in marine conservation, by developing transferrable skills that prepare students and ocean-based entrepreneurs to work on marine environment solutions. Despite the ocean covering 70 percent of the planet, employment in the field of marine conservation is still low.
CJS seeks to capture the dynamic beauty of the ocean, whilst at the same time highlighting the urgent need to protect its fragile ecosystems. The Ocean Blues collection pairs the aquatic hues of blue sapphires, aquamarines and emerald cabochons, with the surf-white brilliance of diamonds and pearls to create the classically nautical blue-white combination that is so synonymous with the sea.
The jewellery designs are elegantly powerful, some following the graceful lines and geometric patterning of sea shells. Other pieces made from multi-coloured gems, reflect the warmer colours of the ocean, as seen in its coral reefs and timeless sunsets. - SR

When we were looking for a Common Candidate, the Prime Minister initially asked me to be the Common Candidate, but I said no. I would find him a prominent SLFPer for the job. Because we needed to win. People have forgotten the beginnings.Some people think that Maithri alone won this or that Ranil won it; neither is true, it was done together.

Bangladesh overnight pair skipper Towhid Hridoy and Shamim Hossain both failed to add to their overnight scores being dismissed for 54 and 43 respectively.
The Sri Lankan under 19 bowlers evaded a worthwhile pursuit against Bangladesh as they piled up 309 first innings total, adding only 100 runs on the second day of the first Test played at the NCC ground yesterday.
But Amite Hasan coming at the fall of the fifth wicket steadied the innings with a fine half century scoring 64 off 99 balls (6 fours). However the rest of the batting fell apart and Bangladesh who had looked headed for a big first innings score folded up quickly.
Sri Lankan openers Navod Paranavithana and Kamil Mishra gave the side a good start with a 55-run partnership. Mishra was dismissed before the close for 17, leaving Paranavithana unbeaten on 35 to resume the innings on the third day today with his captain Nipun Dananjaya on five.

It was also pointed out that the JVP rebels who were arrested in the 1970s and 80s insurrections were later released. It was also pointed out that these prisoners were held under a legislation which the Government has already undertaken to repeal and that the prisoners confessions are not admissible before the law as per the new Counter Terrorism Act. Even if they had been meted out punishment at the right time, most of them would have been served their term and would have come out by now. Therefore, it was explained that it was not right to keep them in prison any longer, the spokesman detailed.

Protesting South Eastern University students defy court order
A group of Technology Faculty undergrads of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka who have barricaded themselves inside Administration Block, continue to do so in defiance of the Akkaraipattu Magistrates Court order for them to disperse.
The undergrads have locked themselves inside the universitys Administration Block since Monday and continued to piclet, preventing the Vice Chancellor, Registrar, Bursar and other Administrative Officers from entering premises
As result, all activities of the universitys Administration Block have come to a standstill.
However, the Vice Chancellors, Registrars officiers are functioning as usual at the Faculty of Arts and Culture. Meanwhile, the academic activities of the University are also functioning as usual except for the Faculty of Technology.
It is learnt that a group of Technology Faculty students involved in acts of indiscipline such as ragging and other acts of violence were punished with the Faculty premises being made out of Out of Bounds.
The parents of the punished students held negotiations with the Vice Chancellor and the other administrators last Friday with 9 demands.

Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne refuted media reports that stated that President Maithripala Sirisena had informed Cabinet that the RAW was plotting to kill him.
The President had only noted that certain groups were trying to insinuate that the Indian arrested in the attempted assassination plot case was an agent of the Indian Intelligence Agency; RAW, Minister Senaratne said, at the weekly Cabinet media briefing.
Through this they are trying to create issues between India and Sri Lanka, the President had said, the Minister said.
The story had been reported in the Indian newspaper The Hindu yesterday with the report quoting multiple sources within the Cabinet.
The CID in September arrested an Indian national who had visited Anti-Corruption Force Organization Working Director Namal Kumaras house and later revealed that the Indian had revealed to them that he was aware of a plot to kill incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family. The Indian High Commission in a statement released since then has stated that the Indian national was not of sound mind.
Details of an assassination plot came to light when Kumara playing an audio recording at a press conference said that the former TID chief DIG Nalaka Silva and some officers were planning to kill President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Minister Senaratne in addition revealed that the President had noted at the Cabinet meeting that the file on DIG Nalaka Silva was yet to be handed over to him. DIG Silva was interdicted from his post yesterday.
When questioned as to why action against those mentioned in the audio recording was slow even after the Government Analyst's report proved its credibility, Minister Senaratne said that while the recording may be true, it did not mean that the contents had any validity, No one said that it was enough proof for an arrest. We also cant take the word of Namal Kumara who is a police informant, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is scheduled to visit India this week and also met the Indian High Commissioner yesterday.

Relentless reality v Rankings and recovery
All hail Sri Lanka Rugbys most gracious host of the final Asian 7s series 2018.
Little or no doubt about the quality and sheer professionalism of the Japanese squad thru the entire 2018 series.
Food for much Sri island thought and a definite divide in skills, fitness finish, consistency and discipline.......that sets them apart from Hong Kong and yet further from us.
Here lies Sri Lankas quest and challenge over the next 3 seasons in Asia, and ambition on the World 7s platform.
Our 4th place recovery, much better than 6th in Korea...but still outside all further World 7s qualifiers...
We miss out on the biggest platforms going.
The World Series, Asian, the 7s World Cup and the mother of all the 2020 Olympics.
As 7s islanders we are still short on the magic....little shy of the hard graft....... lack petrol to outrun...and burning questions about belief.
But for me as your older deckchair expert.....its all on ball retention, being out gunned and out muscled at the breakdowns.
If you had a stats buddy grey matter analyst....the teams that win the deck and wrestle strong are significant winners throughout.
Japan and HK clearly a level above all other Asians and easily outplay all contenders including Sri Lanka.
Reality is always way above fiction and naturally a bitter pill to swallow.
Four years we have been hovering around the top 3 and failed to make the cut regularly.
Under the experts microscope, despite playing 3 regular wingers as our line...Kavindu, Ranjan and Naveen...or Dixon....we still lacked pace to run round the defence and relied lots on trying bust thru the drift D.......sapping up lots of petrol in the process.
We are also short on work rate ball dog forwards like Muthu, Gayan and Jason.....vital cogs in our ability to crash through.
I am a firm and stubborn believer in building our reputation for an island brand of rugby as championed by Fiji, Samoa, etc.
Dreams of consistency are defiantly the way forward and upward.
We certainly cant be circling on the outside....its time our coaching and thinking, for both the men and women, considered how we plan to beat a Japan or Hong Kong....how we win both attack and defence, forcing errors from imposing pressure.
Sri 7s has been described aptly as plenty the skills to run but lack the power to pressure sides, and turnover ball as required.
Both teams 4th and 5th place Plate for the women......acceptable, but still way short of being a force in Asia.
All in all we are still short on the top grade to be a team with magical attributes.
Take Kenya, Portugal, Argentina, Canada, Samoa and USA...sides that have shocked the world by beating the best ...showing us the way to fly at that elite altitude.
The time has come the walrus said...time to change Sri 7s history and be rated as a consistent force in Asian rugby...we make this destiny our reality.
All hail our future for 7s.
Bula bula Sri Api!

Rising fuel prices give urban Indians harrowing time on roads
NEW DELHI (Xinhua) -- Hit hard by steep hike in fuel prices, people in urban India are trying all cost-effective measures to tackle commuting. The most popular among them has been to shun the use of private cars and resort to public transport or carpooling.
Petrol and diesel prices have been on a steady hike since the past few months.
Despite protests from several counters, petrol have crossed 80 Indian rupees (1.10 U.S. dollars) per liter in most Indian cities, including the national capital, while it has crossed 90 Indian rupees in financial capital Mumbai, as the dip in the value of rupee and rise in international crude prices continue to push rates across the country to all-time high.
India is the third largest importer of crude oil and rising international oil prices are inflating domestic transport fuel costs in a strong demand environment.
Brent, the benchmark for more than half the worlds oil, climbed to 80 U.S. dollars per barrel from 71 U.S. dollars in the past five weeks, and the Indian rupee lost ground against the dollar by 5-6 percent during the same period, resulting in expensive crude imports.
This rise has flipped people who are now scrambling and cutting household expenses to adjust with the steep fuel prices.
I have started taking car pool since last month when the prices started to rise. With my salary and two children to educate, its difficult to manage the budget. Though carpool can be a time-consuming exercise, it is helping us manage our monthly expenses as most of the money we make for our survival was going into refuelling the car, says Gargi Chaudhury, an IT executive who travels from Delhi to her office in nearby Gurgaon daily.
In a recent survey conducted by citizens forum Local Circles, participants from five metropolitan cities responded that the fuel rise has broken their backs deeply. The survey asked respondents how their household condition has been in the past 12 months with respect to earnings and expenses.
While 22 percent said earnings have risen less than the expenses, 38 percent said that earnings have been flat, but expenses have risen significantly. Only 16 percent said earnings have risen significantly more than the expenses, and 24 percent said earnings have risen slightly more than the expenses.
People complained cutting down on leisure activities, and discretionary spending like eating out, travel, movies and shopping, which is specifically dampening given that the festival season is around the corner.
My wife used to spend almost 10,000 Indian rupees (150 U.S. dollars) per month on fuel but with the price hike, we could not afford to shell out more than we were already doing. We both have stopped using our cars and instead using Metro rail or pooling with colleagues. The price rise has really burned a hole in our pockets. We are also thinking of abandoning our cars altogether to travel on bike to office and use bicycle for daily-use purposes, says Akash Singh, a Delhi-based private sector bank executive.

Some royal etiquette experts had criticised them, branding it a major faux pas to overshadow Eugenie and Jacks big day. Etiquette expert William Hanson said: Whether they are royal or not, they committed a faux pas. They did slightly upstage the bride and that is a complete no-no.

But no, the couple did not actually tell their family during Eugenies wedding - it seems this was just a case of the royal rumour mill in overdrive.
BAZAAR.com has been told by a source close to the family that most of the family actually knew about the pregnancy before the wedding.
The Duke and Duchess are said to have shared the news before Princess Eugenies big day as they were set to jet off on their royal tour shortly after.
The source told BAZAAR.com the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and Eugenie and Jack all knew about Meghans pregnancy before the wedding.
They hadnt seen them in person yet so were only able to congratulate them on the wedding day, but they were already aware of the happy news.
Whether the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge knew about the royal baby hasnt been made clear, but with Harrys extremely close relationship with his brother, it is likely.
A representative for Kensington Palace said Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are delighted for the couple.

Princess Eugenie is yet to make a statement but is said to be close to her cousin Harry.
There were a few rumblings of the Sussexs having stolen Eugenies thunder, however.
Just 40 minutes after the baby news broke, Eugenies mum Sarah Ferguson posted a tweet of the wedding with the caption: So proud of Eugenie and Jack.
Some speculated this was an attempt to get the attention back on her daughter after her moment in the limelight over the weekend. Eugenies father, Prince Andrew also retweeted one of Fergies tweets featuring Eugenie and Jack, also making no mention of Harry and Meghan.
But its hard to see what Harry and Meghans other options were.
They waited until after the wedding, but knew they would be photographed on a daily basis during their tour and Meghans bump is beginning to show.

Sangakkara had a massive influence on me  Ollie Pope
Ollie Pope partly owed his mould-breaking international selection this summer to his proficiency against spin.
The first batsman to be picked as a debutant at No 4 by England since Michael Vaughan 19 years ago provided the necessary weight of runs to be watched, and caught the eye of the national selector Ed Smith for the ease with which he played the turning ball.
Coming in so early during his two Tests against India, Pope failed to showcase the dexterity inherited from such wristwork but, with Joe Roots team expected to be smothered by spin in the coming weeks, his chance could come in Sri Lanka. As an indication of what lies ahead, Suranga Lakmal, the one pace bowler in the home XI, recently sent down just 6.3 overs in the 2-0 Test series win over South Africa.
To be honest, cricket and hockey come hand in hand, probably more so in Twenty20 than any other format. he says. Ive found myself seeing a gap behind me and asking what can I do to get the ball there In hockey, it might be the same kind of action to make a deflection. I made a name for myself at the start with Surrey by playing these wacky shots, getting the ball into a weird position.
There is not a massive amount to sweeping, its just backing yourself, backing your hand-eye co-ordination, getting into the right positions and not pre- meditating. Seeing the line of the ball early is important so, if its the off-spinner, the one you want to sweep is the one outside off-stump  if you miss it, it is hitting you on the pad outside the line.
If you go in with a mindset of defend, defend, just trying to survive in those conditions you are likely to have a ball with your name on it, especially if a bowler like Rangana Herath is consistently hitting the same spot.
So, whether it is going over the top like a few lads will do or sweeping and reverse sweeping, having the scoring options is pretty essential.
Pope finished the international summer out of the Test team as England accommodated a plethora of all-rounders, including his close friend and county colleague Sam Curran. But he wants to be mentally in tune for Test cricket, prepared to play so that whenever I do get my shot I can make the most of it.
Whatever happens during his first winter as an England player and beyond, though, Pope is committed to the small print of what turned him into a Test cricketer. Pope has adopted two quirks from his Surrey mentor Alec Stewart, who enjoyed a lengthy and successful career at international level  the chewing of gum on his way out to bat and the bending of his knees before every delivery he receives. At 20, and with a first-class average of 54.72, the recently crowned Professional Cricketers Association young player of the year admits he is yet to encounter failure. So remembering the finer details of what got him picked for his country after just 15 first-class appearances, he says, will be crucial when he does.
Me and Stewie spoke about dealing with it in my appraisal at the end of last year, but luckily this year was a good year too, says Pope, who is part of Englands 16-man squad in Sri Lanka.
The chewing and dipping  Australias Steve Smith does something similar  have been a part of Popes set-up for 13 months and are regular features of his chats with Surreys psychologist, Andrea Furst. But it is to a former team-mate  Kumar Sangakkara, Sri Lankas most prolific Test batsman  that he will turn for trip-specific advice.
He has had a massive influence on me, reveals Pope. Firstly, coming into a side as an 18-year-old alongside a star player like Sangakkara is unbelievable for making sure youre not getting too far ahead of your own station.
Then, he was so good at training. Whenever hed had his hit he would normally stay behind after and watch you play. He was always seeing if there was any advice he could give, and there is no better person to speak to.
He has seen me play and knows exactly what it takes to succeed out there.
But it was actually batting with him that I learned the most. There was a time at Somerset when he changed the way I was playing completely, not by instructing me what to do, but just telling me what I was doing wrong. Suddenly, I was playing five times better than I was before.  Daily Mail

Selfish play proves the undoing of Kandy Schools
Colombo schoolboy ruggerites will be looking to extend their winning performance when they host Kandy schools at the Racecourse Stadium in the second game.
Last Friday evening Kandy schoolboy ruggerites let down their supporters with a disappointing display against the Colombo schoolboys where they were beaten 14-12 after leading in the first half due to selfish play.
Kandy schools who are famous for sensible rugby had an off day in the first leg.
They should give a better performance on October 20 in the return game in Colombo. These two games are played to pick the junior national squad for the Asian U19 Rugby Championship that will be played in December. However there was only one selector at the grounds L.V. Ekanayake.
In the second leg game Kandy boys should not forget rugby is a team game not an individual game. Everyone expected the Kandy boys to do well at their home den, this defeat faces a big question mark as who is to be blamed the coaches or the players
Kandy boys started scoring in the fourth minute through Devanandas Lahiru Daulaga and his team mate made no mistake with the kick at goal to give them a 7-0 lead. Then came a try from Colombos Rukshan Madushak and it was goalled by Thuan Zamil to make it 7-all, Again Kandy scored through Humana Dhananjaya, a Maliyadeva product but this time the conversion failed and Kandy led 12-7 at half time.
In the second half Kandy schools were unable to prove that they had any sort of spirit in their game, and the players forgot that rugby is a 15 player team game. A thrilling game was expected but it never happened. Kandy had all the chances of pulling the game in their favor if they had played as a team. They also missed a penalty kick at goal two minutes before the final whistle, the Maliyadeva boys kicking at goal was good, but they brought in another player to kick this penalty and he failed.
Thanks to a superior team work of the Colombo schools backs and forwards who dictated proceedings after Kandys rugged opening quarter. Colombo made use of the Kandy boys one-man show mistakes.
Rugby fans were not impressed, there were 25 scrum downs in this game. Whatever said and done, the winning teams ruggerites gave a super display in rucking and clean hard play. The winning side forwards had plenty of fire to keep up to their standards, and rattled the opponents. The set scrums were equally shared, with the fly half coming in, and setting the line in motion on several occasions. It was pleasing to see the ball handled by the entire back division. Some of the timely kicks into the opponents territory was excellent.
In the last quarter of the game Colombo boys played with confidence and paced out the game to earn a penalty try goal. Their forwards played furiously and their three-quarters ran the ball well. Kandy side in the second half on more than they went up to the opponents goal line but failed to score due to faulty finish and selfishness. It would have been more purposeful if they could have made these attempts productive in the need of the hour.

Staying youthful
Sweet Treats 
If sugary foods are a staple of your diet, you may want to reconsider what you eat.

Preventive measures: 
urb your consumption of simple carbohydrates, which include the obvious treats, like soft drinks and candy, but also seemingly innocuous choices, such as honey, white rice, and white bread. These foods are quickly converted into sugar in your body and put your skin on the fast track to glycation. If you need something sweet (and, really, who doesnt), eat a small square of dark chocolate. The antioxidants in it can protect you from free radicals, those unstable atoms in the atmosphere that latch on to skin and lead to fine lines. Also, increase your intake of vitamin C. It helps generate collagen

Untamed tension 
Yes, stress really does wear on you. When youre under intense or chronic pressure, your body increases production of the hormone cortisol, which can damage collagen and elastin and decrease the skins ability to repair itself. Whats more, stress can make you tense up and grimace or frown, often without your even realizing it. After a while, these repeated muscle contractions can leave their mark in the form of permanent lines.

Preventive measures: 
Get stress and anxiety under control by exercising regularly. Yoga, Tai Chi, and brisk walking have been found to be effective tension tamers, possibly because of the meditative aspect of these activities. (The deep or rhythmic breathing of yoga and Tai Chi probably helps, too, by promoting healthy circulation.) If you dont have time for hour-long exercise sessions, break up your workouts: Walk the 30 minutes to the office, and download a yoga app (such as Yoga RELAX) so you can do a few gentle poses before bed.
Weight Fluctuations
Packing on pounds can make your skin look plumper on the surface, but carrying excess weight can cause your bodys levels of insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas that controls the amount of sugar in your blood) and cortisol to rise, which can break down collagen. Youll see increased sagging from putting and keeping on as little as 10 to 15 extra pounds. Repeatedly gaining and losing weight can take its toll on the skins elasticity, leaving behind stretch marks and jowls.

Preventive measures: 
Aim to keep your weight in the normal range, with a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.9.
Midlife Moisture Loss
With menopause, your body begins to pump out less estrogen.Since estrogen stimulates oil and collagen production in the skin, your skin may become drier, more wrinkled, and saggy as its levels drop.

Preventive measures: 
Your best inexpensive bet may be to troubleshoot by moisturizing heavily. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can offset some of these effects, but it can take time to find the exact combination of hormones that your body responds to. For more instant results, you might consider dermal fillers, which are injected into the skin to fill in wrinkles and plump up sagging areas. Consult your dermatologist for options.

Lack of Sleep 
Your skin has a chance to repair itself overnight. Without enough deep sleep, the kind you cant be roused from easily, the skin cant properly undo daily damage. Also, sleep deprivation puts your body into stress mode, causing it to release more stress hormones.

Preventive measures: 
Shoot for seven to eight hours of sleep a night. It takes discipline, but start by shutting off all electronic devices a half hour before bed so the stimulation doesnt keep you up. Another strategy: Try to sleep on your back. If you usually sleep with your face smushed into your pillow. it will look creased faster.
Marathon Workouts 
In the skin-aging equation, regular moderate exercise is a plus, since it reduces stress. But if you frequently run or bicycle long distances, you are not only exposing yourself to lots of UV light but also jolting, and possibly damaging, the support structure of the skin.

Preventive measures: 
Do not consider this a license to slack off! Brandt emphasizes that premature skin aging is generally an issue for extreme athletes only. That said, the use of lots of sunscreen and a great moisturizer can go a long way toward counteracting the relentless pull of gravity.

The Blues
Depression doesnt show up only in your demeanorit may also show up on your face. Over time, a frown (ironically, just like a smile or a squint) can become permanently etched into the skin. Depression is also associated with elevated cortisol levels, which can weaken supportive collagen fibers, as well as with a decrease in growth-hormone synthesis, which inhibits the ability of the skin to repair itself at night. Whats more, when people are depressed, they may not take care of themselves (or their complexions) the way they should.

Preventive measures: 
To combat depression, exercise regularly, enter counseling if necessary, and talk to your doctor about whether you would benefit from an antidepressant. Interestingly, reducing wrinkles with a cosmetic treatment like Botox might improve symptoms of depression. Sure, it could be that if you look better you feel better, but a study conducted at Cardiff University, in the United Kingdom, found a more likely explanation: When people had their frown lines treated with Botox, the paralysis of those facial muscles prevented them from transmitting negative-mood signals to the brain, which correlated with a lifting of the spirits.

T.B. Jayah trophy 49th boxing championships in Kandy
Five days of top boxing can be expected at the most looked forward to schools boxing meet, contested for the T.B. Jayah trophy. This time round the meet will be organized by one time boxing powerhouse St. Sylvesters College with the collaboration of the Sri Lanka Schools Boxing Association.
It will be the 49th inter-schools boxing meet. This meet every year is keenly contested with more than 220 boxers from over 50 schools participating.
The meet will commence on October 18 with the finals scheduled for October 22 at the St. Sylvesters College Gymnasium at Asgiriya.
The Zonal director of Education W. M. Wijeratne will declare open the meet.
This meet is held in memory of a trophy presented in the name of Tuan Burhanuddin Jayah who was a educationist, politician and diplomat. He started his career as a school teacher and retired after serving 27 years as the principal of Zahira College Maradana. He was born in Galagedera on 1 January 1890 to Nona and Cassim Jayah. He attended his first school the Anglo-Vernacular School in Kurunegala. Jayah later attended St. Pauls College, Kandy now known as Sri Sumangala College, where he received most of his primary education. He had to be enrolled to Grade 1 at the age of ten. However, the young student was found to be so brilliant that he was awarded a treble promotion from Grade 1 to Grade 4 and once again a double promotion to Grade 6 the following year. In 1904, he obtained a scholarship to S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia for his secondary education. He passed Cambridge Junior and Cambridge Senior examinations with merits. He obtained his first appointment at Dharmaraja College, Kandy in January 1910. His first monthly salary was Rs. 40. After a short term at Dharmaraja College, he moved to Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa on May 1910. In 1917, he shifted to Ananda College, Colombo after accepting an invitation from P. de S. Kularatne, who was the principal at that time. Jayah mainly taught History and Classics at school. At Ananda College he taught some students who became leading Marxist politicians of the country several years later Philip Gunawardena, Robert Gunawardena, Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe and Dr. N. M. Perera. Jayah was instrumental in opening up several branches of Zahira College. In 1942, the first branch was opened in Aluthgama, followed by the Gampola branch in 1944.
Three other branches were opened in 1945 in Matale, Puttalam and Slave Island. While studying in the final year in the Law College, in 1921, he assumed duties as the principal of Zahira College Jayah died in 1960, falling ill on pilgrimage to Mecca.

Tying political knots
With just three weeks to go for the Budget, there have been renewed attempts to reconcile the two major factions of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), despite major differences of opinion surfacing during initial consultations.
That President Maithripala Sirisena and his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa held discussions on this matter is now in the public domain. It is also known that the Sri Lanka Progressive Party (SLPP) faction headed by Rajapaksa and aided by his brother Basil Rajapaksa negotiated from a position of strength at these talks.
This was possible because of their resounding victory at the local government elections in February this year which pushed the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) into a distant third place. The SLPP is insisting that the mainstream SLFP cast the first stone- by pulling out of the National Unity government with the United National Party (UNP).
That would be a drastic step for President Sirisena and would be against the very mandate he received at the 2015 January presidential election. There is also no guarantee, at least at present, that the SLPP is willing to endorse President Sirisena for the next presidential poll. Hence the reluctance by the President to move in the direction of severing all links with the UNP.
Next presidential candidate
Meanwhile, the SLPP is proceeding with its own plans. Recently it was announced that the partys leadership would be passed on to Mahinda Rajapaksa, if it was so required. Rajapaksa has also been given sweeping authority, both regarding negotiating with the mainstream SLFP and also in deciding the SLPPs next presidential candidate, if these were to become necessary.
In such a context, The SLPP is viewing its negotiations with the President and the mainstream SLFP effectively as Plan B. Their first option, of which they are confident of, is contesting presidential and general elections on their own steam.
It was against such a backdrop that President Sirisena was called upon to make a nomination for the position of Chief Justice last week following the retirement of former Chief Justice Priyasath Dep. For various reasons, the nomination of a Chief Justice had become an issue of political significance.
One of outgoing Chief Justice Deps final tasks was to affirm the death sentence handed down to Duminda Silva, a former parliamentarian known for his loyalty to Rajapaksa. Silva was convicted of the murder of Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, father of UNP parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra.
President Sirisena nominated Supreme Court Justice Nalin Perera for Chief Justice and this was approved unanimously by the Constitutional Council which itself had been freshly reconstituted. Chief Justice Perera was not initially a frontrunner for the position where speculation centred between Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya and Supreme Court Justice Eva Wanasundera.
Chief Justice Pereras appointment has been hailed as an achievement for career judicial officers as he is the first career judicial officer to be elevated to the highest position in the judiciary after thirty years, a similar appointment being made previously in 1988 when Chief Justice Parinda Ranasinghe assumed office. In terms of seniority however, Chief Justice Perera was the fifth senior most judge in the Supreme Court.
With this appointment, President Sirisena has once again demonstrated that, despite the many political pressures that are brought upon him, he is able to make key decisions disregarding such influences. That the Constitutional Council unanimously backed his decision must be a source of strength to the President. However, it has been noted that the Presidents decision may only buy him a few months time as Chief Justice Perera will also reach retirement age next year. The President will then be called upon to nominate fresh choices for the post of Chief Justice all over again.
Another controversial appointment that President Sirisena has had to deal with is that of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera. Jayasunderas position as head of the countrys law enforcement agency has been under the spotlight after a Deputy Inspector General was implicated in an alleged plot to assassinate President Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.

Opposition political parties have accused Jayasundera of acting in favour of the UNP. Others have said that his actions, in the aftermath of revelations about the alleged assassination plot, have made his position as IGP untenable. The issue at stake was that President Sirisena could not sack him without a vote in Parliament- a vote that he could not be confident of winning.
Although he was previously resisting calls for his resignation Jayasundera this week hinted that he may be considering this option. Posts in social media that targeted his elderly mother appear to have affected him greatly. Questioned by journalists, the IGP said that it would be better for him to resign if it were the wish of everyone that he does so.
I think I have done enough. I have been working for the police department for thirty three years. I have not taken even a pittance from anyone. I earned only the goodwill of people and my self-respect. You will probably not believe me when I tell you I do not even own a house. I have to get one on rent so that my family has a place to stay, Jayasundera said.
The IGP said that neither President Sirisena nor Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked him to resign but that he formed the impression that they would prefer him to quit. If they do not have confidence in me it is of no use me staying on any longer, Jayasundera said.
In response to these comments, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara has stated that the IGP had not formally indicated any intention of resigning. He is free to resign if he wishes to do so. We have not asked him to resign or to act in a particular manner, Deputy Minister Jayamaha said. At the time of writing, IGP Jayasundera continues in his post.
As the government grapples with these issues and President Sirisena contemplates the best political course for himself and the SLFP, it is clear that the SLPP has its own political agenda and is pursuing it with enthusiasm. Similarly, the UNP also realises that come 2020, it will be on its own and that it should not expect support from the mainstream SLFP, the party it is cohabiting with now in the government.
The main obstacle the UNP is faced with is the economic crisis. While the party maybe justified to some extent in claiming that it is due, at least in part, to the massive debts undertaken by the previous Rajapaksa government, the masses will perceive that as a lame excuse. When the next elections are held, the UNP would have been in government for five years and that is ample time to rectify any errors by its predecessors. This, the UNP has failed to do convincingly so far.
Much then will depend on whether the SLPP and SLFP reconcile. If they do so, the UNP will face a tougher challenge at the next national elections. However, even as the dialogue between the hierarchies of the two parties continues, there are many political and personal obstacles to overcome before the two parties can work together.
It is the outcome of this proposed political marriage that political observers are eagerly awaiting in the coming weeks. The vote on the Budget will indicate which way this potential union is heading.

Vehicle registrations dip
The vehicle registrations saw a sizeable slowdown in September 2018 across almost all categories including two wheelers which were down 17%. Total vehicle registrations were 43,190 in August and this amount reduced to 34,293 in September. The category leader in small cars the Suzuki Wagon R hybrid registrations were down 31% on a month on month basis in comparison to August.
The measures by government to slowdown vehicle imports, three to months ago are finally biting which are evidenced in the registration figures, said J. B. Securities in their monthly Sri Lanka Vehicle Registration Summery. In 2018 August there were 7,003 vehicle registrations which it dropped to 4,990 last month. Three wheel registrations dipped from 1,670 units to 1,418 while two wheeler registrations reduced from 30,042 to 23,914.
There are yet a lot of inventory of unsold cars in vehicle yards or on the sea thus one will not see a dramatic fall in registrations in the next three to four months until it is sold. There are noticeable volumes in premium small engine cars due to a relatively lower rate of excise duty.

Welgama hits back at JO colleagues
Joint Opposition (JO) MP Kumara Welgama yesterday hit back at his JO colleagues who attacked him for his remarks over the future leadership of the country and the SLFP.
He convened a press conference in Kalutara to reply to the allegations levelled against him by several JO members.
I am not a political slave. I speak forthright.
I prefer Mahinda Rajapaksas leadership, but the SLFP is a common mans party and nobody can demand that its future leader must only be a Rajapaksa family member. I am against a coalition government that will give the ruling power back to an individual who destroyed the country. That is why all are attacking me. If I leave the SLFP, I would join a leftist party, he commented.
A JO MP, who wears full suit, knelt down in front of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asking for a ministerial post in the 100-day interim Government. There is blood on both the hands of another young JO MP. His father is a respected politician but the son is different, MP Welgama hinted at the MPs who levelled accusations against him.
