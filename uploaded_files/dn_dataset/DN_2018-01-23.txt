RADA fraud case: preliminary objections order fixed for Feb. 21
The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for February 21, the delivering of its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles in connection with a Rs. 200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, with Nalin Ladduwahetty PC, appearing for Tiran Alles, alleged that prosecutors have failed to follow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance when dealing with computer evidence. However, Additional Solicitor Yasantha Kodagoda PC, appearing for the Attorney General (AG), raised a primary counter-objection, citing its premature to raise this objection since the prosecution has not taken a decision to call computerized evidence at this juncture. At a previous occasion, the High Court had allowed the AG to proceed the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, an accused in the case. The AG had filed criminal proceedings against four accused; former RADA Chairman Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former RADA Chief Operating Officer Saliya Wickramasuriya, and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe, in connection with the RADA fraud.
On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by Supreme Court did not bar the AG filing indictments against the petitioner, Tiran Alles, based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is currently evading courts, and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest, in connection with attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.

Ravi to make  special statement  on Bond issue
UNP Assistant Leader and Colombo District Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake will make a special statement in Parliament regarding the Central Bank Bond issue when Parliament meets tomorrow (January 24).
Karunanayake announced this when he addressed a UNP election propaganda meeting held in Kotahena West on January 22.
Addressing the meeting Karunanayake alleged that the contents in the Presidential Commission Report on the Central Bank Bond issue had been distorted.
He said the Prime Minister, Ministers Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim and himself appeared before the Presidential Commission with good intentions. But the facts contained in the commission report allegedly contradicted the submissions made by them before the commission.
He would divulge this alleged crime during his statement made in Parliament tomorrow.
Karunanayake alleged that there was an insidious conspiracy to inconvenience the UNP government by making use of the Central Bank Bond issue.
He alleged that certain vociferous SLFP members who had crept into the UNP government and obtained Ministerial Portfolios were earlier in the opposite camp working to defeat the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015 Presidential Election. The master robbers who were today in the opposition were now trying to sling mud at those who laboured hard to bring the government into power. Answering several questions posed by the media Karunanayake said it was due to total misunderstanding that some critics claimed that the government had done nothing towards the countrys development, Karunanayake said.
The biggest challenge successfully shouldered by the government was servicing the massive debts handed over by the Rajapaksa regime. Had not the government reduced the prices of fuel and several other essential items Hasnt it eradicated the white van culture and strengthened democracy and media freedom, he added.
The Yahapalanaya is not only intended for UNP supporters but to the people of all communities and party hues. If anyone tried to challenge the Yahapalana system they were prepared to protect and safeguard it, Karunanayake said.

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act
Report on reform  recommendations  presented to Minister
The report on the recommendations for reform to the 1951 Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act which was nine years in the making was finally submitted to Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala yesterday.
A Ministry Spokesperson informed the Daily News that the report was handed over at 11 am yesterday by Chairman of the Committee appointed to look into reforms, former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Saleem Marsoof.
Justice Marsoofs Committee consisting of 16 members was appointed in 2009, by former Justice Minister Milinda Moragoda to Consider and Propose Reforms to the Muslim Matrimonial Law and Upgrading of Quazi Courts in Sri Lanka.
The handing over of the report came in the wake of a protest organised by civil society members and members of the Muslim Personal Law Reform and Action Group (MPLRAG) yesterday morning before the Ministry of Justice, asking that the Committee release the report.
MPLRAG member Hassanah Cegu Izzadeen speaking to the Daily News said they also demanded that the report be made public, the ministry invite womens groups and women affected by the MMDA for consultations and to provide the general public with a timeline over which amendments would be drafted into legislation and submitted to Parliament.
The Act which applies to all Muslim men and women who enter into marriage, disproportionally discriminates women at the time of registration as well as divorce; does not include a minimum age for marriage; bars women from positions of Quazi judges, marriage registrars and other key posts in the Quazi court and allows for polygamy without consent.
In October 2016 a Cabinet Sub-Committee was appointed to make proposals to amend the MMDA. The committee is expected to await recommendations from the report before they can work making recommendations to be legislated and submitted to Parliament.
The Cabinet Sub Committee consists of Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathuideen, Provincial and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, Muslim Affairs and Postal Services Minister M.H.M. Haleem, Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara and Water Supply and Drainage Deputy Minister Dr.Sudharshani Fernandopulle.
In a press release issued by the Ministry, it was stated that even though the MMDA requires amendments to many provisions pertaining to marriage and divorce, a special attention has been given to the minimum age of marriage.

Senaka Batagoda,  tell us who we are!
Last Saturday night the students of Nelu Adikari and Kapila Poogalaarachchi put on an amazing show. It was the second edition of Miyesi Lamaa Tharaka, and came five years after the maiden concert.
It is not easy to manage over 300 children. There were more than a dozen items. The children sang and danced. They sang most of the songs by themselves but there were a few where well known artists accompanied them. For example the song api sanasille was sung by Nelus brother Athula and Jananath Warakagoda, the renowned percussionist who has supported the excellent efforts of Nelu and Kapila to instill in children, a love for all types of music.
Miyesi Lama Tharaka needs to be written about separately. This is about the man who wrote the lyrics and composed the melody of api senasille.
Bandula Nanayakkarawasam, one of the best and most productive of our contemporary lyricists who compered the show, had a story to tell.
This song was written by Senaka Batagoda. It was he who wrote Api Kavuruda,, the song made popular by Sangeeth Wijesuriya and the band Wayo. Once I interviewed him for my programme Rae Ira Paana. We recorded him singing Api Kavuruda and as was the usual practice I made a CD and sent it to the radio station.
I rarely listen to my pre-recorded programmes. Senaka had listened. He called me. He was deeply distressed. He had a simple question: Ai mahaththayo vathura adala adala kale binde or Why did (you) break the earthenware pot after having drawn so much water
Then he told me that the producer for reasons best known to him or her had replaced his version of the song with that of Wayo. I was as devastated.
Its not Wayos or Sangeeths fault of course. They acknowledge Batagoda in their videos. They have purchased copyrights as well. They have with visuals and other enhancement turned what some may call a raw version into a hit. Producers know whats best for the station, one could argue. However, at the end of the day, theres an artist who created something special who is left feeling shorthanded. Thats not good.
The song, consequent to Bandulas account, sounds different now. The title-question is even more philosophical now. The entire song is about people wondering who they are. Who are we Who am I These are the questions we dont ask ourselves but seek an answer to nevertheless.
In a way, this is the question that Nelu and Kapila are seeking an answer to or rather want the children they teach to find an answer to. Parents send them to learn music, but they also learn history, heritage and culture. They learn something about humanity, about giving, sharing and the value of the collective. They acquire eyes to see the world and see through the world. They get exposed to roots, if thats proxy for things like history and heritage, and they open their minds to the universe, if thats proxy for things beautiful and sweet that are not necessarily wrought from our cultural soils.
So its about who we are and also about who we can become. Its about whats uniquely Sri Lankan and about the commonalities that pay little attention to national boundaries. It is about things that Senaka Batagoda sings about. Things that might at first cut appear to be casual observations about ordinary things but on closer examination are deeply philosophical.
Too often we re-define ourselves according to what we believe the world expects us to be. In the end we are not who we really are but someone elses version inhabiting someone elses version of our reality.
Lobo captures this in the song Love me for what I am:
I cant change any more
of what makes me be myself
And still have enough left
not to be somebody else
Its not always a conscious decision. We are bombarded in multiple ways all the time with be this! or be that! We want inclusion, we dont want to be left behind. So we go along and tell ourselves (by way of consolation) this is what I want to do/be. We dont often ask ourselves somewhere down the line, who am I or what have I become
Senaka Batagoda felt shortchanged. I like to think that he felt cheated by the misrepresentation. He is not just the lyricist, but the lyrics.
When he asks Api Kauruda (Who are we), its a general question to a large collective he is a member of, but he clearly has a good idea of who he is. His songs are explorations of the dimensions of being and becoming.
I dont know if he has had a conversation with Nelu and Kapila and I dont know if the duo ever thought of that song seriously. But in this universe where the improbability announces presence, theres a community that they are part of and that collective appears to be companions on a long journey. They walk to destinations that are probably clear to them. Their footprints are made for following. Malinda Seneviratne is a freelance writer.

Shrinking  Matt Damon
My plan is the following, announces Alexander Payne, who at 56 recently became first-time father to a baby girl. From zero to eight, only silent films. From eight to 12, talkies. And then on her 12th birthday, colour. And if it means we have to home school her, so be it.
No Netflix No TV
Yes, he concedes. Well have a black and white TV.
Downsizing, it seems, is more than just the name of Paynes new movie  but it is also that. His seventh feature as director stars Matt Damon as a self-effacing Omaha physical therapist who agrees to be shrunk to the size of an iPhone after being sold a dream of the minimalist life, but soon finds himself diminished in other ways. He is in many ways a typical Payne protagonist, a man beaten down by life to the point of cracking, next in line to Matthew Brodericks disgraced schoolteacher in Election, Paul Giamattis wine-soaked misanthrope in Sideways and George Clooneys floundering father in The Descendants.
If Payne put any of himself into these characters, it doesnt show. The director, Nebraska-born but of mostly Greek descent, greets me in an upscale London hotel suite looking entirely unruffled in cotton shirt and slacks. He is perched on a sofa, eyes owlishly alert and slightly piercing, his tone cool and relaxed.
We begin by talking about Damon, who since our meeting has made headlines for his squirm-inducing comments on sexual harassment but was better known for recent films in which he was made to squirm on screen: The Martian and Suburbicon and now Downsizing. I observe that Damon seems to have become the go-to-actor for every American director looking to cast a middle-aged ordinary Joe.
Well, we dont have another one among people between lets say 35 and 55, says Payne. Tom Hanks is now 60. Who do we have All these muscle-bound guys named Chris. And for a movie like this I needed a Jack Lemmon, a James Stewart, someone you can believe is an everyman, and I needed a star because it was a big-budget film.
Downsizing represents something of an upscaling for Payne, not only in terms of budget (a hefty $68m) but in scope, cast, locations and visual effects. For while it starts small  with Damon and wife Kristen Wiig diminutised but finding it only amplifies their marital discord  Payne and regular co-writer Jim Taylor extrapolate the story out across a global canvas. Says Payne: We thought: what if we take that premise ridiculously seriously, and say that Norwegian scientists think its the only possible solution to overpopulation and climate change Then it becomes a prism through which to see a lot of things, as science-fiction premises often are.

SL sovereign rating now assigned stable outlook - cb Governor
A major problem faced by private sector today is that there is a lack of stability and a lack of consistency and predictability in policy-making. However this is being addressed and the country can now see some improvements, said Governor Central Bank, Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at a Seminar organised by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and the launch of the exclusive Economic Intelligence Unit Publication: seminar on Economic + Sector Review and Outlook 2018 Report he said that some progress has been made in terms of stabilization. The Governor said that today one can be cautiously satisfied that the country has made some progress.
We are seeing foreign money coming into the stock exchange, and the securities market.
Fitch and S&P have taken away the negative outlook on their sovereign rating, and we now have a stable outlook. Of course with Moodys we still have a negative outlook, but there has been progress in terms of Fitch and S&P.
There is a degree of confidence that has been percolating through as far as the Sri Lankan economy is concerned, but were still on a journey. Im not for a moment saying that weve cracked it, far from it.
As far as growth is concerned it is more muted than wed like it to be. We end the year with a little fewer than 4% growth. In our view, the potential growth rate is about 5.75%. So there is an output gap that we feel needs to be addressed.
He said the thing that has to be avoided at all costs was to try to boost the growth rate by loosening macroeconomic policy in inappropriate ways, and this was something the country has done again and again in the past.
However this time we are determined that we will not go for this sugar-high in terms of not artificially boosting the growth rate through inappropriate macroeconomic policy. Sri Lanka, if one were to categorize it in the post-1977 years, has been a high budget deficit, high inflation, high nominal interest rate, overvalued exchange rate economy which is diametrically the opposite of the successful countries of East and Southeast Asia, the governor added. The government is seriously considering strengthening the fiscal responsibility management act as it sets targets for the budget deficit and for the debt as a percent of GDP figures..
We had an increase in the trade deficit despite a noteworthy turnaround in export performance. Youd have seen the papers today screaming headlines: a record in exports in 2017. I dont think theres much to be proud of in this achievement, because we are still way down as far as exports are concerned, but we are on our way up.
He identified the current Trade policy as the jewel in the crown. If were able to complete the FTA and trade negotiations with India, China, Singapore, the country will be the only country in the world with preferential access there three nations.

Sri Lanka start as  favourites in Plate  quarters vs Kenya
Sri Lanka have entered the Plate tournament after finishing third in Group D behind Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their opponents will be a Kenyan side who are winless after the group stage. The teams will face off at Lincoln No.3 on Tuesday 23 January.
Sri Lanka started with a good win against Ireland before defeats to Pakistan and Afghanistan ended their hopes of qualifying for the Super League. However, they were competitive in those losses and had their chances to win both games. They will feel confident of getting back to winning ways against the Kenyans.
Kenya has struggled so far in the tournament. They managed to keep wickets intact in their first two matches but they didnt find run-scoring easy, succumbing to a 169-run defeat to South Africa and 243-run loss to New Zealand. They havent managed to score their runs at a rate of more than four an over in their three matches to date, and in their final group game they were bowled out for 96 by West Indies.
The best Sri Lanka have ever fared at the ICC U19 CWC was in 2000, when they lost to India in the final in Colombo. Thereafter, they have reached the semi-finals in 2010 and 2016. Between 1998 and 2018, Kenya have played 19 matches at the ICC U19 CWC, winning five and losing 14. They have a win/lose ratio of 0.357. These two teams have never met in the ICC U19 CWC before this match.

Sri Lankan merchandise exports  top record US$11.4 bn in 2017
Lankan merchandise exports have grown up to an all time record of over US$11.4bn in 2017, surpassing the previous high of US$11.1bn achieved in 2014.
Once, again the EU and the USA were our biggest markets taking US$3bn each. The sectors showing particularly strong year-on-year growth were tea ~20% and fisheries 40%. Tea benefited from higher prices and enhanced access to Middle Eastern markets, particularly, Iran. Fisheries benefited from both the lifting of the EU ban in June 2016 and the GSP+ concession in May 2017. Apparel which accounts for over 40% of all goods exports and employs over 300,000 people directly, mostly women, recorded a modest 2% growth over 2016. However it is encouraging that the past 4 months showed 10% year-on-year growth as new orders from the EU were secured due to the GSP+ benefit of 12% duty exemption. 2018 is expected to be a strong year for the apparel manufacturers. Services exports comprising ICT/BPM, logistics, financial services and construction contributed an additional $3.7 bn of exports, an increase of 8% compared to 2016.
The growth in services in 2017 was significant compared to the year 2016 where ICT/BPM grew at 7.7% and logistics at 5%. Furthermore, ICT/BPM companies are expected to show a double digit growth next year with the budget support for IT SMEs to be executed in 2018, while benefiting from grant schemes for innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition the 40% foreign ownership restriction will be removed from freight forwarding to facilitate investment into the sector. The Export Development Board (EDB), under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, is Sri Lankas apex organisation for the promotion and development of exports. Commenting on the landmark 2017 performance, EDB Chairperson, Indira Malwatte said, Our export results are particularly noteworthy given the global trading environment.
Our peer nations have experienced material declines in trade in the past year, while Sri Lanka has maintained growth. This is a testament to the tenacity of our exporters and the relentless enhancement of their value proposition to customers.

SriLankan achieves highest ever monthly revenue in Dec.
SriLankan Airlines achieved the highest ever monthly revenue in company history in December 2017.
The air-transport operation of the Company recorded stand-alone revenue of US Dollar 100.1 million  the first instance in the 38-year history of the airline where monthly operating revenue reached this landmark figure.
The airline attributes the increase in revenue to its expanded network and continuous improvement in revenue management processes.A total of 566,627 passengers were carried during the month, a 27% increase over December 2016 and recorded a Passenger Load Factor of 85.9% - above that of most major airlines in the world. Cargo carriage too witnessed a significant growth, rising 23% year-over-year to 12,016 metric tonnes.
The airlines newly launched route to Melbourne, Australia, was a resounding success  achieving a Passenger Load Factor of 92.4% - and recording a significant overall profit during the month. This makes Melbourne the first long-haul route launch of the airline in recent years to reach profitability in such a short period.
The airline also recorded a successful month in terms of operational efficiency, recording an average aircraft utilization of 13.8 hours per day. The wide-bodied fleet of Airbus A330 aircraft achieved an average daily utilization of 15.2 hours  with industry leading reliability.
The airlines strategy of re-fleeting with fuel-efficient single aisle aircraft paid off, with its five-strong fleet of Airbus A320neo family aircraft helping to combat rising fuel costs. Two days of un-forecast fog in the Gulf were the only blight on the month, leading to several delays due to aircraft diversions.
The Companys subsidiary and business units  including SriLankan Catering and Ground Handling  too recorded a stellar performance, comfortably exceeding their revenue and profitability in comparison to the prior year.
The Ground Handling division did particularly well, both financially and operationally, despite have to cope with record numbers of passengers, congested facilities at BIA and unusually high disruptions due to inclement weather.
The Company recorded a net positive result for the montheven after interest costs, with an un-auditednet profit of USD3.0 million. However, the management stresses that this positive result is only a beginning,especially considering the fact that oil prices have increased by over 25% compared to December 2016.
The fuel cost which accounted for 25% of the total operating expenditure a year ago, has risen to 31% whilst the ticket price (yield) has barely increased due to fierce competition and persistent over capacity, ills which are affecting most airlines.
Accordingly, much hard work remains to be done in order to drive the airline into sustainable year-round profitability.
In line with this goal, the airline is currently developing the next phase of its restructuring and operational overhaul strategy.

By the end of the program students will be able to independently create their own computer games, learning tools and digital stories. They will progress on to designing their own mobile apps and smart devices. During this learning process, students will cultivate their creativity and imagination while also developing important life skills in the form of team work, critical thinking, public speaking and problem solving.
All programs will be conducted by Create Lab. They are Singapores leading coding, robotics and design school with collaborations with the Government of Singapore, Google, Softbank and NUS Enterprise.
The curriculums are developed by academics from Oxford, MIT and Singapore leading universities and include the latest educational technologies, tools and teaching methodologies. The students who follow Create Labs program at St. Josephs College will have the same learning experiences and certifications as their students in Singapore.
The age of the fourth industrial revolution will be an era driven by technology and smart systems, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and big data. In an increasingly digitalized world, the skills that will determine success will be the ability to imagine, create, empathize and solve problems.
Coding skills are a powerful tool that can stimulate and bring forth these already existing abilities within children. Coding helps children improve their analytical thinking and help them look at the bigger picture, said Create Labs CEO, Thilan Wickramasinghe.
We are very proud to part of this initiative by St. Josephs College. We are looking forward to helping raise a generation of Josephians who will be empowered to become the digital leaders of tomorrow, he added.

True colours
He never had a moments regret for what he did in the World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka. He never anticipated all the ramifications, though, and his actions caused him difficulties that seemed to go on and on. But the hardest moral questions were hard precisely for that reason. One could never anticipate all the consequences, never feel fully happy or comfortable with yourself. Yet if he had his time over, he would hope he would act the same way again, stated Adam Gilchrist in his book True Colours.
Australia was drawn to play Sri Lanka while India, the next highest qualifier, got Kenya. The match was in Port Elizabeth, where they sneaked home against England and New Zealand. The St Georges Park wicket was usually uneven, and favored spin more than express pace, although quicks Brett Lee, Andy Bichel and Shane Bond all took five-wicket hauls there during the tournament. If the Lankans could have chosen anywhere in South Africa to play us, it would be there reminisces, says Gilchrist.
Ricky Ponting won the toss, and he walked out with Haydos thinking, Test Match, Test Match. He did not want to come out blazing. They didnt need to score 300. On that wicket the key was to make a solid start, then keep Murali out and attack the other bowlers later. Their job was to get through the first overs without losing wickets. He let a few go from Vaas - still thinking Test match, Test match - but to show the limitations of those plans, when Guneratne bowled some loose ones in the second over he hit a four and a six.
Haydos came down the wicket. Did you pre-plan that
No, I had no idea, Gilchrist said. He was just watching the ball. But I couldnt worry about breaking the plan. He was seeing it well, and felt good. His way had always been to let his instincts go first and not ask too many whys and wherefores.
After five overs, they had thirty-five on the score board. Gilly was up to 22 and Jayasuriya then brought Aravinda de Silva on to bowl as his hitting had brought the Lankans plans to use their spinners. He pushed the first ball to cover. Aravindas second was a flighted one, and Gilly went down to sweep it behind square leg. He got a thick loud bottom edge. It went in to his front pad, just above the ankle. He heard cries of Catch it! Catch it! And turned around to see Kumar Sangakkara with the ball in his gloves. Well thats that, he thought.
But Rudi Koertzen at the bowlers end shook his head, Not out.
Gilchrist noted that he felt strange, so much discontent about umpiring, video decisions, and trust between players had been bubbling away in the back of his mind when he saw Rudi shaking his head and Gilly heard an emphatic voice in him.
Go. Walk.
So he walked. At first he was not feeling anything but annoyance that when he was going so well, hed got out. And this was the main thing, wasnt it Hed made a mistake, he was out.
But the moment turned surreal mused Gilchrist. The crowd cheered him off, mainly the Sri Lankan supporters who were happy that he was out. There were other voices in his head too, telling him he was crazy, he was defying all cricketers did, and he was throwing the World Cup away. (In this day and age if something of that sort happened the batsman would rub his chest and shake his head, its a pity that this pristine game has become so putrid). Gilly was dumbstruck; could he rewind the last minute Could he go back No. The dominant was like a school teacher, calling the others to order and reassuring him that he had done the right thing.
As soon as he got into the changing room he took his gear off, grabbed a drink and went into the viewing room with the boys.
The rule of these moments in life was always that you dont know how big it was until you see others react. And it wasnt good. Someone asked if he had seen Rudi shake his head and say not out. He thought most of them thought or hoped that he simply had not seen Rudi.
Yes, he said. He saw him.
Gilchrist recalls that he suddenly felt very lonely, knowing how his walking was going to look to the others. Why then Why in a World Cup semifinal Why did he do something to appease his conscience, when the whole teams fate hung in the balance
A few minutes later Ricky got out for two. They were 2 for 37. He unpadded, then, when he came to the viewing room, asked him if hed seen Rudi given him not out.
Gilly told Ponting he had, and went on and stated that the implications of what he had done would play out over the next hours, days and even the years.
When they walked out he had a nice acknowledgement from Rudi. He was worried that hed embarrassed him. He applauded me. Later after the game, he said congratulations. It took a lot to do what you did and wed all be better off if there was more of it.
Fortunately, Sri Lanka never got close. Their opening bowlers broke through and Bic (Bichel) threw down the stumps on a pick-up-turn-and-throw to run out Aravinda in his last international innings. A great batsman gone. Bic then bowled four maidens in a row. Sri Lanka was 7 for 123 when a thunderstorm hit and they were pronounced winners. They celebrated for hours since they were in the World Cup final, concluded Adam Gilchrist.

The Unemployed Graduates called off the protest staged opposite the Fort Railway Station last morning, subsequent to meeting with Additional Secretary to the President Sunanda Kariapperuma.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Convener of the Combined Association of Unemployed Graduates Tenne Gnananda Thera said they had staged the protest last morning due to the failure of the government to provide a solution to their unemployment issues over the past six years.
The government has still not provided us jobs. Its been over five months since the applications for development officers was called, but still there is no solution. Further, despite the Education Minister stating that there are vacancies in the teaching profession, these unemployed graduates are not recruited to these positions and there is no proper mechanism to address this issue. There is no point in having discussed this matter with any of the officials as our problem is still stagnating without a viable solution, he said.
However, they called off the protest launched yesterday after they held a discussion with the Additional Secretary to the President as he had assured them that he would do everything in his power to arrange a meeting with the President.
We asked for a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss this matter. There is no point in discussing it with other officials as there is no positive outcome despite the discussions. Therefore, we want a meeting with the President so that we could speak to him regarding our grievances and see a viable solution.
However, despite the assurance given by the Additional Secretary, we are not convinced that our request will be granted, he said, adding that in the event they are not granted a meeting with the President, the unemployed graduates would stage a sathyagraha campaign in Colombo, demanding their rights.

US embassy to open in Jerusalem by end of 2019

The US will open its embassy in Jerusalem by the end of 2019, US Vice President Mike Pence said Monday in Israel's parliament, confirming that the controversial move is speeding up after officials earlier said it could take three to four years.
Pence told Israeli lawmakers that Jerusalem was "the capital of the state of Israel," reiterating President Donald Trump's change of policy last month.
At the same time, Trumpannounced plans to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city, upending seven decades of US policy.
Both Israelis and Palestinians consider Jerusalem as their capital, and Pence's address is likely to further rattle the Muslim world.
"In the weeks ahead, our administration will advance its plan to open the United States Embassy in Jerusalem -- and that United States Embassy will open before the end of next year," he said, to rounds of applause.
"I am here to convey a simple message from the hearts of the American people -- America stands with Israel."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heaped praise on Pence, thanking him and Trump for their support.
"The United States has no greater friend than Israel. And Israel has no greater friend than the United States of America," he said.
But not everyone in the Knesset was happy to see Pence. Arab lawmakers staged a protest at the start of his speech and scuffled with security officials before walking out.
One of the lawmakers, Ayman Odeh, called Pence on Twitter"a dangerous racistwhose whole reason for being here is in order to damage any chance of peace."
'A new era'
In comments earlier Monday at the Prime Minister's office, Pence had said that the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital did not mean the US was abandoning the peace process.
"(I am) hopeful that we are at the dawn of a new era, of renewed discussions to achieve a peaceful resolution to the decades-long conflict that has affected this region," he said, later adding that the US was still open to a two-state solution if both Israelis and Palestinians agreed to it.
The US' recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has prompted concerns that it could derail any attempts to restart a peace process, and cast further doubt on the likelihood of any two-state solution being reached.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbashas repeatedly condemned and rejected Trump's decision, saying, among other things, that it would aid extremist organizations to wage holy wars.
The United States Congress in 1995 passed a law requiring the US to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But all US presidents before Trump have resisted acting on the law, signing a waiver in the national interest.
Iran nuclear deal a 'disaster'
Pence, an evangelical Christian, also used his moment in the Knesset to criticize Iran for being what he called the leading sponsor of terrorism, while also peppering his remarks with passionate biblical references and highlighting Christianity's roots in the region.
He lambasted the 2015 Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration, which has seen the country restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions.
"The Iran nuclear deal is a disaster, and the United States will no longer certify this ill-conceived agreement," Pence said.
"Earlier this month, the President waived sanctions on Iran to give the Congress and our European allies time to pass stronger measures. But as President Trump made clear, this is the last time," he said, adding that the US was working on other ways to curb Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
The US president must sign waivers and certify the deal every few months.
Trump signed off on a sanctions waiver earlier this month, essentially keeping the nuclear deal intact, but he has in the past chosen to not certify it, a decision that could lead to new US sanctions on the country.

Weah sworn in as  Liberian President
Monrovia: Former international football star George Weah was sworn in as Liberia's new president on Monday, in the country's first transition between democratically-elected leaders since 1944.
Weah, 51, took over from Nobel laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who spent 12 years at the helm, steering the West African nation away from the trauma of a civil war.
He was sworn in as president by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Francis Korkpor.
The ceremony took place at a packed sports stadium near the capital, Monrovia, with several African heads of state in attendance, along with friends and former colleagues from Weah's football years.
Crowds queued for kilometres (miles) to reach the stadium, singing, dancing and waving the Liberian flag as they waited.
Weah has vowed to make prosperity and job creation the hallmarks of his presidency. Liberia is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking a mere 177th on the 188 countries in the Human Development Index compiled by the UN Development Programme. AFP

Welikada Prison  riot in 2012
The Welikada prison riot in 2012 killed around 20 inmates leaving more than 15 injured, yet no concrete action has been taken yet, despite a lapse of six years. The relevant authorities are yet to take action against the perpetrators who were involved in the mass killing.
Around 27 inmates at the Welikada prison were reported to have been killed by the Special Task Force (STF) following what was reported as a search operation leading to a riot.
Based on testimony of eyewitnesses, the STF had entered the premises of prison with firearms and had insisted that this was an order from a higher official attached to the Defence Ministry.
Eye witnesses had heard screams of those being assaulted and later shot to death.
On November 9, 2012, the Special Task Forces (STF) had forcefully entered the prison, shut down the power supply and killed those inmates. The atrocious task was carried out forgetting that even the prisoners are human beings.
Around 10 PM, some of the prisoners were engaged in a protest insisting the authorities to meet some of their demands. This cannot be considered as a reason that instigated the riot. In the meantime, Special Task Force (STF) of the Police had entered the prison to conduct a search operation. It was reported on the following day that the riot occurred as the prisoners attacked the Police officers who were returning after conducting the search operation. However, the riot took place for few hours. The prisoners started shouting and screaming as they were not aware of what was happening inside the prison. Some prisoners even tried to break the walls and get out of the prison while some others using phones illegally, called their relatives and informed them about the incident.
One of the prisoners who was sentenced to death and submitted a petition had informed that STF was engaged in targeted killing of prisoners. The riot came to an end only after the STF officials left the prison premises.
The committee that was appointed to investigate over the incident revealed that it was a very well planned massacre targeted on prisoners. It was reported that the prison turned into an unsafe place for the prisoners only after the STF of the Police entered the premises. The report further said that C. W. Kodipelli Indika who was the Commissioner General of the Prisons, when the riot occurred and Former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake had failed to do their duties properly and the riot occurred as a result of their carelessness.
Even though the reason for the riot was not clearly stated by the committee appointed, it emphasized that the STF of the Police carried it out following an order given by a former senior official in the Ministry of Defense. The doubt over whether the STF shot the prisoners or the prisoners shot each other has been resolved through the report. Among the prisoners who were shot, some were sentenced to death penalty. The list includes KaluThushara, Thotalaga Kapila, Dolphin Chaminda, Kiribathgoda Susantha, Konda Amila, Maharagama Chaminda and 20 more underworld criminals who were killed. Another 14 were injured. When the light came on after the forces left, the dead bodies of prisoners were seen all over. There were firearms near their dead bodies to show that they died after they shot each other. But, only the dead would know who killed them.
The eye witnesses said that they heard some screaming out the names of the underworld criminals who were killed. They further said that after calling out names and killing one group, the murderers had gone to every other prison, called out names and shot them dead.
It was revealed that one of the officials attached to the STF had provided the details of the prisoners who were shot to a former senior official in the Ministry of Defence. It was further revealed that one of the main motives of the riot was to murder the criminal who was imprisoned for stealing the sword from the National Museum.
It was also reported that the prisoners attacked the Police when they returned after conducting a special operation. But there was no evidence to prove that the prisoners had firm arms or weapons in possession.
A Police investigation was launched immediately and it was carried out under the former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake. Even though nearly 20 prisoners were murdered, no comprehensive investigation was conducted and the Police did not provide adequate evidence to find the individuals who were involved in the riots.
During the same period, many other mysterious murders also happened and some people who were murdered mysteriously are Wasim Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickramathunga. The investigations pertaining to all these murders were also conducted by Anura Senanayake.
After the present government came into power, families of those killed witnesses, concerned lawyers and activists raised their voices seeking justice. Under the present government, an investigation has been launched on Senanayake. The investigation started with his statement being taken down. The Narahenpita Police OIC in his statement alleged to have revealed details of the murder of Wasim Thajudeen and this resulted in the arrest of Anura Senanayake. Sometimes, the Police change the directions of a case adhering to an order given by a higher official. They would be in trouble if they fail to do so.
Criminal Investigation Department has completed their investigation on the prison attack. It was alleged that the riot took place with the aim of killing the underground criminals. Even though the CID is aware of the people who were involved in the mass killing, the prosecution is being delayed due to difficulties in collecting evidence.

Woman dies in accident, ex-Judge arrested
A retired Judge, Nimal Nambuwasam, who had knocked down a woman motorcyclist, has been remanded until January 23.
The motorcyclist had died on the spot.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Wariyapola Police OIC CI Nilantha Bandara said the 35-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter had been travelling on a small motorcycle when the accident occurred. The impact of the crash had caused severe damage to the womans head and body. One of her legs had detached from the body and was found a few metres from the body. The motorcycle had also broken in two due to the impact, he said.
The Judge was found to have been under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident, according to the doctors.
The incident occurred on January 20 afternoon when the Judge and his wife were returning after attending a wedding in Thambuttegama.
The daughter of the woman, who had also sustained severe injuries during the crash, is receiving treatment at the Kurunegala hospital.
According to the Wariyapola Police OIC, the accident had taken place when the Judge who was driving his car, had tried to overtake another vehicle.

Bangladesh One-day Tri-Series
Zimbabwe  need batsmen  to stand up
DHAKA, Monday: Two matches. Two bonus-point wins - Bangladesh have by far looked the best side in the ongoing tri-series. Their performances have ensured they've set one foot on the final and the hosts will look to seal that when they take on Zimbabwe in the fifth match of the series today.
Even though Zimbabwe were brushed aside in the first match of the series - by Bangladesh by eight wickets - the hosts will know the visitors have improved since that game and the second bout will throw up more challenges. Having said that, Mashrafe Mortaza and his band of boys have been clinical and will be more than confident of toppling any challenge that comes their way.
Shakib Al Hasan being promoted to No. 3 in the batting order seems a well thought out move, giving their best player enough chances to create an impact in the game. Bangladesh have almost immediately benefited from the move as Shakib has struck 37 and 67 in the two matches apart from picking up six wickets.
In the first game, Zimbabwe could manage just 170 but they came up with a much-improved performance in the next game, scoring 290 against Sri Lanka. The fragility of their batting came back to haunt them as they were knocked over for 198 in their third game. With the loss, they also missed a chance to knock Sri Lanka out of the contention to reach the final.
Zimbabwe now won't want to leave too late, or their fate, hanging on other results. If they win the contest against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka will have to win and win by a big margin against Bangladesh in the final game of the series to reach the final. For that, Zimbabwe need their batsmen to stand up.
The onus will be on Brendan Taylor, Hamilton Masakadza and Sikandar Raza but it's equally crucial that the other batsmen find a way to bat around them. A score on the board will give the bowlers the much-needed cushion they need but with Bangladesh in top form, they'll at least 30-40 more runs from the par score.
Bangladesh have found the perfect rhythm ahead of the final and it won't be easy for Zimbabwe to stop them. However, the last thing you want to do in cricket is predict a result.

Abuse of authority during elections a violation of fundamental rights
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), issuing directives to public officers on the Local Authorities Election  2018, said abuse of authority and use of powers in a politically-partial manner, result in violation of fundamental rights, yesterday.
HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama, issuing a press release, said the Commission would take steps to monitor the conduct of public officers in order to ensure that the forthcoming election is conducted freely and fairly. The release said the non-implementation of the law or the permitting of some political parties and groups to use public property and resources in violation of the law, is a violation of fundamental rights.
In addition to state responsibility, officers responsible for such action/inaction would be held personally responsible for violations, it added. The right to vote has been declared a fundamental right by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. When an election takes place, all public officers are bound to ensure that the election takes place in conformity with the Constitution and prevailing laws. Public officers should conduct their official duties in compliance with such laws and act impartially, the release added.
The objective of the directives is to make public officers aware of the protection of fundamental rights during the election.
The HRCSL has sent these directives to all Ministries and Chief Secretaries of all Provincial Councils. The directives were also sent to Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, and the Election Commission, the statement said.

Darkest Hour
There are transformations and then there is Gary Oldmans Churchill in Joe Wrights Darkest Hour. The actor endured five hours in the makeup chair daily to transform into the rotund politician who rescued Britain from WWII. With the semi-retired makeup legend Kazuhiro Tsuji behind the making of the mask, Oldman worked intimately to disappear into the role. On set, nobody met Gary Oldman for months. And, he says, it gave him a new appreciation for the British politician who strove to bring an end to WWII.
When the news breaks that Joe Wright is doing a Churchill movie, and that hes cast you as Churchill, its hard not to double-take. What was your first reaction
I think my reaction was much the same as yours. Most of the work that Ive done over the years, Ive hardly ever chased. Im at the mercy of the industry, and youre beholden to the imaginations of the people that are casting the roles. A Churchill project came my way in 2014, and my reaction was, Dont be utterly ridiculous. It was never in my consciousness, even. You could see yourself playing Lear, maybe, down the road. Lear can be different things to different people. But when you start with the robust silhouette of a man like Churchill, with the big jowls and the double chin, its hard to see that.

Governments have fallen sans public support at referendums
There are instances both locally and internationally, where governments that failed to gain public support at referendums, were toppled, said MP Dullas Alahapperuma, addressing a meeting held in Naimana on Sunday night.
He added, If the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) wins a majority of Sri Lankas 341 LG institutions, we too have a chance of coming back to power.
The meeting was held at the Naimana Community Center, in support of the candidature of SLPPs Dasanayake Jayawickrema and Attorney-at-Law Danesha Liyanage, for the Matara Pradeshiya Sabha.
It was 10 months ago that British Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party, was forced to resign when his party failed to gain public support in favour of the referendum held to decide whether Britain should remain in the European Union (EU), or not (Brexit). In Sri Lanka, it was a Presidential Election that was held on January 8, 2015, but after President Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in at 4.42 pm on January 9, 2015, he appointed United National Partys Ranil Wickremesinghe as the new Prime Minister at 4.55 pm. At the time, the UNP held only 46 seats in Parliament.
In accordance to our constitution, a new Prime Minister could be appointed only after the demise of the incumbent PM or on his resignation or if the Parliament rejects the statement of policy or Appropriation Bill, passes a vote of no confidence or he ceases to be a member of Parliament.
Nothing of the aforementioned took place, and the reason given for the appointment was that the people had rejected the government through their vote. Therefore, if the forthcoming LG poll is considered as a referendum at which the people reject the present government, then, the same principle should apply.
Members of Parliament for the Matara district, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Kanchana Wijesekera, Niroshan Premarathne, and Provincial Councilor Aruna Gunerathne, also addressed the gathering.

According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, the School Canteen Policy declared through the relevant circular, is not being implemented properly at schools. Due to this situation, junk food is available at school canteens, and such food make schoolchildren ill. He was addressing the award presentation held in Colombo, recently, for the winners of competitions conducted to mark World Diabetes Day  2017.
Minister Dr. Senaratne added that food with excessive amounts of sugar, salt, and fat, should not be given to schoolchildren. Such food promotes Non-Communicable diseases (NCDs). The School Canteen Policy and the relevant circular clearly states which food should be offered to schoolchildren.
NCD-prevention centers would be established in all State schools as soon as possible in order to protect schoolchildren from NCDs. It is easy to educate children than adults. Adults have various beliefs in them, he added.

Present good governance government has undertaken yeoman service for the public during the last three years. Hence, the UNP would win the upcoming local government elections, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare said recently.
Addressing an election rally at Matale Hilton colony to support UNP candidates contesting the Matale Pradeshiya Sabha, he said that when the present government came into power, a large foreign debt had been left behind by the previous regime. So, the Yahapalana government had to face a heavy foreign debt. But the government has taken every possible step to settle the debt successfully without any burden being passed onto the public.
Not only that, international communities were against Sri Lanka during the Rajapaksa regime. The present government has made efforts to reverse that situation. As the result, all international communities are standing with us now. Meanwhile, they have extended their full support to the Sri Lanka government, he said.
Now development activities are continuing with the help of international aid and people would reap the benefits shortly, he added.
Candidates of local government polls for Matale Pradeshiya Sabha, Gamini Costa, Indika Dias Hewavitharana, G. Kadigawa, Sepalika Perera and M. Muththaiya participated at the rally.

The honour for this accomplishment should go to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, for the decision to increase womens representation in governance was taken on a proposal made by the Prime Minister, the Minister said.
He said under the new electoral system, 25 percent representation by women would be mandatory in all local government institutions.
The Minister said during the last Presidential election, the UNP was able to win the Kandy electorate despite the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and four Provincial Ministers and all Pradeshiya Sabhas in Central Province supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This showed that the UNP was destined to win all local councils in Kandy at the forthcoming elections.

## Title: Unnecessary furor on sale of liquor to women

Unnecessary furor on sale of liquor to women
On 10 January 2018, the Minister of Finance and Mass Media amended Excise Notification No.666 of December 31, 1979. It is widely believed that by this act the Minister revoked a prohibition on the sale of liquor to women. The President and the cabinet responded by asking for the amendments to be reversed.
This reversal is widely believed to have reinstated the previous prohibition on women purchasing liquor. Verit Research finds both these views to be poorly informed. The Notification that the Minister amended lists categories of persons to whom liquor cannot be sold or given.
This includes for example: a member of the Police Force or Officer of the Excise Department while on duty; any person under 21 years of age; and a woman within the premises of a tavern.
The Ministers intervention through Excise Notification No. 02/2018 only removed the restriction on women being sold or given liquor within the premises of a tavern. That was the only consequence it had on womens ability to purchase liquor. The Excise Ordinance of 1912 does not define the term tavern.
Blacks Law Dictionary defines a tavern as a place of entertainment[or] a house for the retailing of liquors to be drunk on the spot. Sri Lankas excise licensing regime has over 20 types of licences that are issued for the manufacture and sale of liquor.
This regime includes licences for retail shops, licences for bars, licences for hotels, licences for rest houses, and licences for the consumption of liquor on the premises in which it is sold. There are only two types of licences for taverns: licences for toddy taverns and for foreign liquor taverns.
Such taverns appear to be a rarity in Sri Lanka, and it is likely that new licences for taverns may have long ceased. In fact, the Excise Department does not list a prescribed application scheme for either of these tavern licences. By contrast, it lists an application scheme number for every other form of licence.
Excise Notification No. 1004 of December 11, 2017, lists the schedule of fees for liquor-related licences. It lists the fees for 40 types of liquor licences  including hotel licences, rest house licences and retail licences. Licences for taverns are not among this list. Therefore, the licencing regime for taverns lack both an application scheme and a corresponding licence fee. By Notification 02/2018, the Minister only set aside a previous restriction on the sale of liquor to women inside a tavern. This restriction has no implication on the purchase of liquor almost anywhere else, which is almost everywhere that liquor is sold.
This begs the question as to why there has been a wide-ranging perception that the sale of liquor to women is restricted at establishments that are not taverns. Past discussions in the press suggest that some sections of the Excise Department have promoted the view that the terminology of taverns (in the law) is applicable more generally to any retail outlet that sells liquor (e.g. supermarkets).
This view, however, appears to be untenable in law. In conclusion, the foregoing analysis reveals that, contrary to popular understanding, the cabinet decision on January 16, 2018, to reverse the Ministers original amendment has no implication on the freedom of women to purchase liquor from retail shops and supermarkets.
Excise Notification No. 04/2018 issued by the Minister of Finance re-imposed the same restriction on women that was previously removed  this is prima facie inconsistent with article 12 of the Constitution. However, even if the Supreme Court does not declare it unconstitutional, the Notification will only re-impose the restriction on women purchasing liquor inside a tavern.

Last year (2017), a total of 137,000 Sri Lankans had died from Non Communicable Diseases, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the number of NCD deaths had been reveled through 2017 health statistics. NCDs have become a challenge for Sri Lanka and most of the NCDs are caused due to lack of exercises and unhealthy life style. He was addressing the gathering after launching Life TV Channel, the National Health Channel in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that a social dialogue should be commenced on the prevailing NCDs condition in the country. NCDs are rapidly increasing in the country. A lot of steps had been taken to tackle the issue. A total of 1,000 state hospitals will be included in the e-Health Programme by 2020.
Accurate health information should be communicated to the public. Complaints had been received on overdosing certain injections given to gain fair skin. Some creams available to apply on skin contain mercury which is cancerous. Such treatment should be properly managed and accurate information should be communicated to the public. The launch of this channel was planned several years ago, he added. SPMC Chairman Dr. Sayura Samarasundara and many other Consultant doctors were present during the launch.

Ocean brings unknown wealth and potential. It is evident that 95 % of the underwater remains unexplored. The ocean is also the largest habitat for marine life with more than three billion people depending on it as a primary source of protein.
The ocean becomes the focus of attention in the field of development and sustainable development both nationally and internationally. The world is, in many ways, a turning point in your economic priorities in the ocean.
Indian Ocean, which has been nourished for thousands of years by many rivers and tributaries, contains large quantities of commercially exploitable hydro carbons; gas and oil, and seabed minerals in addition to a rich diversity of living resources such as fish and exotic marine life.

Athiyasayaraj Davidson is Indias  own version of Lasith Malinga
Very few bowlers have been able to make an impact in the game of cricketwith their unconventional bowling actions. Different bowling action, when incorporated with magnificent line and length, becomes a deadly composition making it difficult for the batsman to play the bowler.
One such bowler is Sri Lankan cricketer Lasith Malinga has made the toe-crushing yorker a phenomenon in the game. Now, India have its own Lasith Malinga, who has a similar slinger action.
Former India cricketer-turned commentator Aakash Chopra took to his official Twitter handle to upload a video of Athiyasayaraj Davidson of Tamil Nadu bowling in the similar fashion and captioned: "Meet The Indian Lasith Malinga...#Davidson #DELvTN#Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy#IPL."
Davidson, who is playing in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, has already participated in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) and shot to limelight with his maiden T20 season. Chopra was quick enough to notice his action and uploaded a video on social media. Davidson started his career with the Globe Trotters in 2015 but TNPL proved to be his launch pad.
Davidson had taken 15 wickets during the 2017 TNPL where he represented Albert Tuti Patriots.
The 25-year-old pacer has taken 10 wickets in five T20 League South Zone matches, including a five-for against Karnataka.
The youngster has played six T20s, wherein he bagged 10 wickets. He is one of the many players like T Natarajan and Murugan Ashwin who found recognition courtesy TNPL.

Aussies to tackle predatory Barrier Reef starfish
AUSTRALIA: A multimillion-dollar campaign to stop the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish devouring the Great Barrier Reef was announced by the Australian government on Monday in a push to preserve the World Heritage-listed ecosystem. The coral-eating starfish are naturally occurring but have proliferated due to pollution and agricultural run-off at the struggling reef.
Their impact has been profound -- a major study of the 2,300-kilometre (1,400-mile) long reefs health in 2012 showed coral cover has halved over the past 27 years, with 42 percent of the damage attributed to the pest.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Aud$60 million (US$48 million) would go into the new drive, with just over half to be spent on incentives for farmers to prevent agricultural pollutants from running into the reef.
Funds will also go towards increasing the number of patrol vessels and divers targeting the starfish, he said.
It is a vibrant, resilient ecosystem and one of the best-managed coral reef ecosystems in the world, Turnbull said in a statement.
While it is facing increasing threats, we intend to remain leaders in reef management, he said, adding the fund would support the development of new technology to help protect the reef.
The reef is also reeling from significant coral bleaching due to warming sea temperatures linked to climate change.
Canberra in 2015 narrowly avoided UNESCO putting the site on its endangered list, and has committed more than Aus$2.0 billion to preserve it over the next decade.
But it has been criticised for backing a huge US$16 billion coal project by Indian mining giant Adani near the reef, which environmentalists warned would harm the natural wonder.
Conservationists said Monday the governments latest funding announcement did not go far enough and action is needed to slash greenhouse gas emissions to prevent warming sea temperatures.
It will be a classic case of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic unless the federal government moves quickly away from coal and other fossil fuels, Imogen Zethoven from the Australian marine conservation society said in a statement. - AFP

BCCSL went bankrupt during  Rajapaksa regime  Patali
It is the Rajapaksa regime which had driven the profit earning Board Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) to bankruptcy, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Addressing an election propaganda meeting in Colombo Central, Minister Ranawaka said Mahinda Rajapaksa built an International Conference Hall in Hambantota named after him spending Rs 863 million and it was unable to pay even its water and electricity bills because not a single international conference had been staged there ever since.
It was public money that was being used to pay up its taxes today. Ranawaka said Rajapaksas eyes grew large on seeing the Kettarama R. Premadasa Stadium, Minister Ranawaka said.
He (Rajapaksa) tried to match it by building an International Cricket Stadium in Sooriyawewa by utilising Rs.6000 million belonging to the SLPA, the Minister said. This had made the Colombo Port Bankrupt, Minister Ranawaka said. The stadium had staged only three international matches so far. The BCCSL which was a financially strong institution in the world of cricket suffered bankruptcy due to the crime committed by erecting the Sooriyawewa stadium to perpetuate the Rajapaksa name, he said.
The BIA, Katunayake Airport is a busy airport, particularly at night, with more than 200 inbound and out bound flights daily. Due to overcrowding there was a proposal in 2009 to build a second runway. Instead of building the second runway there the Rajapaksa regime built an Airport in Mattala which is almost in an abandoned state without regular flights servicing it. More than that, the SriLankan Airlines had become a financial loss due to mismanagement during the Rajapaksa regime, Minister Ranawaka alleged.
The Colombo Port was capable of handling a maximum of 6 million TEUs. As such it needed another Western and Eastern Terminal. Instead of building them the Rajapaksa regime built a Port in Hambantota which was rarely serviced by ships, Minister Ranawaka said. Each member of the countrys population today had to pocket out Rs.2000 to maintain the Hambantota Port. The present government did not believe in building unwanted edifices to establish a personality cult in this country. It wants to create development schemes which catered to the needs of the people. A fine example was the Rajagiriya Flyover which services 164,000 vehicles daily, Minister Ranawaka added.

Commercial Bank achieves another first on LankaPay network
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has announced that it has enabled its entire automated teller machine (ATM) network to acquire and process ATM transactions through the EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) integrated circuit, becoming the first ATM Network to be fully EMV compliant in Sri Lanka.
Commercial Bank is also the first bank in Sri Lanka to activate its entire EMV chip card base(Debit and Credit cards) to perform secured EMV transactions through the LankaPay ATM network, making it possible for the Banks own cardholders to securely perform transactions using other bank ATMs connected through the LankaPay network.
EMV is a secured platform to perform ATM and Point-of-Sale (POS) transactions where transaction authentication is performed through the integrated chip, preventing counterfeiting of card data residing in the chip.
Commercial Bank is focussed on technological innovations that deliver meaningful benefits to customers, said Jegan Durairatnam, Managing Director of Commercial Bank. These latest developments are noteworthy because they address a primary concern on transaction security. We have once again demonstrated Commercial Banks superiority in the IT and digital landscape by validating our entire ATM network for EMV compliance on the LankaPay platform.
The Commercial Bank ATM network was already EMV - certified with international card schemes such as MasterCard, Visa and Union Pay.
Durairatnam said the wide spread of Commercial Banks ATM network, currently numbering 756 terminals, and the availability of ATMs at many off-site locations and public locations such as bus stands and railway stations, makes its integration with LankaPay particularly beneficial to the general public.
LankaPay is owned by LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd. which was incorporated in February 2002 as the National Cheque Clearing House, and is today considered the National Payment Infrastructure Provider for the country.
Commercial Bank achieved another first with LankaClear two years ago when it made it possible for users of the Banks Online Banking facility to make instant, real-time transfers of funds from their Commercial Bank accounts to accounts in other banks, via the LankaPay - Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS).
Commercial Bank ATMs support the networks of Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, Visa, Plus, Amex, UnionPay, Discover and Diners Club, enabling tourists and other visitors to Sri Lanka to withdraw money from their overseas issued cards for spending in the country.
The upgrade of the ATM network to EMV Chip capability means that every Commercial Bank ATM accepts and processes transactions based on Smart Card Integrated Circuit (IC) data as well as magnetic strip data.

For the first time Sail Lanka Charter, one of Sri Lanka's leading yacht charter operators has introduced Delft Island Delft, the largest of the islands off the coast of Jaffna tours.
The cruises start from jetty at Kurikadduwan situated on the island of Punguduthivu which is the furthest island connected to the Jaffna peninsula by a causeway and is an hour's drive from Jaffna town.
We begin the journey from Kurikadduwan and go to Nagadeepa and then to Delft, Kakarativu, Annalativu and Iranativu. The day cruises, the overnight cruise to Delft, the two and three-nighters with a limited number of islands and the six-nighter where we take the guests all the way to Mannar and Talaimannar, are increasing in popularity, and encouraging us to expand our fleet in the north, said Vice President of Sail Lanka Charter, Gowrie Ponniah.
With permission from the Navy, we can take our guest's upto Adam's Bridge - the sand bank between Sri Lanka and India which we approach on a dinghy because the water is so shallow. As an option, we also organise a land tour of the Jaffna district, but with most of the guests, once they get on the boat, they don't want to get off.
After pioneering the whale watching in Mirissa, the founder of the company, Pierre Pringiers always wanted to make Sri Lanka the hub for yacht construction and yacht ownership and yacht chartering in the region, and to maximise the socio-economic benefits to the country by creating Sail Lanka Charter and the local yacht building yards, mini marinas and a training centre for all the skills required.
Jaffna was the last destination because we have boats going out from Mirissa in the south, Beruwala in the west, and Trincomalee and Pasikudah in the east. The north of Sri Lanka is the only part of the country that has a number of islands which are totally suitable for sailing tourism and he felt that there was also something he could do to redevelop the post-war economy and bring a new type of tourism to the north.
Beyond the tourism sector, our yachts offer an amazing experience and a new way for resident Sri Lankans and Sri Lankans residing overseas, to rediscover the country.
The unique hybrid, sail and engine powered catamaran yachts, cabin cruisers and day-cruisers are completely designed and built in Sri Lanka. With comfortable accommodation for eight passengers in four double-cabins and two double-crew quarters, each cabin has a western-style bathroom with toilet, shower and wash basin.
The boats are equipped to provide the guests with freshly cooked food from the galley kitchen. Solar panels provide the 220V power for the galley refrigerators, lighting, WiFi, music system and water de-salinator. All yachts have a living cum dining area on the lower deck.

Digitization of SL Customs  to happen this year - DG
In keeping with the governments vision for a digital economy and the World Customs Organization mandate, a series of plans will be implemented in 2018 to digitize the Sri Lanka Customs, Director General of Customs P.M.S. Charles, said yesterday.
As a part of the move towards paperless trade, Sri Lanka Customs will implement the use of digital signature from February 1, 2018, DG Charles said. The introduction of an e-signature will be a giant leap in improving Sri Lankas trade dynamics.
Responding to the Daily News, DG Charles further said that plans are afoot to implement an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) at the Sri Lanka Customs that will standardize its international trade performances. The EDI is an electronic interchange of business information platform which promotes paperless business communication.
She also noted that SL Customs has already introduced the online payment system 24/7.
We are moving towards paperless office and pre-arrival documents. We are also in the process of developing the National Single Window, Trade Information Portal and the trade facilitation unit. There are a series of plans to be implemented this year to uplift the standards of the services provided by SL Customs, she further added.
DG Charles made these observations while inspecting an event held to destroy counterfeit and pirated goods, at the SL Customs, Orugodawatta, yesterday.

Dilapidated road  to Siyambalewa
In the village of Siyambalewa, in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat, lives a man named A. H. Kapuwa. The road to his village is an arduous one and filled with potholes making travel extremely difficult.The slightest of rains turns these potholes to ponds and this has been the road he has taken home for many years now.
Very few politicians or government officials however paid heed to the problems of these villagers and their road, thus Kapuwa fed up with official apathy, decided to take things into his own hands.
A. H. Kapuwa who is fixing the Siyambalewa road full of potholes on his own.
I am 60 years old now. And instead of just sitting around at home, I thought I would do something good and earn some merit in my golden years, he said.
It has been two years since he started work and for two years he has been fixing the big as well as small potholes on the road.
I dont have vehicles or backhoe machines to do this, so I fill up my wheel barrow with soil and use my shovel to cover up the holes. Thus far I have filled 2km of this Siyambalewa road. I have a few more kilometres to go. I plan to complete it during my leisure hours", he said further.
School children, monks, those who set off for government jobs and pregnant women use this road. But this road is no longer in a state useful to anyone. The massive potholes on the road are used as ponds and children play with paper boats in them. At the same time, when it is the dry season, the whole area is filled with dust.
So I thought that when I had some time, I would fill these holes up. My wife too helps me out when she has time. They are cutting a canal in front of our house, I use the soil from that. I dont mind the heat too much and my time is now mostly spent covering this holes, said Kapuwa.
A. H. Sirimalatha (59), wife of A. H. Kapuwa helping him to fill the road.
His wife A. H. Sirimalatha (59) stands with Kapuwa and helps out in every possible way,
My husband engages in repairing the roads and filling the potholes whenever he has time. The villagers often say that there is no need to do all this as the road will be carpeted. But for more than four years we have been told that that the road will be carpeted and that it would be done very soon but we have not seen any initiatives being taken towards that, she said.
The government buses that run on this road have also resorted to taking alternative routes as the road is severely dilapidated.
Only after my husband repaired the roads that the buses are taking the normal route and travel passing our house, she added.
The vehicles cannot travel smoothly because of deep potholes and hitting a pothole with the vehicle can cause a great deal of damage to the vehicle,
So, I too help my husband to move the soil to the road. We do whatever possible to earn some merit. If we take a pregnant woman on this road, I am sure she would deliver the baby on the way. We have almost finished the repairs on the road. As we have filled the potholes using soil, the vehicles are able to travel smoothly, she said.
Kapuwas determination to finish the road is fuelled by his desire to complete the job and his strength which motivates him to do it. During election times, as officials visit every home promising a better future and local government, he has shown that one man alone can change things, with a wheelbarrow in one hand and a shovel in the other.
Kapuwa busy repairing the Siyambalewa road.
Vehicles are able to travel on Siyambalewa road once again because of Kapuwa's efforts in filling the potholes.

The Kalpitiya Regional Office of the Palmyrah Development Board (PDB) has already handed over about 10,000 palmyrah seeds to the Wanatavilluwa Pradeshiya Sabha to start a nursery.
This novel method will be an environment-friendly and natural way of protecting rural villages from wild elephants which are destroying crops and houses and are a danger to villagers in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the NWP.

Filling stations barred from selling Lanka Kerosene in bulk
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation issued an order to all filling stations and distribution agents prohibiting them from selling Lanka Kerosene to vehicles, factories, bowsers in bulk to containers and barrels.
The order has been issued under a circular signed by Corporation Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga.
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry in a press release issued in this regard, said there are two varieties of kerosene available in the market. They are Lanka Kerosene and industrial kerosene. Lanka Kerosene is sold for ordinary use under the government subsidy targeting low-income families and fisheries community.
Lanka Kerosene is red in colour and the industrial kerosene is colourless. The corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 30 on each litre of Lanka Kerosene sold to low-income families and the fishery community at a subsidised rate.
The sale of Lanka Kerosene in 2017 had sharply increased compared to the sales in 2016.
This was because certain filling station owners sold the subsidised Lanka Kerosene in large quantities to other users including business ventures and factories with the intention of making huge profits. Lanka Kerosene was also being used in buses and bowsers by mixing it with diesel. But such activities were illegal. If filling stations were found guilty of resorting to this illegal racket, their agencies would be cancelled.
Business establishments and factories should be supplied with industrial kerosene only. The sale of Lanka Kerosene to petrol and diesel vehicles was also illegal. If any filling station was found guilty of mixing kerosene with diesel with the objective of earning excessive profits, their licences would also be cancelled, the Corporation Chairman had said in his circular to all CEPETCO dealers.

Former England captain  Armfield dies, aged 82
London: Former England captain and Blackpool legend Jimmy Armfield has died at the age of 82 after a long battle with cancer.
Armfield, who played 627 matches in 17 years for his only club and was part of the World Cup-winning squad in 1966, was diagnosed with cancer for a second time last year.
"Blackpool Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of its record appearance holder and vice-president Jimmy Armfield at the age of 82," said a statement from the club. Armfield captained Blackpool for more than 10 of his 17 years at the club and was capped 43 times for England, with 15 of those occasions as skipper.
He was one of two Blackpool players along with Alan Ball named in England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, although injury denied him an appearance at the tournament. Only players who were on the pitch in the final received winners' medals but that was rectified 43 years later when Armfield eventually received his medal.
Armfield had stints in management with Bolton and Leeds before moving into broadcasting where he spent more than 30 years working for the BBC. He was inducted into Blackpool's Hall of Fame in 2006 and Bloomfield Road's newly constructed South Stand was named in his honour in 2010. In a statement to the Blackpool Gazette, Armfield's family said he had "passed away peacefully surrounded by his immediate family." "Jimmy had two great loves, first and foremost was his family, to which he was devoted and loved dearly.
The other was football, especially Blackpool, England and his colleagues at the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association)," it added. AFP

Tomorrow would be a decisive day, because the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) would take a decision on today at 4.00 pm to launch an island-wide strike, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday evening, he said the GMOA would launch an island-wide strike without prior notice, if the Health Minister attempts to sabotage Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Election which is to be held between January 23 and 24. At the moment, he is trying his best to prevent the victory of the GMOA representatives.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the SLMC and the Health Ministry (MOH) would present their stand on SAITM to the Supreme Court during the final hearings of SAITM case scheduled for today and tomorrow. The GMOA would launch an island-wide strike without prior notice if the stand is pro-SAITM.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said it was revealed that the SLMC is going to present illegal documents without the signature of its Registar, to the Supreme Court, stating that it is their stand. If this happens, it would be a pure violation of the Medical Ordinance.
The Health Minister and his two teams which contest for the SLMC Election, are trying their best to prevent doctors from voting. They are threatening them using social media, by not granting duty leave, organizing several hidden voting centers, and not giving parking facilities, The GMOA would take legal action against such persons through the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) and the police, he added.

Mandy Teefey addressed the rumours of a supposed feud between her and the 25-year-old singer, after she and husband Brian Teefey stopped managing Selenas career in 2014.
Every mother and daughter has disagreements, Mandy told Gossip Cop. We never expected to manage her her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business. It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.
However, there is one issue that seems to be causing concern with Mandy, and thats Selenas rekindled romance with troublemaker boyfriend Justin, 23.
She admits she is not happy with the reunion, but added: Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy.
Asked if she was concerned about the relationships effect on her daughters health, Mandy replied: She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed.
Selena is an adult and can make her own choices, she insisted.
Mandy also praised her daughter after she underwent a secret kidney transplant last year, following her battle with lupus.
Describing Selena as brave and fearless, she added: I was so proud of her bravery.
The singers close friend Francia Raisa offered to donate her organ, and Mandy said the family was beyond blessed that we had Francia in our life,, and recalled she was a wreck during the time of the operation.She joked: I am pretty sure I am banned from that hospital (now). Music News

Great countries  need great schools
The College of S. Thomas the Apostle will be completing 100 years at Mt. Lavinia, in 2018. Much has been written on the history of the school, its illustrious products and the events around the centenary celebration. The purpose of this short piece is to look at a few other angles.
STC is not the only old school in this country. There are many lesser known entities. STC is blessed with four campuses located in Mount Lavinia, Colpetty, Gurutalawa and Bandarawela governed by one Board. Its uniquely placed to provide opportunities for education to children across many walks of life and regions.
Achieving greatness 

A former Warden Puddyfoot captured the nuances of how school could really be great. He spoke about, A school achieves greatness by responding imaginatively and creatively to the challenges posed by the world in which it exists and the world in which its pupils will live their lives. Great schools tend to have well-entrenched traditions, and those traditions can both underpin future progress and obstruct it, depending on how we deal with them.
Schools must filter what is already known in order to present pupils with what is of permanent value in both their own traditions and the worlds vast knowledge, while also anticipating what will be of value in worlds which do not yet exist.
Of course, there will never be universal agreement about what is of permanent value, and such differences help to define different cultures and different value-systems, even different schools, but there can be little doubt  I at least have no doubt  the schools betray the trust bestowed upon them when they prepare children for a world already gone rather than a world yet to be. Their pupils will need to live their lives solving new problems, not regurgitating solutions to old ones, however useful that may be in some circumstances. Schools should therefore aspire to an embodied intelligence: an institutionally realised and established capacity to use what is already known in order to solve the problems of the unknown.
In a great school, everyone is a learner and everyone a teacher; all are engaged in exploration of the vast possibilities of life; all relish the challenges presented by new problems; all are at their best when the going is toughest and the tough can really, get going. Great schools do not narrowly predetermine their measures of success: they do not praise only those who are academically gifted; they do not despair of those who struggle; above all, they never give up on any child under any circumstances, and see children who give up on themselves as a measure of the schools failure, not the childs.
These are very valuable thoughts. STC has undeniably been privileged and it is for that reason it must continue ceaselessly look for avenues to serve the larger populace and society in Sri Lanka. Its not my intention to catalogue the list of public figures, products of the school who have led the country. I rather show how some continued to serve the less privileged giving them equal access to opportunities for their well being.
Examples of illustrious products 

Prof. Dayantha Wijeyesekera, an academic and civil engineer left school after his O/Ls. Proceeded to Maradana Technical College and went onto earn two PhDs. A remarkable achievement. His entire working career has been for public service.
He was the first Vice chancellor of Open University of Sri Lanka in 1983. He later served as Chairman, Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC). In 2011, he was named chancellor of the University of Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC). He has spent considerable time maximizing opportunities for less fortunate students to access higher education.
His efforts were taken to its next level by equally well known old boy, Rajiva Wijesinha the son of an illustrious Thomian Sam Wijesinha. He enabled his Minister to present a Cabinet in 2016 which recognizes National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) for Employment Opportunities.
The Cabinet of Ministers decided at its meeting held in June 2016 to consider the completion of NVQ level 3 and NVQ level 4 as equal to passing the G.C.E. (O/L) and G.C.E.(A/L) examinations respectively, at the instances where the requirement of NVQ level 3 or NVQ level 4 along with the G.C.E. (O/L) or G.C.E. (A/L) has been included in Service Minutes and Schemes of Recruitments as professional and educational qualifications for recruitment to posts in technological and technical sectors. It opens pathways to higher education, employment and income to scores of youth male and female in this country.
Thomians can take pride and justifiably say, Esto Perpetua (be thou forever), when we collectively continue to deploy all our strengths for the greater good of the majority who do not access to the wealth of opportunities we possess as STC.

For the first time eight ornamental Nepenthes Bandura hybrid starter plants have been introduced in Sri Lanka. These eight varities have been named as Lady Luck, Bill Bailry, Binky, Crimson Kiss, Mimis Kiss, Queen Malani Suki and Susan. One variety has been named as Queen Malani as a tribute to Sri Lankan screen queen Malani Fonseka.
There are around 120 Nepenthes verities in the world and around 2000 ornamental Nepenthes hybrids have been introduced to the world. Borneo Exotics (Pvt) Limited Managing Director Robert Centley said that they have been engaged in experimenting with Nepenthes hybrids for around two decades and have come up with about 200 new varieties. Eight of these new varieties have become top sellers. The company hopes to introduce and popularize them among the public. Those who are interested in growing the Nepenthes hybrid verities can purchase them from the nurseries in Lindula from January 20 to February 28. The varieties will no longer be on sale after this period.
Sri Lanka has one Nepenthes variety which is endemic to the country. This rare breed grows in Sinharaja.

I am against corruption - President
President Maithripala Sirisena requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to support him to bring culprits of the bond issue to book.
He was addressing a United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) rally in Kandy on Tuesday.
The President said those members of the G L Peiris party were saying that the scam has happened from 2015 to 2016, but he knew what those members did then and asked the Premier and his party members not to weaken him in the move to take measures against those who had misappropriated public money.
President Sirisena said the G L Peiris party members should not forget that the Supreme Court judges had clearly stated in the report that the fraud had been committed since 2008. He said that a forensic and audit reports had been called for this reason. He said what is needed at the moment was to punish all those involved in the racket.
The President said it was fair to follow lions rather than leading a pack of dogs. He said all who defrauded public money should be penalised.
That money should have been used to facilitate the poor. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had requested people to join him as the government and opposition has proved a failure, he himself had failed at three occasions, the President said.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa held the Presidential Election two years earlier since he failed to run the economy. He lost the election and the August election as well, President Sirisena said.
The people supported me against the corruption and I won on January 8, the President said.
President Sirisena said Mahinda Rajapaksa did not vote for the no faith motion against Ravi Karunanayake brought by the Joint Opposition, but he congratulated Ravi when he won it.

If words  were  weapons
Growth is a slow and steady word for Sri Lankas literary landscape. Sri Lankan writers  more without than within the country  are now making their presence known. Chandani Lokuge, among them, has earned a brand name as an academic as well as literary editor. The works of Chandani Lokuge, a professor in Literary Studies and Creative Writing at Monash University, Australia, have now been republished the Australian Scholarly Publishing (ASP), an established Australian publishing house.
ASP values its independence and adds a strong general cultural dimension to its list. Nick Walker, its publisher, offers an explanation about Lokuges works: Australias literary heritage is British in its foundation, but it has also been uniquely colonial and, more recently, indigenous and creatively regional in its evolution. Our Arcadia fiction seeks to reflect thisas indeed, to our delight, does Chandani Lokuge in her elegant, evocative writing.
Reprinted and republished
ASP published Lokuges last novel, Softly, As I Leave You, republished by Perera-Hussein, Colombo, to be awarded the Godage National Literary Award for Best Book. The publishing house also reprinted Lokuges earlier work If The Moon Smiled and Turtle Nest that were originally published by Penguin Australia and reprinted by Penguin India. The French translation of Turtle Nest was published by Paris publisher, Aux forges de Vulcain.
For her postgraduate research, Chandani Lokuge studied three eminent literary figures: Leonard Woolf, James Goonewardene and Punyakante Wijenaike.
I researched these three writers for my MA degree as far back as 1985-1987. Im honoured to note that it was the first MA in English Literature that was conferred by Peradeniya University. The contribution of these three writers to the cannon of Sri Lankan fiction written in English is invaluable. Since completing my MA, my own evaluations of their writing have of course evolved.
Lokuge now considers Leonard Woolfs A Village in the Jungle more critically. The colonial civil servant was able to project an insiders view of that particular dry zonal village and develop the readers empathy for his protagonists. All the same his perspective is decidedly imperialist despite his claim to be anti-imperialist.
British colonisers
As we know, both James Goonewardene and Punyakante Wijenaike commenced writing following Independence, when Sri Lanka was trying to rejuvenate the Sinhala identity, language and culture that had been brutally submerged by the British colonisers.
Goonewardenes A Quiet Place and Call of the Kirala, and Wijenaikes Waiting Earth tends (at times rather desperately) to evoke village identities and ambience, Lokuge adds. While Goonewardenes portrayal of village life is rather distanced as it is conveyed from the point of view of his city-bred characters who escape into the villages, Wijenaikes fiction is more deeply embedded in village life and character. Their later fiction is much more complex and offers, Lokuge believes, a more realistic portrayal of Sri Lankan milieu and character as does more contemporary fiction written in English in Sri Lanka. Set in Colombo, and dealing with a medical doctor, Goonewardenes The Awakening of Dr Kirthi would be a case in point.
Chandani Lokuges current research interest is in South Asian, particularly Sri Lankan, diasporic literatures. In 2016, in line with these interests, she founded a new multidisciplinary Humanities project, South Asian Diaspora International Researchers Network (SADIRN) at Monash University. It is supported by the Monash Faculty of Arts and affiliated to Monash Asia Institute. South Asia comprises a rich mosaic of cultures each of which is represented globally by its diaspora - Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. SADIRN is an effort to cluster these diasporic research communities to promote and disseminate collaborative research within and beyond the network.
Research community
Our call for membership registration received an overwhelming response  over 135 researchers ranging from senior scholars to postgraduates have registered as members already  showing the significance of this kind of initiative  and how SADRIN may fill a serious gap in our Humanities research community.
South Asian Diaspora Literary Studies is a challenging and evolving field. The ways in which the diaspora responds to the host and home countries, the ways in which they tread the fine line between them, provide unending challenges for the writer and the critic.
Im happy to note that the two earlier novels, both of which embrace the Sri Lankan-Australian experience, have just been reprinted and are now available in book and e-book formats. That shows the demand for South Asian diaspora literature in Australia and beyond. In literary criticism, I have recently edited with Janet Wilson, a special issue of the Journal of Postcolonial Writing (Routledge) with a special focus on Asian Australian Writing. The fact that this particular journal has been selected by Routledge to be published as a book of essays entitled Mediating Literary Borders: Asian Australian Writing confirms the significance of the field to global literary audiences.
These books include several essays on Sri Lankan diasporic writers as for example, Yasmine Gooneratne, Chandani Lokuge, Michelle de Kretser and Channa Wickremesekere.
Fiction elements
Fiction and non-fiction run on different tracks. But non-fiction such as autobiography can contain some elements of fiction.
I think that all writing genres, even history, are creative (not necessarily fictional) in the ways in which the author embeds their own personality and perspectives in the documentation of factual material. Autobiography seamlessly integrates the private and deeply personal self (aute), and the documentary of the authors life (biog). Autobiography is thus a reflection of and meditation on the more public life that is being recorded. Fictional autobiographies tend of course to use fiction deliberately to fill in the gaps in the authors recollections of life experiences.
Professor Lokuge also founded and directed the Monash Centre for Postcolonial Writing.
When I took up employment at Monash, I realised that there was huge potential to develop a hub in postcolonial studies that could be centred at Monash. I founded the Centre in 2002 and directed it until 2012. During this time, the Centre hosted several luminaries and public intellectuals of the postcolonial world including Yasmine Gooneratne and Bill Ashcroft who launched the Centre, Homi Bhabha (Harvard), Robert Young (NYU), Harish Trivedi (Delhi), and writers such as, Kim Scott, Robert Drewe, and Janette Turner Hospital. Several international festivals/conferences were also organized, among highlights, Litfest that was included in the 150th celebrations of the State Library of Victoria, and academic conference jointly organized with Calcutta University. I then branched out from the postcolonial into my current interest in South Asian diaspora studies and founded SADIRN.

From inept  handyman to dandy  candy-man!
How unkind can some people get Many insist I am hardly accomplished at carrying out the most simplest of chores. They even go to the extent of calling me domestically disabled. They aim for humour by portraying me as a hopeless and helpless goof.
Things got so bad that I decided to seek professional help, although of a different sort than is usually suggested to me. Nuts to you, I told them while elaborating that they could go and do what the monkey did with nuts. In my estimation anyone who goes to a psychiatrist should have his head examined.
I harboured an ambition to be an artist once. But I could never draw. I mean I could not even manage a straight line even with the help of a foot-ruler. You see the line becomes terribly slanted. Okay if I had the slightest talent to draw I would have made a career of being an editorial cartoonist and drawn funny caricatures of certain crooked politicians, tycoons, bureaucrats and policemen.
And I would have made a montage of them in a sort of rogues gallery. And I would not have given a tinkers cuss if they had sued me because I would have told the entire shebang: If the face suits you then slap it on! But I still have not given up hope of becoming a modern artist at least. All you have to do is to splash paint on a canvas, then wipe it off with a cloth and sell the cloth.
All right then, it is an empirical fact that I cannot sing either. If I ever had to sing for my supper I would be a starving scarecrow. Or come to think of it listeners may have paid me more than a superstars fee to put a brake on my vocal chords. The truth is I cant even rap. If I did my audience would not clap they would slap!
It is not that my voice is all that bad. It is rather attractive for an accomplished presenter. But the problem is that I cannot carry a tune in a bucket. So for a long time I have had the good sense not to sing in public. I save my singing voice for solo performances in the shower.
The family maintains that the neighbours inquire politely if our pet Labrador Retriever, Flash, who is usually quiet, has suddenly taken to baying out loud. Very funny! Well let me tell you for the last time, if I am going to sing like everyone else, then I dont need to sing at all.
Again I concede I am a mutt at Mathematics. I get half scared to death when totting up numbing numerals. You could actually call me mathophobic. I could never have attempted a financial job if my life depended on it. I always considered mathematics a devilishly daft subject.
So I thought why the heck should I have to follow a darn stupid formula Pure mathematics, my foot! My kind of maths is of the most impure kind because I spew out the most profane oaths when confronted with counting my change. Anyway why bother when you can always use a calculator to tot things up. You may have surmised by now that I am not really much good at anything.
According to my detractors I am a total failure as a handyman too. Home improvement, I concede, can be a nightmare for me. They say I could not knock in a straight nail. So I tell them to get an experienced carpenter to really nail it, if you dont want me screwing everything up.
If only they would pass me a hammer I would show them how an ugly human head could be nailed into a wall with the same dexterity as fixing an animal trophy. They also claim I am the most feared cook East of Killinochchi. They maintain I cannot fix anything. Not even a slap-up dinner. Some ungrateful guests have spread a malicious rumour that with my cooking it does not do any good to invite people over for dinner.
They say I have to ask my friend the High Court Judge next door to send out warrants. It is small consolation when they concede that I am a hospitable host. But not when they elaborate on the reason that nobody ever leaves my kitchen hungry. Nauseated yes, but never hungry, they say. And the worst crack about my culinary achievements is that when I go into the kitchen the onions start to cry.
They also claim my chillie omelettes are dynamite. When they hit your stomach they explode on impact. Imagine, when the parish priest came over for dinner the other night he said grace. When he had completed his thanksgiving speech my sister couldnt resist the crack: My brothers cooking is so bad that we usually pray after we eat. As if on cue granddaughter Keshi 17 and going on 25 quipped: My dada has a black belt in cooking. One chop and you are dead!
Do not ask me why but when my car or anyone elses vehicle breaks down I am constrained to look under the hood. I would not notice if the problem had to do with the radiator or accelerator. Still hand me a hammer and a pair of giant tongs and I will handle it as a make or break emergency. I have nothing to lose either way.
As you can see, Im artistically, culinarily, vocally, musically, mathematically and mechanically impaired. But it could be worse. So instead of trying to be the all-round handyman I decided that it would be far safer and practical playing popular candy-man.
I was asked to take charge of my little grandson Kingco for an entire day. He actually loves my food. Actually he thinks a combination of waffles and ice cream is the greatest culinary invention of all time. But I took him over to the old Victoria Meda-Midula and asked him to finish up his hot dogs before he tucked into his sweets. I bought him a pack of delicious candy bars for dessert.
He could not resist and kept unwrapping them one after the other. I left him for a while on a park bench while talking to an old acquaintance. He was munching what must have been his fifth delectable strawberry morsel when a man came across from the opposite bench and said: Hey, eating all those sweets is not good for you young man. It will give you tummy aches, blacken your teeth, and make you fat. Little Kingco replied: No probs, mate! My great-grandfather lived to be 102 years old.
The man asked, Did your great-grandfather eat six candy bars at a time
Kingco coolly answered: No, he minded his own darned business!

Inflation down to 7.3% in December
Issuing National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) for December 2017, Director General of Census and Statistics Dr. Amara Satharasinghe said that the year-on-year inflation based on NCPI has declined to 7.3% from 8.4% in November 2017.
Before inflation decreased to 7.3% in December 2017, over 8.0% inflation was reported for three months (November, October, September of 2017) consecutively. Contributions to the inflation in December 2017 from food group and non-food group are 5.7% and 1.6% respectively, whilst contributions of these two groups to the inflation in December 2016 were 1.0% and 3.2% respectively, resulting in headline inflation of 4.2%, which reflect comparatively lower food prices particularly prices of coconuts and vegetables, in December 2016.
However, when compared to month-on-month changes, NCPI in December2017 has increased to 126.6 from 126.4 reported in November 2017. This shows an increase of 0.2 index points or 0.2 percentage points in December 2017 as compared to November 2017. This month-on-month change was due to the increases of expenditure value of food items by 0.12% and non-food items by 0.03% respectively.
The increase in expenditure value of food items was due to the price increases of vegetables, fresh fish, red onions, coconuts, papaw, eggs, coconut oil and tea dust. However, decreases in expenditure value in index were reported for rice, green chilies, banana, mysore dhal, potatoes, limes and dried fish.
The increase in expenditure value of non-food items in December 2017 compared to the previous month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of Transport and Clothing and Footwear.
Further, the groups of Furnishing, Household equipment and Routine household maintenance, Restaurant and Hotels and Miscellaneous Goods and Services recorded very slight expenditure value increases compared to the preceding month.
The expenditure value of Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other fuels, Health, Communication, Recreation and Culture and Education groups remained unchanged during the month.

IPL 2018 from April 7 In Mumbai
The 11th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be held from April 7 to May 27, the IPL governing council announced on Monday.
The opening ceremony, opening game and the final will all be held in Mumbai on April 6, April 7 and May 27 respectively.
Accepting broadcaster Star Sports' request, the IPL governing council has also allowed a shift in timings of the matches. The 8 pm game will now begin at 7 pm while the 4 pm start has now been pushed to 5:30 pm. "The broadcaster has requested for change in timings. By and large the GC has accepted it. It gets too late in the night if the game starts at 8pm," said IPL Chairman Rajeev Shukla after the GC meeting.
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, also a GC member, could not attend the meeting.
"As far as the double headers on weekends are concerned. The 4pm game will now be played at 5.30pm. There will be an overlap but the broadcaster says it has enough channels to show the games simultaneously," Shukla said further. At the meeting, it was also decided that Kings XI Punjab will play four of their home games in Mohali and three in Indore. The home matches of Rajasthan Royals, who are returning to IPL after serving a two-year ban, will be finalised after the Rajasthan High Court's hearing on January 24. "The matter is in court. I think on 24th (Wednesday), the court may dispose off the matter. We are waiting for that. Preference will given to Jaipur if the stadium is ready and court clears RCA's status. If that doesn't happen, the alternate venue will be Pune," said Shukla. - PTI

Lest history repeats
With a three-way race for the local government polls well underway, actually a five-party race if one considers the official opposition JVP and the TNA as well, President Sirisena at a political rally late last week in Kosgama, called on the people to prevent a return to the past. He urged the people to not leave room for the return of white vans, fear, humiliation and ethnic disharmony.
When Sri Lanka was fast becoming a near pariah state on the world stage and where rampant corruption by the kith and kin of the ruling elite was the order of the day. He urged people to use their vote wisely to prevent a return to such a past.
Rajapaksas have neveradmitted error 
In the course of the campaign for the LG elections, in the run up to the same and before then, the Rajapaksas nor their surrogates the SLPP or their allies in the Joint Opposition (JO) have never acknowledged the errors, faults and shortcomings of the Rajapaksa Administration, especially during its second term. There has been no regret mentioned at all for sacking a Chief Justice, jailing a presidential election opponent, victimizing the war time Army Commander, permitting newspaper editors to be murdered in broad daylight, seeing mosques burnt and Muslim businesses attacked, appalling human rights violations, economic mismanagement, taking on crippling debt and rampant corruption. While it should be conceded that in our cultural ethos, at least for a majority of people, the concept of repentance saying mea culpa or my fault is alien and a loss of face, a candid acknowledgement of error and a commitment to a new path is not politically uncommon and is actually required.
When the SLFP in 1994, returned from a seventeen-year political wilderness in the opposition, under the leadership of Chandrika Kumaratunga, there was a clear break from the disastrous and failed socialist policies of the 1970-77 period and commitment to a managed free market economy.
The UNP has radically moved away from its disastrous approach to ethnic relations which witnessed the fiasco of the District Development Council (DDC) elections of 1982, the resultant burning of the Jaffna public library and the 1983 anti-Tamil riots under their watch. Even the JVP, counter ideologically has renounced armed revolution, which it had twice waged both in 1971 and 1988/89 as a means of bringing in socialism and most crucially for national reconciliation and social cohesion, the TNA used the destruction of the LTTEs entire senior military leadership to renounce both separatism and the armed struggle, committing instead to a robust democratic political engagement with the Sinhala polity.
In contrast, the only political force to have expressed no regrets, remorse or a commitment to a political course correction are the Rajapaksas, their fellow travellers of the Joint Opposition and their political surrogates in the SLPP.
The Rajapaksa political project seems intent on taking Sri Lanka back to a darker past, the contours of which we can all remember and President Sirisena urges us never to return to.
A serious Rajapaksa return will require a reexamination of what went wrong, especially in its second term, candidly admitting the same and committing very publicly to never repeat its dark, disastrous and corrupt track record. Paradoxically it may require a new, younger generation leadership, like young Namal to be the standard bearer for the kurakkan shawl rather than either brother number one or brother number two (no pun intended).
Where is Gotabhaya 
The issue of succession within the Rajapaksa family is the issue which clearly remains unresolved, demonstrated most recently by the departure from Sri Lanka of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and his decision to sit out the LG election in the United States. His political organisation Eliya and its associates have become totally silent and are not active in support of the SLPP pohottuwa.
The Rajapaksa top echelon has divergent interests, which work against a quick return to power. Mahinda is constitutionally barred from seeking election as president, son Namal requires time to build himself up as a national leader with broad acceptance, Basil has too many political enemies from his decade as Mahindas political hitman and henchman and Gotabhaya is a polarizing figure, with no experience in politics, a military mindset unsuited to democratic governance together with a complete lack of understanding that compromise can lead to consensus and is anathema to the Muslims who comprise 10% of the electorate.
These are significant drawbacks, not helped in any way that their political allies are mono ethnically Sinhala only and comprise such political lightweights as Dinesh Gunawardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Tissa Vitharana, Udaya Gamanpila and Wimal Weerawansa, all leaders of very small political parties, which all except the last, being only capable of electing their leader and no one else to Parliament. One-man parties and the exception of the NFF with five MPs has been imploding of late, with cross overs to President Sirisenas SLFP.
From August 2015to February 2018 
The real story of February 2018 and how it differs from the general election of August 2015 is that overall the national vote but especially the UPFA vote will now be broken up between the SLFP led by President Sirisena and the SLPP led by the Rajapaksas.
The Rajapaksas SLPPs pohottuwa claims the opposition or political dissent space and the Sinhala nationalism political space, while President Sirisena has the SLFPs party machinery, the anti-corruption platform and the political moral high ground. Exactly how the UPFA / SLFP vote will split up and how much of the floating vote would swing towards President Sirisena remains to be seen. It is uncharted political territory and we shall know the answer soon enough on February 11th, when the election results are known. Either way as President Sirisena says, we must avoid a return to the past.

This is one founding principle of L.I.F.T, Sri Lankas premier fashion campus. Since its inception in the year 2000 the school has been recognized as one that leads the way in quality fashion design education in Sri Lanka.
In another pioneering venture L.I.F.T will launch Sri Lankas very first online fashion exhibition titled FASHION NOUVEAUin conjunction with the schools graduation ceremony to be held later this month.
The digital exhibition will be a real-time walk-through of an upscale, concise mix of carefully curated collections put together by outstanding students, and will range from haute couture to high street fashion.
The project uses state-of-the-art technology to allow viewers to explore fashion and discover the stories behind the clothes designed by students who have been nurtured by L.I.F.T.
To kick-off the initiative, the online exhibition will feature selected garments, a diversity of footwear and accessories and much more designed by students of L.I.F.T & ModArt International Sri Lanka. For the first time ever the exhibition will also feature a photography series of students from ModArt International Paris.
We are constantly exploring how new technologies can help bring the unrivalled fashion collection of our students to life online. Online visitors can now see the incredible detail of highlights from the campus collection, while discovering the tantalizing stories behind them in ways never experienced before. Through this revelatory online experience, we hope viewers will gain a greater understanding of the craftsmanship and design expertise that transforms fashionable clothing into pieces of art by our students, said L.I.F.Ts Managing Director, Niroshani Leanage.
The exhibition will be open to the public for viewing from January 18 to March 18, 2018. This will also be a great opportunity for potential students to view what L.I.F.T has to offer prior to applying for their first intake for the year which ends on January 31, 2018.
The exhibition is also targeted at fashion industry professionals to gauge the skill levels of L.I.F.Ts internationally trained graduates. L.I.F.T encourages all potential students and interested parties to visit their brand new website www.lift.lk to view the online exhibition or walk in to the school at No. 87 Horton Place, Colombo 07.

Make the CM pay
The despicable act of Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake in forcing a female school principal to kneel before him, as punishment for the latter's refusal to admit a child to a school, on the recommendation of the CM, has rightfully raised a public outcry, compelling the President to order the IGP to conduct a full investigation into the matter. The incident, once again, brings into the limelight the type of politician we have in our midst, who are called upon to preside over the destiny of the masses. The principal had initially denied the charge, apparently under pressure, but subsequently came out with the whole sordid tale in an emotion filled scene, as witnessed on television.
The Chief Minister, meanwhile, has resigned from the Education portfolio that has been attached to the string of other ministries held by him, until the conclusion of the investigation. It would have been the right thing for him to step down from the post of Chief Minister, itself, and, hopefully the President will insist that he does so, pending the outcome of the investigation, so that an impartial probe could be held. Holding the powerful post of CM while the inquiry is being conducted would naturally hamper a free and fair probe, with the police investigators naturally reluctant to go that extra mile to get to the bottom of the whole affair.
The CM's conduct, no doubt, is a reflection of the larger picture of national politics where individuals drunk with power not hesitating to stoop to any level to give vent to their bloated egos. Not many moons ago a similar incident took place under the former regime, when a Provincial Councillor from Wayamba got a lady schoolteacher to kneel before him for chastising the daughter of the PC. On that occasion the PC resigned from the Provincial Council but was replaced by his brother to fill the vacancy, showing the callous nature of the rulers of the day. What is more, it is reported that the selfsame PC has been presently appointed as an electoral organiser of the SLFP, in yet another instance of kid glove treatment given to politicians with muscle power, typical of the present day political scene.
It is also a reflection, that, in today's politics, if one wants to go places strong arm tactics would certainly pay. No wonder decent individuals today shun politics like the plague, not keen to be in the same company of individuals like the Uva Chief Minister.
Be that as it may, the treatment of a school principal, no less, in this callous manner by the CM goes to show the depths to which politicians have degenerated in the present day and age. In the past, it would have been unthinkable to have come across such an instance where a school principal would have been made to endure such an experience. Nothing less than a public apology from the Chief Minister to the principal concerned would suffice, in this instance. It would be interesting to see if the same individual will receive nominations to contest the next PC election too that is around the corner, if not being rewarded with a ticket to parliament on the National List.
However, judging by the good fortune of the former Wayamba Provincial Councillor who has been currently rewarded with an electoral organiser post, this is a distinct possibility. According to election monitor PAFFREL, today, some 20 percent of those nominated to contest the upcoming LG elections are drawn from the underworld, yet again proving to the hilt that crime pays in today's politics. All parties are guilty on this score. Like they say, in the past it was the politicians who employed the thugs to do the dirty work rewarding them lavishly. Now these baddies themselves have entered the scene querying why not do it ourselves. The scenes we have frequently come to witness in parliament bears testimony to this. Those who should be behind bars are today calling the shots, in the country's supreme legislature, maintained by the public purse.
This government came to power promising to usher in Yahapalanaya, or good governance. The conduct of the Uva CM certainly does not do any credit to the government's Yahapalanaya credentials. It is time that the rulers start cleaning up the Augean stables and rid politics of the unsavoury elements. Popularity alone should not be the sole criterion in picking up candidates to contest elections. If the trend continues all the elected bodies in the country will be full of thugs, misfits and undesirables. Today it is no exaggeration to say that our Provincial Councils and other LG bodies are packed with such elements. With the numbers increasing several fold under the new electoral system, things can only get worse. It is harrowing to contemplate that our Provincial Councils and Local bodies are the finishing school for these elements to enter parliament.
Let this investigation into the conduct of the Chief Minister not be another sham. All school principals and teachers, island-wide, should keep up the pressure to ensure that justice is done by their hapless colleague.

Norochcholai Coal Power Plant
Measures to address  environmental concerns
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), North Western Provincial Environmental Authority and Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited will sign an agreement on measures to address the environmental concerns at Norochcholai Coal Power Plant.
The agreement is comprised of an action plan with long term and short term solutions to environmental pollution from fly ash and coal dust at the Lakvijaya premises. The action plan was based on the final report of the expert committee appointed by PUCSL to look into the issue.
The committee was appointed following a fundamental rights petition filed by the EFL at the Supreme Court.
A senior PUCSL officer said the agreement was finalised last Thursday and it would be signed in a couple of weeks.
Several new machines are to be installed in the plant premises to control the coal dust. The CEB engineers working at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant wrote to the CEB General Manager last week on the health hazards and other difficulties faced by them due to fly ash and coal dust.
Power and Energy Ministry Media Spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardena, speaking on the measures proposed to address the environmental pollution concerns at the Norochcholai plant as per the action plan, said fly ash would shortly be used in cement manufacturing. He said the tender in this regard has already been awarded. A wind barrier will also be constructed at the site to reduce the wind speed. The Ministry is in the process of buying lands adjacent to the Norochcholai plant to increase the buffer zone and create a green belt in it by planting more trees.
The technical specification of coal procurement tender has also been modified to improve the size of coal particles. The improved standards have been communicated to the suppliers, he said.
Jayawardena said the renewal of Environment Protection License (EPL) of Norochcholai Power Plant was still pending, but added that applications for the purpose have already been sent to the North Western Provincial Environmental Authority.
Contacted by the Daily News, North Western Provincial Environmental Authority acting Director Saman Lenaduwa said the renewed EPL to the Norochcholai Power Plant would be issued shortly as the action plan is satisfactory.
In the wake of environmental pollution concerns at the Norochcholai Power Plant due to fly ash and coal dust, the Central Environmental Authority has also sought a report from its District Office to study the matter. The report was due from Puttalam Office yesterday.
CEA Director General Hemantha Jayasinghe said the CEA would take immediate action after studying the report. However, he pointed out the space for the CEA to intervene into the EPL issuance for the power plant is minimal due to the existence of provincial environmental authority.

Minister vows action against corrupt UNP candidates
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake warned all UNP candidates contesting the elections that in the event they are found guilty of corruption or fraud after the elections, action will be taken to initiate legal action against them and the party too would take disciplinary action against them.
The minister noted that the UNP has not fielded candidates who have committed offences such as having parties after raping women, tying government servants to trees, making teachers kneel before them, killing of foreigners and their fiances etc.
He made this statement addressing an election rally held in the Bodeniya area in Kotapola, Deniyaya.
The minister added: During the past three years we understood the value of the village government and that is the reason that the UNP was of the view that the LG elections should be held at the earliest. We wanted to hold the LG elections and expedite the governments development plan. We want to bring good administration to the village and we have put together a good team. We have not included thieves or corrupt candidates. We have included candidates who have taken on responsibility and worked for the villages heading various positions. They are good community workers, but we expect them to continue to work with dedication and honesty even after they win and are appointed as members of the relevant provincial councils.
Minister Ratnayake further said that having completed three years in governance, it certainly was not an easy journey. The country was dogged down by the debt burden and the cost of living had increased drastically. In the past, there was a trend of reducing the price of goods before the election but increasing it further after the elections. The people were being cheated. Development was also sub-standard where after some time these new constructions were crumbling. Luckily, this road had not been constructed by them. If it was, then, we would have had double work in having to first remove the old concrete before renovating the road. I witnessed the concreted Ketawala road where the concrete is coming off in chunks and the road is now impassable. This was the kind of development that was carried out by the previous regime. But for this sub-standard work, they had obtained colossal loans. Finally there are no roads, no ships in spite of a port and this is why the price of goods had to be increased in order to pay the loans that were obtained. When we came into power, we reduced the cost of living, but some ridiculed us saying that the prices would be increased after the elections. But it has been three years and we have only reduced prices and have not increased anything, he added.
He noted that the good governance regime had generated 400,000 jobs in the private sector during the past three years in office. He said when investors come to Hambantota and the industrial estate is established, there will be many employment opportunities made available for the youth of this country. The port will develop under the new joint venture and as a result it will have a positive impact on the countrys economy. Ratnayake further stated that despite the end of the war, tourists had not visited the country as expected due to the lack of security and the breakdown in law and order in the country.
Considering all the atrocities that were committed, how can we expect tourists to visit this country But now we have strengthened the law and gradually tourists are beginning to have faith in us and the number of tourists is increasing gradually. With all these efforts materializing, the countrys economy is bound to prosper and that is our goal, he noted.

The Greatest Showman
A musical  to be  proud of
P.T. Barnums imagination has inspired in making this musical biopic which tells the tale of a visionary who rose above all to create a spectacle which became a worldwide sensation.
Imagine Hugh Jackman of Wolverine fame singing and dancing to some rhythmical beats and in the centre of a circus as showman PT Barnum. A little known fact about the celebrated actor is that he was an award winning stage musical star before he bared his claws. Now many years into the Hollywood movie scene it is a pleasure to note that his abilities in the stage musical scene have not faded because he delivers a performance which deserves a standing ovation. Since Barnum finds himself out of a job he decides to buy a museum and make a circus out of it. Soon he lay his hands on every possible showpiece he thinks he can gather from dwarves to tattooed guys, tall and pot bellied men and tries to put them on display for an audience. And being Jackman he manages to pull it off with wit and twinkling eyes.
The opening scene itself, much like the successful La La Land begins with an energetic performance by Jackman and a troupe of professional dancers. This promises of better things to come and does not cease to disappoint the audience. Thus begins an all-singing and all-dancing show which will keep you entertained for hours. However like in many successful stories Barnums too must come to an end. When Barnum decides that he wants to be a part of the elite world as well as continue making money from his team he begins to lose respect from the troupe. The whole project boasts of some of the top names in the industry. The lyrics are by La La Lands Pasek and Paul. The cast comprises of some of the most promising actors in the scene like Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Rebecca Ferguson and Zendaya. However director Michael Gracey is relatively new to the directors seat and has been handed a script which is difficult to visualize. Plus making the movie a musical adds more fire to the hay but he has done wonders in making a magical piece which has a lot of spunk and heart.
For Bollywood fans some scenes in this movie might remind you of the Aamir Khan starrer Dhoom 3 but apart from the circus performances, the similarities end there. The bright hues which put life into the dull 19th century backdrop and the angles of the camera which capture Williams graceful moves are commendable.
There will be plenty of humming and toe-tapping when the movie is at full swing because the music and songs are quite infectious. The cast carries the dance items so effortlessly that it is a joy to watch. Ringling Brothers may have closed up shop, but through The Greatest Showman, Barnum lives on.

No tax relief for  sugary drinks - Rajitha
No tax relief will be offered for manufacturers of sugary drinks even though they had made a request for a tax relief, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
Minister Senaratne had stated that a tax of 50 cents had been imposed by the Budget on every extra gram of sugar contained in sugary drinks and these drinks should contain only the recommended number of grams of sugar which is six (6). He had stated this during a recent ceremony held in Colombo.
The World Bank has provided US $ 200 million to control Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka. Excessive consumption of sugar cause diabetes which is one of the common NCDs prevailing in Sri Lanka at the moment, the Minister said.
According to the WHO, about 70 percent of worlds deaths are due to NCDs and annually about five million people die from diabetes in the world. The new tax imposed on extra grams of sugar in sugary drinks will not be removed on any grounds, the Minister said.

No taxis  on the road..!
Even as the golden beaches of Goa seduce me each morning as I holiday here, with their shimmering sands, sparkling blue seas and breakfast shacks, I look at groups sitting all over, tourists most of them, with troubled expressions; wondering how they can reach airport or railway station.
The taxis are on strike!
And why on strike Because they dont want speed governors to be fitted on their vehicles! I enquire a little more and find that the Supreme Court had made it mandatory last year for all tourist taxis to be fitted with these speed restrictors, to help reduce road accidents throughout the country. The Golden state of Goa, however, illegally passed a law giving taxis a six- month extension!
Now they want more extensions, another laugh at the law! So, theyre on strike!
Break the law! shout thousands of taxi drivers, sitting together, playing cards, enjoying the local brew, and bonhomie.
The Supreme Court says we cant! whimpers the Goa state government headed by the countrys former defense minister.
You can! grin the taxi drivers, If you could last year, you can this year!
And as locals are inconvenienced, people are irritated and the state looks at votes reducing in the next elections, theres no doubt theyll buckle, give in and laws will be broken all over again.
India has the unique situation of getting laws passed to please a certain section of the people, and same law not implemented to please another section, and whichever side has the numbers, wins!
Laws have been passed disallowing loudspeakers after ten in the night, but when a slum or a local community celebrates, the police turn a blind eye in the city of Mumbai, and if the same loudspeakers are played by the middle class or those who live in flats or bungalows, the police stoop down and make their arrests. The slums have the numbers and the votes, the others dont.
Votes influence the implementation of laws here.
A laws was passed to make helmets compulsory for rider and pillion, but till date I have not seen the police arrest a single pillion rider. Government said not to do so! say the policemen.
Why would the government not implement something that would safeguard the lives of millions of pillion riders I wonder, but know the answer.
Today, gangs roam the country harassing, lynching, those who raise cows. Murder is an offence, but the state looks the other way, because a majority community backs these mob killings.
I look out of my window, I see golden beaches, shimmering sands, and forlorn faces of people with no taxis to carry them to their destinations. Dont worry! I chuckle, The taxis will soon be on the road, and everything will be fine!
The blue seas wink at me and I wink back at them..!

Obama finds footing Obama finds footing
US: One year after exchanging pleasantries with a newly-inaugurated President Donald Trump and ascending onto Marine One for the final time, former President Barack Obama has remained a central figure across the United States and global political scene. As his successor has seemed to systematically target key components of his legacy, Obama has been strategic, according to current and former aides, in choosing when and how to speak out.
Hes watched the year's political developments closely from Chicago and his home in Washington D.C., which sits just miles up the road from the White House. Hes made global excursions to mentor young adults, delivered paid and unpaid speeches and hunkered down to write his post-presidency book, while coordinating the operations of his foundation and presidential library. The Obamas have spent much time in Chicago where the foundation is located, spending time nurturing young politicians and teaching the importance of civic engagement.
He has rolled up his sleeves and really worked hard to make sure [the foundation] reflects his values and his priorities, former White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told ABC News. Civic engagement he thinks its so incredibly important for young people to recognize their responsibilities as citizens and that that should begin at a young age because it should be a lifelong passion and so anything he can do to mobilize that effort is important.
Despite watching his signature achievements unravel, Obama has been described as upbeat and optimistic. But that positivity doesnt come without some anxiety.
Of course it causes anxiety just like it does for so many people, former White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told ABC News. Hes never looked at it from the perspective of him  his legacy  hes looked at it from the perspective of the people whose lives he tried to improve. So if he thinks that people will lose healthcare or that young DACA folks will be at risk and potentially lose their status, sure thats extraordinarily and profoundly troubling to him. Just two days before the transfer of power was carried out on the steps of the US Capitol, Obama outlined to reporters in his final news conference the actions a Trump administration could take that might spur him to break with the precedent of polite silence previous presidents typically extended to their successors. Theres a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake, Obama said. In a years span, President Obama spoke out four separate times with vocal objection to a policy being pursued by President Trump and the GOP-led Congress, including twice regarding the Republicans failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trumps announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the administrations rescission of legal protections for nearly 800,000 DREAMers.
But Obama was notably restrained in going after Trump directly regarding several other highly controversial moments in his first year, including the botched rollout of his first travel ban, his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville and his accusation that Obama illegally wiretapped him during the election.
I think you saw him kind of do that deftly and strategically this past year, one aide said. When it comes especially to the presidents political involvement but certainly all of this other stuff, hes keenly aware that theres nothing more that President Trump would like than to make Obama his foil.
Matthew Dallek, a political historian and associate professor at George Washington Universitys Graduate School of Political Management, pointed out that Obama wasnt necessarily alone in breaking with the quiet deference that presidential successors typically extend to the acting president. In October, former President George W. Bush delivered a rare public speech in New York City in which he didnt call Trump out by name, but seemed to make multiple references to his effect on American political discourse. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, Bush said. Weve seen nationalism distorted into nativism. What he said then may have been harsher than anything he said about Barack Obama during the eight years of his presidency, Dallek said. I think its a bit unusual but I think the sense is among not just Barack Obama that it is incumbent upon them to speak out against Trump when they think its appropriate. Notably, Trump and Obama have not spoken since Inauguration Day, a sharp contrast from past presidents who have at times seeked counsel from their predecessors. - ABC NEWS

Only SLFP can  usher prosperity   Duminda Dissanayake
Votes cast for the UNP, JVP or the GLs new party SLMP would go waste since both the executive president and the SLFP President is Maithripala Sirisena whose support would definitely be with the SLFP candidate, said SLFP General Secretary and Ariculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake, addressing an election rally at Padaviya.
JVP is asking people to vote for their candidates at the forthcoming local government elections promising to make the village a heaven. Also, former President and Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, on the SLMP election platform, is urging people to vote for the SLMP to enable development awakening in the village. It is same with the independent contestants. If you vote for members representing these political clans, your villages will remain underdeveloped with problems and shortcomings unsolved while the members chosen enjoy the salary and other privileges for their own benefit, Minister Dissanayake said.
Only SLFP candidates could bring about prosperous development packages and relief to you once they have been voted into the local government bodies at the elections. They are reinforced and energized and invigorated by the executive president, the government and the provincial council, a three-fold strength, the Minister said.
He said that G.L. Peiris party has no clear or permanent political vision or mission and the only objective is to gain power for the comfort of a certain politically bankrupted group rejected by the people. The JVPs only strength is the tiny group of MPs in Parliament.
The SLFP General Secretary appealed to voters not to allow themselves to be misguided or hoodwinked by untrustworthy political groups. Only your conscience could correctly decide the most suitable way you will use the franchise. Be wise enough to be with us the SLFP and the president dedicated to eradicate corruption deeply rooted in society, Dissanayake added.

Case against Tiran  Alles and three others
Order on preliminary  objections fixed  for February 21
The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for February 21 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with Nalin Ladduwahetty PC appearing for Tiran Alles alleged that prosecutors have failed to follow the provisions of Evidence Ordinance when dealing with computer evidence.
However, Additional Solicitor Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General raised a primary counter objection citing its premature to raise this objection since the prosecution has not made a decision to call computerised evidence at this juncture.
On a previous occasion, the High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, an accused in the case.
The Attorney General had filed criminal proceedings against four accused - former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with controversial RADA fraud.
On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court had pronounced that the Attorney General has no obstacle to file indictments against Tiran Alles in the High Court and observed that the Interim Order issued by the Supreme Court did not bar the Attorney General filing indictments against the petitioner (Tiran Alles) based on the findings of the investigation into the incident.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is evading courts and the Colombo Special High Court had issued an open warrant for his arrest in connection with the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.

Paradigm shift  in work-ethics
In the backdrop of Triple Bottom line (People-Planet-Profit), organisations are traversing towards a spirituality culture. Workplace spirituality is interpreted as employees having an inner life that sustains and is sustained by meaningful work in the context of society (Poole, 2009). While spirituality is an evolving buzz-word, there is still little research done on workplace spirituality and its holding-power in post-modern organisations and business enterprises (Robbins et al., 2013). Organisational behaviour in the 21st Century has carved a new dimension of employee emotions that are expressed in different, but meaningful ways.
Spirituality is an empathy-driven approach being adopted by employees for several purposeful reasons. The stressful paces of life can be reasonably counterbalanced by spirituality, employees move to question the meaning of work against the backdrop of progressive job demands and studies envisage that material acquisitions (money, reputation and prestige) leave employees unfulfilled. Therefore there is a rationale for the growing interest towards workplace spirituality.
Work ethics
Values, ethics, motivation, sustainability and leadership of individuals in organisations encompass spiritual leadership. Despite preliminary studies on workplace spirituality in Sri Lanka, there are cultural characteristics inherent to spiritual organisations. Benevolence, trust and respect, open-mindedness and a strong sense of purpose are the identified organisational culture aspects. Work ethics is the holistic study of business situations, activities and decisions where the issues of right and wrong are addressed (Crane & Matten, 2010).
Spirituality is the social role of businesses intertwining the interests of both society and stakeholders. Benevolence is the expression of kindness towards employees and all stakeholders including wider society having interest in the organisation.
Carroll & Buchholtz (2009, p. 44) emphasised that corporate social responsibility (CSR) means the economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic expectations and desires placed upon businesses by the society at a given point in time. There is a reasonable certainty that CSR is inter-related to workplace spirituality and they are positively correlated.
Trust and respect are twin-elements which differentiate spiritual organisations. Mutual trust, honesty and integrity of employees are underpinned by dignity, esteem and value for employees by the organisation. Flexible thinking and creative-space for employees is valued by workplace spirituality known as open-mindedness.
Business organisations
Strong sense of purpose reveals that profit is not the primary value for evolving business organisations. People and planet, the two other aspects of the triple bottom line is of equal concern and catalyses the business performance in a balanced manner. Hence, most organisations are moving from secular interests driven by profits; towards interests precipitated on employee feelings and sympathy towards people and environment (green-practices).
The vertical garden concept is being practised by organisations which contribute towards ecological greenery and home-grown vegetation. This is a strategic move to minimize environmental pollution and long-term food crises.
McDonalds Corporation has initiated Pass on the Happiness, a spirituality drive by both employees and customers. Employees and customers are encouraged to regard how their work and spending respectively embrace a sense of purpose. While achieving a spiritual workplace, the stakeholders buy an ice-cream cone and donate another 80 S$ to Ronald McDonald House Charities (Nov 2017-McDonalds SG). This is a true sense of calling by a multinational organisation to stakeholders and to be sensitive towards dire needs of society.
As the season of giving-Christmas was just over it is pertinent for businesses to consciously regard the ethical duties and work ethics towards societal needs both visible and emergent.
Against the backdrop of criticism, the question arises whether organisational profits and spirituality are compatible objectives. Thus business managers and investors should regard the paradigm shift of the traditional triple bottom line and its augmented emphasis on people and planet in modern business contexts.
Secular institutions which are traditional-oriented focus primarily profit protecting secular interests. However, the evolving business entities and employees should reflect on people and planet which are spirituality-driven. This approach could engrave a spiritual workplace strategy as well.

Positive vibes
Umara Sinhawansa is a phenomenally gifted and talented artiste and an individual who values uprightness with a set of principles. She is a well- known face on the show Youth With Talent and is a charismatic judge and a household name. Melodies features Umara, who has been in the music industry for a long time and has conducted herself with honor.
To me music is not about showing skin, I dont believe in music that is about nudity or drugs. I think music is a universal language where people can connect, and there has to be a message. To me music is trying to make someone feel good. If you are feeling down and I make you feel good through my music then I am happy. It is not about singing about drugs and alcoholism and showing skin. That is so not about me.
If you go through back in time, you never see me revealing my skin, I have not come this far by showcasing something that I am not. To me it is my throat, it is my voice and if I can touch you for some reason and inspire you to do something good in life, that is what music is to me, explained Umara.
Umara does not believe in short cuts. For her hard work is a must. To her success means work ethic, determination, focus and having passion and love for what you do.
To be a successful musician I do not believe in short cuts in life. Currently unfortunately money does all the talking. Working hard and sacrificing a lot of blood, sweat and tears and coming up the ladder the right way with your own experiences, will help you sustain yourself in the industry for a longer period, rather than spending money and coming up in the industry  it will be a shorter period of your time. You will not be able to sustain yourself in the industry. To me success is being able to sustain yourself in the industry after your hard work and after being recognized for your hard work, said Umara.
Umara and her sister had an idyllic childhood being born into a musical family. Music she says hits her to the soul, whether it is rock, jazz or classical music. It just hits her to the core. Because she grew up in her family, it became a norm for her. It became a day to day thing for her like inhaling and exhaling and is something she cannot live without.
My childhood was the best I ever could have ask for or dream of because my parents were both musicians, so we toured a lot in Europe. My sister Umariya and I were very fortunate to grow up in that atmosphere. We were exposed to different genres of music and different cultures. So we learnt the very basics of stage management. I always wanted to be like my mother.
I still remember us cousins being on the couch with our milk bottles, while they were rehearsing on stage and wanting to be just like my mom. It was the best time I could say. I dont remember anything that was negative at all. My passion for music can be traced back to my parents. We are a very musical family, from generation to generation. It was in our genes and our blood, stated Umara.
Inspiration to write lyrics is based on the situation she is in. Where song writing is concerned, it is mainly her life experiences, be it a sad moment or an inspirational moment in her life. Even after her son was born she jotted down a few lyrics.
In 2011 I did release an album, I have a couple of singles that were released. My most famous single was Wassanayata Atha Wanala.I think I went to the furthest that I could have imagined in this country, to the rural people with that song. It has been more than seven years since I released that song. And it is still very popular which I am very proud about.
In addition to that I have done a couple of collaborations. I was fortunate to do a collaboration with Shanker Ehsaan Loy. I was with Bhathiya and Santhush for a long time. I did a couple of hit songs with them as well. The last song I released was with the ever so famous Chitral Somapala  Malakuth Thibuna, pointed out Umara.
Her music is a mix of R&B, blues, classical, rock, hip hop and so based on every occasion it changes. If it is a sit down dinner then it is jazz.
One of the most special events that I have done is making a guest appearance at the Make A Wish Foundation, in Hong Kong. There was one particular concert where I had to sing with my parents and their band as well which was in Germany. Every concert is memorable in their own different ways. Singing with my sister has been very special for me. On and off we perform, added Umara.
Umara says creativity is being inspired by that particular moment and trying to think out of the box. This has helped her sustain herself in the industry and she feels blessed to be accepted by the public for who she is.
There is no point in me thinking the same thing someone else is thinking and trying to plant the seed of that and letting it grow. Because that would be the same thing all over the place. So being creative is about being me. Being truthful to who I am. And not trying to be something which I am not, pointed out Umara.
Umara has no fear when facing challenges. She does not avoid challenges.
There is no experience if there are no challenges in life. You have to face every challenge. To sustain yourself in the industry you face those challenges without avoiding them. It is easy to avoid them but then your reputation will not survive. I think reputation is very important. When there is a challenge facing it without fear is the right thing to do, said Umara.
Youth with Talent holds a special place in Umaras heart. It means a lot to her because it is very Sri Lankan. She feels very privileged to be a judge. She feels nothing but honor and pride when she sits down before the performers.
Youth with Talent is an amazing show, that opened my eyes to so many things in my own country that I never thought I would see. We have a habit of underestimating ourselves because we compare ourselves with international platforms. Youth with Talent helped me widen my perspectives about Sri Lankans and why I am proud to be a Sri Lankan. We are very authentic and different compared to the international platforms. We can stand out in the international platforms because we use our Sri Lankan culture. This is what I notice about this show. It is so different to the international platform.
These people come from rural areas and with very less facilities. There were people who came with Rs. 400 in their pockets and they slept in the streets for two weeks because they were selected to the second round and they borrowed money from people. They really work very hard. For me to sit there and watch, that is such a privilege, explained Umara.
Umara is a big fan of Nanda Malini, Umaria, Nirosha Virajini and Amaradeva. Internationally her idols would be Whitney Houston, Destinys Child, Beyonce and Maria Carey. American Idol, X- Factor, Youth With Talent is an opportunity and a platform to showcase your talent, your vocal flexibility and the flexibility of your talent. What I say is, use that platform to come up in the industry. Kelly Clarkson won American Idol but is still huge today. She used that platform. Same goes for Carrie Underwood. Beyonce competed in contests she never won but she is huge today. I would love to be successful internationally. I want to slowly expand as a Sri Lankan musician, said Umara.
