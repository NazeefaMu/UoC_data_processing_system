Cadeting can mould you into a good citizen  Major Dissanayake
The former old boy of Kekirawa Central College, Junior and a Senior Cadet Sergeant and a Company Quarter Master and an Athlete and Volleyball player, a former Cadet Master of Madawachchiya Central College, Lumbini Vidyalaya, Colombo and Master in Charge of Cricket, Volleyball, Athletics and Cadeting and later Prefect of Games at Moratu Vidyalaya, Master in Charge of Cadeting at Lalith Athulathmudali Vidyalaya, Mt. Lavinia and the present Principal of Kotalawalapura Maha Vidyalaya, Ratmalana Major D. M. L. K. Dissanayake spoke to the Daily News Sports at his residence 97/3/C, Hadigama Road, Suwarapola, Piliyandala.
Q. Can you tell something in brief about yourself and your family
A. My full name is Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Lakshman Karunaratne Disanayake and I was born on 1st January 1962 and my father is Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Kerala Welwidanage Tilakaratne Dissanayake. He was a businessman and my mother is Wijesinghe Mudiyanselage Premawathi. She was a housewife. I have one elder brother, two younger sisters and one younger brother.
My wife is a Retired Government Teacher and presently teaching at Buddhist Ladies College. She is Palika Subashini Perera and we have a son and we hail from Kekirawa.
Q. What is your first school
A. I had my entire education at Kekirawa Central College from Grade 1 to Grade 13. I entered school in 1967 and the then Principal was Harry de Silva. I got through the Advanced Level Examination in 1979 and got selected to the University of Peradeniya. I passed out in 1984.
Q. Did you do sports at school
A. I played for the school volleyball team and took part in athletics in the Inter House Meets. Our volleyball team emerged as the Provincial champions and I was awarded school colours.
But my forte was Cadeting. I was a Junior and a Senior Cadet under Lt. Lanarolle. I was a Senior Cadet Sergeant and later promoted as a Company Quarter Master and attended Diyatalawa Cadet Camp in both these formats.
Q. Did you do sports whilst at University
A. During my university days there was no possibility at all to do sports over there due to JVP terror and the campus was closed very often.
Q. What is your first employment
A. Actually I was interested to join the Army but my parents vehemently opposed so I got a teaching appointment as a Graduate Teacher at Medawachchiya Central College.
As soon as I assumed duties the Principal appointed me as the Master in Charge of Senior Cadeting and we attended camps for four successive years. In my fourth year I was sent to Rantambe for my Officers Training Course by the Sri Lanka Cadet Corps.
Q. Then what happened
A. I did the course well and I was promoted as a Second Lieutenant and I was drafted to Lumbini Vidyalaya, Colombo and the Principal W. P. A. Perera asked me to take over cadetting. I served there for four years. Lumbini performed well under my command and I was promoted as a Lieutenant and transferred to Moratu Vidyalaya.
Q. Did you continue cadeting at MMV
A. We were in the third Battalion and we were able to win third place. In addition to cadeting the Principal D. M. Gunadasa entrusted me to Volleyball, Athletics and Cricket.
In Athletics Vidyalians came up to the fore and always they were neck to neck with Prince of Wales and St. Sebastians. Then I was appointed as the Prefect of Games. Moratuwites are famous for cricket and I took several cricketers from the area schools which doesnt have cricket.
Ajantha Mendis was also taken by me. Cambrian Bandula de Silva was coaching Vidyalians and he got a coaching assignment at his alma mater and I took Old Vidyalian Sumith Prasanna and we were able to win several championships at various levels. I got the opportunity to organize seven Big Matches with Sri Sumangala College, Panadura.
During this period I was promoted to the rank of Captain and transferred to Lalith Athulathmudali Vidyalaya as the Vice Principal.
Q. Did you take over cadeting in addition to your duties
A. There was no cadeting over there at that time and I commenced and after one year. I was mobilized during the height of North East War and drafted to Matugama Youth Cadet Camp and from there I was transferred to Bulathsinhala Youth Cadet Camp as the Second in Charge and then I was promoted to the rank of Major and transferred to Bope Youth Cadet Camp at Galle as the Commanding Officer.
I encouraged most of the Cadets and students of nearby schools to join armed services and the Police and I was able to encourage more than 2000 young men to join the services and Police. In 2011 I was de mobilized and transferred to Kotalawalapura Maha Vidyalaya as the Principal.
Q. Did you continue cadeting at this school too
A. There was no Cadeting at this school and there were about 180 girls and boys all together on the roll and classes were upto Ordinary Level. By now there were nearly 900 students and I was able to commence the Advanced Level classes.
There were no sports. I commenced Athletics and took former Vidyalian Indika Cooray as the coach and we started to do well.
We came first in the Dehiwala Division and we came fourth in the Zonal. One athlete became all island overall third in 2016.
I commenced Inter School Sports Meets and to develop athletics at school I organized an inter schools sports meet from the area schools. In Volleyball we won the Divisional title and represented at the Zonal Level.
In the sphere of education we were promoted as a one A-B School in 2015. Our school is the first Mahindodaya Vidyagara School in the island and we now have classes up to grade 13.
Q. You are at your last stages of your employment and have you got an any idea of mobilizing again
A. Already there are several requests. But the Ministry of Education is reluctant to release me.
Q. What is the advice you can give to the students
A. The education and extra-curricular activities of the school should go together. With my experience if you do cadeting at least for one year you will be moulded as a good citizen but every male student is not getting this opportunity as there is no cadeting at most of the schools in the island.

Campaign calling to refrain from voting for women to be investigated
Political campaigns urging voters not to vote for female candidates, especially in the Eastern and North Western coasts, have come under the scrutiny of the Elections Commission.
We received a serious complaint from the Eastern Province, wherein Pudukuduirippu, a female candidate stated that she had been prevented from coming to hand in her nomination. We are carrying out an investigation into it and a special police team has been sent to ascertain details, said Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya.
He was addressing a media briefing at the Election Secretariat, yesterday.
In a separate incident, complaints were made to the Election Secretariat that in Puttalam, certain parties had used loudspeakers from religious institutions asking people to not vote for women.
We are watching these regions closely, said Deshapriya, who explained that two teams would be sent on January 8 to ascertain details of the situation in these areas. District officers are also studying the areas closely and are expected to inform the Secretariat if additional security is needed for female candidates in certain areas.
If there are any barriers preventing the freedom to vote, the Elections Commission will not hesitate to postpone elections in these areas, said Deshapriya.
The police have also launched a hotline 0113024884 to lodge complaints regarding intimidation of female candidates.
Deshapriya noted that it was futile to ask for women candidates to be defeated under the new system. The 25 percent quota ensures that 15 percent of the First Past the Post (wards) list have female candidates be nominated whilst 10 percent be voted in through Proportional Representation (PR).
The wards with the First Past the Post system have only one candidate representing each party and thus the voter votes for the party and not a specific candidate on the ballot paper. This would ensure that any female candidate nominated for such a ward, automatically wins if her party wins. With wards under PR, more than one candidate would contest and it is up to the party to recommend the members to this ward, based on whether they qualify or not. Here, the Elections Commission has the power to inform parties to nominate more women if the relevant party has not been able to elect enough women through the First Past the Post system.

CH-Havies should be a close game
A close battle for supremacy can be expected when Havelock Sports Club lock horns with giant killers CH & FC in the second leg of the Dialog A Division inter club league rugby tournament today at Havelock Park, kick off will be at 6.30 pm umder lights.
Going by how the two teams had fared this season, Havies has a slight edge hence will have a definite chance of coming on top over CH as they are playing this game on their home grounds and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
It is the Park Club which won the closely fought out match in the first round league tournament this year by 31 points to 26 against CH played at Race Course grounds.
In the first round games of the league this year Havies thrashed Police (36 nil), Air Force SC (46  23), lost to Navy SC by (14-25) , won against Army SC (29- 19|), won with CR & FC (35  30) lost to formidable Kandy SC (9-20). In the second round they beat Air Force (34-18) in their first match at Air force grounds in Ratmalana.
Meanwhile in the first round the lads from Maitland Place lost their first match to Kandy SC (06 - 23), lost to Army SC (15-20), beat the formidable young CR side by 19 points to 12, lost to Havies (26-31), held Police SC to a 21 all draw, thrashed Air Force SC (43-31) and beat Navy SC (27-24) . In their first match of the second round they lost to Navy SC (24-27) after a grueling game last week at Navy grounds in Welisara.
CH will have a definite advantage when it comes to the two fly halves with former St.Anthonys college Kandy sensational fly half Samuel Maduwantha is very much faster than Havies fly half Dulaj Perera The Park Club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in today's game and if their speedy three quarter line spearheaded by their dynamic play maker cum former Peterite and the national centre Nishone Perera delivers the desired results today, then it will be a daunting task for the CH and FC outfit. But they will be countering their attack through another Peterite and national centre Lee Keegal to pull off a much needed victory in the end exactly like he did against the formidable CR and Navy outfits in the first round games.
All in all the spectators can witness a close battle for supremacy

Crane takes comfort in Warnes Test debut
Sydney: Young English leg-spinner Mason Crane was encouraged by his first bowling stint in Test cricket in Sydney on Friday and hoping for a better return than legendary Shane Warne's unflattering Test debut.
Crane, who at 20 is the youngest specialist spinner to play for England in 90 years, made a creditable start to his Test cricket career with figures of no wicket for 58 off 17 overs on the second day.
The Hampshire youngster had the daunting task of bowling to Australia's prolific scorers Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja, but he stuck to his guns and was unlucky not to snare a wicket.
Crane, who took five wickets bowling for New South Wales in a domestic Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground last year, takes encouragement from Warne's one for 150 on his Test debut against India at the SCG in 1992.
Warne went on to become the greatest Test leg-spinner with 708 wickets, second only to Sri Lankan world record holder Muttiah Muralitharan's 800.
"I'm hoping for slightly better figures (than Warne's)," Crane told reporters.
"At the end of the day that's how it goes, he turned into a great bowler and I'm sure it was character building for him."
Crane, who has been coached by another Australian leg-spin great Stuart MacGill, said he had been very nervous when called on to bowl his first over in the final Sydney Ashes Test.
"It was awesome. Naturally I was a little bit nervous, but I was also really excited. I had great fun out here and I can't wait until tomorrow," he said.
Crane said MacGill had helped him deal with the pressures of playing in his first Test match.
"He told me I would be nervous when I was called on to bowl and that's very natural," he said.
"It was about dealing with that and focusing on the keys that make me bowl my best."
Crane had a couple of chances, but he was level-headed about his performance before almost 44,000 fans at the SCG.
"There were periods where we had a couple of inside edges that didn't quite get to short leg or to slip, but that happens," he said.
"That's the game and you keep plugging away and hopefully they go my way tomorrow."
Crane said Steve Smith, unbeaten on 44 at the close and chasing his fourth century in the series, was the key wicket for England.
"He's got out four times in this series, he's playing it very well, he's seeing it very well but he's only human so we'll keep plugging away tomorrow and hopefully get him out," Crane said.
"He's a key player for them. I feel if we can get him out and we can take a couple more wickets then we can hopefully get a first innings lead." AFP

How fast will law fight Bond issue
President Maithripala Sirisena was in the spotlight of both governance and politics with his announcement recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Treasury bond issue, and its call that all related offenders be brought to book. He stood above the stature of political party leaders engaged in the current local government poll campaign, while being such a leader himself, as he informed the public of the results of a probe into what is certainly the largest show of corruption in recent years, and gave some strength to his pledge to fight corruption in his campaign as the Common Candidate in the Presidential poll of January 2015.
The fact that the Treasury bond issue is of relevance in the current local government poll campaign was seen by the call for the Commission report to be tabled in Parliament by the Joint Opposition (JO), the JVP, and SLFP members, too. The President who certainly knew of the political stuff of this report, especially in this rising electoral campaign, had already effectively gained on the call and need for public knowledge of the Commissions findings, when he stated: especially I would like to mention that this final report must be presented to the Parliament and through this initiative the report must be open to the public. He added that in the future, necessary as well as legal steps in this regard will be taken expeditiously according to the advice from the Attorney General. He requested to consider the openness of the facts of this Commission Report and assured that no hesitation would occur in filing cases against the offenders.
The Presidents statement on the Report with the highlight of the losses to the country, especially the Employees Provident Fund, other State funding sources such as the Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, losing more than Rs 8000 millions in secondary bond auctions, and the larger loss to the Government of Rs 1,1145 million, is certainly a major exposure that will have its impact on public opinion, and certainly influence voter thinking, especially in the urban centres of the local poll.
Load on UNP
While the load of the Commissions findings would certainly fall on the UNP, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been cleared by the Commission on the appointment of Arjun Mahendran as Governor, Central Bank, although it was noted that the PM was too reliant on statements by Mahendran on Treasury bond issues.
However, the record of Arjun Mahenrans conduct as Governor of the CBSL, especially with regard to Treasury bond auctions, his relations with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, with its association with his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius, certainly remains a cloud over the UNP, which it will now have to fight against, especially in the urban areas, in the rising poll campaign.
Notably, this Bond issue report does not stand out very well with both the SLFP and its direct rival today - the Mahinda Rajapaksa led SLPP, as it will lead to renewed debates on the fight against corruption, which was the pledge of the Unity Coalition of the UNP and SLFP, as well as the revival of interest through this report on the fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa regime.
It is also important to note that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) has also presented its report to the President, which largely involves situations under the previous government, and there is now the necessity to proceed with the legal and other actions on those recommendations, too. If done with speed, this can certainly pose major problems for the SLPP and the Mahinda Rajapaksa team campaign on an issue of corruption against the mainstream SLFP and UNP that are in government today, and are the poll rivals of the SLPP.
President Sirisena did make a politically important observation in stating: I must specially mention, in the future when filing cases, according to the recommendations and information of these Commissions, individuals who belong to two main political parties will be defendants in the legal process. We must be happy over our independent and impartial Judiciary. I must state all of us will provide our maximum support for this process.
The legal process
President Sirisena has already submitted the Treasury bond issue report to the Attorney-General, with the Commission recommending that the criminal and civil court action must be taken through the Criminal Investigations Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. That is certainly a politically useful statement. But what is of larger importance is how long it will take for the necessary legal action to be taken. A major problem faced by this government is what is seen as the delay in legal action on issues of corruption and fraud by the last government.
There has been only one major judgment so far in this regard, and that was against two public officers on the sil redi' issue. The politicians involved made big noises after that, and even the Sangha was brought to ridicule with pinda paatha for cash to pay fines imposed by the Court. No politicians of the former regime have yet been seriously affected by the functioning of the law against corruption. We see a mockery of justice in the fines imposed on those who have not declared their assets. It is now seen that some of these political figures are ready to use and even manipulate the law, through the available access to the judiciary (unlike in the past) to delay and obstruct legal action against them.
There is not much room for doubt that members of the former government, now with the SLPP, and members of the SLFP with todays government, have both contributed to these delays and manipulations of the legal process. It must also be noted that the Ministry of Justice remains with the UNP. If there is to be speedy action on the Bond issues, to recover the monies due to the Government, and bring the necessary legal punishments to those responsible for these corrupt actions, there will be the need for special action for the speedy passage of required legislation through parliament (with the necessary time for legal objections in Court) and the organisation of the Attorney-Generals Department with the personnel and facilities to follow up with speedy action.
There is much that has to be done with speed, if this Treasury Bond Probe Report is to have its full impact, in terms of the fight against corruption. This includes the call for a forensic audit of Central Bank Treasury Bond transactions from 2008 onwards, to bring out possible earlier frauds, and reorganising of the Audit Department. Moves to restructure the Central Bank, Public Debt Dept., and direct issuance of Treasury Bonds, and the recovery of illegally obtained profits of Perpetual Treasuries, and whatever action that could be taken against former Governor Arjun Mahendran, too.
There is also the recommendation for necessary legal action under the Bribery Laws against former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake (RK), over the penthouse obtained with funds from Arjun Aloysius (which RK was not aware of!), and allegations that RK had given false evidence before the Commission.
A tough challenge
This is certainly no easy task for any government, especially for one that is clearly divided within, in the current battle for the local government bodies. The President has gained a big plus by his statement on the Treasury bond issues. But, the question that arose about delays in fighting the corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime will be revived unless speedy and effective action is taken to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission, which is action under the legal process.
In a country where the Legal Process has been seen and largely condemned for its large, inordinate and often deliberately managed delays, raising some questions about the independence of the judiciary (which is certainly better today), the call for speedy legal action on such a huge aspect of fraud and corruption, involving political appointees, and those with power and influence over areas of governance, remains the issue of substance in this new phase of the Treasury Bond issue.
It revives the call for a new commitment to fight corruption by the government, which needs much more unity than is seen today in the SLFP  UNP clash in local government polls, showing all signs of turning into a more decisive difference after these polls, with SLFP members in government talking openly of alliances with the SLPP after the polls.
President Sirisena, who has scored well in his statement on the Treasury Bond Commission findings, will certainly face a very different situation in the rivalry of politics, when he settles down to consider the future of the SLFP  UNP alliance, which has formally ended, and awaits possible extension after these local polls. The Treasury Bonds will be of little help in the final issue of continued unity within the government, which will be the substance of UNP and SLFP consideration for the future.

IRAN  NEXT U.S. TARGET
The United States was never happy with Iran ever since the Revolution of 1978 which ended the monarchy. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who ruled for 37 years, was its best friend and policeman in the region. He fled to the United States. It has been trying to effect regime change ever since.
The United States taking advantage of recent civil unrest in Iran, mainly on account of economic and social causes such as rising unemployment, high cost of living is engaged in meddling in the internal affairs of Iran. This made Iran to complain to the United Nations Secretary General that The current US administration has crossed every limit in flouting rules and principles of international law governing the civilized conduct of international relations.
US President Donald Trump has openly stated that America would support the opposition protests. It is possible that the United States is pinning its hopes in effecting a colour revolution. Of course, it is not averse even to supporting a coup de tat. It was with the assistance of the United States that progressive regime of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq was overthrown in a coup in 1953.
However, opposition protests have now died off but massive pro-government demonstrations are being held throughout Iran protesting against US interference in the country and in the Middle East in general.
Having overrun Iraq and Libya and openly supporting the Islamic insurgents in their efforts to topple the Syrian regime the United States has set its eyes on Iran as the next target for it has been an obstacle to the realization of US colonial ambitions in the region. Its support to the Syrian regime and its cooperation with Russia has irked Washington.
Iran with its rich petroleum, natural gas and other natural resources and its strategic location is tempting Washington to take it under its control.
Iran with a territory of 1.648 billion square kilometres and a population of 80 million has shorelines on the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea and the Caspian Sea. It has land borders with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Iraq.
The United States is coordinating its policy towards Iran with its ally Israel. It was on December 12 last that the two countries signed an agreement on cooperation on dealing with Iran. It was signed by US National Security Advisor H R McMaster and his Israel counterpart Meir Ben-Shabbat.
US-Pak relations nose-dive
Relations between the United States and Pakistan, which for long housed the regional headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have nose-dived recently.
It began with a twitter message from President Trump complaining that Pakistan is supporting terrorism in Afghanistan. He said: The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!
Meanwhile, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Pakistan of playing a double game for years and confirmed the administration will withhold $255 million in aid to the country.
They work with us at times, and they also harbour the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan, Haley said on Tuesday at a news conference. That game is not acceptable to this administration. She further said that President Trump is willing to go to great lengths to stop all funding from Pakistan as they continue to harbour and support terrorism.
The Pakistani government said earlier on Tuesday that recent comments from US leaders were completely incomprehensible and could damage the trust between the countries.
Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations Maleeha Lodhi responded stating US spokespersons should not shift the blame for their own mistakes and failures onto others.
The National Security Committee (NSC) Chaired by Pakistan Prime Minister Shavid Khaqan Abbhasi which met to consider President Trumps remarks issued a statement which expressed deep disappointment at US leadership comments, which it said were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation.
Interestingly Pakistan the following day replaced the dollar with the yuan in its bilateral trade and investment with Beijing.
With Chinas ascendancy in the world economy and substantial increase in Sino-Pakistan economic and trade co-operation. The latter is now less dependent on the United States. China-Pakistan Economic Corridor under Chinas Belt and Road initiative alone provides nearly $60 billion in investments.
According to an editorial published by Chinese state-owned Global Times China and Pakistan enjoy an all-weather strategic partnership of cooperation, Beijing will without doubt not give up on Islamabad.
Inter-Korean dialogue
On New Years Day North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks to consider participation of North Korean athletes in the Winter Olympics to be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea from February 9.
South Korean President Moon Jae in welcomed the offer as a positive response and a ground-breaking opportunity for peace.
South Korea has suggested holding high-level talks on January 9th at Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. North Korea has confirmed the meeting. It would be the first direct negotiations between the two states since December 2015.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang in a statement welcomed and supported the two Koreas taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization on the peninsula.

Iran declares sedition over
IRAN: Iran saw another day of large pro-regime rallies on Thursday after authorities declared the end of deadly unrest and turned attention to addressing the economic concerns that fuelled protests.
A week after demonstrations broke out, there was a very heavy police presence on the streets of Tehran, AFP journalists said, and no reports of fresh protests overnight.
Limited activity on social media suggested unrest in provincial towns was also down.
The US said it may look to impose fresh sanctions on Tehran over its crackdown, but Russia warned Washington against interfering in Iran's internal affairs.
Iranian state TV showed huge crowds marching in support of the government across 10 cities early Thursday, including Isfahan, Ardebil and Mashhad, where the protests first erupted a week ago.
We are together behind the leader, chanted the crowds, in reference to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a bid to address grievances that drove the initial unrest, Iranian authorities were weighing options including blocking unpopular measures in President Hassan Rouhani's recent budget.
The people's main demand now is for the government and officials to deal with the economic problems, Ali Akbar Velayati, an advisor to Khamenei, told the semi-official ISNA news agency.
The head of the army, General Abdolrahim Mousavin, thanked security forces for putting out the fire of sedition.
A total of 21 people died and hundreds were arrested in five days of unrest that began on December 28 as protests over economic woes and quickly turned against the regime as a whole, with attacks on government buildings and police stations. Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli on Thursday said 42,000 people had taken part in the unrest nationwide.
It was a higher figure than the 15,000 given by the head of the Revolutionary Guards a day earlier, but still far below the hundreds of thousands that took to the streets during the last major protest movement in 2009. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted back on Thursday: Trump has an odd way of showing such respect'
From labelling them a terrorist nation and banning them from visiting the US, to petty insults on the name of the Persian Gulf, he wrote, referring to Trump's use of the term Arabian Gulf.
Russia jumped to Iran's defence, with deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov telling state agency TASS: Despite the many attempts to distort what is really going on (in Iran), I am sure that our neighbour, our friend, will overcome its current difficulties.
The question now is whether Trump will continue to waive nuclear-related sanctions that were suspended under the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.
Under the deal, Trump must actively lift certain sanctions every few months and the next deadline falls on January 12.
Iran -- which has long accused the United States and Sunni Arab rivals led by Saudi Arabia of interference in its affairs -- said external enemies were behind recent unrest.
Online messaging and photo sharing platforms Telegram and Instagram remained blocked on mobile phones, having been interrupted soon after protests began.
Telecoms Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi said Telegram would only be unblocked if it removed terrorist content.
Iran's political establishment has closed ranks against the unrest, with even reformists condemning the violence.
But many have also called on Rouhani to address the economic issues that drove the initial protests.- AFP

Kamburupitiya central bus station project in bottleneck
Work on the proposed Kamburupitiya new central bus station is proceeding at a snails pace, sources say.
A senior official attached to the Kamburupitiya Pradeshiya Sabha said its construction work was ceremonially inaugurated in early 2014 by the previous administration.
It comprises two storey building and will have a shopping complex, offices for SLTB officials and private bus operators, and separate rest rooms for clergies once it was completed.
Work on the bus stand yard and the public lavatory are still under construction, the sources said.
The building now has become a dwelling of vagrants, anti-social elements, stray dogs and cattle heads, while the public have to suffer scorching sunlight until buses come.
The bus station costs Rs.115 million to the Pura Neguma National Development Project, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry and the Kamburupitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Residents of the area request the authorities to speed up the project and vest it in the public as soon as possible.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Kandy SC at Ratmalana
A side that was tipped to comfortably win their eighth encounter Kandy S.C will be pursuing a far better performance than what they dished out in their earlier games. They will be with some real momentum and have some stars in their team. If they get enough ball, they could go really well. Everyone who goes for Kandy SC matches like their play, their rugby makes spectators to enjoy the game. Their pack is strong and rugby nowadays is all about the three Ps - pace, power, physical fitness. So, in todays game Kandy SC are the strong favourites against Air Force. It will be difficult for the Airmen to surprise Kandy, who within themselves, will feel they are good enough to win this game. The Airmen last season beat Kandy SC in the first game at the same venue and will keep hoping to repeat that success. Kandy who enjoys a better track record, will be eager to take the upper hand. Their fitness is a big thing, they always pride of being fit and thats why in tight games they come out on top.
Appeal to Sports Minister
The sporting fraternity of Kandy wants to appeal to the Sports Minister to look into the shortcomings of sports in Kandy. Sports in Kandy play a significant part in the lives of the folks living in the hill country. Kandy is represented by all races in the island, Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers and Malays. Rugby is the most popular sport in the central hills at school and club level and also cricket and hockey at school level. Kandy has produced many national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, football and hockey. Today most of the state schools lack funds to equip themselves and also no proper playing fields. Rugby is the most popular sport and crowd-pulling game. This is because Kandy SC is the one and only club from out of Colombo playing the game at its highest level. They are the reigning club rugby league and knockout champions. Although, Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest level. Kandy is urgently in need of proper ground facilities.
Ruggerite Lashan gets 4 As
Trinity Colleges talented ruggerite Lashan Wijesuriya passed out well at the G.C.E. A/L with four "A" passes and was ranked 78th in the Kandy District. He was also a school officer and president of the Trinity College Commerce Society. He was a top ruggerite since 2007 and played in all age group teams from Under 12 to the senior side. He was vice captain of the under 14 and 16 teams. He was a member of the senior rugby team from 2015-17 and won his rugby colours. Lashan was the highest points scorer last season with 81 points, five tries, 22 conversions and four penalties. He had the privilege of playing in six Bradby Sheild matches.
Pupils are readying for rugby
Kandy schools are warming up for the coming rugby season and are busy with training programmes. All schools are blessed with some keen and knowledgeable players. Trinity College is once again coached by Lote Raikabula with Buddhika Abeyasinghe as his assistant. St. Anthonys College is handled by Sanjaya Amunugama. Dharmaraja College is lucky to have Isipathanian Kapila Silva, a former CR & FC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka forward as their coach for the second successive year. Kingswood College is coached by that talented Dinesh Gamage. St. Sylvesters College side is coached by one of their products Aruna Rankothge who will be in his third year. Vidyartha College is coached by Sumedha Maleawana. Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College by veteran soldier B.B.N. Dharmapala. Sri Rahula College is coached by Nalin Wijesinghe and Nugawela Central is coached by Deepal Puniyawardene.
Governor's trophy for KCC
Kandy Cricket Club pocketed the Governor's trophy in their cricket tournament organized by the Central Province Cricket Association. Kandy CC beat Old Rajans CC by 6 wickets at Pallekelle. Old Rajans CC taking first lease of the wicket scored 84 in 20.3 overs while in reply Kandy CC made 89 for 4 in 23.2 overs. A pat on the back to the President of Kandy CC and Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake and Secretary Janaka Pathirana for organizing the tournament after many years.
Kandy has potential to promote football
Kandy has a lot of potential to be a top football promoting city. Kandy has been playing football since the 1930s. Sad to say, last year there was no AGM and the FFSL failed to do the needful. What Kandy needs today is another discreet and autonomous organization for promoting football at club level. Kandy is so bad at football because of poor organizing.
Kandy Youth SC to get a fillip
Kandy Youth SC at one time did well with their own resources in cricket and rugby, this club was founded by Malcolm Perera, Shaw Wilson, late Bodi Liyanage and H Marikar to promote cricket and they also took up rugby and played in the A division. Once again some of the founders have come forward to give the club the much needed support. Their main aim is to support cricket. Despite 10 schools playing top class cricket in Kandy, the town hasnt been able to play in the Division I of the Premier cricket tournament of the country. The main reason for the drop in club cricketing standards is that the players dont have a regular playground for practices and even for matches.
Minister Kiriella to upgrade Bogambara Stadium
Former Royalist Lakshman Kiriella, a senior minister and the man who initiated the Pallekelle Cricket Stadium and gave a big hand for the Hambantota Stadium, is planning to redevelop the historic Bogamabara Stadium and expand its capacity. He wants to make the playing area and the track perfect, and also the netball and the basketball courts and swimming facilities upgraded making it the biggest ground in the Central hills. The Minister has already held talks with sports promoters. This is going to be a great help as today a school needs over Rs. 75,000 to play a rugby game.
Antonians back in the game
Thanks to their new coach Sampath Perera, St Anthonys College has won four games this season beating Kingswood, Wesley, St. Annes and Thakshila Horana and drew with Vidyartha, Bandaranayake Gampaha, St.Sebastians Moratuwa and Katuneriya. At present, they are playing Royal. This is turning out to be a highly successful year after a long spell for the school. St. Anthonys College is one of the oldest cricketing schools with a history of over one hundred years producing top cricketers like the first school double centurion Jack Anderson and the worlds top spinner Muthiah Muralitharan.
Sampath to give a hand for iron sport
Weightlifting is one of the oldest sports. At one time this sport was dominant in Kandy and produced several weight lifters who brought honour to their clubs, themselves and the country. Kandy was the hub for the iron sport. All this was made possible due to the immense support and helping hand extended by Kandy YMCA, which was backed by the National Olympic Committee and the Sports Ministry. Once again this iron sport is to get the fullest support. An ardent fan and one time lifter Sampath Perera, a product of St. Sylvesters College who is also good at Billiards and Snooker is keen in giving a hand to promote weightlifting. Athula Wijawickrema from the famous weightlifting family is happy to do the coaching.

Kohli falls cheaply as South Africa hit back
CAPE TOWN: India started strongly on the first day of the first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday, but finished in disarray after a ferocious onslaught by the home teams fast bowlers.
India were 28 for three at the close -- with skipper Virat Kohli amongst the victims -- after bowling out the hosts for 286.
It was a remarkable turnaround after South Africa had been reduced to 12 for three by Bhuvneshwar Kumar inside the first half hour.
Counter-attacking batting, led by aggressive half-centuries by AB de Villiers and captain Faf du Plessis, and some wayward bowling by India enabled South Africa to make a reasonable total on a lively pitch.
Then the South African fast bowlers struck.
Vernon Philander had Murali Vijay caught at gully and four balls later Dale Steyn, playing his first Test match in more than a year, caught Shikhar Dhawan off his own bowling when Dhawans attempted pull steepled high into the air.
The biggest prize fell to Morne Morkel, who came on as first change and produced a sharply-lifting delivery which Indian captain Virat Kohli edged to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock after making just five.
The biggest prize fell to Morne Morkel, who came on as first change and produced a sharply-lifting delivery which Kohli edged to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock.
Du Plessis said batting first on a well-grassed pitch was a tricky decision and his sides start must have reinforced his misgivings.
Kumar gained appreciable movement off a well-grassed pitch to plunge the South African innings into deep trouble.
Dean Elgar, South Africas leading batsman during 2017, edged the third ball of the match to be caught behind by Wriddhiman Saha for nought.
His opening partner, Aiden Markram, fell in Kumars next over, leg before wicket for five, before Hashim Amla, on three, edged an attempted back foot drive and gave Saha a second catch. Saha finished with five catches behind the stumps.
De Villiers and Du Plessis started the recovery, putting on 114 for the fourth wicket, with De Villiers in sparkling form as he hit 65 off 84 balls with 11 fours.
He showed intent from the start of his innings, hitting four fours off Kumars fifth over.
De Villiers missed a drive against new cap Jasprit Bumrah and was bowled. Du Plessis went on to make 62 off 104 balls with 12 fours before he was caught behind off Hardik Pandya.
Quinton de Kock (43) and Vernon Philander (23) put on a rapid 60 for the sixth wicket before De Kock was caught behind by Kumar and Philander was bowled by Mohammed Shami.
There were useful contributions from the lower order batsmen before the innings ended, leaving the Indian batsmen with 51 minutes to bat against a four-man pace attack, including Steyn, who had not played at top level since suffering a fractured shoulder against Australia in November 2016.
Dhawan hit two boundaries off Philanders first over but it didnt take long for the bowlers to find their range.

Margaret Court to skip Australian Open after gay uproar
MELBOURNE, Friday - Tennis great Margaret Court, whose views on homosexuality sparked calls for a boycott of the Australian Open stadium named after her, will not attend this years tournament, organisers said Friday.
The Australian legend, now a church pastor, initially drew fire for saying last year she would avoid Qantas airline for its support of same-sex marriage, which became law in her homeland in December.
She later claimed tennis was full of lesbians and that transgender children were the result of a Nazi-style plot.
Her views drew stinging criticism from a host of players including gay former star Martina Navratilova, who called Court a homophobe and lashed out at the sick and dangerous comments.
The furore led to suggestions that some players would boycott the Margaret Court Arena at this months opening Grand Slam unless the flagship stadium at Melbourne Park was renamed.
Court, 75, poured more fuel on the fire by claiming a gay conspiracy from America was behind calls to strip her name from the arena.
As a former champion Margaret was invited to the Australian Open. We have been advised she will not be attending this year, tournament organisers told AFP.
Court denied she was avoiding the tournament after the controversy.
I dont run from things, I face them, she told Melbournes Herald Sun newspaper Friday. I decided not to come across this year and do more crabbing.
The Perth-based Court said she would instead head to her holiday home and watch the tennis on television, while indulging her hobby of catching crabs.
She also said it would be childish for players to boycott the court named after her.
I think that is petty if they do that and it says whats in their heart, she said.
I think thats very childish -- but thats not up to me and it doesnt affect me.
Court is Australias greatest female tennis player, winning a record 24 major titles.
Serena Williams has won 23 but said Friday she would not be playing in Melbourne after recently giving birth.
Court told the Herald Sun she did not hate gay people and was angered how she was made out to be a homophobe who no longer deserved credit for her tennis career.
In many ways they bought my tennis into it and I was speaking from a biblical side, she said. Bringing my tennis into it and what I did in my life ... they should be ashamed.  AFP

Messi can quit Barca, if Catalonia leaves Spain
Barcelona: Lionel Messi has ensured he could become a free agent if Barcelona no longer plays in a major European league as a result of Catalan independence, Spanish media wrote on Friday. According to a report in Madrid daily El Mundo, the contract Messi signed last November includes a clause that he must remain a Barcelona player only as long as the club is playing in a top-level European league. A source at Barcelona told AFP that for reasons of confidentiality the club never comments on contractual relations with players.
Catalonian nationalists proclaimed independence from Spain after a referendum on October 1, precipitating a crisis which is still unresolved.
The Spanish civil and football authorities have said repeatedly that Catalan secession would end the participation of the regions clubs in the Spanish League. If Catalonia becomes independent and Barcelona are booted out of La Liga and cannot persuade another major league (France, Italy, Germany or England) to give them a home, Messi could leave without having to pay his 700 million euro ($843 million) buyout clause, said El Mundo.

Alleged misappropriation of USD 330,000 in funds
Open warrant on Jaliya
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday issued an open warrant for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Jaliya Wickramasuriya for his failure to appear before Court.
The FCID had filed a B report in the Fort Magistrates Court against Jaliya Wickramasuriya for allegedly misappropriating USD 330,000 out of USD 6.6 million allocated for purchasing a building for the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
When the case came up before the Colombo Fort Magistrate, the suspect was not present in Court.
The Court was informed through his Counsel that the suspect has gone abroad for medical treatment with Court permission but failed to return before the due date.
Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando appearing for the suspect further said his client is still receiving treatment at a hospital in the United States.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate warned that sureties would be liable for confiscation of the bail amount if they failed to appear in court on the next hearing date.
Two sureties including the wife of Jaliya Wickramasuriya were not present in court yesterday as well. Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for February 16.
The FCID alleged that the suspect had misappropriated the concerned amount committed during the purchase of a building to house the Sri Lankan embassy at 3025, White Haven Street, Washington 20008. The former ambassador had remitted this money to Sri Lanka. The former Ambassador is a close relative of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

President to open Rajagiriya flyover on January 8
President Maithripala Sirisena will vest the Rajagiriya flyover with the public on January 8, providing long-term solutions for the heavy traffic congestion in the Rajagiriya area.
Even though the construction work of the flyover was scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, steps were taken under the guidance of the President to complete the construction work 11 months ahead of schedule for the convenience of the public.
The construction work of the flyover commenced in 2016, jointly under a Spanish company and a local company. Rs. 4,700 million was spent for this project.
The length of the flyover is 533 metres and the width is 21.4 metres. It consists of four lanes - two lanes each way.
Parallel to this project, several roads around the Rajagiriya area will be developed and an alternative road towards Narahenpita as well as the road towards Buthgamuwa will be developed with a total of three lanes.
The flyover, built using high standard modern technology as well as in accordance with high-quality engineering, will be added to our roadways history as the first flyover constructed filling a concrete surface on metal.
During the times of heavy traffic congestions in Rajagiriya, the speed of vehicles movement on this road is slower than 2 kilometres per hour. After the completion of this flyover, it is expected that the speed limit of vehicles to be increased by eightfold. The flyover can be considered as one of the most significant road development projects implemented by the present Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, providing the benefits of sustainable development to the country. It is also considered as an important milestone in the process of strengthening the economy of the country.

Remove posters and cut-outs by Jan. 31 - Deshapriya
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya yesterday requested that all posters and cut outs, including ones in elections offices be removed by January 31.
Deshapriya warned that those who do not comply would have the Police remove all posters for them.
Though the law states that posters in all forms cannot be displayed during the election, the Elections Commission had previously decided that they would allow the candidates to display their posters at their election offices, he said.
This is a privilege we have granted, not a right.do not abuse it, Deshapriya said, addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat.
The Chairman also made an appeal to the public to report about illegal cut outs and posters to the Police or to remove them on their own.
The public too has a responsibility to enforce these laws and we must oppose those who break the law, the Elections Commission Chairman said.
Posters announcing national meetings or rallies too cannot have pictures of candidates contesting the election. The Commission has only allowed posters to print the basic details of meetings with a theme or slogan of the party.
The Elections Commission has also decreed that only a maximum of 10 persons can visit homes during campaigning, he added.
Deshapriya explained that according to the law, a group of 12 persons make up a procession and without proper permission, it becomes an illegal one. Furthermore, the assembly of more than five persons for a particular cause, without permission is considered illegal.
The candidate can accompany these groups but they have to make sure that the number does not exceed 11, Deshapriya added.
In addition, candidates are not allowed to promise certain favours during their campaign or distribute goods in return for ones vote. Both will be considered acts of bribery, he said.

Salah wins African Player of the Year award
ACCRA, Ghanam, Thursday - Prolific Liverpool scorer Mohamed Salah was named African Player of the Year in Ghanaian capital Accra on Thursday, the first Egyptian to win the award since Mahmoud al Khatib in 1983.
The 25-year-old has scored 23 goals in 29 matches in all competitions this season for the Premier League outfit after moving from AS Roma in the summer.
He also starred for resurgent Egypt, who last year finished runners-up to Cameroon in the Africa Cup of Nations and secured a first World Cup appearance since 1990.
In the penultimate round of World Cup qualifying, Salah scored the brace that edged Congo Brazzaville in Alexandria, including the stoppage-time winner from a penalty that sealed a trip to Russia.
Salah's Liverpool teammate Sadio Mane, of Senegal, was runner-up and 2015 winner, Gabon and Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang third after a 30-player list had been trimmed to three.
National coaches, Confederation of African Football (CAF) officials, journalists and the public were involved in the voting.
"Winning this award is a dream come true -- 2017 was an unbelievable year for me I had a fantastic time with the national team," said Salah after receiving the trophy.
"This is a big award for me, a special moment in my career. I would like to dedicate it to all the kids in Africa and Egypt.
"I want to tell them to never stop dreaming, never stop believing."
The Egyptian succeeds Algerian Riyad Mahrez of Leicester City as holder of the most prized CAF individual award.
It is the first time since 1986 that stars from the north of the continent, which along with the west is the strongest football region, have won successive titles.
Victory on Thursday completed an awards hat-trick for Salah, who was named BBC African Footballer of the Year in December and Arab Player of the Year earlier this week.
Mane was voted 2016-2017 Liverpool Player of the Season, but the 25-year-old has since been overshadowed at Anfield by Salah's scoring exploits.
He did stand out for Senegal, however, as they secured a first World Cup appearance since 2002, providing much of the creativity in a team stacked with physically formidable footballers.
Aubameyang was Bundesliga top scorer with 31 goals last season, holding off Bayern Munich and Poland ace Robert Lewandowski.
He flopped with Gabon, though, failing to take the 2017 Cup of Nations hosts past the first round and shunning several World Cup call-ups as Gabon failed to qualify. Other award winners included Women's Footballer of the Year Asisat Oshoala of Nigeria and Youth Player of the Year Patson Daka of Zambia.
Argentine Egypt manager Hector Cuper was named Coach of Year and other honours went to Egypt (national team), South Africa (women's national team) and Wydad Casablanca (club).
Ahead of the awards ceremony, CAF president Ahmad Ahmad told a media conference why the Africa-based Player of the Year and Referee of the Year awards had been scrapped.  AFP

Siritunga Jayasuriya seeks interim order
The United Socialist Party (USP) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission.
This is from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Sri Jayawardenapura - Kotte Municipal Council. United Socialist Party Secretary Siritunga Jayasuriya filed this petition in the Supreme Court through President's Counsel Srinath Perera naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others respondents.
Jayasuriya is seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte Municipal Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by USP's authorised agent to elect members to the Municipal Council.
The USP nomination papers had been rejected on the ground that the papers did not contain the required number of candidates.

SLFP calls for legal action on Bond issue
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha stressed the importance of taking legal action on the investigations and the recommendations made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond issue.
Addressing the media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters, the Minister said the Commission has recommended that Criminal and Civil proceedings should be initiated against the those identified by the Commission and to recover all profits earned by Perpetual Treasuries.
While referring to the Bond Commissions recommendation on the Central Bank to conduct a forensic audit of bond sales since 2008, Minister Premajayantha said the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made a profit of Rs. 11,145 million within a short period and that should be recovered.
The bond issue affects the countrys economy and it is important to do a forensic audit examination to quantify economic damages including the damage to public confidence on the Central Bank and the loss of new foreign investments, he said.
The Minister charged that a certain group attempted to sweep this under the carpet to protect the real offenders. He said that the COPE had completed its probe on the controversial Central Bank bond issue of February 2015. Its then Chairman, D.E.W. Gunasekera was to table the report but the 7th Parliament was dissolved. Some MPs had incorporated footnotes into the second COPE report on the Treasury bond issue. The report was submitted and nothing happened.
He said that after the 2015 general election, the Finance Ministry had been segregated into three separate ministries called Finance, Policy Planning and Economic Affairs and Public Enterprises Development Ministry.
According to that Sri Lanka Customs and the Treasury were under the Finance Minister and the Central Bank and Planning was under the Prime Minister. All the banks are under the Public Enterprise Development Ministry.
On February 10, a Singapore citizen was appointed as the Central Bank Governor and bond issue occurred on February 27. When we were in Opposition, we questioned the Prime Minister about this and he gave various answers. Later, he appointed the Pitipana Committee.
That report did not bear fruit since those lawyers were not aware of the situation, the Minister said.
He added that two COPE committee investigations were conducted, while Arjun Mahendran was the Central Bank Governor. But the Presidential Commission was appointed after removing Arjun Mahendran from his position which helped to gather evidence from Central Bank officials.

Smith milestone as Aussies chip away at England lead
Sydney: Steve Smith racked up another milestone as he continued to torment England and Usman Khawaja neared a century to put Australia in a strong position after day two of the final Ashes Test in Sydney on Friday.
The Australian skipper became the second fastest batsman to reach 6,000 Test runs in his 111th innings, second only to the legendary Don Bradman.
Smith, with three centuries in this five-match series, has been the bane of the England team and was potentially heading towards another ton.
At the close, Smith was on 44 with Khawaja reaching his highest score of the series on 91 in Australia's 193 for two in reply to England's 346 first innings.
"We're stoked he's on our team so we don't have to bowl at him," Ausralia paceman Pat Cummins said of Smith.
"Those big innings he has played have been really important. In Brisbane and Perth they were match-winning and in Melbourne it was match-saving.
"It's just incredible and I think he's been the difference between the two sides."
So far in the series Smith has scored 648 runs at 162.
The pair shared in a 107-run partnership after the loss of openers Cameron Bancroft and David Warner.
Khawaja raised his third fifty of the series with a six down the ground off Moeen Ali.
"Great reception when he walked back in, all just really happy for him," Cummins said of Khawaja's knock.
"We know how well he's been hitting them all summer, he just hasn't got that big score to get him away."
Debutant Mason Crane, the youngest specialist spinner at 20 to play for England in 90 years, troubled Smith and Khawaja with his wrist spin, enticing some edges and false shots to finish with a creditable no wicket for 58 off 17 overs. "It was awesome. Naturally I was a little bit nervous, but I was also really excited," Crane said. "I had great fun out here and I can't wait until tomorrow.
"There were periods where we had a couple of inside edges that didn't quite get to short leg or to slip, but that happens and you keep plugging away and hopefully they go my way tomorrow."
Warner reached his fourth half-century of the series before James Anderson coaxed an edge behind for 56 after Bancroft was bowled by Stuart Broad for a seven-ball duck. England's maligned tail earlier piled on runs before the tourists were bowled out at lunch. Newcomer Tom Curran smacked 39 off 65 balls, Moeen Ali hit 30 and Broad clubbed two sixes in his 31 off 32 balls as England lashed out late in the extended morning session.
Smith pulled off a stunning one-handed catch to dismiss Dawid Malan for 62, but the Australians were guilty of two embarrassing dropped catches to give England a helping hand.
But Australia then dropped two regulation catches in the space of four balls.
Cummins put down Curran on 21 at mid-on off Nathan Lyon then in Cummins' next over Josh Hazlewood made a dreadful hash of a skied catch at mid-on from Moeen on 22.
It was the 11th dropped catch by Australia's fielders in the series, with five coming off Lyon's bowling.
But Cummins made partial amends when he had Moeen caught off his glove to a lifter for 30, giving wicketkeeper Tim Paine his fourth catch of the innings.
Broad and Curran hit out late in the session with Broad clubbing Cummins for two sixes to the delight of England's Barmy Army supporters. Curran finally fell to a bat-pad catch by Bancroft for 39 off 65 balls to give Cummins his fourth wicket.
Broad went for another heave on 31, only to top-edge behind the wicket for Smith to take the catch and give spinner Lyon his only wicket. Australia have already clinched the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-Test series. AFP

Some thoughts on the elections
It is true that relations of Lasantha, Rajudean, Raviraj and Eknaligoda, also Marshal be really disappointed that police still couldnt find a valid reason to arrest former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. Any HR conscious foreigner who reads the above opening statement of this article may wonder what is happening in this country.
Why the government is incapable of keeping in line with the UN resolution.
Why the government is looking for more reasons to arrest a person who as defence secretary directly responsible for crimes committed by military people Yes, such things happen only under dictatorships, fascist regimes and undemocratic circumstances.
However such things have happened in this country, this is the sad reality in Lanka today. Since the current government came to power promising good governance, there was eagerness to arrest responsible for fascistic crimes.
Oppressed families were relieved but now some see only the exact opposite being practiced. Families of the disappeared expected the entire government machinery to target fascistic villains. But the government behaved, to avoid the blame, towards harassing the current and potential opponents. There was strong revulsion against laws to be twisted at will, to achieve the sinister motives of somebody.
Over the last three years, the government had been effective in suppressing the abuse of the legal system and the police powers. Thousands of people have been questioned by the CID, Bribery Commission, presidential commissions and of course by the FCID but nobody claimed any undue harassment.
Yahapalanaya and Mahinda regime
This is certainly the main difference between Yahapalanaya and Mahinda regime, whose legality itself is in question. Those days every time one of these institutes started an inquiry about a politically important individual, the information is not passed to anybody; family members live in horror. Now no such steps are taken, even when indirect evidence available for brutal crimes. If the case is very important, then it is quite likely that a charge is framed under the Public Property Act. Why Public Property Act That is because under the Public Property Act the magistrate courts have no powers to grant bail to those who are arrested by police unless there are some exceptional circumstances justifying bail. That is how those who conduct the case can investigate keeping the victim in remand custody for several weeks or months.
Once a person was framed as a suspect and remanded by Mahinda regime, the government media is used to completely tarnish the image of the suspect. That happened to Marshal Fonseka and later Azath Sally. Sadly the private media followed suit due to fear of the regime, whatever its news value. The target was no longer a suspect. He was already projected as a culprit. Long before an indictment was even served, the persons character was completely destroyed in the public eyes. To the outside world now he is positioned as a criminal who betrayed the country.
How many times have Lankans seen this drama being played over and over again Since the current government came to power, they have conducted a number of inquiries on Gotabhaya; public may remember only a few. Investigations on Avant Garde maritime services, Rakna Arakshaka security services, MiG aircraft, attacks on some journalists, Welikada prison massacre and the D. A. Rajapaksa memorial were just the most important. Even after three years of investigations government has so far not imprisoned him and stood with judicial rulings.
Local government election
The nomination period for the 2018 local government election drew to an end last week with remarkable changes in political landscape. It is going to be full of clashes but with less bloodshed but with lots of hard words and campaigning will continue earnestly in the coming weeks.
Candidates were given a choice, so are the people. Political debate is hot though not violent as some people predicted. Of course violence was reported here and there; but police was in control. It might be so in the coming period of campaign.
Clearly the nomination period for the 2018 local government election is over and campaigning has begun; inspite of few objections taken to the Supreme Court. How have the early days of campaigning been for the Lankan people Good, in spite of few bad incidents says police chief Pujith Jayasundara. He is ready to deal with any aggression on peoples freedom!
However some say that the nomination period was eventful for almost all the parties and there seems to have been clashes between aspirant candidates. Because of these clashes and disappointments, some candidates have become estranged from their parties. They have either joined other parties or have become neutralized or hostile.
Fascistic politics
This is unavoidable with seat-oriented candidates eager to try their luck with the village or ward community that they were attached to, and worked for. As there have been close to 100,000 aspirant candidates and their hardcore supporters were vying against each other during the nomination campaign; whether their luck and dedication was fruitful. Unlike in the past with Manapa dominating, social and political grassroots level leaders got more chance with the present system.
Since there were a lot of hopes riding on this process and so many people were fighting for a limited number of places, it is easy for people to get upset and crossover to a side offering palaces without any demand on finance capability.
Of course politics dominate and the masses that are already politically aligned will change their minds although some of their leaders have changed their minds. Of course that means fascistic politics still alive.
They are in an alliance, which includes the SLPP - Sri Lanka Peoples Party at the centre. So, apparently others are not under the SLPP but a part of the alliance. The powers of this alliance have been distributed evenly, of course with proportionate privileges to those who have the largest segments of political power. That means concentration of power in the fascistic leader. Therefore, irrespective of the numbers of nominees each of sub parties can include differ; they are satisfied with the openings that they received from the leader.
Of course the nomination process appears to have been complicated for all parties. But all democracy-oriented had the support of the rank and file to complete the nominations. In particular young people with education and political awareness were very active. Women were more active more than ever. But it appears that it has been more trouble for the fascistic SLPP. Over 10 SLPP nomination lists have been rejected, which is a lot more than any other party. Why is this Is it because of negligence, inexperience or internal clashes For these questions one fascistic leader gave a hilarious answer.
If the SLPP had some issues in preparing the nomination lists, it was because the SLPP was handling a lot more aspirants for nominations than any other party. There are political parties who had to struggle to find candidates, for those parties things are easy. But since we had so many applications, the selection process was long and complex. When a process is long and complex, the possibility of minor errors happening also increase, I think this is what happened to our nominations.
May be we should not laugh. Who knows The new theory of permanent revolution could be - more mass support leaders have, less revolutions will occur.

Top five ODI spinners of all time
Spin is not just a style of bowling, it is an art form, and one notoriously difficult to get absolutely correct. Spinners beguile batsmen into unplayable shots, turn the ball in defiance of physics, and it can confound even the best, most experienced of cricketers.
Here, we take a look at 5 of the best spinners who were revolutionaries in the art in their own way:
SANATH JAYASURIYA
The former Sri Lankan skipper, usually the picture of calm on the field like his one-time teammate and successor Kumar Sangakkara, was more known for being a swashbuckling batsman and leading his side from the front. Indeed, over a career spanning 22 years, Jayasuriya amassed 13,430 runs from 433 innings.
But Jayasuriya is still the third-highest wicket taker for the nation, and a talented left-arm spin bowler. He took 323 wickets in the 50-over format, with four 5-wicket hauls.
He once took six wickets in a One-day international, ending with figures of 6/29 during England's tour of Sri Lanka in Moratuwa in 1993.
SAQLAIN MUSHTAQ
Pakistani ace bowler Saqlain Mushtaq is widely and unequivocally considered among the best spin bowlers of all time.
He was a revolutionary in the field, and is widely considered the man to have pioneered the 'doosra', which is a leg break delivery bowled like an off-break; it aims to confuse the batsman facing it.
Interestingly, it was Pakistan's wicketkeeper at the time, Moin Khan, who was indirectly responsible for the name. The word 'doosra' means 'the other' in Urdu (and Hindi), and Moin would often ask Saqlain to bowl "the other delivery" to the batsman. Iconic former cricketer - and then commentator, Tony Grieg made the connection, and since then a number of bowlers among them Muttiah Muralitharan and Harbhajan Singh, have used the delivery. One key difference, however, is that Mushtaq's action was not contentious - while most bowlers since have faced controversy for their deliveries.
Saqlain took 288 wickets in 165 innings, with an average of 4.29 and six 5-wicket hauls.
His best figures in One-day internationals was a 5/20 haul against England during the side's tour of Pakistan in 2000.
He became the first Pakistani to take a hat-trick at a World Cup, playing against Zimbabwe at the 1999 edition of the tournament.
DANIEL VETTORI
Former New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori is considered a gentleman in the modern cricketing game.
He bowled a steady line and length and in what is the ideal for every bowler, was always stingy with runs.
The greatest spinner his country has produced, and arguably its greatest cricketer, Daniel Vettori also managed to be undeterred by surface, managing to generate spin on a flat track or seemingly unfriendly conditions for spin.
Left-armer Vettori took 305 wickets from 277 innings in his 18-year ODI career, with two five-wicket hauls.
He has staggering best figures of 5/7 against Bangladesh during the Tigers' tour of New Zealand in 2007, and ended his career post the 2015 World Cup as one of the best left-arm breaks we have ever seen.
SHAHID AFRIDI
'Boom boom' Afridi, as he is known by many of his fans, has become almost synonymous with career longevity - for the sheer reason of coming out of retirement on multiple occasions.
Over a 19-year career, the Pakistani leg-spinner took 395 wickets in 372 innings in addition to being quick with the bat.
He had a good economy rate of of 4.62, and took a robust nine five-wicket hauls in One-Dayers.
Afridi's best figures were 7 wickets for a mere 12 runs, against the West Indies in Providence, during Pakistan's tour of the Caribbean in 2013. The Men in Green won that match by a whopping 126 runs.
MUTHIAH MURALITHARAN
Without dispute, the Sri Lankan icon is the greatest spinner cricket has ever seen. The man with a broad smile and a controversial action has seen that action taken apart, analysed, and during his 18-year cricketing career, set a number of records that may not be beaten during his own lifetime at the very least.
He all but made himself the face of Sri Lankan bowling during his career, and took a staggering 534 wickets from 341 innings.
He maintained a meagre economy rate of 3.93 over the course of his career, and won thirteen Man of the Match titles in One-day internationals. Controversial though his bowling action may be, statistics speak louder than words - and perhaps none speak as loudly as Deshabandu Muthiah Muralitharan's. - SK

## Title: The UNP at 70

## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, January 6, 2018 - 01:00
The UNP at 70
The United National Party (UNP), which will be holding its 70th anniversary convention tomorrow, is one of the countrys two main political parties. Having been founded two years before the country gained independence, the party played a crucial role in the struggle for independence from the British. Although initially mocked as an elitist Uncle Nephew Party by opponents, it has since transformed into a common mans movement with a solid vote base.
The party has now embarked on a new journey that has never really been previously experienced in Sri Lanka  a journey of unity with main political rival the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to form a Government of National Unity on the theme of Good Governance. Despite certain ideological differences, there is very chance that the agreement will last even beyond 2020.
This convergence of ideologies would have been unthinkable 70 years ago, when the UNP was founded by the late Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake. Sri Lankas two-party system began in the early 1950s, when S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike broke away to form the SLFP. Since then, the two parties have been governing the country from time to time.
In Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, we have an astute politician who realised that divisive party politics can only take the country backward. With Sri Lanka on the cusp of the 70th anniversary of independence, party politics should not be seen as a force that can impede the countrys progress. This is why he backed the presidential candidature of Maithripala Sirisena, then the General Secretary of the SLFP and vowed to form a Government with the SLFP. This was achieved on January 8, 2015 and reinforced on August 17, 2015 at the General Election.
Many thought of the idea of a Government of National Unity as an impossible dream, but it has brought many benefits to the country from wider international recognition to domestic political stability. The two leaders commitment to achieving lasting peace and reconciliation, concepts the previous Government eschewed, has been proved by recent actions. The UNP has always been a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural party that has never discriminated against the minorities. In fact, some of its most well-known stalwarts have been Tamil and Muslim.
Apart from the ethnic reconciliation factor, since the National Unity Government came to power, Sri Lanka has also been able to extricate itself out of the quagmire of international isolation. The UNP leader has made extensive use of wide international contacts to gain assistance for technological and development projects in Sri Lanka. Technology will be a key factor for political parties in Sri Lanka in the future. The UNP has always pioneered new technologies as a political party and as a governing force. For example, it was the first to issue e-membership cards to youth members.
The UNP has faced many challenges from the very beginning, including stinging defeats, high profile defections and internal revolts, but the party has remained as a cohesive whole even as other parties splintered. In recent times, the formation of the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) by party heavyweights Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake was one of the biggest threats then faced by the UNP, but today there is no trace of the DUNF. (There is a lesson here for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna too).
The UNP, and indeed the SLFP, are not parties based on a single persons personality which is a factor that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa seems to have forgotten. For the UNP leadership, it is the party that matters, not individuals. There is no personality cult in the current UNP and SLFP. Hence both parties will be contesting the February 10 Local Government Election purely on a platform of village and city development as opposed to promoting personalities.
The UNP was one of the first parties to propose a higher allocation of nominations for women candidates. It has been able to attract many professional women for the polls and has proposed the name of Ms. Rosy Senanayake as the Mayoral candidate for Colombo. This is a vote of confidence for womens power in politics.
A resurgent UNP faces the challenge of getting youth on board, though this is not unique to the UNP. We must remember that both UNP and SLFP Governments have faced youth insurrections in the last 50 years. Addressing their concerns and frustrations is therefore vital, as is repelling their general mistrust of local politics. The healthy participation of youth at elections will be a boon for the country. We hope that parties and voters will give preference to youth, both men and women, at this poll because they can play a more dynamic role in the towns and villages.
The UNP-SLFP combination has started a new political culture in Sri Lanka that has taken aim at ending corruption. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have reiterated this stand in the wake of the Bond Commission Reports revelations and recommendations. The potential elimination of corruption could possibly be the biggest contribution that the two parties can make collectively to the drive to develop Sri Lanka.

We will develop Matara city - JVP mayoral candidate
Matara Municipal Council JVP Mayoral candidate Nishantha Wickramarathne said past mayors who governed the Matara municipal council had not given priority to the city's important issues "They had failed to give first place to citizens' healthcare requirements,"he said.
He said the mosquito menace has got into critical proportions due to water clogging in the drainage systems. Home gardens are filled with rain water due to roads that have been developed without proper planning.
Modern technology is not used to clear drainage and sewage systems as well as human waste from the city areas. So far the previous mayors have only provided temporary solutions to burning issues in Matara.
"We are urging you not to think about the individual person but to vote us with five years experience to accomplish the programmes we have in store to solve burning issues of Matara citizens.
''We hope that based on the social and economic pressure the public in Matara are faced with now, those who governed the city thus far will be rejected and the power to rule will be handed over to the JVP this time. We pledge to work towards building a healthy and developed city," Wickramarathne said..

Wiping out corruption indication of good governance- SB
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said that the measures taken by the President to wipe out fraud and corruption is a good indication of good governance.
He said that both major parties of the Government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have unanimously agreed to take action jointly for the eradication of fraud and corruption. That is a fruitful measure for safeguarding the qualities of good governance.
The Minister further said that people had doubt whether the government would not take any action against the people who were responsible for the Treasury bond issue. He made this comment recently at the Kiwullinda area of the Pahatha Hewaheta Electorate.
When we took action against the responsible persons of the Treasury bond issue, certain persons thought and predicted that there would be clashes within the government. There is no truth in those predictions and the aim of the government is to create a society without fraud and corruption, the minister said. He further added that the UNP has clearly understood that the action taken by the President on the Treasury bond issue is not against any person but against fraud and corruption. Therefore, the UNP also supports the ongoing process of wiping out fraud and corruptions.

Bond Commission report not a court sentence
The Treasury Bond Commission report is not a sentence issued by a court but a compilation of facts founded by the Commission in the investigation, said Education and Highway Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
Minister Kiriella said the COPE report on the same case has been sent to the Attorney General (AG) in 2016, so that this new report which was already forwarded to the AG is nothing new.
He made these observations at a meeting held at the election office of the UNP Local Government election candidate for the Kandy Municipal Council, former Mayor Raja Pushpakumara yesterday (05).
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who received several similar Commission reports, never forwarded them to the Attorney General, Minister Kiriella pointed out. Minister Kiriella added that the final outcome of the Treasury Bond Commission will not affect UNPs victory in the upcoming Local Government election.

Super close Serena out of Australian Open
MELBOURNE, Friday - Defending champion Serena Williams pulled out of the Australian Open on Friday, saying she was "super close" but still not at the level she needs to be after giving birth to her first child.
The American 23-time Grand Slam winner made a tentative return at an Abu Dhabi exhibition late last month, losing to French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.
Prior to that her last competitive match was at the Australian Open final almost a year ago, which she won despite being two months pregnant, memorably beating sister Venus in the decider.
Since then, she has given birth to her first child and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian at a star-studded wedding, where guests included Beyonce and reality TV star Kim Kardashian.
"After competing in Abu Dhabi I realised that although I am super close, I'm not where I personally want to be," the 36-year-old said in a statement.
"My coach and team always said 'only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way'.
"I can compete, but I dont want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time.
"With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I've decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year," she added.
Her withdrawal deprives the opening Grand Slam of the year of another major star, after former world number one Andy Murray and Japan's Kei Nishikori both pulled out injured on Thursday.
In Abu Dhabi, Williams was clearly sluggish and had problems with her serve. She also stuck mostly to the baseline and only twice charged the net.
Despite this, she made it clear afterwards that she missed being on court and was desperate to play at Melbourne Park, where she has been crowned champion seven times.
Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley expressed his admiration for her efforts to return to the game she loves.
"The true champion Serena is has been demonstrated in the Herculean efforts she has made over the past few months in her desire to play the Australian Open," he said.
"It was never going to be good enough for her to just compete, she wants to give herself the best chance to win.
"Ive been in constant contact with Serena and her team and know this is why she has pushed it and pushed it until the eleventh hour to make her final decision."
Few players have successfully bounced back after giving birth, and even fewer have managed to go on to win Grand Slam titles.
Williams can look to Margaret Court, Kim Clijsters, and Evonne Goolagong Cawley as those who achieved the feat as mothers.
A key motivation for her is to match Court, who boasts 24 major titles and is renowned as the most successful player in Grand Slam history, but this must now wait until the French Open at the earliest.
The Australian Open starts on January 15, with a host of top names either out or battling to be fit.
Murray has returned home after failing to recover from a hip injury sustained last year, while Nishikori has been on the sidelines since August due to a torn tendon in his right wrist.
World number one Rafael Nadal and six-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic also have injury issues, having yet to play a competitive match this year.
Stan Wawrinka, Milos Raonic, Johanna Konta, and Garbine Muguruza are among others either on the comeback trail or fighting to be ready.
The irrepressible Roger Federer appears to be one of the few top names to be fully fit, leading Switzerland into the Hopman Cup final with another masterclass against top-10 rival Jack Sock in Perth on Thursday. - AFP

2018: The year of tennis comebacks
If you like a comeback, then tennis is your sport next year. There arent one, two or three multiple grand slam champions making a return in 2018 but a handful.
Fresh injury problems for Djokovic but can he dominate once again
Djokovic received medical attention on court during his fourth-round match against Adrian Mannarino at Wimbledon.
An elbow problem cut short Novak Djokovics 2017 campaign in July and on December 29 the former world No.1 withdrew from the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, citing he had started to feel pain in his right elbow.
After several tests, my medical team has advised me not to risk anything, to withdraw from the tournament and to immediately continue with the therapies, the Serb said on his official website.
I am very sad because I was eager to return to playing official matches ...
Now I need to accept this situation, and to wait for the results of the therapies, in order to start playing tennis again and getting back to full rhythm. This might affect the start of the season and the tournament plan, but the decision will be made in the following days.
With the reemergence of both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal this year, it can be easy to forget that Djokovic was once the most dominant tennis player on the planet.
Federer: Dream scenario to win 8th Wimbledon
Indeed despite Federer and Nadal owning more grand slam titles than Djokovics 12, the Serb achieved something the pair hasnt: Winning four consecutive grand slams -- from 2015-2016. He was the first man to claim four straight since Rod Laver in 1969.
When he triumphed at the French Open in June 2016 to complete the job, there were those who -- rightfully -- thought Djokovic would catch or even surpass Federer for the all-time mens lead in majors. That now looks unlikely.
Djokovic hit a roadblock, a barrier that not even new coach and tennis legend Andre Agassi could remove in 2017.
Why the slump Djokovic has referred to private issues, his former coach Boris Becker said he wasnt practicing hard enough and then there were elbow and arm injuries.
But he will have a new entourage in tow when he does return to the court. Flamboyant Czech Radek Stepanek -- who retired from the game this season -- will coach Djokovic alongside Agassi. Djokovic also added match analyst Craig OShannessy.
SERENAS QUEST FOR 24 ... AS A MUM
Serena Williams shows off new baby girl
What an eventful, unforgettable year it has been for Williams. The American won the Australian Open in January while pregnant, gave birth to her first child about four months ago -- daughter Alexis Olympia -- and got married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in New Orleans last month.
Williams coach Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN in November that a decision hadnt been made yet as to whether she would compete at next months Australian Open although Melbourne tournament director Craig Tiley has twice said he expects the 36-year-old to show up at the seasons first major.
And that could very well be the case after it was announced that Williams would be making her comeback at a lucrative exhibition in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 30 against French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko.
I am delighted to be returning to the court in Abu Dhabi for the first time since the birth of my daughter in September, Williams told the exhibitions web site.
Despite not playing since January, no one would rule out the now 22nd-ranked Williams winning in Australia if she is in the draw. Williams, after all, could be the greatest tennis player of all time.
Collecting a 24th grand slam title would see Williams tie controversial Australian Margaret Courtfor the all-time grand slam lead, women or men.
ANDY MURRAY TO RESURFACE TOO
Born a week earlier than Djokovic in May 1987, Andy Murray matched his longtime friend by becoming the world No. 1 -- replacing the Serb -- late last year.
But getting there took its toll: A grueling schedule surely led to the Scots longstanding hip injury getting worse.
Although Murray managed to make a grand slam semifinal at the French Open, he visibly struggled with his movement in a defeat to Sam Querrey in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
Like Djokovic he shut down his season following the fabled grass-court grand slam before playing in a November exhibition in Glasgow against Federer.
Whereas Djokovic is set to return to the ATP circuit the first week of January in Doha, Murray is scheduled to join Nadal at the Brisbane International in the same week.
Their performances at the Australian Open foreshadowed the tough times -- six-time winner Djokovic was upset by wildcard Denis Istomin in the second round while Mischa Zverev stunned five-time runner-up Murray in the fourth round -- so the pair will no doubt be hoping for a better start in 2018.
But first, theyd take a clean bill of health.
So would Nadal. The Spaniard pulled out of the exhibition in Abu Dhabi with knee problems after experiencing knee pain at the end of the 2017 season. He -- along with his fans -- will hope its a relatively minor issue for the player who has dealt with knee injuries throughout his stellar career.
AZARENKA READY TO RESUME SOON
This year was supposed to be Victoria Azarenkas big comeback. And while Azarenka did return to the tour in June about six months after giving birth to son Leo, the Belorussian was another player who -- as it turned out -- called time on her season after Wimbledon.
It wasnt however because of injury.
The twice Australian Open winner became embroiled in a custody battle with Leos father, Billy McKeague, and said she couldnt travel outside California with her son -- the 28-year-old lives in the US state -- while the case was ongoing.
Azarenka decided to skip the US Open in New York and Novembers Fed Cup final, where Belarus lost 3-2 to the US in her hometown of Minsk. During the layoff, Azarenkas coach Michael Joyce -- formerly in the camp of Maria Sharapova -- then switched to Britains Johanna Konta.
Azarenka received a wildcard for the ASB Classic in Auckland the first week of January and suggested she would be in the field but ended up withdrawing.
We are obviously very disappointed to not have someone of the caliber of Victoria in Auckland and know how desperately she wanted to be playing here, tournament director Karl Budge was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald.
However, I think we can all appreciate family comes first ...
Azarenka was also the beneficiary of a wildcard to the Australian Open but skipping Auckland may put her participation in doubt.
FIRST FULL SEASON BACK FOR SHARAPOVA
Sharapova on her rivalry with Serena
Sharapova reappeared this April after serving a 15-month suspension for testing positive for meldonium but what unfolded thereafter likely wasnt what she hoped for following a promising start in Stuttgart. The five-time grand slam winner failed to receive a qualifying or main-draw wildcard for the French Open -- the lone major shes won twice -- and withdrew from Wimbledon qualifying with a thigh injury. She was limited to eight events.

Sharapova however upended current world No. 1 Simona Halep in the first round of the US Open -- where the Russian did get a wildcard -- in one of the matches of the year before claiming a title in Tianjin, a first title since Rome in 2015.
Sharapovas ranking was high enough to receive a direct entry to the Australian Open, the tournament in which she tested positive in 2016.
Meanwhile 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli is also coming back.
Rumors of a return surfaced in October only for the 33-year-old Frenchwoman to deny those reports before taking to Twitter last week to say she hoped to be back by Marchs Miami Open. - CNN

Accused acquitted in former Pakistan envoys assassination attempt
A trishaw owner arrested and indicted in connection with the assassination attempt of former Pakistani High Commissioner in 2006, was yesterday acquitted and released from the case by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judegment against the accused Balakrishnan Balasundaran Manoharan, the High Court Judge observed that the prosecutors have failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused, a trishaw owner, was arrested on the charges of conspiring to commit this offence by providing a trishaw to carry out a claymore bomb blast targeting the Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bashir Wali Mohamed at Kollupitiya on August 14, 2006.
The accused, Balakrishnan Balasundaran Manoharan, was arrested by an Immigration and Emigration official when arriving in the country on August 29, 2012. He had been charged under the provisions of Prevention of Terrorist Act (PTA). On August 14, 2006, a convoy carrying the Pakistani High Commissioner was attacked with a claymore mine. The High Commissioner escaped unhurt. However, seven people including four Army commandoes were killed and several persons were injured in the blast.

Acne bacteria trigger pimples
Acne is one of the most common skin problems around the world, with youth suffering its impacts the most.
The most common causes of acne is the result of hair follicles becoming clogged with oil and dead skin cells or the excess activity of a particular type of hormone.This results in acne erupting usually on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.
Research however shows that apart from the above factors, bacteria too can affect the breakout of acne. Certain bacteria called Propionobacterium acnes that live on our skin cause pimples.
P. acnes consume sebum as its food source and secrete substances to break it down. These secretions irritate surrounding tissue, resulting in a quick response from the immune system,an inflammation or pimple. Latest findings however show that not all acne bacteria trigger pimples and that some actually help maintain healthy skin.Thus through the use of creams or lotions which increase the concentration of friendly P. acnes, one can reduce the severity of acne.
