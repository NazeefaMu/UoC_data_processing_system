SLFP, JVP asked to state positions clear
The SLFP and the JVP have been asked to state their positions clear on the draft interim report on the new Constitution during the Steering Committee meetings scheduled on January 5 and 6.
A Steering Committee member speaking to the Daily News yesterday said the draft interim report circulated among the Steering Committee members last month spells out the basic contours of the new Constitution.
However, the presentation of this report to the Constitutional Assembly had to be postponed as the SLFP members in the government ranks and the JVP requested time to further study its content. They are expected to articulate their official stances on the Constitutional making during the next Steering Committee meeting, he said.
The member also said the 14 points forwarded by the Joint Opposition on the new Constitution would also be discussed during the next committee deliberation. The 14 point proposals of the JO group state among other things that foremost place to Buddhism, the unitary state and sovereignty of the country should be re-affirmed.
He said the UNP, the TNA and other minority parties representing Parliament are in agreement with the draft interim report.
Asked about the stance of the steering committee on SLFP proposal to take up the electoral reforms separately as the 20th Amendment, he said the majority of parties prefer comprehensive reforms and is against pushing through the electoral reforms only.
If we are to accommodate larger reforms even including devolution of power and nature of the state and government within the 20A then we can reconsider this position, the member said.
The Constitutional Assembly is to have its first debate on the new Constitution next week. A three day debate has been scheduled from January 9 on the reports of the six sub committees which deliberated on Fundamental Rights, Judiciary, Finance, Public Service, Law and Order, and Centre-Periphery Relations.

Tamil Nadu leaders flay Sri Lanka for seizing boats
Strongly condemning the taking over of boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan government, political leaders including DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps for releasing the boats and fishermen arrested by the Island navy.
Stalin said the move to take over the boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen is against the decision taken in the six rounds of talks held between the fishermen representatives and governments of the two countries. The Island government is not giving the importance for the relationship between the two countries, he alleged. Expressing shock at the island government's decision, he said the Centre had not come forward to rebuke the Lankan government and protect the rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen. The state government too had not exerted enough pressure on the Centre, he added.
Several rounds of talks had been conducted between the fishermen representatives and governments of India and Sri Lanka till now, but no solution had been found. Tamil Nadu fishermen are insisting on fishing rights in their traditional fishing area for which artificial boundaries had been drawn, but the Island government is adamantly refusing to accept the demand.
TNCC chief S. Thirunavukkarasar said the Lankan government's move showed that it did not respect Narendra Modi's government and added that the Island government's announcement also betrays its lack of interest in solving the fishermen issue.
Describing the move as a direct challenge to the Indian government, MDMK General Secretary Vaiko alleged that the BJP government at the Centre has been sacrificing the interests of Lankan Tamils for the Island nation's friendship. The approach of the Indian government is the reason for the Lankan government's arrogant action, he charged.
CPI State Secretary R. Mutharasan said while India is claiming that Lankan is a friendly country, the Island nation had arrogantly come out with such an announcement. The Lankan government's arbitrary announcement stems from the Indian government's move of acceding Katchatheevu to Lanka, he complained. - Deccan Chronicle

Panneerselvam writes 4th letter to Modi on Sri Lankan fishermen issue

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam has once again urged the Centre to intervene to secure release of Tamil fishermen captured by Sri Lanka.
After the December 21 incident, the number of Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody has gone up to 51.
The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister wrote again to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to secure release of fishermen captured by Sri Lanka.
This is the fourth letter written by Panneerselvam to the Prime Minister since he took over as the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister.
In his letter, Panneerselvam has requested the Centre to intervene and help in getting back the 51 Indian fishermen under the Sri Lankan custody. Panneerselvam also talked about the 114 boats that were captured by the Sri Lankan authorities.
He sought help in getting back those boats to their original owners. Panneerselvam said that he wrote the letter "with deep anguish at the very unfortunate and needlessly provocative remarks of the Sri Lankan Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic resources development Mahinda Amaraweera which indicated that the fishing boats and gear of the Indian fishermen of Tamil Nadu which are under the Sri Lankan custody will be taken over and made the property of Sri Lankan government."
Panneerselvam termed the Sri Lankan minister's statement as veiled threats aimed at intimidating the Indian fishermen in order to keep them from exercising their traditional rights of fishing.
Panneerselvam urged the Prime Minister to get the 51 fishermen and the 114 boats released and bring about relief for the fishing community in Tamil Nadu.
Sri Lanka has captured 51 Indian fishermen over time. The last such instance occurred when on December 21, Sri Lanka captured 29 fishermen and five fishing boats.
Tamil Nadu has requested the Centre several times not to treat the International Maritime Boundary Line with Sri Lanka as a settled issue. Under Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu government challenged the constitutionality of the 1974-India-Sri Lanka Agreement by which the small island of Katchatheevu was ceded to the southern neighbor.

PM challenges Mahinda Rajapaksa to topple government

Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today challenged Mahinda Rajapaksa to topple the current government, the Economic Times reported.
It saud the challenge came days after the former president expressed his intent to make a political comeback this year, bringing down the national unity government comprising SLFP stalwarts and UNP leaders. 
"I will be going next week to Switzerland for one week, giving Mahinda time to bring the government down," Wickremesinghe told reporters here.
 Rajapaksa last week warned that the unity government headed by the President MaithripalaSirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe could be toppled in 2017 through a roll of the head count in the national parliament.
Wickremesinghe said that the government was from today launching its development drive opening up factories and announcing its new development strategies.
Initially, an agreement is to be finalised with China for setting up of a special economic zone (SEZ) in Hambantota, deep southern district.
"We have signed the framework agreement and finished. Now we are doing the concessionary agreement. It will be signed soon. Both sides are now arguing about the tax concessions," Wickremesinghe said.
"On the Hambantota port we will get 1 billion (dollars) , the whole loan can be written off," he said.
Rajapaksa leads the local protests to the move to lease the port's 80 per cent stake to China for a USD 1.3 billion settlement.
 He said he was not opposed to the setting up of the industrial park but opposes the move to give 15,000 acres of lands of the locals to the Chinese.

Pelwatte Sugar liquidation to end soon
Melstacorp Limited is looking at ways to make its fixed wireless operator Lanka Bell a viable entity contributing to Melstacorps revenue stream, Melstacorp Managing Director Amitha Gooneratne said.
He made these views at a special market opening ceremony organised to mark the listing of the shares of Melstacorp Limited last Friday.
Lanka Bell was badly hit particularly due to tax structure, Gooneratne said adding that the firm is inundated with all other forms of taxation and quite a substantial amount of revenue generated by Lanka Bell fills the government coffers in terms of frequency fees, VAT and various other levies.
Lanka Bell has also made heavy investments aimed at developing LTE services.
In addition to this, the group is also planning to boost energy and tourism, finance sectors.
Disclosing future plans for Pelwatte Sugar, Gooneratne asserted that the liquidation process of the company will soon come to an end.
Nonetheless, the compensation bureau which looks at the entire process hasnt taken a final decision as to what form of compensation would be granted to the investors.
Gooneratne is however hopeful that something will work out in that respect.Commenting on the alcoholic beverage sector, he disclosed that in the first half of 2016, market share of its alcoholic beverage sector has marginally increased and many actions taken by the new regime has resulted in a drop in activities of illicit alcoholic beverage segment.
Various regulatory measures taken by the new regime has assisted a formal player like Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DCSL) to perform well. Gooneratne noted.
However, the firms performance for the second half of 2016 has momentarily affected due to increases in excise duties and so on.

Economy grows by 4.1% in 3Q
Sri Lankan economy is estimated to have grown by 4.1% during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the growth of 5.6% in the corresponding period of the previous year, according to the provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics.
Services activities grew by 4.7 percent, while Industry activities grew notably by 6.8 percent during the third quarter of 2016. However, Agriculture related activities continued to report a contraction, for the second consecutive quarter, by 1.9 % , impacted by the adverse weather conditions that prevailed during the third quarter of 2016.
Favourable developments in leading economic indicators as well as the lower base in the fourth quarter of 2015 are likely to steer economic growth upwards in the final quarter of 2016 in spite of the effect of adverse weather conditions and global economic uncertainties.
Headline inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI, 2006/07=100), increased to 4.1 percent, on a year-on-year basis, in December 2016 from 3.4% in November 2016. In the month of November, headline inflation as measured by the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), declined to 4.1%, year-on-year, compared to 5.0 per cent in October 2016.
Core inflation increased noticeably during December 2016 mainly reflecting the effect of government tax changes. Consequently, core inflation as per the CCPI accelerated to 6.3% (year-on-year) in December 2016 from 5.1% in November 2016. while core inflation based on NCPI increased markedly to 6.8 % in November 2016 from 5.7 % in October 2016.
In the monetary sector, year-on-year growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks witnessed the anticipated deceleration, and was 22.0 % in October 2016 compared to 25.6% in the previous month. However, the net increase in credit extended to the private sector, in absolute terms, remained high at Rs. 79.0 billion during October 2016. Meanwhile, credit to the public sector from commercial banks increased modestly in October 2016.Accordingly, broad money (M2b) growth decelerated to 17.8 percent, on a year-on-year basis, in October from 18.4 percent in September 2016. Rupee liquidity in the domestic money market returned to surplus levels in December, while market interest rates, which increased in response to monetary tightening measures adopted by the Central Bank, appear to have broadly stabilized during the month.
In the external sector, mainly due to the effect of a one-off increase in the expenditure on imports, the deficit in the trade balance increased substantially in October 2016. Earnings from tourism as well as workers remittances continued to grow at a healthy pace. Gross official reserves were estimated at US dollars 5.6 billion by end November 2016, while the Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated by 3.6 per cent against the US dollar thus far during the year.
Taking into consideration the developments discussed above, the Monetary Board, at its meeting held on 30 December 2016, was of the view that the current monetary policy stance of the Central Bank is appropriate. Accordingly, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank unchanged at 7 percent and 8.50 percent, respectively.

BP fills up with $1.3 bn Australian petrol station deal
BP has paid $1.3bn (1.1bn) for the petrol station business of Woolworths, the Australian supermarket chain.
The deal adds 527 service stations and 16 sites under construction to the 350 outlets BP already owns in the country.
The two firms will trial a convenience store business at 200 stations as part of the agreement.
The move follows the success of BP's Simply Food forecourt chain in the UK, which it runs with Marks & Spencer.
There are 248 Simply Food at BP stations in the UK, while the oil giant plans to open 50 more in 2017.
Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive of BP Downstream, said: "Globally we have developed a winning retail formula where we partner with strong local brands, like Marks & Spencer in the UK, to provide our customers with a convenience retail offer that meets the needs of their busy lifestyles." BP said the deal, which was first proposed in September, would be completed by January 2018, subject to regulatory approval.
The UK firm is seeking new ways to drive growth after being hit by the slump in global oil prices since 2014.
In the three months to September, it reported profits of $933m (763m) on an underlying replacement cost basis, down from $1.8bn a year earlier.
The firm also said in December it would invest almost $1bn to explore the Tortue gas field off the coasts of Mauritania and Senegal.
Shares in BP have risen more than 40% this year and were 1.2% higher at 509.1p in afternoon trading in London. BBC News

Total turnover value amounted to LKR 2.76Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 1.46Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.69Bn (135.76% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.29Bn.

In terms of volume, Commercial Bank & Nations Trust led foreign purchases while Dialog Axiata & Renuka Agri led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Commercial Bank & Nations Trust led foreign purchases while JKH & Dialog led foreign sales.
Point of view
The ASPI gained a marginal 11.7 points over the week, helping the Index close largely flat (-0.2%) over the month of December.
Gains were driven primarily by buying interest in COMB and helped by a strategic transfer of a 9.88% stake in PABC.
Although marginal, the gain on the Index was in contrast to the previous two weeks (when the index lost 50 points each) and helped the broad-share index hold-on above the key support level of 6200.
The transactions in COMB and PABC also helped boost average turnover levels, pushing the weeks average daily turnover levels to LKR 0.69Bn cf. LKR0.29Bn recorded last week.
Daily average turnover levels on the Bourse over 2016 has averaged LKR0.73Bn, helped largely by bargain-hunting by Institutional and HNIs in key blue-chip and mid-cap stocks along with Strategic buying in specific mid-cap counters.
Retail investors however, have remained largely on the sidelines throughout most of the year. Foreign investors meanwhile, recorded a net buying position for the year, helped primarily by strategic buying (in Commercial Credit) in Mid-December and as the equity sell-off on Emerging market assets eased off between July-November as investors regained interest in Emerging Market Assets amid expectations that the US Fed would scale-back its monetary tightening cycle.
Net foreign buying in domestic equities consequently totaled LKR 0.35Bn in 2016 relative to a sell-off totaling LKR 5.37Bn last year. Markets in the week ahead are likely to take cues from the Central Bankss Policy rate decision which is broadly expected to remain unchanged.
Equity market loses 9.7% over 2016
Equity market performance in 2016 has been mixed as markets have struggled for direction amid uncertain macro-fundamentals (particularly at start of the year), policy uncertainty and global market volatility.
After a volatile Q116, markets recovered partially in Q216 and Q316 before paring down some of the gains over Q416. Q116 was particularly challenging for equities as Fiscal constraints and high external debt payments led to challenging domestic macro-fundamentals; domestic pressures were further exacerbated by the Global equity market rout on the back of the China slowdown, the Oil price collapse and capital-flow reversals back into safe-haven assets.
The Benchmark ASPI consequently lost 11.9% over the quarter before recovering partially in Q216 (+3.5%) and Q316 (+4.0%) amid the presence of a credible, IMF-backed, economic reform program and as short-term macro-economic stability improved due to tighter monetary policy and greater currency flexibility. However, policy uncertainty (particularly surrounding taxes) re-emerged in the run-up to the National Budget in Q416, and the introduction of several new taxes along with the possibility of higher short-term interest rates has led to the Index paring down some of the gains made in the previous two quarters.
The Index lost 4.7% over Q416 with 50% of this loss recorded in November (-2.6%). The overall performance of the ASPI for the full year was consequently -9.7%, higher than last years loss of 5.5% but lower than the 12% loss recorded at the start of 2016.

ISM APAC believes that a childs education is the only sustainable reward that can be passed on to future generations.
A Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major health problem in rural areas in Sri Lanka, which was previously confined to North Central and Uva Provinces. ISM APAC as a socially responsible company decided to focus on the matter with their annual Corporate Social Responsibility project for 2016.
They have contributed to the affected area with the best of their ability and worked tirelessly throughout the year to make this project a success.
Kahatagahagollawa Vidyalaya is providing education for 180 students in the area with classes starting from grade 1 to grade 11. The school and the village are vastly affected with the CKD in recent years and many children have already lost their parents as well.
ISM APAC has taken necessary steps to fix an advanced water purifying filter (customized based on the quality of the water in the selected area) at the school, which will not only benefit the school but also the villagers.
The advanced water purifying filter was handed over to the school recently by ISM APAC. The specialty about the water filter system is that the filter will provide 800 gallons of drinking water per day, covering the need of both students and villagers.
The filter system will include a softer system as well as to treat the heavy water of the area while the main filter will be treating the other dissolved solids. All project cost are borne by ISM APAC and will include the support of the school for first year maintenance in addition to the implementation of the filter system.
ISM APAC is looking forward to undertake more projects in the near future to contribute to the society as a socially responsible organization. (DJ)

Kalubowila Impex innovates for PET bottle market
Kalubowila Impex,an IDB approved project at the IDB Industrial Estate, Munagama, Horana received SLS standards recently.
The company established in 2005 with modern technology acquired by Japanese and Chinese advice is today one of the top plastic bottle manufactures for both Sri Lanka and export market.
The company is headed by Managing Director, Sarath Kalubowila and assisted by director Dr. Chandani Seneviratne Kalubowila.
Kalubowila who specialised in Japan in Plastic manufacturing and Electronic products first started his venture mainly to introduce high quality and health conscious plastic bottles (PET) to the market.
He said that he always wanted to give the best to the public and always insists on installing new machinery to meet this end invests around Rs. 50 million each year.
He said that today his product range includes PET Bottles, Preforms, Caps, HDPE bottles and Caps for both local and foreign markets.
He said that obtaining the SLS standard was tough as they had to maintain tough discipline in all ends. But at the end we are happy that our standards are being recognized and honored.
He said that one the reasons for his success is the innovations and their R and D Section for which around 4% of their profits are reinvested.I also attend regular global exhibitions on Plastics and bring in ideas from it and my R&D team innovates and makes new designs.
These designs are very popular among the market and these new structures have also helped some of the producers to have an edge (simply because of our design) over its competitors. Some of the attractive vinegar, soya sauce and oil bottles in the market are designed by them.
Today the company employs a workforce of 30 and some of our machine producers and mould makers are trained in both Japan and China.
Commenting of waste management he said that is zero as they dont have disposals to environment. Our plastic waste is being sold for Yarn manufactures and we also dont have any fumes released to the environment as we dont burn any plastics, but simply heats the raw materials.
Describing the process he said that the plastic pettles raw material is first heated, melted and made in to small three inch thick plastic see through moulds similar to laboratory beakers. These are then blown up through another heat process and made to bottles.
He said that when a pattern is given to them by a customer they make a metal mould to cater to that. He said that in addition for manufacturing small bottles they also make water canisters for dispensers.
Commenting on the industry he said that while glass is going out of style there is more demand for plastics.My air is to make plastic even healthier and reduce a grammage of it.
He also advised its not healthy to keep on reusing plastic water bottles for drinking water as they are made to dispose after use.Commenting on the future plans he said that he is planning invest more for new machinery replacing the old ones and introduce more attractive patterns. (SS)
