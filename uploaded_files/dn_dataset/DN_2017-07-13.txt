Water management should be properly understood at grassroots level: Duminda
Some irresponsible officials slip through the water problem in the cover of 'water management'. They do not simplify the phrase to enable society to grasp its real meaning. Until water management is understood the grassroots level, society cannot be convinced, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said.
He was addressing the officials at the Anuradhapura Kachcheri to discuss drought relief programmes among other issues, recently.
Minister Dissanayake said the government spent a lot of money on officials and agencies for water management training in vain because it has not produced any result, Minister Dissanayake said.
The phrase 'water management' is attractive but nothing is achieved, he said.
All parties say that the water problem could be solved through water management. Officers must explain how water could be managed at paddy fields, factories and homes to the grassroots level without waiting to preach on the subject until a landslide, flood or other natural disaster hit them, the minister said.
He added that the country's ancestors should follow the concept that no drop of rainwater be allowed to flow into the sea without being used effectively.
It led them to build amazing irrigation systems. We should follow such theories, while being aware of water management, he said.

When BIG BEN struck a chord on Sir Don
This is about that incomparable legend
BENEDICT BEN NAVARATNE.
Before Sri Lanka broke into the elite halls of the International Cricket Council where Test cricket was what the game was all about, it had cricketers of the caliber of Mahadevan Sathasivam, Derrick de Saram, Ivers Gunasekera, Bertie Wijesinha, Sargo Jayawickrema,Sathi Coomaraswamy and Michael Tissera to mention a few of the greats who could have held their own against the best in world cricket.
But it is on record that every time Sri Lanka made attempts to enter and play in the elite league, the snobs who ruled the ICC turned down all attempts citing frivolous excuses and we were asked to go back and grow.
Then came the cricketing Messiah in the form of Gamini Dissanayake who worked the oracle and got the cyclops living in their Ivory Towers to see reason. And they bowed to the wiles spun by Dissanayakes wonderful presentation claims in 1982 and were lured and stumped. And Sri Lanka cricket reached crickets Mount Everest  into the world of Test cricket.
Talking of stumping brings to mind the brilliant wicket keepers (stumpers) that Sri Lanka produced during the pre Test era when knocking on the door for full ICC membership. Names that come to mind are that of BEN NAVARATNE, TELUS FERNANDOPULLE, MAHES RODRIGO, Dr. H.I.K. FERNANDO and RANJIT FERNANDO.
Stumpers of world class
The above named were stumpers of world class and would have held their own or bettered the excellence of world class stumpers such as Don Tallon, Gil Langley, Wally Grout and Rod Marsh and Ian Healy of Australia and Godfrey Evans of England. These Lankan wicket keepers had no big league cricket to showcase their extraordinary wares, but showed capabilities only when Test teams like England, Australia and West Indies played what was then called whistle stop games. They could have been better than the best known.
BENEDICT BEN NAVARATNE learnt his rudiments of glove work playing for Zahira College and St.Benedicts College. He was a stumper in the manner born and his work behind was excellent and lo and behold any batsman who dared leave his crease or lift his legs, because in a flash NAVARATNE would whip the bails off to the consternation of the batter.
It is said when the great Donald Bradmans played here in the way to England for an Ashe series, Bradman who watched NAVARATNEs magic behind the wicket paid him the highest compliment when he said that he would like to have NAVARATNE in his team. That was in 1948 and which Australian team was tagged the INVINCIBLES because they won the Ashes and never lost a single game on that tour.
NAVARATNE was born in 1916 and played only 16 matches in a career spanning eleven years. He played for the Government Services in the quadrangular tournament. The Gopalan Trophy match against Madras was the main match at that time and NAVARATNE was an automatic choice for the Ceylon Cricket Association. He had no equal at the Sinhalese Sports Club playing in the exalted company of Derrick de Saram, C.I. Gunasekera, Sargo Jayawickrema and Lucien de Zoysa to mention some of his team mates.
Similar compliment
Talking of Bradman wanting NAVARATNE in his team, reminds the writer of a similar compliment made by that great Australian captain Richie Benaud when he said he would love to have off spinning sensation Abu Fuard after Fuard had them in a flat spin capturing 5 wickets in a whistle stop game at the Colombo Oval.
Be it sheer pace or viciously spinning deliveries, NAVARATNE had the daring to stand up to the stumps. This story was told to me by another wicket keeper, TELUS FERNANDOPULLE of St.Benedicts and Tamil Union fame who would have won his countrys colours if not for the presence of NAVARATNE having to play second fiddle to him.
He said that the Commonwealth team played at the Oval in 1953, Keith Miller who formed a deadly pair with Ray Lindwall and Miller who opened bowling for the Commonwealth X1 seeing NAVARATNE who had the knack of standing up wanted him to move back.
According to Fernandopulle, NAVARATNE who thought he would show Miller his heroics had to back peddle and stand well back because the first three deliveries beat him and went past him. NAVARATNE acknowledged Millers extraordinary speed and stood yards back from that moment. Incidentally BENs son Lakshman followed in his fathers footsteps and kept wickets for SBC. Lakshman married Lal and Lasantha Wickrematunges sister Rukmani and they are now domiciled in Canada.
Fitness fanatic
NAVARATNE it is said was a fitness fanatic. He was very supple and would do his jerks and would be seen running round the SSC ground in an endeavor to stay fit after a game when all his team mates had left the ground. With todays cricketers lacking fitness NAVARATNE would have been an example to them had he lived. He too lived down my road and was very pious man and would attain daily mass at St. Lucias Cathedral, Kothena and was a member of the Choir.
FERNANDOPULLE who had to be satisfied being understudy to NAVARATNE was another stumper who could be classed with the greats. FERNANDOPULLE and the writer were neighabours and I had the fortune of playing with him for the Tamil Union when the Wanathamulla Club won the Daily News Trophy in 1961 and I was adjudged the Best Bowler thanks to FERNANDOPULLEs advice and instructions from behind the stumps. He was the stumper when the Tamil Union won the 'Sara' Trophy in 1950 led by Mahadevan Sathasivam.
It would be of interest to reiterate that FERNANDOPULLEs other eight brothers created a world record and which feat should have found mention in the cricketing Bible WISDEN and GUINNESS BOOK OF RECORDS by keeping wickets for St.Benedicts College. The brothers were Cyril, Bernard, Fuster, Quinton, Reginald, Anston, Camillus and Peter. Quintons son Marlon kept wickets for St. Benedicts College and Camilluss son Kitto did similarly for St. Peters College.
Three other wicket keeper / batsmen before the countrys entry into the Test portals will be featured next. They were Royalist Mahes Rodrigo a double international in cricket and rugby, Dr. H.I.K. Fernando St. Peters and Ranjit Fernando St. Benedicts. The five mentioned wicket keeper batsmen were some of those who tarred the road for the countrys admission to Test cricket what the game is all about. Brilliant wicket keepers are not made, they are born.

## Title: Why glyphosate shall bite the dust

Why glyphosate shall bite the dust
The use of chemicals like glyphosate has to be banned because their production, promotion and use is tantamount to homicide by the herbicide. There is plenty of evidence to support this contention and they should be more than sufficient for reasonable men to ban glyphosate on its dangers to life forms and the environment at the present scale of use.
We have got used to talking about glyphosate, a chemical that is only a major constituent of currently used herbicides. Scientific observations and analyses too have been confined mostly to glyphosate simply because the agrochemical companies refer most of the time to glyphosate. That is because glyphosate is a mild poison in the short-term. They can deny it is harmful because that is all they have bothered to find out and do know. But it is definitely a deadly killer in the long-term.
Actually, glyphosate may not be even a 40-50% constituent of herbicides. The other constituents could be equally or more dangerous 2,4-D [2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid], glufosinate, POEA [polyethoxylated tallowamine] and many others. 2,4-D is already banned in several countries.
2,4-D is a poisonous constituent of Agent Orange used by the USA in the Viet-Nam war to defoliate jungles to expose hidden enemy formations and installations. It seriously affected millions of Vietnamese as well as thousands of allied soldiers. Now, 60 years after the cease-fire, there are hundreds of thousands of pitifully deformed, long-suffering, helpless human beings, some even in their youth  showing long-term adverse effects.
Glufosinate is like glyphosate. It is a non-selective herbicide that disrupts a biosynthetic pathway in plants. In other words, it kills all plants indiscriminately by disrupting an essential metabolic process in them. It will affect life forms, just like glyphosate.
Unfortunately, the TRI is supposed to be testing it for use as an alternative to glyphosate! We hope this will be stopped before that also becomes a dangerous long-term experiment with human lives.
Because of the notoriety acquired by glyphosate and its branded formulation Roundup, they were tested separately at the University of Caen in France.
It was found that Roundup was at least twice as harmful to life as glyphosate in dilutions far below those recommended for agriculture.
trade secrecy
There is no knowledge available on formulations because producer companies claim trade secrecy. As such, how can one get scientific proof of danger The population is at the total mercy of the manufacturer with his purposely limited release of favourable scientific information and non-disclosure of the unfavourable scientific information. Scientifically analysing the formulations and researching their effects on the environment and life forms is impossible, impractical, useless. What do this business and their trade secrecy mean They mean that for the sake of profits, money, companies can and do foist dangerous chemicals on us and the environment without extensive research, or after half-baked research, on the effects of these chemicals on life forms and the environment.
Isnt this criminal capitalism Even a decade of such observations may not be adequate to realize the full adverse impacts  as shown by the use of glyphosate, but safety is assured in marketing drivel after short-term testing of a few months, as in the case of glyphosate and Monsanto Corporation, the company that developed it as a herbicide.
Scientific proof is not possible. Not even a few of the relevant natural conditions can be replicated in a laboratory. Modern science has only a minuscular knowledge of the process of life, of metabolism. Apart from that, even if scientists know how to study the metabolic process, even in stages, they do not have the equipment to do it and natural conditions cannot be replicated in the laboratory. Furthermore, there are several formulations of glyphosate in the market. Only the manufacturers know their compositions. As admitted by Monsanto, these formulations have never been tested. They have been foisted on the public without any concern for possible health hazards.
Therefore, those who blindly call for solid scientific proof of the dangers of glyphosate formulations are fooling the people deliberately or through ignorance.
poisoning by glyphosate
The action of glyphosate on higher life-forms, particular humans, is insidiously adverse. Very much so, like the action of diabetes. This has been shown after a decades use in the USA, Canada, China, Argentina, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Puerto-Rico, etc.
More countries, including Brazil and European nations, have woken up to the danger and are pressing regulators to ban glyphosate. In Europe, it has been found in human urine and breast milk. In fact, the research at the University of Caen started after observations in Canada of increases in miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths etc. in farm families. Earlier in 2010, one province in Argentina, after similar experiences, banned the use of glyphosate within 875 yards of homes.
In 2011, a federal bill was introduced to ban the use of glyphosate herbicides within 109 yards of urban areas. Lawmakers were pushing for a 10-year phase-out of all glyphosate-containing products.
The situation in Argentina was tragic. Due to compelling economic reasons, Argentina started growing GMO crops for export. GMO crops are an evil creation to grow food in commercial quantities. They were created immune to glyphosate to permit the use of the very convenient glyphosate to kill weeds only - unlike before GMO when glyphosate killed all plants  crops and weeds. In other words, GMO is an evil created to enable the continued large-scale use of the other evil  glyphosate.

Workshop on Lean Management themed 'Leap Forward with Lean'

A Workshop on Lean Management applications to Construction, Consultancy and Manufacturing sectors will be held on July 25, at Galle Face Hotel, Colombo.
This is a novel concept introduced to the Industry for the first time in Sri Lanka and promises to improve the Organisations bottom line by enhancing efficiency of the total product process in saving on materials, effort and time.
This revolutionary philosophy evolved as Japanese Car Manufacturers (especially Toyota Corporation) were challenged by their rivals to make Leaner and Meaner Cars especially with reducing Costs of Production.
Legendary Engineer, Ohna of Toyota Japan studied the whole process flow of production and devised a new System that was called Toyota Production System (TPS).
The entire process was meticulously analyzed to minimize waste, excessive inventory, defects, rework, overlapping and just in time ordering.
The whole Toyota Corporation worked as a Cohesive Team and all Departments were taken onboard and planning and scheduling were dovetailed as one seamless process. The 'push' and 'pull' between Departments was set in a permanent state of dynamic equilibrium.
As this concept was copied by others thus the Lean Production was born.
Lean Production commenced with manufacturing Industries, it was later adopted by the Health Sector and the Construction Industry.
A Study in the UK has found that in the Construction projects approximately 20% is Wasted, or lost considering the many variables encountered unlike the mass production factory process. Thus it was postulated that by applying Lean Management Techniques an appreciable saving on overall costs could be achieved even in the Construction Sector
Unlike the manufacturing process which targets mass production the Construction Industry has many more variables to be considered such as weather, the ground conditions, environment impacts, social issues, etc.
Since the Lean Management concept is new to Sri Lanka, a world renowned authority Dr. Iris D Tommelein who is Professor of Engineering and Project Management at the University of California Berkley, USA was invited by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka to conduct a workshop on Lean Management techniques for the Manufacturing, Construction and Consultancy Sectors of Sri Lanka.The workshop will commence at 1.30 pm.
This opportunity is available for the first time in Sri Lanka to all those engaged in the Manufacturing, Construction and Consultancy sectors
Tickets could be obtained from Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka. (E mail: [emailprotected])

World Bank to loan USD 1,340 million to Sri Lanka

The World Bank has decided to entrust Sri Lanka a loan worth USD 1,340 million as aid to enhance financial and technological stability, for a period of three years, in effect from July 1, this year, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
Previously, in the years 2014 till 2017, Sri Lanka received USD 660 million from this loan facility enabled by the transit cooperation facility of the International Development Association (IDA).
In addition to the loan, Sri Lanka will receive USD 300 million per year from the World Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and IDA for three consecutive years to aid development projects financially and to provide technological assistance to enhance analytical and instruction services in Sri Lanka.
These facts were revealed at a meeting held by Finance and Mass Media Minster Mangala Samaraweera last Tuesday with the World Bank Director to Sri Lanka and Maldives at the Finance Ministry in Colombo.
The World Bank Director further discussed ongoing and proposed development projects agreed to be funded by the World Bank, with the Finance Minister.
Furthermore the World Bank will also extend financial and technological aid to the project proposed to enhance the efficiency of government services and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project, which will be operated under the Finance Ministry.
The society security network project funded by the World Bank is also underway.
The World Bank Director to Sri Lanka and Maldives commended Sri Lankas economic progress saying that despite of the economical challenges faced in the year 2016 and in first half of the year 2017, Sri Lankas economy is in a favourable status.

RETURN:  in Search  of Stillness
The British Council Sri Lanka is the Principal Sponsor behind Colombo Art Biennales upcoming contemporary Sri Lankan art exhibition at the famed Edinburgh Fringe titled RETURN: in Search of Stillness from August 2 to September 24 at the Sciennes Gallery, at Summerhall. This project marks the latest venture in a prevailing partnership between CAB and the British Council, and also speaks to the British Councils longstanding commitment to supporting the development of the arts from Sri Lanka internationally.
Through its involvement, the British Council Sri Lanka has been integral in allowing the work of 13 emerging and established CAB artists to receive deserved recognition at what is the worlds largest and most visited arts festival  an opportunity that will boost the prominence of and create opportunities for the Sri Lankan arts as a whole.
Colombo Art Biennale has been fortunate to have the support of British Council Sri Lanka since its inception in 2009. In 2014, the British Council brought down a component of its Homelands exhibit to be showcased as part of 3rd Biennale. It featured more than 49 works by 20 of the worlds leading British contemporary artists from the British Council Collection.
This was then followed by British Councils instrumental support in securing Assemble - winners of the prestigious UK visual arts Turner Prize - to run a critical part of the Colombo Art Biennales developing community engagement programme in Slave Island. The programme was a success, with enthusiasm from the community and Assemble to see a continuation of engagement at CAB 2018.
Regarding their motivations to get involved in CABs foray in Edinburgh Fringe, British Council Sri Lankas Arts Manager Tanya Warnakulasuriya elaborates in a press release, This exhibition is the perfect choice for this years Edinburgh Fringe Festival which is also its 70th anniversary.
The festival itself came about following the end of World War II as a way to use arts to raise the spirits of the war-torn British people. Sri Lankas RETURN programme shows how Sri Lankas artists have also used their skills and talents to chart Sri Lanka fragile peace and the inevitably rocky road to recovery.
It is a poignant reminder of the power that art has to challenge, question and shine a light on the very essence of peacetime in our world today.
It is thrilling that an estimated 98,000 visitors to Summerhall from all over the world will experience the work of some of our most talented artists this August. This is the kind of exposure that our young artists need so that they can develop their talents further in order to be recognized as global players the way other Asian artists are now being viewed. It is great to be a part of that.

She was one of the naughtiest parents
Princes William and Harry remember their mother Princess Diana
Millions remember her as the fairy tale Royal bride arriving at St Pauls Cathedral for her marriage to Prince Charles, or in sadder times, revealing on television how there were three of us in this marriage.
But for her two sons Princess Diana will always be their mischievous mother, whose love of life and fun was infectious.
The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry speak for the first time about Diana, Princess of Wales, as a mother, in a documentary to be shown later this month, to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.
In it Prince Harry says: This is the first time that the two of us have ever spoken about her as a mother. She was our mum. She still is our mum.
And of course, as a son I would say this, she was the best mum in the world. She smothered us with love, thats for sure. He adds: She was one of the naughtiest parents.
Prince William appears to suggest in the documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, that his mothers sense of fun came in part from her awareness of life beyond the confines of Royal protocol and duty.
The Princes looking through old family albums
She was very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun, says William. She understood that there was a real life outside of Palace walls.
In one particularly poignant scene the two princes are shown leafing through a treasured photograph album put together by their mother and recall some of the most joyful and touching moments from their childhood.
Studying a photo of Diana holding him whilst pregnant with Prince Harry, William says: "Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photograph, youre in the tummy!
In April William and Prince Harry admitted that they failed to talk to each other enough about the death of their mother and that not doing so only made matters worse.
Speaking about the trauma they endured as children when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, the Princes urged people to be more open with their emotions.
The princes acknowledged in a video with the Duchess of Cambridge, released as part of their campaign to tackle mental health in Britain, that they had bottled up their feelings about her death in 1997 rather than sharing them.
The new documentary has been made by Oxford Film and Television, producers of ITVs Our Queen at 90 and was commissioned for ITV by Jo Clinton-Davis, Controller of Factual and Sue Murphy, Head of Factual Entertainment.
Ms Clinton-Davis said: This new ITV film will offer viewers a fresh and revealing insight into Princess Diana through the personal and intimate reflections of her two sons and of her friends and family, many of whom have never spoken before, to bring together a definitive portrait of a unique person who touched the lives of millions.
Nick Kent, the documentary executive producer, added: This film will show Princess Diana in a way she has never been seen before, through the eyes of the two people who knew her best.

Tea can fill void of shifting from carbonate drinks
Tea has and will be an important commodity in the Sri Lankan economy in the future as well and the stakeholders and the government must discus and solve some of the issues in the industry, said Governor Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at the launch of a commemorative Rs10 coin at the Central Bank to mark Tea industrys 150th anniversary he said that there are issues with regard to wages, prices, fertilizer, taxes, branding, research, marketing and these can be solved with all parties coming to discussions.
The Governor recalled that since coffee was replaced by tea it become a main export commodity from Sri Lanka and for nearly a decade the price of a kilogram of tea was considered a key indicator of the economy.
Minister of Finance and Media, Mangala Samaraweera also emphasized the importance of tea and said it was bedrock of the economy and it accounts to 14% of
total agriculture exports.
He said that though Russia and the Gulf are two main export markets for tea the industry would not be able to reap full benefits due to low crude oil prices and other issues they are currently facing. Hence we must look at new markets.
The minister also said today world is shifting away from carbonate drinks and local tea industry can fill in the void with value added innovative tea products.
Minister Navin Dissanyake said that they will look at new markets and would lead a delegation to Iran next month. In addition we will also try to include many clauses where Sri Lanka tea could reap benefits from the proposed China Sri Lanka FTA.
Chairman Sri Lanka Tea Traders Associations Anslem Perera said that they are very thankful to the government for their efforts to assist the tea industry and said that this is the first time that the State came forward to mint a coin for the tea industry.

ALL ABOUT HAPPINESS Serendib perspectives
One part of the day his fingers hold scalpels, surgical scissors, retractors, clamps and suction tips and tubes. He is focused and is in a bid to relieve the pain and bring back happiness into the life spread in front of him on the table. Another time, the same fingers hold paint brushes, paint tubes and an easel. Again he is engrossed in an effort to give life to a flower, bird or a butterfly that caught his eye. This is Dr. Jayaindra Fernando, consultant general surgeon at the Lanka Hospitals where he has been serving since 2002. He will hold an exhibition of his paintings `Serendib perspectives together with his daughter Randhini Fernando this weekend. The exhibition will take place at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery, July 15to 17.
A product of St. Josephs College, Jayaindra Fernando says he started painting as a hobby. I started painting as a hobby. My pictures are inspired by various types of flora and faunaand the natural and historical heritage of Sri Lanka. So they include trees, flowers, birds, butterflies, and archaeological sites.I love to give a lot of details to my paintings. I use water colours, acrylic and ink as the medium, he said.
Jayaindra has held exhibitions in the past, in 1984, 1988 and 2000, in addition to several contributions to other exhibitions. His art has been published in several journals, and he is the co-author of Fruits of Sri Lanka which includes illustrations of 84 fruits.
Speaking of managing professional life as a surgeon while being an artist Jayaindra said the passion and devotion made him handle both areas with success. You have to have the passion and dedication. When you devote your time and plan the things you do well you can achieve your goals. It took me around one and half years to put these paintings together for the exhibition, he added.
I was inspired by travelling around the country a lot with my family.Whenever I see something beautiful I draw a pencil sketch based on what I have seen then later create the art. Art is relaxing and it connects you with the people in various fields. I come across naturalists, historians and many more who are interested in my paintings. We exchange ideas and it enriches my life, Fernando said.
As Sri Lankans we have a responsibility to preserve and protect the nature and there by stopclimate change. Preserving nature is the key to halt climate change. I try to get this message across to people through art. I am ever willing to share my knowledge with anyone who comes across my path, he added.
Creating awareness on natures miracles in this island nation is Jayaindras motive. People are not aware of many places in Sri Lanka. Through the paintings they get to know nature and the life hidden under the dense greenery abundant in our country, he added.
This time the exhibition will take a new look as his daughter, Randhini Fernando will join her father to exhibit her paintings as well. Randhini held her first solo exhibition titled Shades of Lanka back in 2010. Inspired by her father Jayaindra, she says she is a self-taught artist. I started painting from my childhood. I was inspired by my fathers work. I did not follow any course or class to learn art but Im mostly self-taught. I came across a box of pastels that belonged to my grandmother.On that day my journey as an artist began and made me what I am today, she said.
Most of my drawings are of historic places, nature and scenery. As a family we travel a lot. Especially during holidays we go somewhere. On our way when I come across a beautiful place I paint it. So my art works include interesting places from Jaffna to Matara, Nuwaraeliya to Manara. They are from all over the country, she added.
Painting is really relaxing and is quiet thrilling. To be recognized as an artist gives a satisfying feeling. It is exciting to come across my paintings hung in somebody elses house. It gives me a lot of pleasure, Randhini said.
A past pupil of St. Bridgets Convent, Randhini holds a degree in Law and is also a cellist at the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka. When I held my first exhibition I realized that most of the people are not aware of the beauty of our country. They inquire where the places are and it provokes them to go and visit the places in real. That is the objective of my painting. To make people realize that there are so many beautiful places around Sri Lanka and they arebreath taking and rich in our culture, she said.
Finally the aim of the father and the daughter are to make people smile and make them feel happiness. Our paintings are all about happiness. They are not gloomy. We want people to look at the painting and be happy, they said. The duo invites the public to experience the framed happiness at their exhibition and may be you can also carry a piece of that happiness to your home to decorate your walls so that it makes you happy whenever you lay your eyes on it.

Anti-Corruption Secretariat has not delivered results: Rajitha
The Anti-Corruption Secretariat has not delivered results as expected, Co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne said addressing the Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday. The minister explaining as to why the Cabinet did not extend the Secretariats term which had expired on June 30. He said: The government spent Rs. 65 million on the secretariat, but we have not seen it achieve much.
When questioned whether the Government decided to shut the secretariat down, the Health Minister said it was only supposed to be set up for a year.
The Cabinet paper to establish the secretariat was in February 2015. When its term expired in November, it was given another six month extension until June 30, he said.
The minister said the task of the secretariat was to prepare documentation and direct complaints of corruption to other investigating agencies.
We have 14 government agencies to investigate into corruption. What the secretariat needed to do was to prioritise the cases, but they have sent everything to the FCID, the minister said.
The FCID was formed to investigate into large scale corruption, he said.
Meanwhile, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had remarked that given the achievements of the previous regime, its main actors should be forgiven for their corrupt practices. Minister Senaratne responding to the comment, however, said that the Cabinet or ministers had no power to pardon anyone. It was up to the courts to pardon or not, he said.

Closure of Anti-Corruption Secretariat::
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday, expressing his displeasure over the closure of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat, said the move was an attempt to stall investigations into corruption charges against the Government.
The MP addressing a press conference yesterday, predicted the impending closure of the FCID as well.
The Government said the expenditure of the Secretariat was over Rs 400 million. This was not true. Its total expenditure was Rs 32 million. However, through its investigations it helped the Government to earn more money than what it spent. The Government could find Rs 159 million by taking over the CSN as a result of the investigations carried out. The value of the Malwana land, which was taken over to the Government, is also over Rs 300 million, he said.
The closure of the Secretariat came at a time it was about to investigate on the corruption charges against the members of this Government. The next in the line would be the FCID, he noted.

Ban manpower agencies: ICEU

The Inter Company Employees Union (ICEU) today urged the government to take necessary measures to ban the recruitment of workers through manpower agencies.
Addressing the media today at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), Maradana General Secretary of the ICEU Janaka Adikari said that the Inter Company Employees Union will not hesitate to take stern trade union action and use the full power to solve this issue if the Government does not solve it soon.
He stressed that they are ready to take all possible measures that could be taken within the democratic framework to put an end to this menace. 
He charged that the illegal manpower slavery system has become a threat to the basic trade union rights of the employers.
He said that the rights to form and join trade unions, to collectively bargain and to strike are universal human rights. The manpower agencies completely violate these basic labor rights of these workers.
Man power workers are afraid to voice their opinion as it would put their employment in danger since any protest could lead to a transfer or losing the opportunity to work at that company. This system has created a safer environment for the employers to get the maximum use of manpower workers without fulfilling their basic labor rights. Manpower agencies sell people to the companies and earn money.
Profit making is the only purpose of hiring workers from manpower agencies. Under this system the real employer of the company become free from the responsibility of labor rights. They have limited access to social protection, receive low wages and have substantial obstacles in joining a trade union or bargaining collectively.
Hiring workers from manpower agencies has been common practice in the private sector. Companies prefer hiring manpower workers since it is convenient for them as there are no direct responsibilities towards these workers.
The government is also promoting this and some state institutions such as Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), state banks, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Water Board and the Central Bank have begun widely recruiting manpower workers.
Some claims that recruiting workers through manpower agencies is a legal process which is coming under the fee-charging employment ordinance. Though there is an Act call fee-charging employment act, no regulations have been gazetted so far to make it effective the Act. The prevailing procedure of registering companies has created background for anybody to start a manpower company without mentioning their purpose.

Brazil's ex-President Lula convicted of corruption

Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to nine and a half years in prison.
The judge ruled he could remain free pending an appeal.
Lula has rejected claims that he received an apartment as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to state oil company Petrobras.
He says the trial is politically motivated and has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
The case is the first of five charges against him.
Running again
Lula served eight years as president until 2011 and has expressed interest in running again in next year's elections for the left-wing Workers' Party.
On Wednesday, a judge found him guilty of accepting bribes from engineering firm OAS in the form of a beachfront apartment in return for his help in winning contracts with the state oil company.
In a statement, Lula's lawyers insisted he was innocent and said they would appeal.
"For more than three years Lula has been subject to a politically motivated investigation. No credible evidence of guilt has been produced, and overwhelming proof of his innocence blatantly ignored," they wrote.
The head of the Workers' Party, Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, also hit out at the ruling, saying it was designed to stop Lula standing for office.
She said the party would protest against the decision.
The BBC's Katy Watson in Rio says Lula remains a popular politician and the sentence will deeply divide Brazil.
The charges Lula faces relate to the Car Wash scandal, the nickname for Brazil's biggest ever corruption probe.
What is Operation Car Wash
Operation Car Wash was launched three years ago amid escalating public anger over political corruption.
The investigation centres on firms that were allegedly offered deals with Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and party slush funds.
Lula, a former steel worker turned union leader, came to office as the first left-wing leader in Brazil in nearly half a century.
He was Brazil's most popular president during his tenure - former US President Barack Obama labelled him the most popular politician on Earth.
Unable to stand for a third consecutive term, he was succeeded by close ally Dilma Rousseff,who was later impeached.
Current President Michel Temer also faces corruption allegations and is resisting calls for him to step down.

A break with the past
The claim made by Minister Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa that the Yahapalanaya government had no intention of buying over any member of the SLFP group in the government who intends joining the Joint Opposition, if genuine, is refreshing news indeed. We say this, because, down the years, the voters had been reduced to helplessness, as politicians, whom they have sent to parliament from one party, have gone on to pledge their loyalties to another party, usually, the party in power, kicking against their mandate with nary a thought to their electors. In the end, it is the public who had to pick up the tab for the perks and privileges showered on these turncoats. For, there can be no other reason than the filthy lucre that had always been the motivating force that had lured these men and women to sell their souls for a mess of pottage throwing overboard all principals, ethics and accepted norms held sacrosanct.
Addressing a media conference at his Ministry, Minister Soysa said that rumours were afloat that 18 members of the SLFP group in the government were to sit with the Joint Opposition. However those named as possible poll vaulters had met him and assured that no such thing would ever take place. True, there had been some unrest among the SLFP MPs in the government, but nothing so bad as that which could not be ironed out. No minister or deputy minister would join the Joint Opposition as they have joined the government voluntarily to take forward the policies of the Yahapalanaya government, the minister asserted. In any event, the government was not going to offer would be crossovers any form of privileges and neither will there be any horse deals to retain their support, he added.
In the past, it had been the practise for those MPs who had been overlooked for ministerial office to sound off their intention to crossover to the Opposition from the government ranks. Unlike under the old electoral system, when the ruling party commanded huge majorities, making such crossovers insignificant, under the PR system, with close finishes (and sometimes even a photo finish), a crossover or two may well tip the scales, thus keeping governments ever vigilant as to their numbers. This scenario came to a head in 2001, when some ministers in the Chandrika government switched sides, to trigger a collapse of her regime. It is not clear what perks and privileges were offered to these renegades, that included Prof. G.L. Peiris. But they all received top portfolios under the UNP government that followed.
Such a scenario would not have obtained in the 70-77 and 77-89 parliaments due to the sheer numbers in terms of the majority obtained by both governments, so much so that JRJ even enjoyed the luxury of obtaining letters of resignation from his MPs knowing none would dare challenge him give the five sixth majority he commanded. The only exception to this rule was 1964 when there was a mass crossover from the Sirima Bandaranaike government to the Opposition, led by C.P.De Silva, against the Press Council Bill, the only occasion a government was defeated under the old first past the post system when the ruling party commanded an overwhelming majority.
On the contrary, the precarious balance in parliament in 2000 when Chandrika attempted to ram in her famous package saw a musical chairs of sorts with MPs crossing the floor, either way, with monotonous regularity for the duration of the debate that saw copies of the draft constitution set on fire in the House. This was the first attempt made to change the 1978 Constitution which came a cropper with CBK failing to muster the required two thirds majority, try as she might, by buying over UNPers. On the other hand, Mahinda Rajapaksa had no difficulty in luring as much as 18 UNP MPs to obtain the magical figure to amend the constitution to remove presidential term limits and in the process, for the first time creating a parliament of ministers (from the ruling party).
Be that as it may, the Ministers assurance, if put into practice, will not only see an end to the pork barrel politics that is in vogue in the present day, but would also ensure that the voters are not cheated by MPs, whom they sent to parliament from one party, switching loyalties for the rich pickings. It is not just filthy lucre that is on offer, but other means too where a politicians loyalties can be bought over. One recalls how a notorious provincial councilor who was arraigned for rape being let off the look under the Rajapaksa regime on condition that he switched allegiance to the ruling party. Nor how a onetime ministers wife, who was on death row for the murder of his (ministers) mistress, was granted a Presidential Pardon when the minister concerned was poised for the poll vault.
This quid pro quo politics has to be put to an end and it is hoped that Minister Soysa has fired the first salvo in this regard.

Case against Dhammaloka Thera re-fixed for trial
The case against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence, was yesterday re-fixed for trial on October 24 by Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne.
Both defence and prosecution sought a further date citing that the authorities are yet to formulate a national policy regarding illegally caught wild elephants.
In January 2015, then Wildlife Deputy Minister Wasantha Senanayake had made a complaint to the Criminal Investigations Department regarding a racket where illegally caught wild elephant calves being sold to third parties. The prosecution had named the former Wildlife Deputy Minister as the first witness.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka, an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General over an offence of possessing an elephant without valid licence following the amendments to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in 2009.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed an indictment against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a licence.
The indictment has been filed over two counts come under section 22 (12) of the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No.22 of 2009 and section 5(3) (a) of the Public Property Act. The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses and three documents as production items in the case.
Wildlife Department officials had taken into custody a two and half year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
The Attorney General maintained that Dhammaloka Thera had illegally possessed a stolen property, a baby elephant without a valid licence, an offence comes under the Fauna and Flora Act. The Attorney General further alleged that the accused had also committed a punishable offence under the Public Property Act since he had intentionally kept a baby elephant without a licence. The Attorney General alleged that the accused had committed this offence on or around January 28, 2015 with the Colombo High Courts jurisdiction.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Prasantha Lal de Alwis appeared for the accused.

Chandimal, Tharanga to take over roles played by Mathews
Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga were named as Test and ODI and T20I captains after Angelo Mathews stepped down as captain from all three formats.
Twenty-seven-old Chandimal who has appeared for his country in 36 Tests was named as captain of the Sri Lanka Test side. He will mark his debut as captain when he leads the team in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe starting at the R Premadasa Stadium tomorrow.
Chandimal is the 15th player to captain Sri Lanka since the country achieved Test status in 1982.
Likewise 32-year-old Tharanga has been entrusted with the responsibility of leading the Sri Lanka one-day and T20 teams. A veteran of 207 ODIs, left-hander Tharanga has captained his country in 14 ODIs prior to this appointment. Chandimal a prolific scorer in ODIs last year was left out of the recently concluded five-match series that Sri Lanka lost 3-2 to Zimbabwe, but has unexpectedly found favour with the selection committee.
Chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya explaining Chandimals sudden elevation to the Test captaincy said, He was in our plans for the Tests but he had some issues with regard to ODIs so we did not pick him. Its a temporary setback every player goes through a setback in any format of the game. There are little things that he needs to fine tune in ODIs and he knows what is required of him.
I am sure he will do that. He is the senior player we have and he has been in the system for some time. We have confidence in him.
Jayasuriya paid a glowing tribute to Tharanga, who was his one-time opening partner and with whom he still holds the current world record opening partnership in ODIs (286 v England at Leeds, 2006). Upul is a cricketer who has batted from 1-6 in the order and I have felt sorry for him as a former player. He has taken up all the challenges thrown at him and even sacrificed his place to a youngster which is as good example for every cricketer.
Upul has shown 100 percent commitment to Sri Lanka cricket and we believe he is the best man for the job, said Jayasuriya.
In the current year Tharanga is Sri Lankas leading run getter in ODIs with 591 runs (avg. 53.72) at a healthy strike rate of 95.16.
Jayasuriya also had a word of praise for veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who had stood in as Test captain at times when Mathews and Chandimal were both injured.
Herath led Sri Lanka to Test series victory in Zimbabwe and to a drawn series against Bangladesh at home.

Keep our nation clean
Almost all the newspapers are blasting on the hot issue, presently, regarding the garbage menace and its disposal in our country. However, the media howl that people are still more ignorant and negligent and not at all serious about the seriousness of the matter by themselves.
They fail to realise the utmost annihilation of the country on a long run. I have noticed the plethora of times many an individual blindly throw polythene bags, lunch sheets, plastic bottles, cans after drinking juice or soda, food wastages, cigarette butts etc on streets.
The worst part of it is spitting on the middle of roads which is an intolerable scene. Especially betel chewers and others do not bother whether the people are on the way. When they spit out while they are riding bicycle, motorbike, or driving the bus, the saliva will be spotted over the body/dress because of the wind blow, on the commuters travelling or walking behind and along the paths.
This is the ugliest and unhygienic practice that I have always seen and faced personally in my day-to-day journey. These are the main factors for spreading non-communicable diseases. Top of all, it is sad to say, even our educated people too, exercise such mean ways. This clearly indicates that, in general, people of our country have less concern about their surroundings. The skills like protecting and beautifying our environment, our nation and valuing human beings should be practised from everyones early childhood.
Such mannerisms and dexterity cannot be earned overnight.
As the proverb says, charity begins at home. Every single moral practice and etiquette should be moulded and trained by parents at home, then from the teachers of schools at the very beginning stage of life. The tender age is prominently easier to inculcate the good habits as actions speak louder than words. If the elders set an example for the younger generation rather than preaching or teaching they would follow their steps.
All in all, each and every citizen of the country must have the bounden duty to protect and keep their own nation clean. A watched pot never boils. Likewise, just reading these incidents as interesting news and speaking plainly about Meethottamulla garbage catastrophe throughout the year would never end, until the words wheel into motion and deeds.

Colombo port to re-brand
Under the guidance of the Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has launched an exercise towards total re-branding of the Port of Colombo with a global marketing plan. The first meeting was convened by the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) with the stakeholders to draw a marketing plan to discuss an action plan in this regard.
The top management of JCT, CICT and SAGT participated at this initial kick off session of the project held at the SLPA.
The Port of Colombo has shown a double digit growth last year. However this has slowed down this year to a single digit. Although a 6% growth is still healthy in comparison with the trade growth, an aggressive marketing approach could increase the market share of Colombo.
Towards this end it has become necessary to re-brand the port and to develop a sustainable marketing plan. Marketing individual terminals in as isolated manner needs to be replaced by the Global marketing strategy that promotes Colombo as one Terminal. Different terminals whilst competing for business using quality of service and cost as tools, should also be complementary to each other in working as one port. This is important in an environment where the mergers and acquisitions by major lines have made capacity of individual Terminals inadequate in facing the demand. The acquisition, mergers and the formation of alliances by major shipping lines resulting in introducing larger ships and new services has become both a threat and an opportunity.
The proposal is also an inclusive approach as it will involve all stakeholders in developing the marketing plan.
The new platform will re-brand and market the Port of Colombo with the participation of both public and private sector enabling fast tracking of the development of the Port of Colombo.
The SriLanka Ports Authority (SLPA) will act as the leading player in the process as the regulator and land load of all commercial ports in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Constitutional impasse !

Constitutional impasse !
Among the main priorities of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and their National Unity government was the task of enacting a new Constitution to replace the nearly forty-year-old Constitution introduced by former President J. R. Jayewardene which ushered in an executive presidential system of government in the country.
Although the three Presidents from the United National Party (UNP) who held office, Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and D. B. Wijetunge did nothing to diminish the powers of the Presidency, the three Presidents from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena all promised to abolish or modify the Presidency.
Kumaratunga called the 1978 Constitution a bahubootha (nonsensical) Constitution and pledged to repeal it but did not do so. Rajapaksa promised to modify it but in fact went on to strengthen the powers of the Executive President, amending it through the 18th Amendment to remove the two-term limit on an individual to hold the office of President.
President Maithripala Sirisena, whose presidential election campaign was born out of the campaign of Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Theras movement to abolish the executive presidential system of government, pledged to reform the Presidency, pruning its powers and making it responsible to Parliament.
Amendment to the Constitution
Indeed, President Sirisena and the National Unity government has already pruned some of the powers of the Presidency, restoring the two-term limit on an individual and reducing the term of office from six years to five years through the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
The process of drafting a new Constitution has now been in the pipeline for some months. This has been slow because the government has been keen to obtain the views of as many stakeholders as possible. Two key areas in the process- apart from reforming the Presidency- are changes to the electoral system and the devolution of powers that will redress the grievances of ethnic minorities.
However, the entire country was taken by surprise when the Buddhist clergy, spearheaded by the Asgiriya Chapter in Kandy, issued a statement a week ago, declaring that there was no need for a new Constitution. They also raised the issue with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances Bill being presented in Parliament, wanting it deferred.
The special Sangha Council which met to issue the statement was attended by the Mahanayakas of three Nikayas and seventy-five other leading Buddhist prelates. It was the most direct intervention yet by the clergy into the affairs of the government, since the National Unity government assumed office.
However, it will be recalled that two weeks prior to this statement, the Karaka Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya Chapter had issued a statement under the hand of the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, the Most Venerable Warakagoda Gnanaratana Thera noting what it called were concerns about the challenges posed by internal and external conspiracies against Sinhala Buddhists.
Muslim community
What raised eyebrows in that statement was its tacit endorsement of the sentiments of the radical Buddhist monk, Venerable Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera and his self-styled Buddhist Army, the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) organisation, although it said it did not approve of the manner in which the Venerable Thera had conducted himself.
Although we do not approve the aggressive behaviour and speech of Bhikkhu Galagodaatte Gnanasara, the viewpoint expressed by him cannot be discarded. Insulting Bhikkhus by various groups without inquiring into the veracity of the issues raised by him cannot be condoned, that statement from the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter said.
Many were taken by surprise at this stance because Venerable Gnanasara Thera, openly inciting racial hatred against the Muslim community, was wanted by courts and was a fugitive. Days after the statement from the Asgiriya Chapter, the Venerable Thera who had alleged that there were death threats against him, surrendered to two separate courts and was granted bail twice on the same day.
What the two declarations made by the Buddhist clergy in Kandy revealed was that there was a significant difference of opinion between them and those in government. While the issue of Venerable Gnanasara Theras conduct is a matter of concern, it pales into insignificance against the greater issue regarding amending the Constitution, which is at the core of the Governments agenda.
Indeed, it could be argued that, at the last presidential election, the people of the country preferred Maithripala Sirisena over the incumbent, all-powerful President Mahinda Rajapaksa because they desired a departure from the oligarchy that was controlling all aspects of the countrys public life, an oligarchy made possible only because of the 1978 Constitution.
To now interrupt the process of constitutional reform would be to abandon the very reason why the government was voted into office. On the other hand, the sentiments of the Buddhist clergy could not be disregarded because they wield considerable influence over the vast majority of voters who are Sinhalese Buddhists. If ignored, it could result in disastrous political consequences.
To deal with this conundrum is a difficult task for the Government. Towards resolving this issue, President Sirisena visited Kandy soon after. He was accompanied by the Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who has acquired a reputation for his pro-Sinhala Buddhist sentiments within the UNP parliamentary group.
There, President Sirisena informed the Mahanayaka Theras of the three Nikayas and other Sangha Sabhas that a new commission and a special committee would be appointed to look into proposed Constitutional reforms. It is understood the President explained the rationale of the Governments course of action and assured that measures would be in place to safeguard the foremost status of Buddhism that is now guaranteed under Article 9 of the present Constitution.
Days later, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe echoed the same sentiments. Speaking at the opening of the weli maluwa at Ruwaneweliseya in Anuradhapura over the weekend, the Prime Minister stated that provisions would be included in the new Constitution that would prohibit Governments from interfering with the internal matters of three main Buddhist Chapters.
Political parties
While the Government was attempting to defuse what could be a political crisis, other political parties were also querying the stance of the Buddhist clergy. The Mahanayakes have decided to oppose a new Constitution without any knowledge of its contents, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake declared. The JVP, he said, was not opposed to a new Constitution.
Meanwhile, The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) urged the Government to hold a referendum and place the issue of the new Constitution before the people. TNA parliamentarian M. Sumanthiran stated that the decision on a new Constitution should ultimately rest with the people and hence a referendum should be held if necessary.
Surprisingly, the Joint Opposition (JO) has not come out in force, opposing a new Constitution. It has its own dilemma. The current Constitution, with the 19th Amendment in force, debars Mahinda Rajapaksa from running for President again. Therefore, as long as the present Constitution is operative, Rajapaksa will have to play second fiddle- and that is not a prospect the JO relishes.
In contrast, if the present Constitution is replaced, the powers of the Executive President are further pruned and are replaced by an executive Prime Minister; Rajapaksa could be back in the driving seat. This could explain the JOs muted response to the declaration in Kandy.
It was also noted by many observers that opposition to a new Constitution at this stage was somewhat premature because the draft of a new Constitution has not been released yet. There were many proposals under consideration and there was no draft Constitution as such.
To its credit, the government has not abandoned the project of reforming the Constitution. In fact, all indications are that it is going ahead with the process, with greater input from the Buddhist clergy. In this process, it would do well to note that a continuous dialogue with the clergy will be helpful. This was also noted by the JVP which said the clergy had not been well informed by the government.
Indications are that the government will continue with its efforts to draft and present a new Constitution. Now, in addition to obtaining a two-thirds majority in Parliament, it has to convince the Buddhist clergy that a new Constitution is both necessary and essential. That will be challenging, especially if chauvinistic opposition political forces band together and decide to gain political mileage.

Dambulla Viharaya must be conserved if it is to retain world heritage status: PM
It is essential to conserve the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya if the historic site is to retain its world heritage status, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a group of young Buddhist monks who met him at Temple Trees yesterday (12).
The Government is prepared to stop the conservation work if the Maha Naya Theras want it stopped. However, it is up to the Maha Nayakas to decide the fate of this historical site. It is unfortunate if the Cave Temple Complex is to lose this status at a time UNESCO is considering the declaration of several other Sri Lankan sites including Horton Plains as world heritage sites, Primier Wickremesinghe said.
PM Wickremesinghe said that the UNESCO has informed Sri Lanka to prepare a report regarding the Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya within 2017.
The Premier also said that he would meet the Asgiriya Maha Nayake Thera next week to explain the matters regarding the issue.
PM Wickremesinghe also said some people attempt to politicise the issue targeting the next election.

Developing counter-terrorism measures is challenging: Sagala

Developing counter terrorism legislature anywhere in the world is challenging and it is a fine balance to ensure that it meets counter terrorism measures while not giving rise to human rights abuses, said Minister of Law and Order, Sagala Ratnayake today while addressing the opening of the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting held at Galle Face Hotel.
In April, this year Cabinet approved a framework for a new Counter Terrorism Act to replace the existing Prevention of Terrorism Act and despite the challenges, the Minister said the new Act would help deal with the latest challenges of global terrorism. 
It is unlikely that a pluralistic community like Sri Lanka with a history it has gone through will ever agree with a uniform definition of terrorism, said Minister Ratnayake but explained that they had sought consultations with a wide variety of members of both the security establishment as well as human rights lawyers to strike a good balance.
We have also invitedUnited Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Emmersonto visit Sri Lanka from the 10-14 July to gather information first hand on the initiatives taken to deal with counter terrorism while promoting and protecting human rights, he added. 
As the region enveloped by terrorism and drug trafficking looks to work together to curb its spread, Sri Lanka, the minister said Sri Lanka had been successful in steering the conversation towards dealing with the spread of narcotics and psychotropic substances within SAARC.
Within Sri Lanka however we have been unsuccessful in curbing the menace and we need to tackle the scourge at home. The governments goal is to reduce the drug menace to minimum levels by 2020 through a strategy of supply control and demand reduction, he said.

FNO urges govt to heed Maha Sanghas advice
Members of the Federation of the National Organization (FNO) urged the government to listen to the voice of the Maha Sanga without insulting them, aiming to suppress their voice.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera of the FNO said the Maha Sanga raise their voice not against the government but against its people and acts against the country.
Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera made these remarks while addressing the media in Colombo. The government should listen to the Maha Sanga especially to the Most Venerable Chief Prelates of the three Chapters. But the government has been insulting the Maha Sanga using its henchmen, the Thera said.
Ven. Abhayatissa Thera requested President Maithripala Sirisena to take action against these yes-men who insult the Maha Sanga. The Thera added that the government should not implement a new Constitution, which may harm ethnic harmony and territorial integrity.
The country does not need a new Constitution which divides it, the Thera noted.Addressing the media, Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekara said the government is trying to implement the 13th Amendment of the Constitution under the guise of introducing a new Constitution.
Bringing a new Constitution means empowering the 13th Amendment, he said.
Ven. Malewana Dharmavijaya Thera said the government is duty-bound to uphold territorial integrity.
When asked whether the FNO is leveling baseless allegations against an imagined new Constitution which has not even been prepared or finalized yet, assuming that it will introduce a federal system, Ven.
Abhayatissa Thera replied that they are well aware of the new Constitution that will be implemented by the government. It will harm territorial integrity as the new Constitution will outline a federal system.

Former South African Deputy Chief Justice visits National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry
Former South African Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, Commonwealth Secretariat Head of Human Rights Advocate Karen McKenzie and South African Political Counsellor Johannes Van Niekerk, visited the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation recently.
According to Justice Dikgang Moseneke, in our system, everybody has the right to be Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, or even without religion. The constitution specially protects these rights. Justice also emphasized on unity in diversity, mutual respect and co-existence as important element for reconciliation. Most of the violence in South Africa is due to poverty, exclusion and disintegration of families.
Justice Dikgang Moseneke also spoke about reaching the consensus on constitution on South African experiences. However, though there were challenges, common value of unity in diversity, reconciliation, democracy, fundamental rights and freedom helped to overcome the challenges. The Constitution of South Africa recognized rights not based on religion or ethnicity, but gave protection to minorities based on equity, dignity, without discrimination.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa examined as to how people disappeared or were killed and how to address such pains. Reparation for victims is one of the pillars in transitional justice that helped victims to receive compensation.
The transitional justice is different from the normal justice and it was aimed at buying peace. Amnesty was given to ex-combatants and they were socially integrated. Women's participation in all areas of transitional justice and constitutional reforms was given importance. In South Africa, 35-40% of the women are in the Parliament, said Justice Dikgang Moseneke.
Non-recurrence and memorialization were also important in the reconciliation process. Local peace committees in South Africa helped to keep violence and tension down and solve burning issues.
The Justice further said that transforming the conflict into peaceful and sustainable outcome requires comprehensive understanding of the root causes of conflict. Conflict mediation and conflict resolution in hot spot districts are also important.
Healing and reparation are one of the most important element for reconciliation.
The Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation presented the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) of the Ministry. The interventions and initiatives were commended by the Former Justice Dikgang Moseneke and Commonwealth Secretariat Head of Human Rights Advocate Karen McKenzie.
The meeting was attended by Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy, State Secretary M.M. Zuhair, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation Additional Secretary, representatives from Ministry of National Co-Existence Dialogue and Official Languages and the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM).

Gnanasara Theras FR petition re-fixed for support
The Supreme Court yesterday re-fixed for support, a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera.
He sought a declaration that the order given by the Homagama Magistrate to keep him in remand custody is unlawful and a violation of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution.
The petition will be taken up for support on October 9.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
In his petition, Gnanasara Thera maintained that the statement made by him when getting ready to leave Court on January 25, 2016 addressing complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda, can in no way amount to be a threat made to injure a person or her reputation, nor can it be said that the statement so made would cause alarm to a person.
The petitioner stated that on a complaint by Sandhya Ekneligoda on January 25, 2016 to Homagama Police, the first respondent, OIC Miscellaneous Complaints had arrested him and produced him before the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 26.
Gnanasara Thera stated that complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda after attending the Magistrates Court was getting ready to leave Court when he told her, Thoge miniha LTTE karayek uu malane, tho hingakapiya.
The petitioner stated that Police alleged that he had committed an offence under section 486 of the Penal Code.
He said upon being produced, the petitioner was remanded by the Magistrate until February 9. He was again remanded until February 10.
He stated that police further alleged that he had committed offences under section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act of No. 4 of 20. He said he was ordered to be further remanded until February 23.
The petitioner maintained that there was no justifiable reason for the Magistrate to make an order of remand with the statement so made in as much as such statement does not constitute an offence under section 483 of the Penal Code and section 8 (1) (a) of the Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act.
The Attorney-at-Law who filed this petition on behalf of Gnanasara Thera moved Court that the petition be taken up for support on March 16, 17 or 18.

Hazardous Trans fat found in adulterated coconut oil sold in market
The sample testing carried out by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) on directive of the President on palm oil available in the Sri Lanka market has reveal that it contains high level of Trans fat that is very hazardous to the human body.
The test has revealed that every sample of palm oil consisted of 0.50-1.39% of Trans fat which has been identified as the main cause of heart attracts in Sri Lanka. It was also disclosed that none of the oil samples complied with SLS Standards. The Palm oil samples did not comply with its relevant SLS 720:2016 Standard and the Palm Olein did not match with the SLS 961:2016 Standard. Moreover it was revealed that most of the oil sold in the market under the name Palm oil was actually Olein oil sold in the guise of Palm oil.
With coconut and coconut oil been part and parcel of Sri Lankan food from yesteryear this has raised alarm bells among health circles because it is no secret that coconut oil adulteration is taking place in mass scale in Sri Lanka. Large quantities of cheap palm oil which contains Trans fat is continued to be imported into Sri Lanka and unscrupulous oil traders conveniently mix this cheap oil with coconut oil. This adulterated coconut oil is being sold in the market for a lesser price as a means of attracting consumers.
Research has revealed that coconut oil consists of Lauric Acid which is available in breast milk, a body immunizing element. Coconut oil is now considered a oil with health benefits, but the Sri Lankan public is being deprived the benefits of coconut oil due to fact that vendors have been given a free hand to mix this very health hazardous palm oil to produce cheap adulterated coconut oil which occupies over 85 percent on the consumer market.
Murthaza Lukmanjee, Managing Director, Adamjee Marketing said most Sri Lankans buy and consume adulterated oil unconsciously and some consciously because of the price factor, but if the dealer can educate and sell those to the consumer, even if it has a small difference in price it will immensely help the community to sustain good health. Similarly, Lukmanjee said the consumer too has a responsibility to find out whether they were buying a good quality product or not.
Manjula Rathnayaka, Head of Operations and Sales Manager Vending Department, Adamjee Marketing (Pvt) Ltd (AML) said they have taken measures to protect their coconut oil products from vendors who adulterate coconut oil by introducing a unique tamper- proof method.
He said that to arrest the adulteration of their high quality pure coconut oil, even at the hands of the retailer, the company has introduced coconut oil tanks called Oil Master with a tamper-proof seal, at all retail points where they supply their coconut oil. These tanks have an opening on top where the oil is filled and once the oil is filled, the top opening is sealed by AML. The vendor can only pour oil out to sell and is prevented from inserting anything to adulterate the contents inside the tank. When replenishments are needed, ALM would break open the seal, fill the Oil Master and re-seal it.
Rathnayaka said that they are supplying the retailers with 140 litre foolproof tanks and now have more than 200 such tanks in shops all over the country. Meanwhile coconut oil retailers say customers have expressed satisfaction with the pure coconut oil they purchase from the Oil Master which consists a tamper-proof seal .
Customers too could purchase the Coco+ White Coconut Oil with a guarantee of purity, though the price is little higher than the adulterated stuff. Adamjee Lukmanjee & Sons (Pvt) Ltds large coconut oil factory which is situated at Grandpass is an ultra modern factory and there is no hand operation from the copra feeding point to the finished oil that is stored in the gigantic tanks. Only at the feeding point copra is inserted by hand. He said they were involved in various promotional activities and meeting consumer groups to educate them on the use and supply of coco plus white coconut oil .
Adamjee Lukmanjee Group Chairman Khazaima T Gulam said the sustainability of their business is mostly dependent on the consistent quality products that they manufacture and that they will never compromise on that. The prime idea in introducing the unique tamper- proof method was to protect the Sri Lankan coconut oil consumer from adulterated oils which were very health hazardous.
Pure coconut oil can be used as a medicine if not adulterated. The ancient Ayurvedic texts clearly highlight the attributes of Coconut Oil and the numerous illnesses that could be cured by its use. Adulterating, bleaching or adding chemicals to coconut oil is unethical and harmful to the health.
The benefit of using organic vegetables and food is completely negated if adulterated Coconut Oil is used in the cooking rendering absolutely no benefit to the public and conversely poisonous elements entering the human body.

A high-powered National Agency for Public Private Partnership was appointed to fast-track Sri Lankas economic development agenda, yesterday.
The Cabinet granted approval to appoint former BOI Chairman and business professional Thilan Wijesinghe as the head of the new agency.
The Cabinet paper with regard to the establishment of the new agency was jointly submitted by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema. The new agency will replace the division which operated under the Finance Ministry to handle certain areas with regard to Public Private Partnerships (PPP).
At the weekly Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Cabinet members observed that a division of a ministry was inadequate to carry out the functions of promoting and executing projects based on PPPs, as it had only limited authority.
Under the new arrangement, PPP agreements will be carried out by this national agency with adequate legal, administrative and financial authority. It will also have additional powers to identify suitable projects based on feasibility studies and maintain a project pipeline in consultation with government ministries.
According to the Cabinet decision on Tuesday, the board of directors of the new agency will consist of seven professionals with vast experience in the public and private sectors. The cabinet also decided to allocate Rs. 100 million from the Treasury to meet initial expenses when setting up the agency.

Interdicted EPF Chief Dealer takes the heat on witness box
The credibility of former Chief Dealer of the EPF B.H.I. Saman Kumara, who was interdicted recently (10), was relentlessly attacked when he stood before the commission to testify, yesterday.
Saman Kumara is the former Chief Dealer of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) who purchased Perpetual Treasury Bonds from the secondary market for the EPF. Pan Asia Bank was the intermediary.
The EPF could have brought the bonds from Primary Market instead of the secondary market.
Saman Kumaras personal life and details of his professional life where many questionable transactions had taken place were put on record by Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera.
At the initial stage of questioning Saman Kumara was asked whether he is aware of the gravity of giving false evidence under oath.He said he does not have the necessary legal knowledge regarding such. Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said a witness who provides false evidence could be prosecuted and be imprisoned under the Penal Code.
According to the evidence led before the Commission, Saman Kumara and his family members own assets exceeding Rs. 80 million while owning a chain of businesses and shares in the stock market. It was revealed that he holds 19 accounts in nine different banks. He and his family members also holds accounts worth more than Rs ten million. Saman Kumara has also done transactions with Primary Dealers such as HSBC and the NDB in the Treasury bond market. He has very recently purchased a fuel bowser tank as well.
Justice Jayawardena asked the witness whether he has failed to provide an assets declaration to the Central Bank, to which Saman Kumara answered in affirmative. He said he failed to provide assets declarations for two years. Justice Jayawardena said, a well-planned businessman as he is, he cannot say that he failed to provide the documents. Justice Jayawardena asked isnt there a case against his regarding the same matter at present, to which the witness answered in affirmative as well. Justice Jayawardena pointed out that another case could be filed against him at the magistrate courts if the necessity occurs.
The Commission ordered Saman Kumara to hand over the passports of his and all his family members to the Commission by today (13) morning. Commissioners also ordered Saman Kumara to hand over a phone he used few years back within a two weeks time.
The Commission asked Saman Kumara whether he would like to add his comments to the testimony, to which the witness said yes. He said there is a conspiracy within the Central Bank against him. Saman Kumara said a Deputy Governor is behind the conspiracy.
As a result of this conspiracy, the witness said he was not summoned before the COPE committee or the Auditor Generals Department who were investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Saman Kumara said he has been promoting the auction method from 2014, since it is more a transparent than the direct placement method. Saman Kumara also said he admired former Governor Mahendran for the changes he introduced to the Central Bank. The witness also said that he is able to provide information with data, regarding all the discrepancies that took place at the Employees Provident Fund.
The Commission gave permission to Saman Kumara to seek legal counsel when he appears before the Commission next Monday (17). The Commission requested him to give an honest and truthful testimony.
Earlier in the morning Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Chairman, Justice K.T. Chithrasiri ordered Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries Nihal Fernando PC to desist from confusing a witness. Pan Asia Bank DGM Richard Dias who was on the witness stand was cross examined by Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries Romali Tudawe and Nihal Fernando PC. During the evidence it was revealed that Nimal Perera the former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank had bought bonds in his personal capacity and using another company under him.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera led evidence for the day.
It was revealed at the Commission that there have been more parties involved in the selling of the questioned Treasury bonds in the secondary market. The Commission instructed Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake to find out who these involved parties are.The Commission also said these parties will also be summoned if necessity arises.

Lady  Luminary
A sage was born over two millennia ago and walked over the lotus to inspire a whole world. On the same day, a lady lotus was born too and trod the path behind him.
He was Siddhartha. She was Yasodhara. Everybody in this land knows their tale.
Historical figures never cease to animate and invigorate the entertainment industry. In Sri Lanka, films with Buddhist themes are still a trend, on the verge of being trite. Professor Sunil Ariyaratne maintains his academic credentials elsewhere. Yet he has earned a household signature in the local movie enterprise with more than twenty works under his belt. He dwells in themes of varied interests. He reaches the familiar trend with a historical figure least spoken about: Yasodhara. The movie muhurat was held a few months ago.
Scenes from Yasodhara
The initial challenge before Professor Ariyaratne and his producer, H D Premasiri, was casting the lead characters of the movie: Siddhartha and Yasodhara.
Our aim to find two suitable artistes from India to play the roles of Siddhartha and Yasodhara finally succeeded. Siddharthas role is played by A Chaudhary who was born in Uttar Pradesh. Pallavi Subhash, born in Maharashtra, plays the role of Yasodhara, said H D Premasiri.
Added he: We all believed that it is better to avoid well known local actors and actresses. The audiences preconceived notions about the actors will damage the image of these noble personalities. Our criterion was that whoever acts these prominent figures should maintain their decorum.
The Indian pair was subject to a strict audition.
Pallavi Subash who hails from Maharashtra province made her debut as a model.
Later on, she switched to teledramas where she played several leading roles. Pallavi has performed in more than 12 Marathi films but came into limelight with her role of Dharma in Chakrawarthi Asoka tele-series. Rukmini, the character she played in mythological series Mahabharat was also highly acclaimed by the TV audience. Her contribution to the commercial advertising field as a model has also been highlighted. She holds a degree in B Com.
We were like a family for the 45 days. I would never forget that period in my life. Its like being with my family. I have performed in various historical movies, but this is my first time playing the title role. It is one beautiful opportunity, Pallavi remarked.
She went on to explain how hard it is to approach a producer or a director in the Indian cinema. The Sri Lankan experience was quite the opposite. They could work in close relationship with both director and producer.
A Chaudri entered the scene as a happy accident following a series of fruitless auditions. Both Professor Ariyaratne and Premasiri were not satisfied with the actors they had auditioned in India. But then they ran into Chaudri who was finally tasked with the job.
Chaudhary has won many public accolades for his acting and modelling in Indian cinema. His enthusiasm for academic studies in performing arts helped broaden his horizons following several courses conducted by Western acting schools. Two years experience with Lancaster Grand Theatre as an actor and specialising in acting techniques at the Actors Temple in London added a feather to his cap. He played a leading role in British Asian feature film called The Anglistanis. His roles played in several movies and short films are proof of his talents.
Chaudharyand Pallavi
Initially I had no idea who Sunil Ariyaratne is. I noticed that everyone respects him. Later I came to know that is because of his knowledge and humanity, he commented.
Chaudhary made special reference to his co-actor, Devdath starred by Dineth de Silva for his courageous support.
My passion is to perform characters of different styles. I would accept a character only if I feel I can do justice to it. I am relatively new to the Indian cinema. But you will get to see one of my Hindi films soon. I must specially mention about the support given by the production team. The cooperation from the production team is essential to make film a success, Chaudhary added.
Due to Pallavi and Chaudharys hectic calendar, the film shooting had to be completed within 45 days.
Completing the shoot within such a short period was a challenge, though accomplished as everyone can see now. Professor Ariyaratne made special reference to his art director Bimal Dushmantha who had to work on the sets in areas such as Ranmihithenna to create a vintage effect on the movie.
Scripting about Yasodhara was a challenge, owing to the dearth of information. As far back as in 1975, William Edmund Barrett authored Lady of the Lotus, partly a hagiographical account of the much-revered lady of Buddhism.
The book is interesting because Barrett was a Roman Catholic born in New York in 1900. With the Lady of the Lotus, Barrett took the reader back into many centuries even before the Christ was born. There Barrette narrates the story in almost lyrical prose on a lady who discovers that the man she loves is destined for a path which will lead him away from her, toward a great destiny. The lady will find the courage to find the path of her own. Barrett infuses love as well as the spiritual quest with a rich description of an ancient world. In the Sinhalese literature, Venerable Ganegama Saranankara Thera has authored an informative account on Yasodhara.
Yet Professor Sunil Ariyaratne does not refer to any of these sources. He banks on Pujavaliya, a Sinhalese classic, which portrays some aspects of Yasodharas life to work on the screenplay.
Although many films have been made about Buddhist themes and figures, this will be the first ever film on Yasodhara, Professor Ariyaratne said.
Yasodhara is a cinematic creation based on Bimbadevi, popularly known as Yasodhara. Many films have already been produced in the countries of both east and west on the life of the Buddha or Prince Siddhartha. Films based on the life of Princess Yasodhara are yet to be produced. They are almost non-existent.
This is where Professor Ariyaratnes cinematic attempt can fit in.
This is where the Lady Luminary enters the motion picture to inspire many more.

Lanka embarks on ambitious entry to global hi-tech pact
Sri Lanka began potent work on entering a historic and a groundbreaking global trade pact that would give the countrys exports a boost similar to another GSP Plus -and this pact is also set to impact a whopping one fifth of global trade in a few years from now.
The Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka forayed the country on 12 July to WTOs ground-breaking Information Technology Agreement (ITA) that completes its highly successful 20th anniversary global run this month.
According to the latest reports, todays exports of global information technology products is bigger than global trade in automotive or pharmaceuticals stressed Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch of two day long in-depth analysis and assessment of Sri Lankan IT industry, IT policy and trade/customs regime organized by the Department of Commerce under him and led by two top experts from WTO Geneva.
ICT is changing our world including Sri Lanka said Minister Bathiudeen, and added: Sri Lanka is rapidly emerging as a worlds ICT destination of choice. The ICT sector of Sri Lanka has become the fourth largest export earner. The export earnings of ICT grew 500% from 2006-from US$ 166 Mn in 2006 to US$ 900 Mn in 2016. The sector now employs over 85000.
This is not a run of the mill, general IT sector review of Sri Lanka stressed DG Commerce Wijeratne, and added: But is an in-depth analysis of two aspects of our IT-its tariff structure and schedule. WTO ITA has many benefits including innovation, value chain strengthening etc but for Sri Lanka, exports increase and FDI diffusion are the prominent gains. In fact, the commitment of a country to WTO ITA is now a major indicator to draw high FDI quantum to the country.
WTOs Xiaobing said: after the expansion of the ITA, it now includes next-generation semiconductors (MCOs) and many products based on such semiconductors. WTOs Shing stressed that the vast array of zero duty on high tech products benefits the country both ways.

The judgments of the cases that were filed before the Supreme Court on the delay of the local government elections would most probably be delivered within this month, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Prabath Gammanpila.
He said that three cases had been filed against the delay of the elections and the hearing of them have already completed.
"Since a justice in the bench that heard the cases is scheduled to retire next month I hope the judgements would be delivered within this month," MP Gammanpila said.
He made these observations today addressing a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office at Pitakotte.
However, that the elections have been delayed long and nobody takes the responsibility of the delay the Election Commission and the subject minister both are passing the ball to each other, However the matter is in the hands of the leader of the House as it is his responsibility to take up the amendment bill into debate in Parliament," MP Gammanpila said.
He aslo said that if the government failed to hold the election in October the joint opposition would come on roads in protests and would not leave until the election is declared. He added the advantage of the delay of the election is with the joint opposition.

Mahindra, Ideal Motors to bring digital innovation in SL
At the US$ 19 billion Mahindra Group, digitization is emerging as a key differentiator for business transformation and connected vehicle technology. Connected vehicle technology has been evolving over the past decade to address customers needs and the convergence of technological solutions into the mobility space is gaining further relevance.
Mahindra believes that digitisation will keep them ahead of competition and give sustainable growth to the Company.
One such example is DiGiSENSE, a revolutionary technological solution that connects Mahindra vehicles, tractors, trucks and construction equipment to the cloud, opening up a whole new dimension to the experience of vehicle ownership.
Mahindra recently launched TRRINGO, an organized tractor rental service and SmartShift, the digital marketplace for intra-city logistics.
Sri Lanka, as a nation is on the brink of digitisation with several initiatives by the government to migrate towards a Digital economy.
Sri Lanka is a step ahead of other South Asian nations with digital penetration, infrastructure and connectivity.
This gives Mahindra an opportunity to partner in this journey of Digital Sri Lanka, with innovation led services for consumers.
Together with Ideal Motors, Mahindra has plans to bring new digital initiatives, customized to the needs of the Sri Lankan customer, thus transforming industries with innovative solutions and better consumer experience.DiGiSENSE which is digitally enabled sensing, will be available across Mahindras breadth of mobility products from commercial and passenger vehicles to tractors and construction equipment.
DiGiSENSE will empower customers to digitally build knowledge 24X7 about the performance and location of their vehicles. Drivers can contact emergency breakdown services or pull up a route planner at the touch of a button.
In a country where farm mechanization penetration is low, Mahindra would like to play a significant role in enabling its farmers to improve their productivity and Rise by providing accessible technology.
The TRRINGO farm equipment rental business model will enable farmers to deploy mechanization technology on a pay per use basis without investing in the asset.
This will increase their output and prosperity and lead to the inclusive growth of the country.

Media Standards Bill will not suppress media, but act as regulator: Paranawithana
The government yesterday, insisted that a new Media Standards Bill would not seek to suppress the freedom of the media, but would only act as a regulator to uphold standards, said Deputy Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Karunaratne Paranawithana.
Addressing a Cabinet media briefing, Paranawithana explained that there was no final draft on the Bill and the Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to study the draft would consult the public and media institutions to recommend to the Cabinet what future action was needed to be taken with regard to the Bill.
In a free market economy, the Government usually acts as the regulator but in a democracy, the government was unable to regulate the media. Thus there needs to be a machinery where all stakeholders could participate.
Paranawithana also denied reports that the Bill would force journalists to reveal their sources.
It is a misunderstanding that the government is seeking to suppress the media. No one could force a journalist to reveal his/her sources. But in a criminal investigation or in instances of national security, the Police would have to get a Supreme Court order if they wanted a source to be revealed. Media has the rights but they are not absolute, he said.
He further explained that if the industry was doing a good job with self-regulation in terms of standards and ethics, the government would not have to step in at such juncture. Media institutions are so split, they are unable even to agree on basics. For the print media, we have, even with many shortcomings the Press Commission and the Press Complaints Commission. But with the electronic media, there is no regulatory body and the current regulatory mechanism is not sufficient to deal with complaints against them. Neither has any electronic media institution come forward to set any standard, said the former Deputy Minister of Mass Media as he stressed the need to hold the media accountable for bad reporting and lack of ethical standards.

MH17 lawyer tells Putin to make amends over crash
THE NETHERLANDS: Russian President Vladimir Putin must make amends for those killed on a Malaysia Airlines jet shot down over Ukraine, the lawyer representing victims said Wednesday ahead of the third anniversary of the disaster.
The jet was downed in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.
Initial findings released last year concluded the Boeing 777 aircraft was shot down by a missile transported from Russia, but Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement, putting the blame on Kiev.
My clients have waited three years, Mr Putin. There is still no accountability, Jerome Skinner, an American lawyer representing victims from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
Do you not feel that such tragic loss deserves explanation... You stand as the only man who can set this right.
I will use the European Court of Human Rights and every other avenue available to bring the Kremlin to accountability... Meet me and finally make amends for the victims of this tragedy.
Skinners plea came a week after countries leading the joint investigation team (JIT) -- Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine -- agreed that any trials would be carried out within the Dutch legal system. Preliminary criminal findings have said around 100 people were under investigation for playing an active role in the disaster.
International investigators last month released videos of MH17 relatives talking about the pain of losing their loved ones, in the hope it would spur residents in Ukraine to come forward with new information, Dutch media said.
The European Union last month formally rolled over damaging economic sanctions against Russia, imposed after the shooting down of MH17, for another six months, saying Moscow had failed to live up to its Ukraine ceasefire commitments. -AFP

## Title: Moving towards export-oriented economy

Moving towards export-oriented economy
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, recently said that the Government plans to create an export-oriented economy to promote economic growth. Obviously, he wanted to avoid the failure of the Latin American economies and to apply the lessons learnt from the success of the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) of East Asia. Prime Minister also added that several industrial and technology development areas specialised in various sectors will be created soon.
According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2016/2017 released by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka ranks 71st among 138 countries in the index of global competitiveness index with a score of 4.19 out of 7. India emerged as the top rank in South Asia at 39th place. Vietnam is positioned at 60.
The report shows that our most problematic factors for doing business were policy instability followed by access to financing, inefficient government bureaucracy and tax rates.
Sri Lankas short-term target, therefore, should be to reach the top half of the rankings within the next three to five years. There is only one path leading to the target - the more robust growth of the industry. Without that, Sri Lankas long-term development prospects may be at risk.
Vietnam experience
Unfortunately, the variety of economic policy reform agendas pursued by us over the past two decades has not put the industrialisation challenge centre stage. We should have looked at East Asian success stories to seek what is needed for our country to prosper in the global economy.
Vietnam is a case in point. It appears that Sri Lanka has a lot to learn from Vietnam when it comes to the formulation and implementation of trade and industrial development policy.
Vietnams industrial policy framework is governed by a national Socioeconomic Development Strategy (SEDS) projected for a ten-year period. This is complemented with five-year socio-economic development plans as well as sectoral and industrial strategies and master plans.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade is responsible for conducting and supervising industrial strategies and plans, while the Ministry of Planning and Investment undertakes the implementation of five-year plans. Their portfolio also includes coordination with the private sector through its Foreign Investment Agency (FIA), Enterprise Development Agency and Department of Economic Zones.
During the initial period (1991-95), the main objective of the industrial policy was to facilitate structural change, particularly for key sectors and regions. The two main key sectors being singled out in the five-year plan were heavy industry and natural resource exploitation.
In addition, other goals included the development of the agricultural, forestry and fishery sectors in close coordination with the manufacturing sector; consumption good production and labour-intensive and export-oriented industries. The 1991-95 plan also prioritised the construction of infrastructure and transportation networks, and the modernization of the post and telecom networks.
Second five-year plan for 1996-2000 outlined the projected economic development figures. The annual growth rate for agriculture-forestry and fishery sector was, on average, 4.5-5 per cent, 14-15 per cent for the industry, 12-13 per cent for services. The structural shift that followed was mainly aimed at quickly increasing the share of industry in the economy. The Socio-economic Development Strategy for the years 2001-10 sought to achieve the countrys 10-year development targets through the acceleration of growth and development, improvements in quality both quantitatively and qualitatively, and a strong emphasis on the efficiency and sustainability of growth and development. These objectives guided Vietnams strategy, as implemented according to the two-five-year plan: 2001-05 and 2006-10.
The third Socio-economic Development Strategy for 2011-20 period focussed, in addition to maintaining the vision of an industrialised Vietnam by 2020, emphasising knowledge-based intensive industrial production and higher local content in products. Although heavy industries and manufacturing industries are encouraged, support is limited to those competitively advantaged to be able to join higher positions in the global value chain.
Open economy
The main lesson we can learn from Vietnam experience is that industrial development can only be achieved by restructuring industrial production. In Sri Lanka, we never had a proper long-term industrial strategy to provide adequate guidelines to the industrialists. At least now, we need a master development strategy and/or master plan setting out realisable targets/objectives and broad implementation measures with sufficient detail and feasibility assessments.
Sri Lanka is regarded as a relatively open economy. Industrial policy should, therefore, aim to facilitate the productivity gain from export activities rather than simply endorse export expansion for ensuring long-term growth of the economy. The policy should also include plans to improve the firm structure and build linkages between domestic and foreign-invested firms.
Transparency
It is a sad fact that Sri Lankan industrialists are still not prepared to take full advantage of trade and investment liberalisation for economic development even after decades of international integration. The fact that international integration comes with both challenges and opportunities is generally well understood, but in our country, concrete action to raise international competitiveness is slow to emerge. Various measures such as industrial promotion, enterprise reform, FDI absorption, and trade and investment policy are not properly integrated. Our lack of transparency and certainty in policy environment remains the most serious obstacle for domestic firms to reach the foreign counterparts. Providing clear industrial vision and stable policy environment requires the collection and analysis of detailed and up-to-date information on key domestic industries as well as global market trends, and a realistic policy-making based on such information.
Flying geese model
What Sri Lanka needs today is policy response with concrete numbers and timetables to the imminent industrial problems that the country faces today.
When we study East Asian fast-track growth, we find that those countries as a group have exhibited a unique developing pattern. One by one, countries in different development stages have achieved economic growth by participating in the production network created by private multinational corporations. Linked by trade and investment and targeting the markets of the developed countries, a system of international division of labour with clear order and structure exists in the region.
Under this system, industrialisation has proceeded through geographic widening on the one hand, and structural deepening within each country on the other. This supply-side dynamism is sometimes called the flying geese pattern of development.
The flying geese model intends to explain the catching-up process of industrialization of latecomer economies from three aspects: (1) Intra-industry aspect: product development within a particular developing country, with a single industry growing over three time-series curves, i.e., import, production, and export; (2) Inter-industry aspect: sequential appearance and development of industries in a particular developing country, with industries being diversified and upgraded from consumer goods to capital goods and/or from simple to more sophisticated products; (3) International aspect: subsequent relocation process of industries from advanced to developing countries during the latter's catching-up process.
The flying geese model shows us that the national goal of industrialisation and modernization cannot be achieved except through a successful linking with this regional network.
Domestic firms alone cannot compete squarely with rivals from Japan, US, EU, China, Korea or the neighbouring countries. The only practical way is to attract a large number of FDI by bold policy action and encourage local firms to link up with their activities and improve competitiveness, step by step.
However, Sri Lankas reality at present falls far short of this potentiality. Many foreign firms cite Sri Lanka as a favoured destination, but only a few actually come to invest.
The absorption of FDI by Sri Lanka so far remains minuscule by the Asian standard. The main reason is that the speed of systemic improvement in Sri Lanka lags behind the speed at which the outside world is changing. As a consequence, Sri Lanka continues to stay in a relatively disadvantaged position in Asian dynamism.
Strategy
We urgently need a comprehensive and long-term industrialisation strategy coupled with master plans for individual key industries. The strategys contents need to be consistent with Sri Lankas current capability, global trends, external economic policy and systemic transition policy. If the government does not clarify where the country is heading with respect to the economic regime and industrial structure, no firm will invest with confidence. The compilation of these strategies and master plans will require up-to-date information on domestic and foreign economies. Such information must be continuously analysed among concerned policy-makers and business leaders.
The outdated ideas such as the maximum use of domestic raw materials, self-sufficient industrialisation, desire for vertically integrated industrial structure and compulsion for upstream investment, cannot activate domestic or foreign investment in the age of globalisation.
Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, very few government and business leaders adequately grasp the dynamism of the global market or Sri Lankas true position in it. As a result, policies and business strategies based on false hope detached from reality are often formulated.

NASA probe peers into Jupiters Great Red Spot
US: A NASA spacecraft, Juno, has successfully peered into the giant storm raging on Jupiter, known as the Great Red Spot, and its first pictures should be out in days, the US space agency said Tuesday.
My latest Jupiter flyby is complete! said a post on the @NASAJuno Twitter account.
All science instruments and JunoCam were operating to collect data.
The unmanned spacecraft came closer than any before it to the iconic feature on the solar systems largest planet, the gas giant Jupiter.
Experts say the Great Red Spot is a massive storm -- some 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) wide -- that has been churning for centuries, but little is known about the forces driving it.
It has been monitored since 1830 and has possibly existed for more than 350 years.
The storm is believed to have been shrinking in recent years.
For generations, people from all over the world and all walks of life have marveled over the Great Red Spot, said Scott Bolton, principal investigator on the Juno project.
Now we are finally going to see what this storm looks like up close and personal.
The flyover took place July 10 at 9:55 pm (July 11 at 0155 GMT), as the spacecraft passed about 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers) above the spots coiling crimson clouds.
Raw images will be posted in (the) coming days, the space agency said.
Juno launched on August 5, 2011, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and has been orbiting Jupiter for just over one year. - AFP

No tax on migrant workers: Thalatha
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala yesterday, assured that she would be the first to oppose any move to charge a tax on migrant workers.
She was participating at a function held recently to distribute self employment aids for 25 beneficiaries who have been registered with the Shramika Surekuma programme.
The Minister said that around 1.5 million Sri Lankans are currently engaged in overseas employment. But, none of these workers work happily and they have selected this path to fulfil the basic needs of their family members since they havent any other way to do so.
Sri Lankan migrant workers form the largest source of income in terms of foreign exchange brought into the country. So as a responsible government, we accept that we can never neglect the service of migrant works and we also pledge to extend our fullest support whenever necessary, she said.
President Maithripala Sirisena included pledges and proposals for the benefit and welfare of Sri Lankan migrant workers in his Presidential election campaign manifesto for the first time in Sri Lanka and measures have already been taken to fulfil these pledges.
She said the Shramika Surekuma programme was the first to be introduced by the President in January 2016 and around 300,000 migrant workers have already registered with this programme.

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya commends government decision to ban polythene

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) commended the government's decision to ban polythene bags and food wrappers.
PHU leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila said that he respects the decision taken to ban polythene bags and food wrappers but the government had made the move in a way that creates many issues.

"Actually it is not enough to import an environment friendly substitute for polythene bags and food wrappers."
He made these observations today while addressing a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya political Office in Pitakotte.
He added that polythene bags and food wrappers industry is maintained at mass scale and domestic level.
"A large number of people are affected by this decision, MP Gammanpila said.

Poaching vessels to face heavy fines under new Act
The Government plans to impose fines upto Rs.100 million for vessels poaching in Sri Lankan waters and proposals have also been received to increase it up to Rs 175 million.
The Foreign Fisheries Vessels Act to be presented in Parliament this year will solve the issue of poaching by Indian trawlers in Sri Lankan waters, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Around 80 percent of the drafting process of the Foreign Fisheries Vessels Act has been completed and it will be presented to Parliament this year, Amaraweera said.
The minister said the new Act,fines will be imposed on the vessel owner who will have to appear in courts to secure the release of the vessel. Foreign fishermen involved in poaching in Sri Lankan territorial waters are now charged under the Immigration Act for unlawfully entering the country.
According to Indian media, Rameshwaram fishermen had been protesting against the Sri Lankan government amending its Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act to ban bottom trawling in the territorial waters of the country, said the Minister.
Amaraweera said the Fisheries Act was amended to strengthen the International Fisheries Law and also to protect the marine resources of the country by adding that all these decisions have been taken for the benefit of Sri Lankan fishermen and not for the fishermen in other countries.
The Minister said the central government of India has realised the damage caused damage caused by bottom trawling to Sri Lankas marine resources and they have already taken various progressive decisions to solve the issue.
Appreciating the support extended by the Indian Government, we have agreed to consider Indias request to release 42 captured Indian fishing boats in the near future. he added.

Premier calls for renewed bilateral relations with SAARC countries

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called for the need to develop new bilateral relations between member countries of SAARC while working within the SAARC framework, today.
Addressing the eighth SAARC Ministers of Law and Order (Interior/Home Affairs) meeting held at Galle Face Hotel today, the Prime Minister noted that the countries needed to have a different perspectives on how each interacts with the other in the region.
The Prime Minister stressing on the need to address cross border terrorism asked that, All be committed to not allow any acts of terrorism and to condemn and take effective action, in the case of terrorism in our region. 
While all countries within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have been plagued with the scourge of terrorism, the Prime Minister noted that the realities of SAARC meant that they also needed to look to have bilateral agreements within SAARC to resolve specific issues relating to member countries,
Have the regional framework, but it is also necessary for us to have different bilateral agreements within members, which was not contemplated when SAARC when it was started, said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
When you take drugs, our relationship with India and Maldives where small amounts of drugs come from are different to that of Afghanistan and Pakistan where large amounts come from. So our agreements when it comes to drugs with these countries have to be different, he added.
As the Secretary General of SAARC said, SAARC is a people centric organization and thus we need to increase people to people contact. And whilst we have free trade agreements with many, we are also looking at deepening ties with India as it is our closest neighbour and most trade is done with them. On the other hand, there is also emphasis with our agreements with Bangladesh, Pakistan and Maldives, said the Prime Minister.
He further stressed that bilateral relations should be formed without straining relationships within SAARC, All bilateral relations should be open and transparent he said while keeping the SAARC framework in place and slowly try to improve the environment within SAARC. 
As the SAARC Immigration Authorities are also scheduled to hold their meeting to discuss easing visa regulations between SAARC countries to promote bilateral trade, the Prime Minister stressed that they needed to come up with ways to allow genuine migration while curbing terrorism.
Wickremsinghe has been continually pushing for collaboration within SAARC, especially when it comes to counter-terrorism activities but with the collapse of the SAARC summit in 2016 due to a terrorist attack on an Indian army base in Uri by an Islamic terror outfit allegedly linked to Pakistan, the Prime Minister at the time was found to remark that Sri Lanka would have to look at other viable options if SAARC did not deliver acceptable results for all.

Shopping bags, lunch sheets, regifoam lunch boxes: polythene banned
The Government yesterday announced a blanket ban on shopping bags, lunch sheets and regifoam lunch boxes throughout the country from September 1.
Accordingly, the manufacturing, sale and use of shopping bags, lunch sheets and regiform lunch boxes will be banned after . Environment and Mahaweli Development Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, terming it as a revolutionary move, requested full support of the public to successfully confront the difficulties that may crop up during the transition period.
We decided on the ban after discussing with all the stakeholders for over eight months. We have given a grace period till September to adopt to alternatives. In the next few months, we will make sure that the alternatives to replace the banned items will be in the market, he said.
While the already existing ban on polythene less than 20 microns in thickness will remain unchanged, for other types of polythene except for the above, the Government has also imposed a ban on the use of polythene for decorative purposes at all national, social, and religious ceremonies from .
The ban on regiform lunch boxes (Polystyrene Lunch boxes) also applies to the plates, cups and spoons made of the same material. The commonly used shopping bags will be replaced with environmental friendly or biodegradable plastic packing items. The Action Plan prepared to by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for proper management of the use of polythene also includes controlling the use of polythene bags to fill/insert/pack the processed and cooked meals during the sale of all type of food. The deputy minister said the aim of the Government in introducing new regulations is to prevent the environmental harm caused by polythene by 2018.
CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri, observing that 10-15 percent of the waste collected in Sri Lanka comprises polythene, said it has been a main reason for the spread of the dengue epidemic.
Last year alone we had imported 113,500 MT of polythene as a material spending about Rs 20 billion. The per capita polythene use in Sri Lanka is 5.7kgs and this rate in the Western province is high as 7.5 kgs. As an average we use 20 million lunch sheets each day. We have also reliably found that certain manufacturers add to them to increase the thickness and it is a serious health hazard he explained.
He said the Government will soon also ban the burning of polythene and plastic considering the environmental pollution it causes and serious health hazards it poses to the people.
Prof. Dharmasiri said cellophane wrappers have not been banned under the new regulations.

Significant poor performances forced Mathews to quit captaincy
The series defeat to low ranked Zimbabwe was the last straw for Angelo Mathews who decided that enough is enough and quit the Sri Lanka captaincy in all formats.
Theres a limit a captain can put up with and the way the team has constantly underperformed during his leadership in recent months has forced Mathews hand to step down.
It was not an easy decision but mainly it was not due to the fact that we lost but yes there has been significant poor performances and I am humble enough to accept it, said Mathews at a media conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday to officially announce his resignation from the captaincy.
Two things worked in my mind whether this is the right time to step down and whether this is the right time considering the team because the teams interest supersedes my personal interest.
My honest opinion is that there are candidates who can take over the reins and I am pretty sure that they will be more successful and better captains than me, he said.
I thought this is the time for the team to have a new leader. I didnt want to be selfish and cling onto the captaincy. Our main objective is to start winning and I thought this is the best time to hand the captaincy over to someone else.
I also wanted to give the successor enough time till the 2019 World Cup to build up a team. Those were the main reason for me to step down.
Mathews said he reached the decision after having a discussion with the SLC ExCo and the selection committee.
In a letter to SLC Mathews states: I am immensely thankful [to you] for being extremely considerate of my reasoning and accommodative of my decision to resign as the national cricket captain with immediate effect. When I was bestowed with this great honour of captaining the Sri Lankan national team in 2013, I was overwhelmed to say the least and if not for the immense support and trust placed in me by Sri Lanka Cricket I could not have withstood the pressures of captaincy for a period which has now exceeded four and half years.
I am also immensely thankful to the senior players who were part of the team when I took over the mantle of captaincy at a very young age. They too were always at my side to guide me when it was needed the most. Over the last four and a half years I was immensely proud to be with a team blessed with immense natural talent and unfathomable potential. I am thankful to every single player who played with me and supported the Sri Lankan team to achieve some significant milestones in Sri Lankas cricketing history. We as a team were able to defeat England in all three formats in a single bilateral series in 2014; we managed to win an Asia Cup the same year, and whitewash Australia for the first time in a Test series in 2016. These memories are beyond words, which I will always cherish.
However, though the Sri Lankan team has not fulfilled its true potential during the last several months. I personally believe that it is neither owing to the lack of skill nor effort nor the lack of commitment of the players. However, as the captain I cannot turn a blind eye to the failures of our team during the last several months. In this regard I am very much concerned that we were unfortunate to lose to Zimbabwe during the recently concluded ODI series. This loss to me personally as stated previously is the lowest point in my cricketing career. On this notion after giving deep and considerate thought that I decided that it was time for me to resign as the captain of the national team in all formats.
Furthermore, I was also very mindful that my resignation at this juncture, would ensure that sufficient time being given to my successor to take the national team confidently through to the next ICC World Cup in England in 2019.
On this note I am immensely thankful to my teammates and to every member of the support staff of the national team for their encouragement and support over the last several years. The Sri Lankan media requires a special note of appreciation for their commitment and encouragement to my team and me. The entire nation has over the years continuously backed me and the team, which has given me the most encouragement. I wholeheartedly thank every single cricket fan that has cheered us unhindered all the way.
You would also appreciate that I have at all times played in the exclusive interest of Sri Lankan cricket and have not at any time compromised my national duties for any personal gain. I have at all times given utmost priority to making myself available over and above any franchise commitment and has even at times pre-terminated franchise commitments to fulfill national obligations.
On this note subject to me being selected for national duty I would ensure my fullest commitment to the national cricket team. Moreover I would at all times support and guide our young and profusely talented team and my successor in every way to make our nation proud.

SL to get US$ 1,340 mn from WB
Sri Lanka will receive USD 1,340 million worth of financial and technical assistance from the World Bank Groups for the 3-year period starting from July1, 2017 under the IDA (International Development Association)Transitional Support Facility. Previously Sri Lanka received USD 660 Million IDA support for the period from year 2014 to 2017
Sri Lanka is expected to access approximately US$ 300 Mn per annum for the coming 3 years from IBRD (international bank for Reconstruction and Development) IDA and IBRD are member institutions of World Bank Group. Thisassistance comes as financial assistance for development projects and technical assistance for analytical and advisory services.
WB Country Director Idah Riddihough appreciating the Sri Lankas economic performance said that despite significant challenges, it remained broadly satisfactory in 2016 and early 2017. The WB recognizes the corrective policy measures taken in 2016 following expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented in the previous year as early signs of stabilization
World Bank Country Director discussed the progress of WB assisted ongoing and proposed projects in the country. Public Sector Efficiency Project and the Country Readiness for Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are the two projects,proposed to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance with financial and technical support from the World Bank. The Social Safety Nets Project is the on-going project with WB assistance
A combination of increase in revenues and rationalization of expenditures helped reducing the fiscal deficit from a reported 7.6 percent in 2015 to a 5.4 percent of GDP in 2016. While the boost received from increased profits and dividend income from State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) played a key role in increasing revenues; the changes to the VAT Act implemented late 2016 and improved revenue administration helped strengthen the tax collection.
The World Bank predicts that fiscal deficit in Sri Lanka is projected to fall to 5.2 percent of GDP for 2017. This is thanks to the impact of VAT changes in its first full year.
In outer years, the new Inland Revenue Act is expected to expand the tax base for corporate and personal income tax while shifting from tax holidays to a performance-based incentive regime, where the incentives depend on actual rather than promised investment.
On the expenditure side, WB projects the increased fiscal space will benefit primarily public investment, assuming no major additional recurrent expenditure commitments.
Under this baseline, the fiscal deficit to narrow the deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. The primary fiscal balance is projected to become marginally positive in 2017.

SL's second national symposium to develop national export strategy
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) will conduct a second consultation for Sri Lankas National Export Strategy (NES).
More than 300 public and private sector representatives are expected to attend in order to chart the next export growth cycle of the country.
The development of this strategy is a central component of the EU  Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance: Increasing SMEs trade competitiveness in regional and EU markets project, implemented by the International Trade Centre and funded by the European Union.
During the first NES consultation (in April 2017), a strategic vision for Sri Lankas export growth was agreed upon: Sri Lanka  an export hub driven by innovation and investment
The achievement of this vision is supported by four key strategic objectives guiding the entire NES design process: (1) to have a business-enabling, predictable and transparent policy and regulatory framework that supports exports; (2) to drive export diversification through innovation and the strengthening of emerging export sectors; (3) to strengthen Sri Lankan exporters market-entry and compliance capacities; and (4) to become an efficient trade and logistics hub to facilitate exports.
The NES, with its five-year strategy implementation period, lays emphasis on diversification of exports through strengthening of emerging sectors. Bearing in mind different growth trends, NES focus sectors are ICT, wellness tourism, spice concentrates, boat building, processed food and beverages and electronic and electrical machinery.
The focus sectors were identified based on quantitative and qualitative parameters derived from export potential assessments, conducted by the EDB and the BOI under the guidance of Harvard University, and further sector analysis by the Commonwealth Secretariat, McKinsey Co., the International Trade Centre and the World Bank.
In addition, the NES will ensure that all export sectors including the mature sectors will benefit from the strengthening of trade support functions.
Through wide public-private consultations, the following trade support functions (TSF) were shortlisted to achieve the NES vision and strategic objectives: national quality infrastructure, innovation and R&D and logistics. These trade support functions will aim at improving the overall competitiveness of Sri Lankas export sector.
Following the validation of the NES strategic orientations by the Cabinet Council on Economic Management, individual sector and functional strategy teams have been established. These teams are tasked with providing guidance and decision making for the elaboration of strategies for each sector and trade support function.
The consultative meetings for the second NES will be held from July 12-20. The main objective of the meeting will be to define roadmaps for expanding export and analyse performance of value chains for the NES focus sectors, market orientations, challenges and opportunities.
The TSF groups are also expected to identify the main challenges in the provision of quality and affordable trade support services to Sri Lanka Exporters.
These consultations will be followed by regional discussions planned for September 2017 where national public and private sector representatives will confirm the strategic interventions that the NES should focus on for the next five years.

Sri Lankas uncertainty and Zimbabwes belief
ODI series review:
When Zimbabwe ranked 11th in the ODI standings and below Afghanistan arrived for a five-match one-day international series little did Sri Lanka realize what was in store for them.
The African nations track record was not all that great coming to Sri Lanka having lost a five-match ODI series 3-2 to Afghanistan and being held to a 1-all draw by associate member Scotland.
Sri Lanka who were a better all-round side than their counterparts was expected to beat Zimbabwe and consolidate their position in the ODI rankings where they are hanging onto rather precariously at eighth position. Playing at home under their home conditions and slow turning pitches was also in favour of Sri Lanka. So what went wrong for them in the series which they surprisingly lost 3-2
The series began on a stunning note with Zimbabwe chasing down the highest ever ODI total achieved in Sri Lanka 322 in 47.4 overs. It was the first time that any team had chased 300 and over successfully.
That sort of run chase gave belief to the Zimbabweans that they could bat on any surface prepared by Sri Lanka for the series. Although Sri Lanka pulled back to win the next two matches and take a 2-1 lead, the Zimbabweans never lost hope. They brought new ideas into each game and tried various combinations and ploys to outwit the homesters. The fourth and crucial ODI was the turning point of the series. A win for Sri Lanka would have given them the series and for Zimbabwe they needed to win to keep the series alive.
Played at Hambantota, Zimbabwe overcame the strong crosswinds and the dry pitch to win that game on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule after bad weather had interrupted play and forced a rescheduling of overs and a fresh target to chase. From Sri Lankas viewpoint they were in a way rather unlucky that after running up a total of 300-6 they would have fancied beating Zimbabwe had the match gone its full distance. But instead Zimbabwe was left to chase 219 in 31 overs and they got there with 10 balls to spare. Sri Lanka could have still restricted Zimbabwe to a lower score or bowled them out if not for an appalling display of bowling where juicy full tosses and half volleys were bowled which the Zimbabwe batsmen accepted with glee and punched to the boundary. That win squared the series 2-all and gave the Zimbabweans a further impetus for the decisive fifth and final ODI also played at Hambantota.
Suddenly it was Sri Lanka who were under pressure to win and with it the series. Eventually the pressure got to them and they were restricted to an under par total of 203, their batting falling to spin with seven of the eight wickets falling to them. Zimbabwe came to this crucial game with a plan as they opened the bowling with the off-spin of Sikander Raza instead of their fast bowlers. That ploy caught the Sri Lankan openers Niroshasn Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka who had in the two previous games reeled off successive double century partnerships (a world record) off guard. Instead of being 200 for none they were 31-3 by the ninth over and slid further down the mire to 126-7 before a record half-century ninth wicket stand by Asela Gunaratne and Dushmantha Chameera brought some respectability and gave their bowlers a total to bowl at. Zimbabwe was not going to let slip such a golden opportunity of winning a maiden ODI series in Sri Lanka and they went about chasing down the target briskly with inform openers Hamilton Masakadza and Solomon Mire laying the foundation for them with a stand of 92 in 15 overs. Although Sri Lanka fought back gallantly capturing seven wickets for 175, Zimbabwe who bats deep had enough resources to see them through. Skipper Graeme Cremer and Raza the Man of the Match saw Zimbabwe home to a historic series win  one which they will cherish for a long time in their rather chequered history.
It was a wonderfully contested series with so many individual stand-out performances  Solomon Mires maiden ODI century in the first game at Galle, the hat-trick on debut by Richmond College schoolboy Wanindu Hasaranga in the second match also at Galle, the back to back double century partnerships by Dickwella and Gunathilaka in the third and fourth matches and, the batting of Hamilton Masakadza coupled with the all-round brilliance of Sikander Raza in the fifth ODI  all at Hambantota.
The frustrations and the inconsistent performances of the team proved too much of a pressure for Angelo Mathews to put up with constantly. He had struggled to keep the team together following the retirements of legends like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan. At the end of the series he tended his resignation as captain from all formats of the game.
First it was Graham Ford who resigned as head coach at the end of the Champions Trophy and now less than a month later Mathews from the Sri Lanka captaincy at the end of the Zimbabwe series.
Things are certainly not looking that bright for Sri Lanka cricket and its future at the moment. Their fortunes need a complete turnaround. Where Sri Lankas next series win will come from is anybodys guess.

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket Wednesday offered cash and new clothes to temporary groundsmen who were forced to hand in the uniforms they were wearing before being paid their wages.
Dozens of casual labourers left the Hambantota international cricket stadium on Monday night in their underwear after they were forced to hand back the uniforms they had been provided.
"The way they were treated is unacceptable and I have ordered that they be given a new set of clothes plus an extra day's wages," board chief Thilanga Sumathipala said. "It is inhuman and slavery."
Soon after the news broke on Tuesday, the board had issued a formal apology.
Sumathipala said an investigation was under way and those responsible would be dealt with. AFP

Sri Lankan exporters need to take advantage of connectivity provided by shipping lines
There has been much talk about Sri Lankas enviable location along one of the busiest shipping routes in global trade, between the booming markets of Asia and the developed, high income ones of Europe.
This gives us a distinct advantage as a global transportation hub but have we leveraged it as effectively as we could have
International trade (exports plus imports) now forms a smaller share of the Sri Lankan GDP than ever before.
Back in 2005, trade accounted for close to 80% of GDP; by 2015 this had fallen to a paltry 55%. Compare that to some other leading regional economies that are doing well: Vietnam's trade-to-GDP ratio is now around 170 %, Malaysia's is 150 %, Thailand's is 120 % and Singapore is 350 %.
Exports as a percentage of GDP have also been dropping rapidly over the years. According to the World Bank that figure has fallen from 33% in 2000 to 15% in 2014. These figures all indicate the degree to which trade drives these growing economies. Sri Lanka is a small country with a small domestic market. Without external trade, it cannot achieve high growth. So this low and declining trade-to-GDP ratio needs to be reversed.
The largest contributor to Sri Lankan exports is garments. In 2016, approximately 15.75% of exports were from the textiles and garments sector, followed by tea with 13% and rubber products with 7% (as terms of TEUS).
The country has shifted from an agriculture export-oriented country more toward manufactured exports; however, we have been overly focused on garments with lack of development in other areas of finished good exports.
Exporters need to start realizing the potential and head towards the right direction. 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 have shown steps in the right direction.
According to World Shipping Council rankings, the Colombo Port is ranked 33 among top 50 container ports and as per Alpha Liner Research, Colombo is ranked as 27th container port in the world. The Colombo Port has increased volumes handling over 5.7 million TEUs in 2016 with over 75% being transshipment TEUs. This is an increase of 10% from 2015 (5.18 million) and 16% increase from 2014 (4.91 million). Colombo has become South Asias topmost container transshipment hub. Transshipments increased from 3.2 million in 2013 to 4.35 million in 2016.
Our transshipment volumes have been the main reason for Colombo being a must stop for the top 20 lines. This has presented a fantastic opportunity for shippers to reach and compete in international markets. Without this advantage of transshipment volumes, the connectivity and reach available to Sri Lanka would be much lower and costs higher. The Chinese-run Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) has increased port capacity and throughput significantly, handling over 2 million TEUs in 2016 and has received some of the largest vessels playing the Asia-Europe routes.
Credit should also be given to the infrastructure investments by the Government and Sri Lanka Ports Authority in building the breakwater and providing the platform for such world-class facilities to emerge.
Sri Lanka is expected to attract an increasing share of trans-Indian Ocean trade as well. According to estimates by KPMG, the Asia Pacific freight industry is set to grow at around 12% each year, and Colombo Port is already seeing around a 15% annual growth in transshipments. Sri Lanka has a strong feeder network covering major ports of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives and Africa. The major growth areas in transshipment could be to Africa and the Gulf and also from the East Coast of the Indian subcontinent port of Bangladesh and other Indian ports which presently only do approx.
Thirty percent of their trade via Colombo hub, the rest been done by services covering Singapore and Malaysian hub ports. The share via Colombo can only be increased by concerted efforts to improve the product and also by ensuring that Sri Lanka as a hub is more customer focused.
Shippers also have the benefit of lower freight rates available in Sri Lanka compared to many other countries as the rate is inclusive of THC for quite some time. Although this should help shippers be internationally competitive with their exports, there has not been any significant increase in exports. In fact, the earnings from exports have fallen from 11.1 million in 2014 to 10.3 million in 2016.
Driven from the growth of the shipping industry, shipping-related infrastructure has developed significantly, from container yards and warehousing facilities to efficient transportation systems, which have all made shipping more connected and efficient today.
According to figures from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the transportation sector (mainly shipping related) accounted for 11.6% of the countrys total GDP in 2015, generating Rs. 1.3 trillion (US$8.1 billion), up 1.6% from the year before.
Sri Lankan exporters need to make use of these advantages available to promote their products in international markets. The shipping and maritime community will continue to play its part in helping shippers leverage on the strengths of our strategic position.

Staggering numbers of menacing dengue
At present dengue has become a rising menace in Sri Lanka and reports indicate Negombo to be one of the hot spots in the epidemic. Health officials baffled by the outbreak have been forced to try every tool in the box to deal with the crisis but despite their efforts, very little change seems to be occurring on the ground. As hospitals overflow with dengue patients, poor sanitation and lack of precautions against dengue have led to hospital staff themselves being infected by the dengue menace they are trying to save the people from.
Reports indicate that around 10 doctors attached to the Negombo General Hospital were diagnosed with dengue but the Negombo District General Hospital Director, Dr. Nilanthi Pathirana refused to confirm the exact numbers.
I am aware that some of the doctors have been diagnosed with dengue but I do not know the exact number and how they got it. I have no idea whether they got it from inside or out, she said.
An official attached to the hospital who wished to remain anonymous pointed out many places in the hospital that remained unclean. The hospital premises was filled with patients and visitors and many corners are yet to be cleaned.
PHIs and MOH often visit the hospital but who cares about all these. The cleaning has been outsourced to a private company and they are not performing their duties very well, he said.
When contacted by the Daily News, Chief Medical Health Officer of Negombo Dr L.I. Ranasinghe refused to make a comment. He said he needs to get permission from the higher officials to talk to the media.
Negombo General Hospital  number of patients on the rise
The hospitals are witnessing a significant rise in dengue patients over the past couple of months. The Negombo hospital in the meantime, is also struggling to cope with the dengue crisis as a serious shortage of staff, beds and equipment continues to hinder their ability to deal with the lengthening queues of patients.
Dr. Pathirana said there were around 600 dengue patients admitted to the hospital but they only had 369 beds.
She added that the hospital was in need of more beds and staff to control the increasing number of dengue patients at the hospital. She added that the number of beds to serve dengue patients have been increased to 369. There are around 580 beds in total but the number of patients are estimated to be 900. Those without a bed have taken to sleeping on the floor and on mattresses.
I dont know when this is going to end because the number keeps increasing. Around 150 dengue patients are admitted everyday, she said.
Dr. Pathirana said that they managed to increase the number of wards which was an issue, but they had managed to resolve that issue, however, they still needed more beds.
The army has built two temporary huts to be used as wards but they are built using met roofs. So we need to provide patients' coolers and fans and we need more beds to be put there as well. We will be getting another 80 beds towards the end of this week. But, we also should make arrangements to buy coolers and fans, or we will not be able to admit the patients to those wards, she said.
She further said that when President Maithripala Sirisena visited the hospital, there were only 400 dengue patients, but now it had increased to 600.
The Tri forces sent nurses, medical assistants and minor staff while the Ministry of Health also sent Medical laboratory assistants, public health officers, doctors and nurses to assist the hospital to control the crisis. Moreover, 30 nurses were recruited on permanent basis recently and there are 245 doctors attached to the hospital on a permanent basis.
To control the dengue crisis, 36 new doctors have been recruited on a temporary basis, she said.
Dr. Pathirana pointed out that since last November, the number of dengue patients admitted to the hospital had been increasing. Usually, the number reduces during March and April, but this time it has shown no decline.
I think the mosquito density is high now, and its the type 2. Therefore more people would be affected as this is the first time they are being infected by it. There is no difference in the treatment, it is the same. We have established a new dengue high dependency unit and only the patients who are in serious condition are being treated, she said.
As the numbers of patients increase, the hospital has opened screening centres. There is a fever corner at the OPD and there is another centre run by the Army nearby. Dr. Pathirana added that the patients would be admitted only if their platelet counts were very low. If numbers are not too low, they will be given necessary instructions and sent home, said the Director.
Around 200 patients are being sent home every day after screen testing, though they were diagnosed with dengue fever. We dont have space to accommodate all of them. We give them all necessary instructions and advice on how to take care of themselves at home, she said.
Dr. Pathirana further said that even normal hospitals can take care of the dengue patients. They need not be sent to big hospitals, the treatment would be the same. A general physician can handled the situation; there is no need to panic.
Only awareness is not sufficient to change reality
There have been 10 deaths reported since January this year and patients were from different parts of the country, she said.
Dr. Pathirana affirmed that measures to tackle this dengue crisis were taken very late by the Dengue Control unit.
If they had started it at the proper time we could have reduced the number of patients affected. Even the Dengue Control Unit has its constraints, so cant blame them as well. We as doctors are here to treat the patients; it is not our duty to prevent transmission, she said.
Director, National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Hasitha Tissera told the media yesterday that only awareness was not sufficient to tackle the crisis.
He said a research that was done recently revealed that not many people living in the Colombo areas take initiatives to remove mosquito breeding places.
We live in a self centred community. The environment is equally important when it comes to dengue. The more polluted the environment is, the more dengue breeding sites it will have. The community should also take responsibility for the problem. The public should clean their surroundings regularly at least on a weekly basis, he said.
K. Heshani a resident from Negombo said the PHI cames often to check their houses.
PHIs come often to check the premises but the number of dengue patients keep increasing. So even we do not know whats happening, she said.
Consultant Physician, Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama advised the people not to take health matters into their own hands and to seek proper professional medical assistance when the first symptoms of dengue appear.
The patients need to be monitored when the platelet count is less than 100,000. If the patients platelet count is more than 100,000, we send them home.
The patient needs bed rest, adequate amount of liquid intake and paracetamol for the fever.
The reason why we are sending the patients home is not because of the numbers. The patients have to come back and check their blood counts either the same day or the next day, he said.
Dengue a man-made disease
Former national coordinator for Dengue control Dr. Lakshmi de Silva
Outbreaks are directly proportional to the Dengue mosquito density. Although mosquitoes cannot be eliminated, if the mosquito density is kept low dengue outbreaks can be controlled. One of the most effective strategies for this is to eliminate the dengue breeding sites. To achieve this, active community involvement is essential. Continuous public awareness programmes need to be conducted to ensure active community involvement. Clear, uniform messages need to be given to the public.
Health Department alone cannot control dengue. Inter- sectoral involvement is an important factor in dengue control activities. Other relevant departments like Local Government, Environment Authority, Education Ministry etc. should all be involved in planned control activities. The Education Ministry can play an important role in changing the behaviour of school children. Children should get involved in keeping the school premises and their home surrounding free of dengue breeding sites. As there is a shortage of field staff, volunteers can be trained to inspect premises and disseminate health education messages in identified high risk Grama Niladari divisions. In addition, other field officers like Samurdhi officers, environmental officers, agricultural officers etc. can also be trained and used in field control activities.
Although fogging can be done to reduce the adult mosquito density in an epidemic situation, this should not be done indiscriminately. When a patient is notified, fogging should never be limited to that household alone.
This will cause dissemination of infected mosquitoes to the surrounding households. Fogging should be done according to the given guidelines. It is more important to identify and remove the breeding sites.We must also remember that the use of insecticides will also reduce the density of other important slow flying insects. It is also a health hazard to humans.
The most important aspect is to plan and implement dengue control programmes throughout the year and to intensify selected activities prior to the expected outbreak months.
It is very important and also cost effective to prevent an epidemic rather than control an epidemic once it has occurred.

Unitary status, Buddhisms place will never be compromised: PM
The unitary status of the country and the pre-eminent position of Buddhism will never be compromised in a new Constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a group of youth Buddhist monks at Temple Trees yesterday.
Buddhism will never lose its pre-eminent position in the Constitution, while the unitary status of the country will not be changed, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said no one opposes to the unitary statues of the country and the pre-eminent position of Buddhism. He said while the pre-eminent position of Buddhism is protected, the Government will ensure equal opportunities for other religions. He said the Government has no intention to intervene in the activities of temples, but is duty bound to fulfil the requirements of the youth Bhikkus.
The Prime Minister said the media should act in a responsible manner rather than levelling fabricated allegations against the Government.
The Malwatte Chapter was threatened to be split into two during the Rajapaksa regime. It was an attempt to divide the Maha Sanga, but no media reported it, including the media organisation, that published that the Government has closed down the Dambulla temple, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said there is a need to protect the frescoes of the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya with the blessings of the Chief Prelates of three chapters. He said the Government has no power or does not need to control temples or intervene in their issues.
