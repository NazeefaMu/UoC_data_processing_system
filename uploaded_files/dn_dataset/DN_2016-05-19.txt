Pesi Shroff visits RTC
One of India's foremost retired Jockeys and now a leading racehorse trainer Pesi Shroff has been visiting the Royal Turf Club Nuwara Eliya racecourse subsequent to hearing the glowing reports about the conduct of racing in April which was attended by racing enthusiasts from across India . Pesi Shroff has 837 wins, 111 graded races (33 being grade 1 races), 39 classics, and was 8 times champion trainer in Mumbai and twice in Pune After looking around the facilities at the racetrack he was able to renew acquaintances with Wayne Wood the RTC Chief Executive Officer who had also been the Chief Integrity Steward at the Royal Western India Turf Club where Shroff is based.
During their discussions about the RTC Mr Shroff was pleased to hear that race day control remains in the hands of Professional Stipendiary Stewards and that any person aggrieved by their decision has the right to a second hearing by a Board of Appeal. Further that a licensee is entitled to be represented by a lawyer at that stage.
Shroff said he could see that there was much potential for horse racing in Sri Lanka. He admitted that he has a few horses that would be suited to the track and would be giving some thought to the possibility of setting up a stable at Nuwara Eliya. He said that the club giving prize money to fifth placing would be attractive to owners, especially when the size of the fields are taken into consideration. The Royal Turf Club and the Race Course in Nuwara Eliya certainly have a bright future.
It's got the basics and the additional infrastructure being put into place as per their plans will lay a solid foundation which can then be the stepping stone or a launching pad which will take things to a much higher level  said Mr Shroff. The passion, the determination and the will to make this succeed is what has really impressed me because more than anything else, it's the Love for the Game that has to be the driving force. What's even better is that the RTC approach to the task could not have been better orchestrated. They have put in place the top professionals to captain their cause. Professionals who are not only equal to the task but share the same resolve and love for the Sport and with that sort of driving force behind it I can visualise the Race Course at Nuwara Eliya coming into it's own and graduating into a Racing Centre second to none.
A new state of the art Veterinary Hospital, qualified Vets, a Training Track, and improved and additional stabling facilities which will soon be in place, will enable the RTC and racing in Sri Lanka to stage a comeback to those glorious days of the past when the top horses and professionals had The Emerald Isle as a major port of call.
Pesi Shroffs stamp of approval for the RTC augers well for the future of horse racing in Sri Lanka.

New Trinity coach Wijesinghe keen to win back Bradby
New Trinity College head coach Sean Mark Wijesinghe is eager to leave a great legacy together with his assistant Saliya Kumara. Sean clearly sees plenty of talent in the current team, and believes that they will give off their best most importantly in the return Bradby leg at Pallekele on Saturday and in the second round matches to follow.
Wijesinghe and Kumara are all out to bring back Trinity rugger to its former glory. All what the two coaches got to do is systematically guide the young players to play good rugby with their experience as player and coach.
When you perform well you win and performance is the key. The process is getting that consistency in performance. It's always the process first but, obviously, every team wants to win. Sean was head coach of Kandy Sports Club last season when they won the league and the knockout and Kumara was in charge of the backs.
Wijesinghe represented Trinity College Rugby in 2000 and 2001 under the captaincy of D.H.A. Luchow and T. Jayawardene. As a schoolboy Wijesinghe joined Kandy Sports Club, and he was given the best possible help by Mr. Rugby Malik Samarawickrema. He captained Kandy SC in 2009 to win the triple championship and was once again called in 2014/15 season to lead the side when they were not faring well.
He did it in style in 2015. He represented the country in both 15-a-side and 7-a-side
Kumara started his rugby at Vidyartha College and in his last two years as a senior played for Trinity in 2002 and 2003. He played an important role for Trinity in the Bradby Shield encounter with Royal College in 2003 at Bogambara Stadium, where Trinity won 15/13. He kicked Trinity to victory in the dying stages of the game with a 35-meter drop goal.
Leaving school he turned out for Havelock SC in the inter-club rugby tournament. After a two year stint with the Park Club he moved over to CH and FC in 2006.
In 2009 he came over to Kandy on the invitation of Malik Samarawickrema and represented Kandy SC until 2015. Saliya led Kandy in 2012 when they ended as league champions.
He played for Sri Lanka at the Hong Kong Sevens no less than six times and also at the Commonwealth Games Rugby Championship, Asian Games Rugby and Rugby Asiad.
He first started coaching Vidyartha College and later assisted Kandy SC and now he is with Trinity.
The second leg of the Bradby at Pallekelle Stadium will start at 4 pm, the time has been advanced due to fading light. The under 18 game for the Simithrarachchi trophy will kick off at 2.45 pm.

46th Annual Abdul Jabbar Shield Rugby clash : Isipathana goes out favourites against minnows Thurstan
The 46th Annual Abdul Jabbar shield Rugby encounter between Division one unbeaten group leaders Isipathana College, Colombo and Division two participant Thurstan College, Colombo will be played today at the CR & FC grounds in Longden place. Kick off will be at 4.30pm.
It all started in 1967 when Isipathana - Thurstan match fixture was elevated to a big match status for the Abdul Jabbar Trophy. Since then Isipathana has never turned back going on winning the Abdul Jabbar Trophy for 36 consecutive years till 2005 where Thurstan won the trophy for the first time in their history by 15-6 due to a under the post try scored by Shane Aravinda after they had a slender lead of 8-6 up to that point. To Thurstanites young and old it was a more than a victory after 37 painful years.
The finish was yet another page from the fiction, no different to the 93 fixture where Isipathanas Thuan Bohoran snatched a draw or a near victory away from Thurstan to score a blind side try to make them victorious in the last minute. Such was Isipathanas invincibility for nearly four decades. Closest Thurstan achivement was a draw in 1975 under Tissa Wickramanayake and in 98 under Nuwan Kumara they beat Isipathana in the Presidents Trophy but succumbed to defeat in the Jabbar.
Thurstan took up to rugby in 1958 and Isipathana in 1963 and the two schools met for the first time in 1963.
It was one of Thurstans finest years in rugby under the leadership of late Deepal de Zoysa having beaten many top teams and the score line read 6-3 in favour of Thurstan. Isipathanas rugby revival came in 1965 under Ana Saranapala, in a team that was coached by Mike Davis where they beat Thurstan 17-0 at the CCC grounds. The 1966 match at CR was a thriller where Isipathana scored a close 6-3 win over Thurstan, captained by Sunil Jayakody.
In 1967 too it was a close game where Thurstan captained by Mangala Ratnayake lost narrowly to Isipathana. In 1968, the two captains were Upali Hewage (Thurstan) and Juranghan Savanghan (Isipathana) and the match was closely contested and won by Isipathana with Thurstan paying for sending two kickable penalties astray by their play maker Diyanesh Rajarathnam.
Isipathana after losing to Thurstan in 2005 came back to their winning ways from 2006 to 2009 and in 2010 the match was not played. Isipathana won in 2011 under the captaincy of Devinda Prasad by a stunning 70-6. In 2012 they won the match thrashing Thurstan 98-0. In 2013 the match was not played. 2014 they won 55-5 under Shenal Deelaka
They retained the Abdul Jabbar Trophy last year under the captaincy of number eight Omalka Gunarathna by beating Thurstan College by a smashing 105 points to nil victory. This score goes as the highest team score ever by any team in this prestiges encounter.
Isipathanians lead the tally with 43 wins during the last 45 games played between these two schools against 1 by Thurstan while one match played in 1975 have ended in a tie and in 1972, 2010 and 2013 the match was not played. This year Isipathana College is led by centre kushan Indunil and their coaching staff comprised Nilfer Ibrahim as Head Coach and Terence Henry as Assistant Coach.
The Thurstan team is captained by Tisum Palihawadana while Achala Perera is the head coach and Chanaka Chandimal as assistant coach. Mohammed Akram is their trainer.

A letter to Sports Editor : The Royal-Trinity Bradby fiasco  an eye witness view
This describes the summary of chain of events at Kandy on 15th May soon after the Bradby, which most of the anti-Royalists dont want to know and dont want to reveal as a result of jealousy.
No one is condoning the violence. Theres a lot than most people are not aware of:
1. Both team captains did shake hands on stage and openly discussed and agreed that Nikhila would raise the shield on the podium. Rahul agreed, but was pushed by the TCK principal at the last minute to get on stage.
2. The fact that most spectators dont know is that the shield is NOT shared if it ends in a draw. 30 seconds into the brawl both teams were escorted back to the dressing rooms while the drunk Old Boys fought it out. Both teams only retaliated to punches thrown by spectators which was ridiculous.
3. The teams made up and enjoyed the Bradby dinner together. The Trinity team lined up to welcome the Royal College team which was pretty awesome!
Theres a lot the masses dont know simply because judgements are made based on a 30 seconds video clip. In fact two past captains and current Royal College Rugby Advisory committee members Rajiv Malalasekera and Zulki Hamid were repeatedly asking the Trinity principal as to why he was being so stubborn and not following the rules.
The situation could have been avoided if the Trinity organizing committee was around and was aware of how to handle this situation. Trinity principal should understand traditions and respect past captains a bit more.
Again, no one is justifying violence but both teams were forced into this situation but made up soon after like true champions. None of the media outfits have put that info out there because good news never gets enough attention.
The only fact remaining is that the organizing committees and school administration should take full responsibility and ensure it never happens again.
Thilina Perera, Kandy
