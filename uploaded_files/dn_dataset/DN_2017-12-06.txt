President shows good governance traits
President Maithripala Sirisena has shown the characteristics of good governance by appointing a Muslim as the SLFP organizer for Puttalam District, said Puttalam District SLFP organizer Naina Mohamed Ajnas Khan.
He was delivering his maiden speech at Puttalam Town Hall, on Sunday. The event was organized by Puttalam District Sri Lanka Freedom Party to welcome the newly appointed SLFP organizer for Puttalam District Naina Mohamed Ajnas Khan.
Khan added that a Muslim has never been appointed as the SLFP organizer for the Puttalam district. For the first time, our President has provided such an opportunity to Puttalam. Through this action, the President has shown that Muslims who live in Puttalam should also live up to their fullest. This also shows that Sri Lankan Muslims will be treated equally under the Good Governance government. The veteran members of SLFP have supported this, he said.
This is a great opportunity for me to solve the prevailing problems in the district. Therefore, I assure that I will contact the President directly, and will provide immediate solutions for problems related to education and the health sector in the district, he said.
Puttalam District SLFP Leader Milroy Fernando, SLFP Co-organizer for the Puttalam electorate Victor Antony Perera, SLFP Co-organizer and the North Western Provincial Councillor N. T. M. Thahir, SLFP organizer for Anamaduwa electorate Ananda Samarakoon, former member of Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha Thatchana Moorthi and others participated.

SLFP should contest LG polls with JO
Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera yesterday stated that the SLFP should contest upcoming local government election with Joint Opposition for the betterment of the country and the general public.
We wont oppose two parties contesting together at the local government election if the President agrees not to bring new constitution, not to sell public property and uncover the real culprits of the bond issue and take strict legal action against them, the Thera said.
The statement was made yesterday during the Mawbima Surakime Jathika Balawegayas media briefing held at the Abayaramaya Temple in Narahenpita.The Thera said the members of the Mawbima Surakime Jathika Balawegaya met the President twice to discuss the matter, but he has not yet expressed his views.
Abhayaramaya has a history of uniting the SLFP. Even during the period of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike, we united the party. So we continue discussing the matter with the President, the Thera said.
Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Vihara Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera said the government was trying to bring a new constitution not essential to the country.
"The Country needs peace among all communities, not a new constitution.
A document cannot build unity among nations. The unity will come in the conversion of our heart. The unity comes with love and faith," the Thera said.
Ravana Balaya General Secretary Ven. Ittekande Saddhatissa Thera spoke.

3D-printed ear implants  can improve treatment for hearing loss
Scientists have 3D-printed accurate, custom-designed prosthetic replacements for damaged parts of the middle ear, paving the way for improved surgical treatments for hearing impairment.
The technique has the potential to improve a surgical procedure that often fails because of incorrectly sized prosthetic implants, researchers said.
Conductive hearing loss can be treated through surgical reconstruction using prostheses made from stainless steel struts and ceramic cups.
The surgery, which generally involves tailoring a prosthesis for each patient in the operating room, is plagued by high failure rates.
The ossicles are very small structures, and one reason the surgery has a high failure rate is thought to be due to incorrect sizing of the prostheses, said Jeffrey D Hirsch, assistant professor at the University of Maryland in the US.
If you could custom-design a prosthesis with a more exact fit, then the procedure should have a higher rate of success, said Hirsch.
Researchers studied 3D printing as a way to create customised prostheses for patients with conductive hearing loss.
The technology has been used successfully to solve a number of other medical prosthesis problems, including in the areas of joint replacement and facial reconstruction surgery.
The researchers removed the middle linking bone in the ossicular chain from three human cadavers and imaged the structures with CT.
They employed an inexpensive 3D printer to create prostheses to restore continuity for each of the middle ears.
The prostheses were made from a resin that hardens when exposed to ultraviolet laser light. Each of the prostheses had unique measurements.
Four surgeons then performed insertion of each prosthesis into each middle ear, blinded to the bone from and for which each was designed. The researchers then asked the surgeons to match each prosthesis to its correct source.
All four surgeons were able to correctly match the prosthesis model to its intended temporal bone - the bone containing the middle and inner parts of the ear.
The chances of this occurring randomly are 1 in 1,296, said Hirsch.
This study highlights the core strength of 3-D printing - the ability to very accurately reproduce anatomic relationships in space to a sub-millimetre level, Hirsch said.
The results suggest that commercially available CT scanners can detect significant anatomic differences in normal human middle ear ossicles, and that these differences can be accurately represented with current 3D printing technology.
More significantly, surgeons are able to detect these differences, which should not only increase the likelihood of a proper fit, but also decrease surgical time, according to Hirsch.

ADB approves $500 mn facility to improve  rural roads in 5 Indian states
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Second Rural Connectivity Investment Program totaling $500 million to improve rural roads in five Indian states.
All-weather roads are crucial for economic growth, especially in Indias rural areas, said Andri Heriawan, an ADB Transport Specialist. Building on the success of our previous assistance in the rural roads sector, ADB will work closely with the Government of India to provide the connectivity to improve rural communities access to markets, health centers, education facilities, and other opportunities.
Rural roads are vital components of Indias overall road network, comprising 80% of all paved roads in the country and connecting rural areas with major district roads, state roads, and national highways. Recognizing this, the investment program will construct and upgrade over 12,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads in the states of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. It will also support the state governments to improve rural road maintenance and safety.
The program builds on the first Rural Connectivity Investment Program in 2012, financed by ADB through an $800 million MFF, which added about 9,000 km of all-weather rural roads in the same states. The investment programs first tranche, amounting to $250 million, expected in December 2017, will construct an initial 6,254 km of all-weather rural roads. It will also pave the way for the training of about 2,000 project engineers on road safety and road maintenance. The programs second tranche, for the same amount, is expected to come in the third quarter of 2019.
The investment plan supports the governments drive for innovative approaches to reduce costs, conserve non-renewable natural resources, and promote the use of waste materials in rural road construction. Given that the project states are expected to see increased rainfall and storm surges, the road designs will take into account these climate risks with measures such as greater elevation of road embankments, slope protection, and better drainage in flood-prone areas.

Women were extensively consulted during the project design and will gain some key benefits, including improved access to healthcare, livelihoods, and schooling. (ADB)

Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry has made all arraignments to hold the local government election on its part, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said the rest has to be made by the Election Commissioner.
He said an amendment to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act would be presented to Parliament today. The amendment is to correct some printing mistakes made in the Sinhala version of the Act, he said. Commenting on the demarcation of electoral boundaries in the Sri Pada sacred area , the Minister said there has been no change with regard to boundaries of the Sri Pada sacred area, and it was still belonging to the Ratnapura district and not to the Nuwara Eliya district.
District boundaries cannot be changed under any circumstances. The Sri Pada area has already been declared as sacred and it can not be tarnished under any situation, he said.
The Minister said all local bodies have increased their revenue for last two years. The reason is we managed to eliminate frauds and corruption and minimising wastage taken place in these institutions earlier, the Minister said.

Amazon enters Australia
Amazon has made its long-awaited entry into Australia, in a move that could have ramifications for the country's A$300bn (171bn) retail sector.
Online shopping makes up a relatively small - but growing - proportion of retail sales in Australia.
Geography, poor infrastructure and firms slow to adapt to e-commerce have held the sector back. Australia's retail industry association said Amazon would help local firms by providing a new sales platform.
Australian consumers could previously buy through Amazon's US site.
From Tuesday they can buy locally, as the American retail giant has established a huge distribution warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne on the country's east coast, home to most of the population.

BCCI to keep eye on Delhi  air before allotting matches
A day after poor air quality interrupted the second day of the third Test between India and Sri Lanka, BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary said that pollution levels will be taken into consideration before allotting an international game to Delhi.
Pollution has been spoken about for years, but not just in one walk of life. These are sensitive matters, and there are agencies and structures that deal with this. Scheduling of matches in Delhi during this time of the year will be considered. We do check the weather before hosting matches in places like Delhi, the NCR, and western UP, he told reporters.
However, Choudhary denied reports that Sri Lankas cricket board had reservations about hosting the match in Delhi. The Sri Lankan board had not contacted the BCCI regarding air quality in the city, he said.
On Sunday, the Test match was stopped twice, with the Lankans complaining of uneasiness due to the poor air quality. At one point in the post-lunch session, they didnt have enough fit players to field, and five of them took the field wearing masks.
On Monday, none of the Sri Lankan batsmen wore the masks, apart from a couple of reserve players. Among the Indians, only reserve spinner Kuldeep Yadav was seen wearing one. But Sri Lanka batsman Angelo Mathews, who scored a hundred and batted for close to two-and-a-half sessions, said that the air quality was a bit worse.
It is pretty much the same. Or, a bit worse probably. It is always the same. Look, it is up to the match referee and umpires to take the decision. We are here to play cricket and we want to get out on the park. Youve got to deal with what you have for the next two days, he said.
Mathews maintained that Sundays incidents  captain Dinesh Chandimals frequent pleas to the umpires and skipper Virat Kohlis hasty declaration  hadnt affected his teams ties with the Indian players. Not at all.
As I said, it was one of those unique occasions where no one knew what to do. It didnt hamper the relationship of players on the field. Off the field, we are great friends and it will remain the same, he said.
On Monday, Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami appeared to be in some discomfort, but he said later that it was due to him being slightly unwell earlier. Shami, however, said that steps need to be taken to curb air pollution.
I was a bit unwell from before, I was feeling cold. Obviously, this pollution is a problem but it wasnt as much as it was being showed. It could be that we are used to it. It is possible that we have been bearing it for some time now My belief is that as much as possible, the reasons for pollution should be reduced, and that would be better. People are now used to bearing the problem, he said.  Indian Express

EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION, EVERYONES RESPONSIBILITY
Blessed by nature, threatened by humans
Ive been a life-long naturalist. And for a naturalist, Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to come to  for your coasts, hills, plains, mud-flats and seas. For your wildlife: your animals, birds, butterflies and sea creatures. For your plants: your flowers and trees. You have 30 species of endemic birds, birds that are only found here and in no other country in the world, 50 endemic snakes, and lots and lots of endemic plants. You wont need me to persuade you that Sri Lanka is a country blessed by Nature. And this plays an important part in many tourists decisions to visit.
All these things are precious, and they need protecting. That important parts of Sri Lankas wildlife are under threat, and a number of its national parks under unsustainable pressures, is not in doubt.
The illegal trade in wildlife is flourishing. In the past few days, weve seen reports of hundreds of kilos of pangolin scales being captured by the police, and of tourists stopped at the airport trying to leave with protected plants and animals.
We read about illegal logging in Wilpattu, encroachment on the Sinharaja Forest, and unauthorised building in park buffer zones. Many of us would have been at Yala National Park when the gates open in the morning and jeeps race in by the hundred.
We have all seen the rubbish that collects in drifts on Sri Lankas beautiful beaches. The latest Tourism Strategic Plan candidly admits that the countrys international image is suffering because of this.
Tourism Vision 2025
The Government recently launched its Tourism Vision 2025 to provide strategic direction to the tourism sector. It envisions Sri Lanka recognised as the worlds finest island for memorable, authentic and diverse experiences. Central to the vision lie concepts of sustainability. At its core is a tourism philosophy that celebrates Sri Lankan heritage, environment, values and people, one that is socially inclusive and environmentally responsible and provides economic benefits to communities and the country.
As I look at Sri Lanka and reflect on your countrys tourism potential and future needs, this emphasis on the environment and on the first-class management of your great cultural and natural sites makes good sense and is much needed. It needs to be about more than just the great sites, of course  its how things are all around the island thats as important, to attract foreign visitors, yes and, more than this, for the people of Sri Lanka themselves.
When I was at university I spent two of my summers working with a team of scientists producing a sustainable management plan for a cloud forest high in the Andes Mountains in Ecuador. Since then Ive talked with governments about environmental issues and taken an interest in conservation regimes in countries around the world. Some work well; some, though intentions are good, dont. Here are three of my own reflections about how things are going in Sri Lanka.
The first is that I see that often the rules are good but they arent being or cant be enforced. Politicians dont always help. Indeed too often they are part of the problem, with self-interest getting in the way of conservation measures that are needed. Nor do businesses always play the part they need to play. Take the problems being faced by Bolgoda Lake and the surrounding wetlands.
Planning laws are sometimes ignored or over-ridden, chemicals and effluent flow in from industry and hotels. There comes a point when ecosystems, even strong ecosystems, break. Rules need to be enforced.
Endangered animals and plants
My second reflection is that sometimes the rules are good, but the penalties for breaking them insufficient. Take the worrying number of visitors from China who are leaving or trying to leave the country with endangered animals and plants. Recent press reports mention small fines being levied at Bandaranaike International Airport when people are stopped. Penalties that really deter are needed to slow this flourishing trade.
And my third reflection, that controls on visitor and vehicle numbers in some national parks are much needed and should be an easy win. There are plenty of good examples from around the world of how to make restrictions on numbers work. Controlling vehicle behaviour and enforcing road and other park disciplines need to be priorities too.
Everyone can help by speaking up for good and sustainable conservation practices. The tourism industry, communities that benefit from tourism and the general public all have important parts to play in the conservation effort. Everyone can help to encourage (and sometimes push) central and local government and authorities, and national and local politicians. Everyone can support the goals of the parks authorities, the Forest Department and conservation NGOs.
Sri Lanka is a land of great beauty, extraordinary variety and winning smiles. The greater the number of people who are speaking up today for the conservation practices Sri Lanka needs to have in place, the more confident we can all be that a future generation will still be able to enjoy the remarkable beauty and variety that make this island such a special place.

Brexit into Buddhism
As far back as 1958, one of the popular magazines known to the readers as World Digest carried an investigative essay titled as Why Britons are Becoming Buddhists, written by an English writer named Vernon Brown. I was informed of this innovative trendsetting piece of writing by none other than the learned scholar Professor Gunapala Malalasekara.
I remember his words which went as Please read the contents, for this is the type of essay one needs to be translated into other languages. I remember how I went in search of the World Digest and read the contents as a schoolboy at the time. Brown triggers off with the following words:
Fresh flower
Flank the image of the Buddha
On the dais: in front of the image
A glass of water,
In a corner of the room, a gong to
Signal the end of meditation.
Brown takes the reader further deep into the subject in a meditative tone.
The image and mystery of the east in a four-storey house in Ovington Gardens, Kensington, were you step back 2500 years by taking off your shoes and passing iron gates into the shrine.
The setting is created for further information of what happens in the holy abode.
To this incense laden room come Buddhists of all races.
Who are they Sinhalese, Burmese, Russians, Chinese, French and British, to pay homage to the Blessed One, The Venerable One, The All Enlightened One and The Buddha. Then the writer says that the holy place is known as The Buddhist temple in London or Buddhist Vihara as it is known to many. In the place, according to the writer, one seeks happiness even for a moment by self knowledge, self mastery and virtue which is the message of the Buddha.
Then he goes on to state who the Buddha is. The Buddha was a son of a tribal king who found after a six-year search for Enlightenment while meditating under the Bo tree at Gaya in India. Shifting the attention of the reader from their historical past, the writer comes once again to his surroundings. He hears English voices from the reading room.
Blissful state
Two men who might be bank clerks or teacher are seen discussing what had been taught by the Buddha. They are seen discussing the concepts of the four Noble Truths and proceed on to Eight Noble paths that help them to elevate their day to day life into a blissful state of Nibbana, which is the ultimate aim. Sometimes they discuss these with their friends who have come to study from Sri Lanka (Ceylon at the time).
Time passes fruitfully getting to know more which lead them to read books written by such scholars as Rhys Davids and Christmas Humphreys. Both of them happened to be frequent visitors to this place. They too had links with the University of London, where the unit known as School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) was introduced as an affiliated faculty.
According to the writer, more people are taking up Buddhism in Britain than ever before. At the time of writing the said article, there had been about 2000 British Buddhists. And the new converts are coming in at the rate of about 50 to 60 a month. It is also recorded that more than 100000 copies of a recent low-priced book on Buddhism had been sold. Perhaps this is a reference to the book titled Buddhism as written by Christmas Humphreys.
The reader comes to know the rate of interest paid to the subject which resulted in the formation of Buddhist societies both in Oxford and Cambridge, where most of the members to the Buddhist society are British students. Brown quotes one of his informants in reference to the Buddhist societies of these two centres.
Shifted interest
We get inquiries from all over the country. At first, people became fascinated because Buddhism was something different. The interest has now shifted to the more intelligent people, particularly teachers, scientists, doctors and people belonging to various church denominations.
The moments of illumination in this article rests on the various spiritual segments underlined. Every year, the British Society takes up at a retreat of meeting monks and laymen for meditation. The basic methods of meditation are taught by the monks to the layment and from then the teachings lead to Dhamma discourses. Then he states that the term discipline is taken seriously where silence matters above all.
They sit in silence pondering on the messages of the Buddha, where the theory and practice blend into one entity. The abode is the Holy Temple, formed as recorded in 1954, under the trusteeship of a few philanthropists, Sinhalese, in response to the growing interest they have observed. Then the writer cites a name or two who are responsible for the promotion of the vision. One name is cited as Venerable Dr Hammalawa Saddhatissa Thera, the Sinhala Bhikkhu in charge who lives in a barely furnished room at the temple. The conversation that ensues between Venerable Saddhatissa Thera and the writer goes as follows.
The Venerable says: I gave some talks at Oxford recently, and was gratified to see the extent of the interest among many of the students. They had an amazing thirst for Buddhist knowledge.
Saffron discipline
The writer cites another name of a young monk who is known as Venerable K Sri Dhammananda. The description goes as a monk of 14 years who wears the saffron robe and his head shaven. Facing him is a time of hardship and self discipline. For the next few years, he will study Pali, the contemporary language with Sanskrit, and the teachings of the Buddha. The fascinating and resourceful piece of investigation comes to a close with the following lines that touch the spiritual plane.
Upstairs a thin
Musical voice was
Intoning Buddhist precepts
I undertake the rule of training to refrain from injury to living things
I undertake the rule of training to refrain from taking that which is not given
I undertake the rule of training to refrain from sensuality falsehood, liquor  what engenders slothfulness.
Down below the door bell rang, and a nervous young man entered. Another seeker after serenity.

CB to take legal action against finance company fraudsters
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on November 6 decided to issue a notice of cancellation of the licence issued to Central Investments and Finance PLC (CIFL) to carry on finance business under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011, the Central Bank said.
CIFL was confronted with severe liquidity crisis since 2013 due to mismanagement and other irregular transactions carried out by the management of that company. It has also been observed that the directors and senior management of these companies have fraudulently inflated the value of the assets and the examination of the documents relating to such assets has revealed that those are either fictitious or entangled with encumbrances.
The Company was not in operation since 2014. During this period, the CBSL had discussions with local and foreign institutions/individuals who expressed their interest in investing and reviving the company.
The Monetary Board also wishes to clarify that any revival plan needs at least Rs. 3 billion investments and at least 30-40% of the deposits should be repaid immediately as they had not been paid interest or the capital of their deposits for the last 4 year period.
At the same time, the investors should be credible and the funds should be transferred to Sri Lanka through legal channels, in the case of foreign investors. The total deposit liability of the company is about Rs. 3.5 billion and the number of depositors is 4,092. Of those, 2,501 depositors are with deposits less than Rs. 600,000.
As per the present regulations, maximum amount that can be paid under Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme is Rs. 300,000. However, the Monetary Board having considered the plight of the small depositors has decided to double the compensation from Rs. 300,000 to Rs. 600,000.
Accordingly, in the case of CIFL, 61% of the depositors will be fully settled with their deposits. The CBSL wishes to inform the depositors and the other stakeholders of CIFL, the company has the right to submit their objection to the Monetary Board within the time period mentioned in the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 under which the cancellation notice was issued. Further, it is also important to mention that the CBSL has extended the deadline given to a potential investor on several occasions to prove the availability of funds which has not been fulfilled as yet.
With regard to the The Standard Credit Finance Ltd and City Finance Corporation Ltd the Monetary Board has not issued notices of cancellation as there are legal issues to be resolved with regard to those two companies.
The CBSL also informs that every effort will be made to take legal actions against those who are responsible for the frauds and misuse of depositors funds of those companies.

Ceylon Chambers Chief Economist welcomes Budget's long-term vision
Ceylon Chamber of Commerces Chief Economist Shiran Fernando welcomed Budget 2018 for its more long-term vision and complementary nature to recent policy documents while putting forward new initiatives such as the blue-green concept.
The big positive in this Budget is that there is a significant consistency with recent policy documents and strategies such as Vision 2025 and the Prime Ministers 2017 Economic Policy Statement, Fernando said, citing private enterprise, liberalization and macro stability as common trends in these state policy documents.
He also said this Budget has more realistic proposals than previously, such as the mechanism for levy of the carbon tax on vehicles. Last years Budget mentioned such as a tax but offered no method of levy.
The previous Budget also proposed a committee to look at implementation of Budget proposals, but this year, the Budget has moved towards establishing a unit under the Finance Ministry for this purpose.
Fernando was hopeful that this unit will be operationalised this time around. I think there is a concerted effort to improve on this, he said.
They will have to prioritize which proposals require the greatest level of attention.
Fernando commended the repealing of the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises or Underutilized Assets Act No. 43 of 2011 as an important Budget announcement. This if enacted will send a positive signal to investors that private businesses will not be expropriated overnight for underperformance or any other reasons.
Fernando conceded that there was repetition of proposals in this Budget such as the Debt Repayment Levy which was present in the 2017 Budget as a Financial Transaction Levy. Repetition serves to underline the urgency for implementation of what merely remains on paper.
He however underscored the need for implementation to avoid repetition of proposals which is undesirable.
What Fernando would have liked to see in this Budget was an action plan or direction with regard to SOE reforms.
Fernando said the new taxes such as those on sugary beverages and cellular towers will have a negative impact on those sectors and reiterated the Chambers call for a more medium term plan that factors in grace periods for businesses to adjust when such taxes are introduced.
Speaking on the tourism industry which has been earmarked as a thrust sector, he said while this sector has seen organic growth, much more needs to be done in terms of offering attractions such as those offered by other countries which are more experiential in nature.
He welcomed the VAT refund scheme for foreign passport holders in principal as having the potential to complement Sri Lankas ambition in becoming a shopping hub.

Ceylon Roots brings over  750 Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka
Ceylon Roots, a destination marketing company in Sri Lanka, created history by becoming the first to bring in the largest incentive tourist group from China for a one week holiday in the island. The group included over 750 guests.
The group was from Jiong Aplhay Bio Company, which is one of the largest mushroom manufacturing and distributing companies in the world. The top 700 sales agents from all over China and officials of the company were selected for this incentive trip.
Ceylon Roots Chief Executive Officer Dishan Perera said that they are looking at opportunities of this nature and when they contacted Jiong Aplhay Bio Company, this tour was being planned and Malaysia was their preferred destination for their past 15 year tours. We managed to convince them to come to Sri Lanka and they are happy with their decision. The total package was over US$ 1.2 million and the guests would also spent an equal amount in Sri Lanka.
Perera said that they will stay in Dambulla, Kandy, the South and Colombo during their stay. He said that today Sri Lanka is fast making a name as a tourism hot spot in China and this must be exploited further to bring in more arrivals and revenue to Sri Lanka.
Tourism Minister John Amaratunga who also participated at the mega dinner at BMICH said that he was pleased to see such a number of tourists in one group and thanked Roots Travels for its efforts.
The tour was coordinated by Sunflower Travel Company in China. (SS)

Childs play
A three-day theatre festival for children and youth will be held at Lionel Wendt from December 8 to 10 at 3.30 pm and 6.45 pm. The festival will feature Walas Pawula (Goldilocks and the Three Bears) directed by Chandana Aluthge, Ratmalee (Red Riding Hood) and Punchi Apata Dan Therei (We Know It Now) written and directed by Somalatha Subasinghe.
All these plays are semi-musical type. The production style of the plays has been developed so as to give the audiences an aesthetic journey of entertainment.
A majority of children in the current generation find refuge in television, computer or mobile screens in their leisure times. The busy schedules of children, as well as their parents and the lack of alternative leisure activities, are the main reason for this. However, the extensive exposure to violence through video games and television programmes facilitate a likelihood of aggressive behaviour of children. Not only do the video games and television programmes expose children to demonstrations of how human beings can inflict violence to hurt each other, it also reduces the sensitivity to pain that humans share.
In such a context Somalatha Subasinghe Play House presents the Walas Pawula semi-musical to children and youth audiences this December. Walas Pawula celebrates concepts such as love, kindness and appreciation of nature paving an opportunity to positively influence children to create a more caring and empathetic society.
Based on the fairy tale Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the script of Walas Pawula was adopted and developed by the veteran childrens playwright, director and the founder of Somalatha Subasinghe Play House the late Somalatha Subasinghe. The play is directed and choreographed by the contemporary artiste of childrens theatre Dr Chandana Aluthge. Walas Pawula keeps true to the spirit of being a childrens play of Somalatha Subasinghe Play House by breaking the miscomprehended concept of children theatre in Sri Lanka. The actors of Play House rigorously train and harness their art of childrens theatre by performing at international platforms such as the Childrens Performing Arts Festival, South Korea. The play is a polished and complete production crafted utmost delicate detailing and attention just as a play directed for older audiences would be.
Walas Pawula tells the story of the curious little Ruwanmalee. Ruwanmalee spends most of her time with her dancing dolls, wooden soldiers and talking parrots as her parents are very busy adults. One day when her parents are away, Ruwanmalee being lonely and bored of only playing with her toys goes on an adventure to find out what is in the forest near her house despite her parents' advice. The forest unravels an enchanted world to Ruwanmalee that she never knew that existed. The beauty of the birds, deer, trees, streams and flowers around her brings so much joy to Ruwanmalee. Exhausted by her adventure, Ruwanmalee ends the journey at the empty house of the three bears. When the bears return and discover Ruwanmalee in their house, more magic unravels as the baby bear and his parents welcome Ruwanmalee to their house with much love.
The sublime music and the tasteful choreography create a magical experience that is very enjoyable for children even in this generation.
The beautifully written script highlights the humaneness of the bear family in contrast to the ever so busy human family, provoking older audiences to evaluate their own values and priorities. The music, the costumes, the props, the choreography, the acting and the script all come together in a great harmony presents an aesthetic journey in a magical world for the whole family to enjoy and experience.

China-made environment-friendly bicycle set to hit African market
A Chinese made bicycle which is convenient for short urban trips while reducing congestion and the city's urban carbon footprint is set to be launched in Africa.
Developed by Mobike Technology Ltd, a bicycle sharing service through the use of smartphone apps reduces congestion, and continually strives to improve the quality of city life.
Florian Bohnert, head of Global Partnerships at the Mobike Technology Limited, said in Nairobi on Monday that the company will launch in Nairobi next year and thereafter launch in other African countries.
We intend to introduce the bicycle in the continent once we sign an agreement with Nairobi city authorities to help solve the problem in the city, Bohnert told Xinhua in an interview on the sidelines of the UN Environment Assembly underway in Nairobi.
He said the bikes are environmentally good for the health and environment because they reduce pollution and congestion in the cities.
The bicycles saves space since one car is equivalent to 10 bicycles and they are convenient and faster, he noted.
Bohnert revealed that his firm provides the bicycles and the technology that incorporates simcards and Global Positioning System (GPS), a space-based navigation system that provides the location where the bike is and the time it is seen there.
The GPS and the sim card connect the bike to the platform and also unlock it before the user takes a ride.
He added that the bikes are durable, tubeless and lasts four years without maintenance, as well as help reduce air pollution.
At the end of their ride, users will be able to return the bike to a designated Mobike preferred location or any regular bike parking area.
The cities need to invest money in additional cycle lanes on their roads, acquire that data and be advised on where to launch, he added.
The bike can help the African cities make income as the user's simple download the app and use the bikes at their convenience.
We work closely with local authorities in 200 cities in 12 countries where we have 8 million bicycles that have help solved transport problems in the countries, Bohnert added.
The bicycles are already being used in the cities of China, the United States, Germany, Italy, Singapore and so on. Bohnert said the fee is accommodative because the company wants many people to adopt the new environmental friendly transportation system.
UN Environment Executive Director Erik Solheim and Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Liu Xianfa on Sunday launched a bicycle ride in Nairobi city that was attended by hundreds of international and local riders to raise awareness of the role of sustainable urban transportation in reducing air pollution.
Solheim said it was time to redesign the roads and embrace pathways where city dwellers could easily walk and ride their bikes as this helps reduce air pollution and also keep them physically fit.
The Beijing based company is currently exhibiting their bicycles at the ongoing United Nations Environmental Assembly (UNEA).

Favouritism, thy name is shame
There were complaints that the previous government were appointing their friends and relations to important government positions. Have the position changed now Are there a system and a policy to appoint people to important positions Are there regulations Who is making these appointments Are applications called Do all have opportunities to apply
Let us do a study and see. What are these important positions Is the selection process fair Is it fair to appoint close relations and friends of politicians Have those appointed got required training and experience Who is looking into these issues Our leaders are very clever to preach. However, they are very weak in practicing what they preach.
It is not difficult to appoint the correct person to any position. It is happening in most of the developed countries. Unfortunately we continue to appoint our friends and relations. Our leaders misuse their power and authority.
There is dissatisfaction everywhere. There is frustration everywhere. Some leaders think that the country is their private property. They do not follow accepted procedures. They act like dictators. We changed the government to correct this situation. But the situation has not changed.
They are favouring friends. They are favouring relations. They are favouring party supporters. They are favouring their area people. Things are not happening in a fair manner. There is a circle round every politician.
They are running the show. They enjoy all the privileges. The common man is very badly ignored.
Let us open our eyes and protest against these unfair practices. Most of the corruption is due to these corrupt appointments.
Do not keep silent when you observe these lapses. Fight for justice. Then only we can correct this situation. Show the leaders appointing friends and relations to important positions is also corruption.
It is also a way of stealing government money. It is not correct according to any religious teaching. It is also robbery.

Coach Pothas unhappy  about the timing of bad light
DELHI, Tuesday: Sri Lanka coach Nic Pothas questioned the timing of the umpires coming off for bad light after Sri Lanka had lost two wickets in one over to left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja on the fourth day of the third and final Test played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here Tuesday.
I am sure the light meter is absolutely spot-on, no doubt it but to me it looked too much of a coincidence to lose a wicket to see suddenly its too dark for the seamers and we lose two wickets to spin and then its too dark and we are off. Can the light deteriorate that quick I dont know, said Pothas at the end of the day.
If India is playing against a very good cricket team, momentum is a big thing in sport and luck plays a big part sometimes you just want a little bit of the rub of the green. Its not ideal to lose three wickets it is frustrating at the end of the day.
If we look back on the day we did pretty well in the morning to extend our innings and I thought we bowled pretty well upfront. But yet its frustrating. There is nothing to discuss I back their (umpires) decision, he said.
Sri Lanka left with an overwhelming target of chasing 410 for victory was limping at 36-3 by the sudden flurry of wickets towards the end of the day.
When the question of the smog was raised again Pothas replied, We decided at practice this morning we are not going to discuss it and not going to talk about it. The situation is what it is, you get out there do the job. The bottom line is we are here to play a Test match and there is a professional bunch of people in our change room and we are very positive about our talk, about the way be behave and the way we adapt to certain situations.
Pothas admitted that there were some medical tests done on the Lankan players but he had no idea on what it was for.
There was some tests done and I am not a doctor Ive no idea what these tests tell you, what we are testing, why are we testing, it doesnt make anything to get away with the situation. A situation is a situation so lets get on with it, said Pothas. The guys did fantastically well throughout the day and had great attitude. We saw at the end of today (Mohammad) Shami also struggling. The guys have done superbly well to deal with the situation.
Talking of the final days play Pothas said: If you go skeptical and careful we are heading for trouble. Its for us to have a discussion in the change room.
There wont be very many fancy plays taking place on the last day of the Test. Seven wickets in hand and the wicket is very good, there wont be anything confusing or complex the way we go about tomorrow.
WHATEVER THE SITUATION YOU NEED TO ADJUST - DHAWAN
Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan said that the Sri Lankan players were feeling uncomfortable because they may be having less pollution at home because of the beaches.
There are more beaches in Sri Lanka. Its natural that a city surrounded by beaches wont have pollution. Of course they may be feeling. As I said I wont hide that there is pollution in Delhi. Now if its there, its there. You cant help it. Maybe they are feeling it more, I dont know. But still I would insist that we should do our duty  that is to play cricket, said Dhawan.
There are a lot of players in our team who are not used to this pollution thing in Delhi as they come from other states. But if you have been assigned a job (to play), you cant let anything come on its way. The situation is the same for them also.
If you are playing in Delhi at some other point of time, the pollution wont affect you. During the winters there is a lot of smog, so whatever the situation is, we need to adjust accordingly, he said.

Being in and out of the UNP
Controversial Cyril Mathew
Cyril Mathew the controversial Sinhalese-nationalist, who quit the General Secretary post and the party sighting differences with his leader Dudley Senanayake in 1967, rejoined later and was expelled from the Cabinet and the governing United National Party by President J R Jayewardene in 1984, but regained his position under Premadasa.
In his letter of resignation dated November 2, 1967, Mathew stated: as an honest politician dedicated to the welfare of the motherland and my people, I have no alternative but to resign from a party with which I have been associated with for nearly 20 years. A divided party cannot rule a nation. Unless there is trust and confidence between those at the top the whole party would be a nest of intrigue. He had stated that he had tried his best to tell his leader, Dudley Senanayake, that if the UNP continued to behave in the manner it was doing now not only it will ruin itself but it would ruin the country too.
Mathew further said: I entered politics seven years ago, in the conviction that the UNP, chastened by its route in 1956, had learned its lesson and profited by it, and was capable of rescuing the country from the chaos of 1960. Today I realised that it was not only in Europe that decadent aristocracy was prone to learn nothing and forget nothing. I am disillusioned, but it is with no pangs of regret that I tender my resignation, not only from the post of Secretary of the Party but also from membership of the party itself.
Public opinion
Quoting the following section from the report of the Committee appointed in 1965 to report on reorganisation of the UNP, from 1948 to 56 the UNP with the help of seasoned politicians governed the country efficiently, built it up economically, saved our external assets, our foreign and internal debt was a small fraction of what it is today, issue of Treasury bills was at a minimum, but at the 1956 elections only eight members were returned.
One of the charges levelled against the party of this period was that the high-ups were giving various jobs to their close relatives. About the truth of this allegation, we are not concerned. But we are certainly aware that the UNP of that time never in an organised manner helped their party supporters from amongst the ordinary people.
I would like to Mathew wrote, Believe it was propriety that prevented your giving a sympathetic hearing to the rank and file of the Party who worked for us at the elections.
Quoting another section which said, the type of minister who thinks he is in office by some divine right and not by virtue of the strength of the party will only be a millstone around the neck of the party and such an individual will only help to drag himself, the Party and the country to destruction. While condemning the previous regime for its insensitivity to the public opinion in certain respects, you have permitted some of your ministers to surpass them.
Join the UNP to see the world was once a derisive comment on pre-1956 policy, which the SLFP undoubtedly improved upon  while in opposition you vociferously protested against the appointment of defeated candidates to Corporations enabling them thereby nurse their electorates. Once in power however, you have permitted the same practice I have adduced sufficient proof of the efforts I have made to make you see the writing on the wall but you have been insulated by YES MEN and tale-carriers who put self-interest above that of the Party and the country. You have failed to lead the Party in a manner that would instill confidence in the people of the country, and it is therefore that I am compelled to tender my resignation.
Cyril Mathew was born on September 30, 1912, he was a member of parliament representing the Kelaniya electorate and served as the Minister of Industry and Scientific Affairs in the Jayewardene Cabinet.
Political aspirations
Mathew authored a book titled, Sinhalese! Rise to Protect Buddhism, urging Sinhalese to stand up for their rights and protect their values. He also published a pamphlet Who is the Tiger; it was a collection of provocative and insightful speeches made by him since 1979.
No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them.
- Elie Wiesel
Elected to the 8th parliament on July 21 1977, representing Kelaniya for the Party, he was well-known for his hard-line stance against the Tamil minority and its political aspirations. Mathew is generally regarded as one of the key people responsible for instigating Black July riots or the anti-Tamil pogrom of July 1983.
The holocaust consequently resulted in the eruption of a 25-year civil war that killed over 60,000 men.
The 1983 communal riots were highly organised when compared to similar events of 1915, 1958, 1977-79 in the island.
The horrors and confusion of the Black July remain etched in the minds of citizens of both communities. Goon squads drawn from ruling partys trade union arm became active, unleashing rounds of riots.
They were transported to various locations in CTB buses by the trade union leaders who worked under Cyril Mathew, the president of the Union, who was well-known for his anti-Tamil stance.
Irreparable damage
The pogrom in the last week of July, 34 years ago, left many dead, thousands injured, tens of thousands displaced, huge losses to property, commercial, social and economic disorder. Adverse propaganda against the majority community and state in foreign media traumatized the population.
The violent actions were not an abrupt and rash outbreak of the Sinhalese against the Tamils. There is considerable evidence to trust that a determined effort has been made by sections allied to the government on a cautiously placed plan. Earlier, Cyril Mathew, the minister brought in thugs from the South to Trincomalee, receiving protection from security forces, he began a reign of terror in the Eastern capital.
President J. R. Jayewardene in 1984, sacked Mathew from the Cabinet and the governing United National Party for publicly criticizing a round-table conference called by JR to redress grievances of Tamils.
However, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Jayewardene's successor, later reinstated Mathew as a party member. Mathews son Nanda became a member of the parliament too, who later held several ministerial posts under successive UNP governments. Nanda Mathew was appointed by President Kumaratunga and President Rajapaksa as Governor of the Uva Province. Cyril Mathew, a former Sri Lankan Industries Minister and an ardent crusader for Sinhalese nationalism, died of a heart attack when he was 77-years-old.

Crowned Emperor of silver screen
Sembuge Gamini Shelton Fonseka is comprehensively measured as the undisputed emperor of the silver screen enthroned. Almost 13 years ago Sri Lankas heroic epoch era of Sinhala cinema died, alongside with the abrupt demise of the legendary film celebrity and politician. It was analogous to the shutting down of the screen of the Sinhala cinema where he stood very elevated for nearly three decades dominating in various spheres spaced out with his unique, characteristic own inimitable techniques of performing.
Gamini Fonseka was born on 21 March 1936 in Dehiwala the third child of William and Daisy Fonseka. After starting school at Presbyterian Girls School along station road, Dehiwala, located in his neighbourhood. Gamini was later admitted to the prestigious S.Thomas College Mt. Lavinia.
As a youngster, he had impressed with his innate talents when he gained an initial status in imitating college teachers. Gamini when young had shown his talents in the study of the Sinhalese language cum literature. D.S Jayasekara was his first mentor who later had become the Head Master of the College. It was he who had introduced Gamini to act in stage plays in College as he had recognized in abundance his acting instincts and skills.
Secondary education
His acting was hailed, acclaimed and much-admired when he was in the upper fourth class was nominated and awarded a Sinhala literature prize. The award for this achievement was presented to him by an imminent old boy of S. Thomas College, Graduate, and Barrister from Cambridge University; a Sri Lankan Prime Minister D.S Senanayake.Gamini was also excelled as a gifted and talented cricketer. He had an abrupt end to his College career at S.Thomas prior to completing his secondary education as he was eying for an aperture into the Sinhala cinema.
Gamini Fonseka married his teenage adored girl friend, Dorothy Margaret Valencia also known as Tina in 1962 whom he had been intimately and emotionally implicated through his teen age. The couple were blessed with four children Chamila, Thanuja, Damith and Ishara. His son Damith too had inherited his talents who had successfully a short stint in the cinematic field. He remained legally married to his wife Tina until his death on 30th September 2004, over twelve years ago, when he was 68 years old at his Ja Ela residence. Sri Lankas heroic epoch era of Sinhala cinema died, adjacent with the sudden demise of legendary film personality and politician.
Umbilical string
Prior to legendary Gamini Fonsekas emergence into the Sinhala cinema, our industry was struggling as it was totally dependent on the umbilical string of the South Indian cinema when it was plunged into their ditch. The legend was chiefly instrumental in changing the infancy status of our film industry which was in the immaturity stage for decades. Of course the South Indian films made with high technology were of course impressive and to break that trend and hoodoo was his desire which he to a great degree succeeded by acting, directing, editing mostly his own creations which was hitherto then was attempting and overwhelmed to position up on its own.
He brought in a cosmopolitan type of acting and twisted to an indigenous home grown type of films which made a radical sweeping which rejuvenated thus uplifting our cinema to a very sky-scraping magnitude. For this theatrical change we all should be indebted to this genius actor, director, editor of abundant spectacular and fabulous films. In short he freed singlehandedly those in our industry from supplementary suffocation from South Indian film obsession.
At the time he launched on this revolutionary and avant-garde task he was very privileged to meet and to heed professional advice and guidance from an already legend in the field Dr Lester James Pieris and hence was equipped to take stiff challenges with his familiarity possessing a trilingual tongue This was an benefit as he could communicate with people of the calibre of K.Gunaratnam,,Alfred Thambiah,Robin Tampoe,S.Nayagam,M Selvaratnam etc. apart from been an old boy of S.Thomas College.
Gamini was seen as the budding celebrity that would effortlessly proficient to revolutionize the silver screen. Before he launched into acting, he gained invaluable experience in technical aspects of film making closely associating David Lean who made the film- Bridge on the River Kwai. That was influential to keep Gamini in superior stead to make his individual creations inaugurating with Parasathumal which stimulated and motivated film fans in the early 1960s and Gaminis name was flanked by the jaws in every family entity. His first major appearance was in the film Sandeshaya. Gamini was a genius and hero in both commercial and artistic films which was comprehensively proved by his portraying in his roles in Gamperaliya and Nidhanaya the characters of Jinadasa in the former and as Willie Abeynayake in Sandeshaya..
It was like a natural phenomenon for films in which Gamini Fonseka portrayed lead role to make box office records by running continuously for 100 days on film circuits. He possessed unparalleled talents and could indulge in stunts aerobatics, fights. Once when he acted in Demodara Palama when he was 60 years old he had to jump out of a helicopter on to a bridge which the Director sought to perform with a stunt. He had gallantly said no stunts .Once he has had to dive into deep sea 40 feet in Ranmuthuduwa which he portrayed devoid of any panic. All such scenes were completed in his own incomparable styles which scarcely any other actor could emulate straightforwardly.
With time Gamini displayed his skills in the film industry to embark upon social and political themes that were relatively in inconsistent to his preceding creations. One would bear in mind how Gamini queried the inequities in the judicial structure in the country in his film Uthumaneni.
Unconditional authority
In Sagarayak Meda that truthfully irritated then Cabinet Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike. Gamini courageously challenged the rampant political supremacy of a Cabinet Minister frenzied with unconditional authority and a doctor persecuted under such a rule. Later, in Sarungale and Nomiyena Minissu he went into the intensity of complexities of the racial topic that obsessed the civilization. Gamini was very honest in his convictions. When he called it a day from acting he had acted in 108 films, 86 as the lead role and 19 as the supporting actor. He had directed 10 films and produced 02 films.
Gamini had almost each year from 1964 to 1997 had won a Sarasaviya award for the best actor, best supporting actor, best director and in the year 1997 was awarded the commemorative award of U.W Sumapthipala.
Turbulent sessions
He withdrew from the cinema to waste his valuable time as a politician in 1988. UNP Presidential candidate Ranasinghe Premadasa, a long-standing friend of Gamini convinced the latter in the centre of the uproar of the second JVP rebellion to battle in the Matara District. Gamini accepted the bid proposed and profitably contested the polls to be made the Deputy Speaker in the Parliament. He presided over turbulent sessions but was highly respected by both sides of the House for his neutrality. As a member, he criticized the Premadasa management devoid of panic when effects did not happen to the profit of the people. He gave innovative existence and recognition to the office of the Deputy Speaker.
After the change of government in mid 1990s Gamini Fonseka was named as the Governor of the of the North-East region by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga .
Gamini Fonseka was a man who established dignity to every sphere that he was implicated in. Today actors and actresses are treated with dignity and high esteem by film producers and directors because Gamini instituted their self-esteem to the acting profession. He left a legacy to pursue and not to facsimile. In this aspect anyone who attempts to copy Gamini Fonseka would be unsuccessful.
Gaminis mentor Lester James Peiris had forecasted that another Gamini Fonseka will not be born in this country for the next one thousand years. Accordingly to him, the gigantic void created by Gaminis death in 2004 will not be filled for the next one thousand years. Gamini Fonseka was a larger-than-life figure in every way. Physically he had a superior heart than of a standard human being and that could have been a reason for his sturdy temperament power and influence.

Digital economy growth requires global efforts
China is willing to deepen global cooperation in the digital economy to gain new momentum and expand global economic growth, the head of the country's internet regulatory body said on Monday.
Xu Lin, minister of the Cyberspace Administration of China, reiterated that China would further open its economy and would work with other countries to develop an integrated global digital market with mutual benefits.
We will actively implement the G20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative and deepen international cooperation related to the Belt and Road Initiative, Xu said at the 4th World Internet Conference.
According to Xu, countries should strengthen cooperation in policy making and regulation on network facilities, information technology, cross-border e-commerce, data distribution and other digital related fields to build a fair and efficient governance system.
Working together, we should deepen global cooperation on cybersecurity, strengthen data protection and combat crimes in the field of digital economy, Xu said.
Digital economy is playing an increasingly significant part in driving China's economic growth. The size of China's digital economy hit 22 trillion yuan ($3.3 trillion) in 2016, accounting for 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
Yuan Jiajun, governor of Zhejiang province, said the digital economy is also increasingly becoming a key driver to boost global economic development.
The digital economy is experiencing a new phase of high growth, and is projected to be worth $16 trillion in China by 2035, Yuan added.
Seeing the big potential, the Chinese government has attached great importance to the development of the digital economy and introduced a wide range of strategies and operations, including the national IT development strategy, the national big data strategy and the Internet Plus action plan.
Statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center back up this internet boom. By June this year, the country had about 750 million netizens, accounting for one-fifth of the global total.
To promote and support the development of the digital economy, it is necessary for global leaders, governments, related industries and academia to reach a consensus, said Wang Binying, deputy director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization.
She added that the digital economy will accelerate transformation and upgrading in various industries, and have a huge impact on people's daily life.
Zhang Yong, CEO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, agreed, saying the integration of the digital and real economies offers a promising blueprint for future development.
It offers enormous opportunities for China to catch up with leading countries, he said.

Moment of truth nigh for SLFP dissidents
Face expulsion if support Pohottuwa
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Members of Parliament or Provincial Councils supporting the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the upcoming Local Government elections will be expelled, following disciplinary action, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday.
We hear that certain SLFP MPs and PC members, are going to support the SLPP at the forthcoming Local Government elections. No SLFP member can stand for the victory of any other political party which is considered a clear violation of the party constitution, the Minister added.
The Minister added that the party will later take legal action against errant members which may result in them losing their Parliamentary or Provincial Council seats.
Therefore, legal action will be taken against such party members of the SLFP, who support the SLPP at the upcoming LG polls, he added.
Accordingly, legal action will be taken against these SLFP members, who have been elected as SLFP Parliamentarians, Provincial Councillors or any other positions after contesting under the SLFP banner, the Minister added.
Minister Samarasinghe added that there are legal provisions not only to sack them from the party but also expel them from their Parliamentary or Provincial Council seats.
There are no two words. The party will bring their case before courts, he stressed.
However the Minister said that the final decision in this regard will be taken by the Central Committee of the SLFP in due course.
Minister Samarasinghe speaking on the recent State visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to South Korea, said that Sri Lanka was able to garner a host of benefits from the recent State visit of the President.
He added that in accordance with the framework agreement signed between the two countries, Sri Lanka will receive US $ 300 million at a concessionary rate.
But as a mark of gratitude to the President, this amount has been increased to US $ 500 million. This is also a huge achievement. The monies will be utilised in several sectors including health, education, industry, investments etc, Minister Samarasinghe said.
The countrys economy is driven in the right direction and therefore foreign reserves have increased, resulting in the decrease the interest rates. It is obvious that the country receives more local and foreign investments when the interest rates decrease,  he added.
He said that provincial councils can utilise the powers vested by the 13th Amendment rather than seeking powers through federalism.

Finance Ministry  refutes Bandulas claim
While refuting allegations made by Bandula Gunawardena MP to the effect that the government has given approval to produce spirits using rice as a raw material, the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media yesterday said that it was the previous Rajapaksa regime which gave the licence to use rice as a raw material to manufacture liquor.
This government has not given any approval to produce spirits making use of rice as a raw material to any distilleries. There are 14 distilleries in Sri Lanka and they use palmyra toddy, coconut toddy, molasses, maize and fruits to produce spirits, the ministry in a statement said.
The ministry statement said, in 2006, the previous government had given the approval to one liquor manufacturing company to produce spirits using rice as a raw material. But, recently, in addition to rice, the particular company was granted permission to use maize as a raw material.
By the budget 2018, it was proposed to levy excise duty on raw materials used for the production of Ethanol.
Accordingly, by the gazette Extraordinary issued under the Excise Ordinance on the 09th of November 2017, a levy of Rs.5 to Rs.10 per litre has been imposed on the raw materials used for the production of spirits.
There is no truth in the allegation made by Bandula Gunawardena MP to the effect that this government has given approval to use rice as a raw material for the production of alcohol. In fact the approval to use rice for the production of alcohol was given by the previous government in 2006, the statement added.

Fit for Caesars army: Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya
Head Girl of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Imara Gamage, has two great strengths: her personal brilliance and her followers. Because of her winning personality, there are so many drawn to her. Perfect Prefects features Imara Gamage, who says that people are her power.
Her guild is her bulwark and her position of strength. The main aim or the vision of the Prefects Guild is to uplift the honour of mother Sirimavo and to preserve its glory for generations to come. Her prefects guild consists of five top board members (excluding her), 54 senior prefects, 43 junior prefects and in addition another 60 stewards who have joined the guild for a training period of two months. So as you can see it is very much like Caesars army!
In addition to the daily duties we perform at school we are the pioneers in organizing the main events of the school such as the annual pirith ceremony, sports meet, prize giving, colours awarding ceremony, New Year celebrations, Teachers Day celebrations and childrens day celebrations. As our annual project, we organised a blood donation campaign in aid of the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital which was an immense success with the participation of donors exceeding 160. Currently, we are preparing for the 45th anniversary celebration of our school which is scheduled to be held next year with an array of special events in line, said Gamage.
Different perspectives
Gamage possesses a calm and friendly nature in addition to being a good listener. She believes in leading by example and she has the ability to adapt to any situation. She feels that this combination of qualities has allowed her to lead her fellow Sirimavians down the correct path.
Whenever I take a decision I follow three important steps: listen, observe and then come to a conclusion. I work with 163 individuals who are differently skilled and are holders of different perspectives. Yet as a leader I should be able to motivate them and drive them towards a common goal. At times it can be challenging, but through discussion, we always implement the best decision. Every decision I take, I discuss with my fellow top board members and our teachers in charge. I believe that collective decision making is a must as it allows everyone to be a part of the decision making and gives them more motivation and passion, said Gamage.
Gamage is enterprising and resourceful and does not hesitate to make quick and firm decisions. Again her asset is the guild. Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya is a Buddhist girls school with a unique culture emphasizing on the Sri Lankan traditions and customs and Buddhist upbringing. The school shapes up young individuals who have a balanced personality and a sound education. They will become responsible citizens of the country one day.
People are my power, and they are my strategy. No battle can be won alone; it depends on the strength of your troops. At the face of whatever challenge or difficulty my guild is my strength and together we face the obstacles, pointed out Gamage.
About 12 years ago as a young and playful girl, she entered through the gates of her alma mater. At that time she may not have realized what the future had in store for her. Those who came into contact with her may have seen the untapped potential in the girl. But none could have guessed how she would excel in life.
International community
At Sirimavo I have learnt many things both in academics and for life. Our school is like a big family, each one of us sharing a bond with one another which is unexplainable by words and our teachers are our pillars of strength. I dont think I would have become the person I am today if I had not received the guidance that my teachers have given to me at school, helping me polish my strengths while helping me work around my weaknesses, explained Gamage.
Gamages idol is Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the iron lady of Sri Lanka. One of Sri Lankas beloved leaders. A woman respected by the international community.
If I get to meet any leader of choice without a second thought it will be Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the worlds first female prime minister, after whom our school was named and also one of my personal role models. She has always been a remarkable person to me. She was a woman of great courage and strength, at a time when women politicians were rare. She did not hesitate to run for election, to continue her husbands political legacy and to serve the people of the country. I admire her resilient nature, she fought her way through many obstacles, said Gamage.
The world is at Gamages feet. But she says that before taking on the world by storm she prefers to make a difference in her homeland.
I believe that smaller steps lead to bigger changes. I believe that development doesnt mean only the improvements in the infrastructure of the country. But it should be something which goes hand in hand with the development in the lives of the people and a system where everyone is treated with equality regardless of wealth and status. I mean what would be the point of development if we only have high rise buildings in the country but there are unemployment issues, economic crisis and starving families  questions Gamage.
Business venture
Gamage is currently studying in the Commerce stream and will face her A/Ls next year. Her interest is in fashion.
So in the future, I hope I will be able to enter into Central Saint Martins University in England, a renowned university for fashion education and one day turn my hobby into a successful business venture and maybe become a leader in the fashion industry, said Gamage.
Gamage is indignant when it comes to bias. She believes that we are all equal and we should be treated equally.
I really dont like the way how people are being racially profiled in some countries of the world. You and I may be different in colour, yet we all are human, made of flesh and blood, so its a great injustice to serve someone in a different way just because of the way they look! Even if the whole world seems to be trying to keep all this undercover pretending as if there is no such issue, the mass shootings that happen in the USA can be stated as some examples. I hope that in the future that I will get an opportunity to make people change their mindset on issues like this, argues Gamage.
A Badminton player she also takes an interest when it comes to aesthetic activities. She is a dramatist at school, a member of the Western band and senior western choir. These activities have helped her develop the soft skills essential for a leader.
A leader should be a risk taker. He/she should not hesitate at the sight of an opportunity. Because every opportunity is a chance to learn and a lesson in life. So my message to my brothers and sisters is simply - No matter how it will end just go for it and take the chance. Sometimes it might be what will change your life forever or what will teach you the biggest lesson in life, stated Gamage.
Gamages parents are her confidants. When she is under a lot of pressure she talks to them. This calms her down and helps her keep focus. They give her the best advice she can get from anyone. She is then able to cope with the problem. Her mother has been her shadow all through her life. Her mother kept her strong at the most challenging and difficult times.
If I can travel back in time I wish I could go back to the time when Queen Victoria reigned in Great Britain. The social and cultural changes which took place in England in the Victorian era are really interesting to study about and especially the Victorian sense of style is something that I really love to study and research on. I would also like to visit Egypt. To see with my own eyes the mysterious land of the pharaohs, added Gamage
I would like to extend my gratitude towards our principal R A M R Herath whose leadership has been a great example to all of us. I would also like to thank the Assistant Principal in charge of the Prefects Guild, Surangani Siriwardane, and all the teachers in charge of the Prefects guild and all other teachers who have given me guidance throughout my journey.
I would like to thank all my sister Sirimavians and especially my fellow top board members and all the members of the prefects guild whose selfless effort, commitment and unity have helped us to safeguard the honour of mother Sirimavo and to preserve its glory for generations to come, said Gamage.

Fusion dance redefined
In any society basically, dance is divided into three varieties. One is the classical form, other is folk dance and the other is ritual dance. All classical dances, folk dances and ritual dances reflect the culture, tradition, religion and regional social practices and social background of the selective society.
Classical dance, folk dance and ritual dance have certain norms and all provide equal opportunities for creativity, within the limited framework. All classical dances, folk dances and ritual dances have certain defined clarified items. Each item of the classical dance, folk dance and ritual dance has its own defined order and use certain ornaments and well-designed costumes and selective make-up. Similarly, every classical, folk and ritual dance is based on certain selective music.
Some are accompanied by vocal and instrumental music together and some are only accompanied by vocal music and some are only accompanied by instrumental music. Hence all the classical, folk and ritual dances have a historical background and development.
Emerging trends
Some of the folk and ritual dances are practised only for certain festivals and occasions. During the mid and last quarter of 20th century, a new trend has strongly emerged and penetrated in the dance world.
Some of the dance choreographers and dance teachers have introduced a new type of dance form to attract a maximum number of students and audience. Sometimes one particular dance form is mixed-up with numerous other classical dances, together without any well-established codes or basic norms. This new creativity dance form is called fusion dance.
Sometimes fusion dance is a mixture of classical and folk dances. For these dances, no proper music is adopted. Mostly fusion music or light music is adopted with a variety of instrumental music for fusion dances. The music is chosen in accordance with the rhythmic vibrancy of the dance and the dance movements.
The present trend of fusion dance choreographers is to attract the public and exploit the students interest. Choreographers introduce numerous self-styled methods with the combination and with the influence of classical and folk dances.
All these creativity dance forms come under the name of modern fusion dances. These dances are promoted by some fusion dance choreographers to gain popularity among the people and attract the youngsters for entertainment purposes. Fusion dance is only used for entertainment purposes.
Fusion dances
Numerous modern technologies are also introduced and used in these dance forms. Especially a variety of lighting systems is used for the fusion dances. Spotlights, follow up lights, footlights, focus lights and rotating colour lights are some of the lighting systems used in the modern stages of the fusion dance programmes.
Most of the fusion dancers use real classical dance ornaments with self-designed colourful costumes. These fusion dances dont have proper well defined or well-established structural format or principles. Creativity, involvement, interest and individual talents of the choreographers play important role in the fusion dances. Basically, the aim of the choreographers of the fusion dances is to attract the maximum amount of viewers for their shows.

Indias dream plan to cut freight time to 14 hours from 14 days
A $7.1 billion rail corridor in Rajasthan thats set to cut freight times between Indias capital New Delhi and the business hub of Mumbai to 14 hours from 14 days is finally showing signs of progress.
About 800 kilometers away in Gujarat, a 920-square-kilometer industrial area is taking shape near the village of Dholera, with hundreds of workers fusing concrete sections of a sewerage system on a recent visit. Summing up the massive projects ambition, a sign for a yet-to-be-built housing development reads: Dream City.
Plagued by delays, red tape and disputes over land acquisition, for years it seemed the $100 billion Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor would remain just that -- a dream. First proposed more than a decade ago, the sprawling assortment of smart cities and industrial parks on both sides of the freight railway could cut logistics charges that amount to roughly 14 percent of total costs by bypassing the countrys infamously chaotic major cities.

## Title: Indias bugbear   Delhi  air pollution

Indias bugbear   Delhi  air pollution
An incident unprecedented in the annals of international cricket took place on Sunday at the famous Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, the second oldest international cricket stadium still functional in India after Eden Gardens, Kolkata where players were forced to wear masks to protect themselves from air pollution during the second day of the third and final cricket Test between Sri Lanka and India.
It certainly was not a good advertisement for the richest cricket board in the world  the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for it gave the anti-Indian nations an opportunity to cash in on the situation and say how unsafe Delhi is as a venue to host international matches.
On television channels in India it has become a national debatable issue with one channel headlining it Sri Lanka masks trigger debate and saying that the acceptable air quality is 20 whereas it is currently on an average of over 520.
Sanjay Manjrekar, the former Indian Test cricketer and currently an international television commentator said that the incident of players playing in the middle with masks should have never taken place.
The umpires should have taken the players off the field if the conditions were not conducive for play and brought them back once the air was clear, said Manjrekar.
However for that to happen there were no clear guidelines laid down by the ICC for such an instance that happened for the first time at an international cricket match.
Thus it was quite understandable the ICC match referee David Boon and the two onfield umpires Nigel Llong and Joe Wilson being confused and unable to take a decision on how to react to the situation at hand. The umpires didnt want to come off and it eventually led to a total of about 22 minutes of play being lost due to three separate stoppages.
Asanka Gurusinha, the Sri Lanka cricket manager said that going forward it was an interesting topic for the ICC to look into.
I know that David Boon was talking to the ICC and they dont have any numbers to work on. Most probably it might happen at the next ICC meeting where it will come down to medical reports and all of that, said Gurusinha.
I think it is the first time the ICC has faced this kind of situation. None of them knew about it, even the two umpires were struggling in the middle at that time.
Manjrekar even said that there were thoughts expressed by the BCCI towards shifting the venue from Delhi to another venue as during this time of the year there was bound to be pollution in the air but he failed to understand why the change was not made in consultation with Sri Lanka Cricket. India are not short of international venues they have plenty at hand around 20 or so and the switch could have been made easily.
Had BCCI made the change it could have saved them and everyone from the embarassment of players fielding in masks and advertising to the whole world how unsafe Delhi was to play international cricket, Manjrekar said.
As it is with all Asian countries politics also plays a huge part in the hosting of international matches and Delhi, being the strong hold of the present acting president of the BCCI CK Khanna surely they would have wanted to host a Test match especially with five international teams touring India in the ongoing home season New Zealand, England, Bangladesh, Australia and Sri Lanka.
Khanna has been acting president of BCCI since January this year after president Anurag Thakur was sacked by the Indian Supreme Court for not complying with its orders.
The Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium has a rich history of hosting international matches since 1948 and should continue to host them but the timing has to be adjusted so that there wont be a repetition to what happened on Sunday.
The winter period is between December and January where temperatures can drop from 25 degrees to 5 degrees and the quality of the air can be very poor due to the absence of any strong wind.
Sri Lanka had previously on one occasion played a Test match at this venue almost during the same period (December 10-14) 12 years ago but there were no reported incidents of any air pollution affecting the players.
According to the locals in Delhi the air pollution has become intense only in the past two years and forced people to wear masks to prevent them from constantly breathing the affected air.
The ICC match referee David Boon is certain to put it down in his match report about what took place and the ICC will have to bring it up at some point and draw a guideline to such occurrences and what action should be taken in the event of it happening again, like they did after the Phil Hughes tragedy where guidelines were brought in and it became applicable when Sadeera Samarawickrama took a knock on the forehead of his helmet fielding at short leg off a sweep shot essayed by Murali Vijay and suffered from mild concussion.
For years we are told there has been a public outcry for some action to be taken against air pollution which has been severe at times but unfortunately it has fallen on deaf ears. Although measures have been taken by the authorities to counter it the problem still persists with no tangible end to it in sight.

Journalists, politicians should help strengthen democracy - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said journalists and politicians together should protect and strengthen the advancement of democracy.
The Minister made these remarks delivering a public speech under the theme of Politics in Media at the official launch of the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association website held at Sri Lanka Press Institute yesterday.
Minister Samaraweera emphasised that even if one fails, either politics or Journalism, the progress of democracy would be weakened and added that in a democratic country, there is always minor conflicts between the government and the media.
In the meantime, Minister Samaraweera noted that politicians and journalists weaken democracy further by blaming each other.
The Minister said a new survey conducted in the United States revealed that nurses are the most trusted of all professions, while politicians and journalists are the least.
Both Journalists and politicians are in the same boat. If a similar survey was conducted in Sri Lanka, I believe that the results would have been much the same. Unfortunately,the reputation of politicians has fallen to the bottom, the Minister said.
He added that it is the responsibility of journalists to figure out why journalism is considered as one of the least trusted professions, similar to politics.
Minister Samaraweera noted that sometimes he fears about the truth behind an incident gets easily hidden with the excess use of social media, while the traditional media is trying to compete with the rest instead of protecting the ethics of journalism.
Minister Samaraweera further said that sometimes politicians gain the upper hand over the media and added that the country had already experienced a lot under the former government.
The present government was able to balance it in two and half years. Today,journalists have the freedom to express their views and opinions, he said.
The Minister noted that as in many other countries the troll army is functioning in Sri Lanka as well and added that it could even lead to the collapse the government. He explained that an investigation is being conducted in the United States as to whether Russia had an influence in the last US Presidential election.
The troll army consists of social media users and they spread false news and at the end of the day, it will make the people believe that the news was true.
There is another very dangerous method called Bots and it is very popular in Russia, Libya and other former Soviet Republics nations having its IP address. I would responsibly say that it is highly used by MP Namal Rajapaksa, Minister Samaraweera alleged.
Minister Samaraweera said MP Rajapaksas Bots usage amount is 100 percent only during the year 2017.
He said that many plans are laid out to mislead the public through new technology.

Lanka can unlock US$18 bn as climate-smart investments -IFC
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has estimated that Sri Lanka can envisage a total climate-smart investment opportunity of $18 billion during 2018 to 2030.
In a survey conducted under the theme Climate Investment Opportunities in South Asia it states that Sri Lanka has an US$ 2.5 billion investment opportunity for Renewable energy power generation.
The IFC says that US$ 8.4 billion opportunity has opened up for Green Buildings. This is to meet the governments policy objective of conservation and effective use of energy, as well as the countrys housing and commercial construction needs.
The country has an internal labeling system for buildings, in addition to 78 buildings registered or certified through international channels. As a result, both commercial and residential green penetration is forecast to be higher than other countries in the region.
Another mega sector for investment is in the transport infrastructure sector where the estimate is US$ 326 million to catalyze a modal shift towards mass public transport.
Another area where an US$ 2.7 billion opportunity awaits is climate-smart unban water and wastewater management.
ITF predicts that US$ 3.5 billion opportunity waits for municipal solid waste management.
The collapse of a waste dump in Colombo in 2017 has led to a surge in efforts to address solid waste management issues in Sri Lanka.
Smart agriculture investments for Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2030 are expected to reach US$ 964 million. These are for investments in improving productivity, innovative technology and resilient seed varieties as per government priorities.IFC says that opportunities for private investment will widen as Sri Lanka pursues deeper global economic integration through export-oriented production.
Meanwhile IFC says that the South Asian region by fully meeting the national targets they set under the Paris Agreement, can unlock $3.4 trillion of climate-smart investment opportunities.
South Asia has among the highest economic growth rates in the world and represents a little over 7 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Six countries in the region Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka have enormous untapped opportunities in climate-smart investing in sectors including renewable energy, transport, green buildings, urban wastewater, climate-smart agriculture, and municipal solid waste management. Two sectors stand out for future growth: due to rapid urbanization, green buildings represent an investment potential totaling more than US$1.5 trillion across South Asia between 2018 and 2030; and green transport infrastructure and electric vehicles create an opportunity of over US $950 billion till 2030.

Lanka ODI players leave for India
Sri Lanka on Tuesday left out Test skipper Dinesh Chandimal from the one-day squad to face India on the day he completed a crucial century to help his side save face in the third Test.
All-rounder Asela Gunaratne and opening batsman Danushka Gunathilaka return to the side that has lost 21 one-day games this year and won just four.
Chandimal, who was last man out for 164 in Sri Lankas first innings in New Delhi on Tuesday, is the major victim of the latest changes made to rejuvenate national fortunes.
Sri Lanka Cricket last week named Thisara Perera as one-day captain in place of Upul Tharanga.
Under Tharanga, Sri Lanka suffered three consecutive ODI whitewashes this year against South Africa, India and Pakistan. Gunaratne returns to the side for the first time since being injured in July against India in Galle.
He will strengthen the batting order alongside former skipper Angelo Mathews who returns having missed the last ODI series against Pakistan through injury.
Sri Lanka and India play one day games between December 10 and 17 in Dharmasala, Mohali and Visakhapatnam. Six players of the team are already in India as part of the Test squad and the remaining nine players were expected to leave last night.
They had been stopped from leaving at the airport on Monday night as their names had not been approved by the Minister of Sport, which is a requirement under the current Sports Law for any national team representing the country.
Sri Lanka ODI squad:
Thisara Perera (capt), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Niroshan Dickwella, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Asela Gunaratne, Chathuranga de Silva, Sachith Pathirana, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Dushmantha Chameera, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep.

Lanka struggle to save smog-filled Delhi Test
New Delhi Tuesday  Sri Lanka left with a daunting task of chasing 410 runs for victory to level the three-match Test series against India finished the fourth day struggling to save the third and final Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium on Tuesday.
After Sri Lanka was dismissed for 373 in their first innings in the morning, India with a first innings lead of 164 batted till the final session and declared their second innings at 246-5 with Shikhar Dhawan (67), Virat Kohli (50) and Rohit Sharma (50 n.o.) all scoring half-centuries.
The Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium filled with smog at the start of the fourth days play in the third and final cricket Test between Sri Lanka and India on Tuesday. AFP
Sri Lanka left with 29 overs to survive the day slumped to 36 for three off 16 before bad light ended play with Dhananjaya de Silva (13 n.o.) and Angelo Mathews (0 not out) at the wickets.
It was unfortunate that the umpires waited until Sri Lanka lost two quick wickets in an over from Ravindra Jadeja to come off for play as there was hardly any difference before the wickets fell and after. Sri Lanka trails by 379 runs with seven wickets in hand going into the fifth and final day today and must guard against how they perform in the second innings.
In recent times Sri Lanka has a history of second innings collapses after performing well in the first innings. Against Pakistan they were dismissed for 138 and 96 and in the ongoing series against India for 75/7 and 166.
The air quality in Delhi had not improved from what it was on Sunday only worsened and the Lankan players came to field in the Indian second innings with almost all of them wearing masks to protect them from the heavy smog that enveloped the stadium throughout the day.
Suranga Lakmal once again became a casualty when after bowling three overs and achieving the initial breakthrough for his country by getting the wicket of first innings centurion Murali Vijay for nine, he started to vomit on the field and was forced to leave play. He returned after a few minutes to resume bowling.
Sri Lanka however didnt suffer from any further casualties for the rest of the Indian innings but however Mohammad Shami the Indian fast bowler after capturing the wicket of Sadeera Samarawickrama with a snorter of a delivery that knicked his glove started to put out like Lakmal and was also forced to leave the field. So it was not only the Sri Lankans who were affected by the air pollution but even the Indians in their own environment.
However for some strange reason none of the Indian players wore masks on the field  maybe because they didnt want to embarass their own Cricket Board and country by doing so and thereby making the venue an unsafe target for future international matches. Kohli immediately brought his spinners on to play.
Chandimal went onto play a captains knock scoring a career best 164 to surpass his match-winning 162 not out also made against India at Galle in 2015. It was the fourth time in his career he had gone past the 150-run mark.
Chandimal finally fell attempting to farm the bowling to protect last man Sandakan who hung around for 40 minutes without scoring but helped his captain raise the score by 30 runs. Chandimal played a sublime innings batting eight minutes under eight hours and gave another exhibition of pure Test match batting soaking the pressure and then wearing down the opposition in a flawless display that kept the marauding Indian bowlers at bay. He hit 21 fours and a six in his 361-ball innings. The wickets for India were all shared with all four bowlers picking up more than two each.

Love of learning
It is a sharp analysis of a childs mind. It triggers a deep discussion about the role of a teacher. It is a perfect example of transforming society. It is one video everyone should watch.
A story spanning many years, from childhood to marriage, has been aesthetically portrayed within 5 minutes. By the end of the heart-touching 300 seconds, you are in tears. Not a single word is uttered by the characters, but the emotions are intense. If you still do not know what this is about, it is the video Guru Panduru which has been trending highly on YouTube and Social Media lately.
The story is about a mischievous little girl, who creates trouble all the time. Initially her teacher sees her as an annoyance, but later learns of her loss; the girl has lost her parents in a tragic accident. This makes the teacher see her in a different light. She begins to show love and care for her, resulting in a turnaround of the little girls behaviour. She reciprocates to this love to the point that she gifts her mothers watch  the only physical memory of her mother  to the teacher on her birthday. She sees her as a mother figure. All this is shown in flashback on the day of the students wedding. When the brides mother is called upon to the poruwa, she invites her teacher to take the place, the only mother she knows.
Based on a true story, this amazing video was a brainchild of Rainco which was produced in association with Guru Prathibha Prabha, a national event which pays tribute to teachers from across the island, who has gone out of the way to uplift their students. As one of the main sponsors, Rainco has been able to capture the true meaning of the role of a teacher in this video.
The challenge of bringing such a sensitive story to life was taken up by young director Chamath Paranavitana. It was Deepika Nuwan Samaraweera from the Rainco Team who told me the true story, on which the video is based. We faced many challenges; narrowing down the story to 5 minutes, doing justice to the story and the time we had to complete the video were some of them, commented Chamath.
The creativity of the video is enhanced by the talented performance of the actresses, who are not popular faces. We wanted to make this video unique by bringing in new faces. We found Meleesha Jayaratne, who plays the student, from Nalaka Swarnathilekes Academy. The role of the teacher is played by Sewwandi Ranasinghe, a lawyer by profession, who has experience in stage drama. The story is developed around the acting of these two persons. Another challenge was to find a bride whose features matched the girl. All the artists were so immersed in their characters and the story that when we were shooting the wedding scene, the tears came naturally. It was successful from the very first take, reminisced Chamath.
The videography was handled by Nadishka Ranasinghe, while Dhammika Hewaduwatte was the Art Director, with Chaminda Lakmal as his Assistant.
Viraj Harshana has successfully given life to a story which is without dialogue, through his exceptional music talent. I believe that the director creates the spirit of a piece of art, and the music director gives life to it. So I simply asked Viraj to give life to my visual and he did it perfectly, added Chamath.
I did not allow personal connections to influence this creation. I put my faith on talent, even if it was raw. I have to specially mention the support we got from the Rainco Team. Whilst they owned the concept and provided us with all necessities, they allowed me my artistic freedom. We would not have such a successful creation if it was not for that, Chamath stated further.
Speaking about the reaction he has received for the video, he continued, I studied global teaching methodologies prior to making the video, which gave me a lot of insight. Many teachers who watched it told me that the method of disciplining the child, shown in the video is successful. Those who viewed it as a work of art have commented that we have touched the chords of Indian cinema.
A sensitive moment has been nurtured in a rich creative environment and resulted in a true tribute to teachers, and presented to the world by Rainco.

Of media bosses and journalists
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe minced no words when he gave a piece of his mind on what he thought about sections of the private media, who, according to the Premier, were busy working to bring the Rajapaksas back to power. Speaking at an UNESCO sponsored event calling for an end to impunity for attacks against journalists the Prime Minister said the task of upholding press freedom had squarely fallen on the lot of his administration and a few civil society groups, while private media bosses remained unconcerned. This he said while noting the absence of editors and owners of private media establishments at the event. Instead of raising issue over the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga, the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and attacks on the Uthayan newspapers the private media bosses were today keeping mum as if the whole matter of probing these attacks is the business of the present government, he observed. The Premier also said that certain media houses were planning to bring the Rajapaksas back to power in order to continue with their shady businesses, which they carried out with the blessings of the former ruling family.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghes ire is justified to a great degree, given the lukewarm attitude shown by, both, journalists and media bosses to pursue investigations against their colleagues who had been victims of state power. Nay, journalists and bosses of certain newspapers and TV channels are busy today working to political agendas. It is obvious to any independent minded person that certain private media were hell-bent on getting the Rajapksas back in the saddle. News stories are slanted and/ or distorted to place the government in poor light. Mountains are being made out of molehills and lapses on the part of government are exaggerated. Certain private media lose no opportunity to turn the knife in, so to speak. This was amply evident during the recent petrol crisis where newsmen of certain private channels were seen shoving mikes to the mouths of irate motorists to obtain their naturally uncomplimentary views on the government.
There is one particular Television channel which takes delight in relentlessly attacking Premier Wickremesinghe in its news segments. Special programmes are being designed by this channel to carry out these vicious attacks employing hired experts who are known critics of the PM, with carefully bowled full tosses served to those interviewed. This was seen during the bond commission inquiry where the Premier was being unfairly targeted. It is common knowledge in media circles that this axe to grind with the Premier was occasion by his refusal to accede to a very lucrative business contract, eyed by the wealthy owners of this private TV channel.
There is yet another private channel which makes no bones about where its sympathies lay. The presenter of a morning programme where the stories of the daily newspapers are conveyed to viewers gives his own spin to the news items and his own interpretation of events in a manner that is unfavourable to the government and its leaders. What is more, it is also given to stirring communal passions with reportage of incidents and events in the north in a manner that suggests undue tolerance of the Tamil community by the government.
True, TV channels are concerned about their ratings and anti-government news gain much currency with the public rather than sunshine stories. Hence there is fierce competition among these channels to outdo each other and a certain degree of sensationalism cannot be avoided. However, concentrated attacks on government leaders have today become the norm with certain channels.
Like the PM said, it is strange that no private media bosses have shown an interest in raking up the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunga who was killed in broad daylight in an area with a heavy security presence. Not just Wickrematunga, there was the abduction, and, torture of The Nation News Editor Keith Noyahr and Rivira Editor Upali Tennakoon, not to mention the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda, during the Rajapaksa era. The no show by the media bosses at the UNESCO event that highlighted attacks on journalists may, or, may not be due to their reluctance to cause embarrassment to the true perpetrators of these atrocities. Or is it that they couldnt care less about the journalist tribe and only wish to foster their businesses, which the majority newspaper and TV channel owners are deeply into, and journalists and their lives are only of secondary importance
Be that as it may, journalists, themselves, should take a more pro-active role in demanding investigations into the murders and attacks on their fellow scribes rather than expect their entrepreneur bosses, whose interests lay elsewhere, to promote their cause. But regrettably today certain journalists themselves are reluctant to do so for fear of antagonizing their one time patrons, whose return to power is their sole aim. Evidence of this is shown in their open hostility towards the government and the kid glove treatment given to the former rulers.

Memo signed to amend  US-Lanka Open Skies agreement
US Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Atul Keshap and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage yesterday signed an agreement to amend the US-Sri Lanka Open Skies Agreement of 2002 to facilitate the movement of cargo goods more efficiently and profitably.
The amendment strengthens global express delivery cargo networks, enhances bilateral connectivity and competitiveness, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.
This amendment to our bilateral Open Skies Agreement further strengthens the robust and longstanding trade relationship between the United States and Sri Lanka, said Ambassador Keshap.
As Sri Lankas largest trading partner, the United States seeks economic growth that provides employment and opportunity for the citizens of both our nations.
The signing took place during the Tenth International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Air Services Negotiation Event (ICAN 2017) held in Colombo, Sri Lanka from December 4  8, 2017.
Within the ICAN 2017 framework, the United States is meeting with over a dozen countries and agreed in principle on amendments to two existing aviation agreements to expand rights for US carriers to include key seventh-freedom rights for all-cargo operations.
This years ICAN also provides a venue to discuss a wide range of civil aviation issues with bilateral partner governments to resolve business issues and to obtain new rights for US carriers. The US delegation includes representatives from the Departments of State and Transportation, the US embassy in Colombo said.

Mini meals
The images of these mouth-watering platters might seem good enough to eat but they are actually miniscule works of art made from clay.
Stephanie Kilgast, 26, started making miniature food when she was playing with her dolls as a youngster but has now rekindled her childhood hobby and turned it into art.
She scours recipe books for dinners and desserts and uses the ideas to create her own tiny versions - which can fetch up to 500 each.
The French artist explained: I re-discovered my passion in 2007 when I was searching for a new hobby and stumbled upon miniature food which I used to make for my Barbie dolls as a kid. I was soon addicted to it and I havent stopped making them since.
The designs including salmon steaks, sushi, pizza, chocolate brownies, ice cream and fruit platters are sculpted out of polymer clay and then baked in an oven... just like an actual meal.
Cooking the clay hardens the designs, that range in size from just 0.5 ins to 2 ins, which can then be sold to dolls house collectors or even as items of jewellery.
Stephanie, from Vannes in Brittany, is amused by playing around with scale of the pieces - as are her customers.
I like sculpting food, because of the various shapes, textures and colours, she said.
The miniatures are fun because you feel like a giant, it feels like you could put the world in your pocket. As a girl, I tend to like futile things like jewellery and its fun, wearing miniature food is even funnier. When people see the miniatures they they smile and turn into children and start playing.

Minister questions absence  of several media heads,editors at UNESCO seminar
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that several Heads of media organisations and their Editors had refrained from attending the UNESCO funded seminar calling for an end to the impunity for attacks against journalists though they had received invitations.
The Minister was delivering a speech under the theme of Politics in Media at the official launch of the Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association website held at Sri Lanka Press Institute yesterday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also questioned why they failed to attend the seminar. I inquired about the invitations and I was told that all media organisation Heads and their Editors were invited, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister questioned about the absence of the heads of all media organizations and added that it was not about politics but journalists.
The truth is that some heads are also trying to push the country back to the previous era, while some newspapers publish false reports,he said.
Minister Samaraweera further said the State media has shown an improvement and has a more balanced coverage when compared to the Private media and added that several people still claim that before looking into the private media, the State media needs to be improved.

Morison ventures  into Myanmar
Morison PLC, a subsidiary of Hemas Holdings PLC, announced its first steps into regional shores with the distribution of its baby diaper brand, Bunnies in Myanmar.
The distribution of the first shipment of Bunnies baby diapers is set to commence in Myanmar in early December 2017.
Following extensive market research and insight gathered over the past few months, Morison PLC entered into a partnership with reputed distributor, SIN PHYU KYUN CO. LTD to distribute its products to the widely diverse consumer base in Myanmar. Armed with this distribution network, Morison PLC is well equipped to expand its product presence across a populace of over 53 million in the country.
Commenting on the expansion, Managing Director, Morison PLC, Trihan Perera said, The expansion of our distribution operations to Myanmar with the first shipment of Bunnies baby diapers denotes a significant milestone in Morison PLCs journey of over seven decades. Since the inception, we have made steady progress in winning the hearts and minds of our consumers through high quality products, securing a position as a trusted provider of healthcare and personal care solutions in Sri Lanka. Venturing into foreign shores, therefore, is yet another step in the right direction in further expanding our presence and adding value to the lives of potential consumers. Our plans to proceed with exporting the Lacto Calamine range as well as Gripe Morison Mixture will take place simultaneously. We look forward to this phase of the journey with anticipation and reinforced vigour as we proceed with our plans to place Morison PLC on the global map.
Group Chief Executive Officer, Hemas Holdings PLC, Steven Enderby said, As Morison PLC embarks on its first steps into regional shores, we remain optimistic to see its progress in a new consumer segment in a different geography. While this is just the initial step towards establishing Morison PLCs presence in a regional market, the company remains poised to explore other potential markets to distribute its portfolio of products in the days to come.
Morison PLC commenced operations in Sri Lanka in 1939 as J.L. Morison Son & Jones (Ceylon) PLC, and was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1964. In May 2013, the Hemas Group acquired a controlling stake of the company. Today, it is a fully Sri Lankan owned company with over seven decades of experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing and renowned over-the-counter brands such as Morisons Gripe Mixture, Lacto Calamine, and Valmelix, amongst others. The manufacturing process maintains stringent quality standards and is in compliance with the recognised pharmacopeia specifications and good manufacturing practices, in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.

NARA to investigate sea snake phenomenon
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to perform laboratory tests on sea snakes caught in fishing nets in Batticaloa on Monday morning and submit a full report in this regard.
Considering the spreading rumours that this phenomenon is a warning sign of a tsunami, the Minister instructed the NARA scientists to investigate and clarify the reasons behind it.
The Minister said a large number of sea snakes had been caught in the wake of the tsunami in 2004. However, the sea snakes had been caught several times before and after the 2004 tsunami during the months of November and December. Therefore, this could be a result of a transformation of the life cycle of these snakes, he said. The NARA claims that the rise in temperature at sea would be the reason for this and further tests will be conducted by the NARA to find the reason for the rise in temperature, said the Minister.

Nearly 2,000 acres of paddy fields inundated
Nearly 2,000 acres of paddy fields out of 30,000 acres under the Akkaraipattu irrigation region including the Akkaraipattu, Weerayadi, and Illukkuchenai irrigation divisions, have been inundated due to heavy rains experienced in the Ampara district, Akkaraipattu Irrigation Engineer-In-charge T. Mayooran said.
To drain off the excessive water due to heavy rains and floods in the Addalaichenai, Akkaraipattu, and Alayadivembu divisions, Mayooran has prompted action near the Thillai Aru near the Akkaraipattu, Naripiddy, and Konawatta bridges.
The Thillai Aru in the bounty channel separates the Akkaraipattu and Alayadivembu village and the Addalaichenai village. The channel carries the entire excessive water from paddy fields to the sea at Sinna Muhathuwaram. The water hyacinth and pistia aquatic plants have been removed by machinery at each block at these junctures. Akkaraipattu Municipal Commissioner A. L. M. Azmi, Akkaraipattu Divisional Secretary A.

New bank to provide loans to private sector- PM
A new bank to provide development funding to the private sector is to be established next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister explained that the new bank would have the Treasury, three state banks and main commercial banks as stakeholders.
The Central Bank Governor and Treasury are also talking to the ADB to have them also come in as a stakeholder, the Prime Minister added.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was addressing the 53rd Annual Report Awards Competition organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants at the BMICH.
The Bank is expected to have an initial investment of Rs.30-35 billion,the Prime Minister further said.
This would simplify the process of providing finance to the private sector for business development and remove the need for the government to run separate offices to provide loans.
For a long time, growth had to come from infrastructure projects which in turn was funded by foreign loans. But, we want growth not through government but the private investment- both local and foreign, said Wickremesinghe.
The governments role thus he said was to create the correct climate for investment. One such measure he explained was through the tax incentives provided through the new Inland Revenue Act, which according to the Premier was generous for a government strapped deep in debt.
Through the development of the North and South sections of the Colombo Port, it would become the largest port in the Indian Ocean and together with Trincomalee and Hambantota, the PM expected them to contribute towards making Sri Lanka a logistics hub, the Premier said.
The government of Sri Lanka still faces the difficult task of finding what it owes and how much it has to pay, the Prime Minister said as he explained that through authorised and unauthorised private placements alone, the government owed Rs 7 Trillion to the national debt.
The final amount after 40 years will be about Rs 10-12 trillion, the Prime Minister added.
In the Ministry of Finance earlier they had a simple way of cooking books. There were no financial obligations made in respect for many of the projects, whatever money was there was given. In our first month, we found that the bill for roads alone was Rs 100 billion more than what was forecasted and given to us,he explained.
Looking at SriLankan Airlines, the government had not guaranteed any loans and not legally responsible, but the USD 400 million given to them by the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank has ensured that at some stage the government would have to step in.
We have to now ensure that our financial reporting is in order. The government will bring in a committee of public finance which can go through these. Next year we will bring in a law called the Parliamentary Budget Office Law, following UK and Australian practices, The Office will be independent of the Ministry of Finance and will report only to Parliament. Will make their own independent evaluations of the economy and Budget
Therefore,we want Parliament to be in control of Finance and to be independent of the Treasury, so that they can make their own evaluations, the Prime Minister said.

PARLIAMENT
fish exports will reach 44 percent By end year: Amaraweera
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said 116 lagoons are to be developed while the development of 10 lagoons had already commenced, adding that by the end of this year, fish exports would reach 44 percent.
There are two major issues before the Fisheries Ministry that needs to be resolved. One is the Indian fishermen issue, while the other was the EU ban. However, we were able to successfully resolve the EU issue and have the ban lifted, which has now led to a 44 percent rise in fish exports by the end of the year, he said, joining the Committee Stage debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018 on the financial heads of Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, in Parliament yesterday.
On the Indian fishermen issue, the minister said in the past that while encroaching Indian fishermen were taken into custody and their boats confiscated, due to appeals by the Indian Government the fishermen had to be released along with their boats. However, he said after the Fisheries Ministry took a firm stand on not releasing the fishing vessels, there has been a significant reduction in the number of Indian fishermen encroaching Sri Lankas territorial waters. In fact, there had been a reduction of around 50 percent. We have also introduced a new Act in Parliament and when it is enacted, we intend to further contain this issue. Our aim is to resolve this issue cordially with India and we have already held several rounds of talks, which looks promising. The Indian government too had accepted that the fishing method used by the Indian fishing trawlers was illegal and have agreed to divert these fishermen to other alternatives. In fact, already the Indian Government has removed around 200 of these trawlers and given them incentives to transform their trawlers into multi-day trawlers that could fish in open seas. Another group had been redirected to other agricultural activities. But, the most significant achievement was that the Indian Government agreed to halt the registration of these bottom trawlers in the future. The Indian Government had also allocated a large sum through their budget to construct fishing harbours to accommodate multi-day trawlers. We achieved all these by working together with the Indian government, Amaraweera added.
The minister pointed out that Indian fishermen who are arrested for encroaching on Sri Lankan territorial waters, would be subjected to a fine prior to being released, while their boats would be confiscated. He said through Budget 2018, the allocation for the fisheries ministry was the highest allocation that has been made in history.
The country has over 10,000 tanks, but only a few of these tanks had fishlings placed in them to improve the fresh water fishing industry, amounting to only 20% of the requirement. However, now the government has increased it to 40 percent of the requirement and the minister assured that by the end of 2019, it would be increased to 80 percent of the requirement, adding that several fish and prawn hatcheries had been set up in order to improve fish resources.
Minister Amaraweera said all measures would be taken to improve the image of the fisher folk and bring dignity to their profession. He added that incentives would be given to promote larger fishing vessels over 55 feet and increase the fishing fleet, including the establishment of proper storage facilities to ensure quality standards.
IGP erred when he said police failed to control Gintota issue:Sagala
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake in Parliament yesterday, appreciated the services rendered by the Police in controlling the situation in Gingtota without allowing it to spread across the country as a racial issue.
He made this observation refuting a statement made by the Inspector General of Police that said the Police failed at the Gintota incident.
He made these observations in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2). MP Dissanayake made the special statement on November 24.
Minister Rathnayaka further said that the situation had been controlled, preventing it spreading across the country, due to the commendable services rendered by the Police. He added that the Police Special Task Force, the Navy and the Army too assisted the Police to bring the situation under control.
The minister further stated that a Police Post had been set up in the area to prevent any further tension. He added that several rounds of discussions were held to heal the broken relationship between the Sinhalese and the Muslims of the area with the participation of religious dignitaries, civil organizations, members of the community, Police and public. He also added that in accordance with a proposal made, a committee comprising intellectuals, all religious dignitaries of he seven Gramaseva Niladari Divisions that were involved in the Gintota incident would be set up soon. Still, members of the Police, STF, Navy and Army are deployed in those areas, Minister Rathnayake said. We are on alert concerning the situation in the area.
He said that statements had been taken from 134 persons in connection with the incident. He added that paying compensation for damages is not a responsibility of his Ministry and the matter would be directed to the relevant Minister.
Although some attempted to mislead the people by saying the STF was removed from the site before the situation was brought under control, it is wrong, Minister Rathnayake said. In reality, when the situation subsided, the strength of the STF was reduced. But later, more personnel were deployed as soon as the situation grew worse.
Following the Ministers statement, MP Anura Dissanayake said that some political parties attempted to ignite an issue of racism. At such a situation, the reduction of STF personnel amidst the situation was wrong, MP Dissanayake said. The IGP had said that the Police failed in that incident. Who is responsible for the failure. We need to know.
The Minister said that he did not agree with the IGPs statement if he had said so. He added that he appreciated the efforts of the Police.
Govt. submits supplementary estimate seeking approval of Rs. 11,007,475,445 for expenses by various depts.
The Government yesterday, submitted a supplementary estimate in Parliament seeking the approval for a total sum of Rs 11,007,475,445 for covering additional expenses incurred by various departments and ministries from January 01 to October 31, this year.
The estimate submitted by the Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, also seeks the approval for a sum of Rs 30,000,000 to construct a memorial in honour of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera as per a Cabinet decision dated 22.08.2017.
The estimate also seeks the approval of Parliament to cover expenses of Rs 66,040,000 for additional allocations provided for paying Agriculture Ministrys rents and local taxes.
Among other key expenses was a sum of Rs 1,672,900,000 paid by the Department of Treasury Operations to meet the shortfall of provision for loan flotation expenses.
Approval had also been sought for a sum of Rs 10,000,000 by the Southern Provincial Council to meet the expenditure made by Ridiyagama Detention Centre in rehabilitating beggars. An additional sum of Rs 9,000,000 to purchase an ambulance and two mini trucks for the centre, had also been sought to cover by the estimate. Supplementary allocations are provided strictly for the purposes specified in the approved budget estimates to relevant spending agencies having carried out a needed assessment, giving consideration to relevant financial regulations and approved procedures.
However, this supplementary provision does not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate by Parliament. The allocation for such purposes have been made under the project of budgetary support services and contingent liabilities of the Department of National Budget and it is under the limits of the approved annual budget.Therefore, either the borrowing limit or the maximum limit of total expenditure would not be increased due to granting of these supplementary provisions, a note attached to the estimate said.
Rs. 67.8 B forthcoming to CPC:Anoma
Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Anoma Gamage, said a sum of Rs. 67.8 billion was forthcoming to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC) from various state institutions, while the CEB alone owes the CPC Rs. 41 million.
She said Rs. Six billion was forthcoming to the CPC from private power producers, while Rs. 1.2 million has to be received from the Tri Forces and 12 million by Sri Lankan Airlines. The Road Development Authority (RDA) has to pay Rs. 248 million and Rs. 325 million was forthcoming to us from the Maga Neguma project. Western Province RDA has to pay another Rs. 417 million, while the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) has to pay Rs. 79 million. The other state institutions was in debt to the CPC to the tune of another Rs. 5,173 million.
She said so, joining the committee stage debate on Budget 2018 under the expenditure heads of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development. Minister Gamage said the CPC owes the Bank of Ceylon $ 1,140 million, $ 842 million to the Peoples Bank, $ 251 million to the Iranian Oil Company amounting to a total debt burden of $ 2.233 billion. The Deputy Minister said, In 2015 Rs. 15,049 million was paid as interest. Rs. 11,405 million was paid in 2016 and until this point of 2017, the CPC has paid Rs. 8,890 million for debt interests.
Fuel prices will not be increased
The prices of fossil fuel would not be increased despite requests by the IOC, since the government had no intentions of placing extra burdens on the people, said Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranathunga in Parliament yesterday.
The minister said that there was a tendency of increasing the fuel price in the world market. But the government had not decided not to increase the price, said Minister Ranathunga. The decision had been taken not because of impending elections, but due to the governments reluctance to place the burden on the people.
He made these observations, while joining the Committee Stage Debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018, under the financial heads of Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry. Minister Ranathunga also said that the sale of kerosene oil incurred a loss. He also said that petrol sheds had been instructed not to issue kerosene oil to buses, while the licenses of those petrol sheds that do so, would be cancelled. He added that stern action would be taken from the beginning of January.
Minister Ranathunga said that government institutions had defaulted a sum of Rs 67 billion to the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry. He also said that measures had to be taken to prevent substandard oil being imported, while a wrong message was conveyed to the public. If the oil was to be imported outside tender procedures, the public would be affected, Minister Ranathunga said. There was a wrong media campaign through the facebook as well. We have requested for an investigation into the incident.
No electricity hike within next two years: Ajith
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera revealed that there would be no increase in electricity bills at least for the next two years. Elaborating on the governments future plans for the power generation sector, he said the governments intention to establish a solar and wind power park in Poonerin and also distribute 10 million Led bulbs without an initial payment to encourage people to use environmentally friendly and low power consuming lighting.
He said this during the Committee Stage Debate of the Budget 2018 under the financial heads of Power and Renewable Energy, in Parliament yesterday.
The minister noted that the CEB pays duty and taxes to the tune of 30.28 for every litre of diesel that is imported and Rs. 4 billion as VAT, adding that the government intends to focus on low cost and efficient power sources in the future to meet the growing demand in the country. He added that despite the AAA Fitch rating, the CEB still had a long way to go. We have planned to establish a 500 MW power plant in Sampoor, but with everything in place and even with allocating newspaper pages to call for tenders, the government notified us to stop the project. We wanted to do this as a short term measure to resolve the countrys power crisis. This was a very important project for the country. However, that was the decision taken by the government. But, now a decision has been taken to amalgamate the countrys power sources and move ahead, Perera said.
The Deputy Minister added that within a year, the CEB would be able to achieve its goal of generating 100 MW of power through solar energy. He also noted with gratitude the contribution of the Sustainable Energy Authority in reaching the target.
Touching on the importance of wind power, Minister Ajith Perera said the corrupt permit system that was in practice would be discarded and no permits would be issued in the future. 
We have been able to call for tenders from the private sector and reduce the price of a unit of power by 40 percent. In the case of solar power, we have been able to reduce the price per unit by a huge 50 percent by calling for tenders. Therefore, despite allegations that the tender process is lengthy, we intend to conduct all projects in a competitive manner, by calling for tenders and selecting the most suitable deal and also conduct it in a transparent manner, the Minister noted.
He added that during the past regime, a 21-year-old was appointed as the Chairman of the Coal Company which turned into a family business. Coal tenders in the past was an issue of concern being riddled with corruption, but today the government has developed an efficient system where not a single tender had any issue under the good governance regime.
Minister Perera noted that the power demand in the country grows at an annual rate of around 5 percent and it was essential to manage power consumption efficiently, while improving the power generation sector.
A Presidential Task Force on Demand Side Management needs to be set up to manage the power sector. Further, in order to promote solar power, we have taken many measures through the Budget.
Under the rivi bala savi loan scheme, loans of up to Rs. 350,000 could be obtained at an annual interest rate of 6 percent. Further, for roof mounted solar panels, loans could be obtained to the tune of Rs. 7.5 million at an annual interest rate of 8 percent, he added.
With the aim of promoting renewable and environmentally friendly power sources, the government has also exempted or reduced that taxes on solar panels, inverters, bio mass and other sustainable energy sources.
JVP MP blasts former politicos, relatives for embezzling CPC funds
JVP- MP Nalinda Jayatissa accused former politicians, their relatives and henchmen for having collectively fraudulently embezzled Petroleum Corporation funds and engaged in fraudulent activities.
He noted that based on the Auditor Generals report, through the lubricant marketing promotion project in 2014 alone, a financial misappropriation of over Rs. 150 million had taken place.
Citing the Auditor Generals report, Jayatissa said Rs. 2.5 million had been approved illegally for the Fox Hill Super Cross organised to promote lubricants, pricing had been called from four fictitious companies and advertising had been given to their own companies, granting Rs. 5.4 million for advertising of Super Diesel and lubricants, Rs. 93 million had been spent on television advertising, Rs. 12 million on radio advertising and many other discrepancies had been reported. He said a person named Hudson Samarasinghe had been paid at the rate of Rs. 30,000 per month for a period of six months for promotional activities, but no promotion had taken place.
In addition, the daughter-in-law of a prominent minister had 50 percent ownership of the Filling station at the Jaffna clock tower, Kasturi Road filling station and the Palai, Killinochchi filling station, but this had also been gained amidst several irregularities, Jayatissa said.
Insurance scheme for farmers whose crops are damaged by wildlife:Gamini
An Insurance scheme would be introduced to farmers whose crops are damaged by wildlife activities, said the Sustainable Development and Wildlife and Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament in response to a query made by MP Ananda Aluthgamage during the round of questions for oral answers.
Minister Perera said that the proposal had already been presented before the Cabinet, while the approval would be granted within a short period of time.
The minister also said that those farmers whose cultivation is damaged by elephants, monkeys, wild boar, etc., would benefit from this scheme, reducing animal - human conflicts to a certain extent. He added that the people attempt to kill animals that damage their crops since they fall destitute following the damage.
He also added that when farmers are compensated for their damage, their rage would cool down.
He further said that although the previous government paid Rs 100,000 as compensation for victims who died of wildlife attacks, this government had increased the sum to Rs 500,000. He also added that compensation would be paid to victims of elephant, leopard or bear attacks and even snake bites.
Uplift for fishermen: Niroshan
Although the fishermen had to face bullets during the last regime, the good governance government enhanced the living standards of the fishermen in numerous ways, said National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera yesterday.
He said so in Parliament, joining the Committee Stage Debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018, under the financial heads of Power and the Renewable Energy Ministry, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.
He further said that this government could get the fish export ban to Europe lifted, while illegal fishing by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters were also reduced.
The fishermen had to face difficulties during the last regime due to the increase of fuel price, the State Minister said.We have provided facilities to go deep sea fishing and have plans to increase those facilities.
He also said that the Government had plans to convert the country into a hub that provides fish to the entire world.
Excise duty hike for non-potable spirits
The Finance Ministry issued a Gazette Extraordinary to charge an excise duty of Rs. 15 per bulk kilo of non-potable spirits imported into the country with effect from November 10.
The Gazette submitted for the approval of Parliament yesterday said that non-potable Methanol, Propanol, Isopropyl alcohol, Butanol, Isobutnaol, Secondary Butyl alcohol and tertiary butyl alcohol would be imposed the new tax of Rs 15.
According to the Gazette, the new provisions would not in any manner influence the orders that exist at present in relations to potable liquor, denatured spirits and molasses.
Any person shall not import, export, manufacture, keep in possession, store sell, transport, submit or exhibit for sale any non-potable spirit specified i.e.
Methanol, propanol, Isopropyl alcohol, Butanol, Isobutnaol, Secondary Butyl alcohol and tertiary butyl alcohol except under the authoritative power of a license issued in that behalf to a person by the Commissioner General of Excise, says the Gazette issued under the signature of Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Govt. should take an initiative to develop marine resources: Wedaarachchi
State Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Dilip Wedaarachchi, said the dignity of fishermen should be upheld and the government has taken an extensive initiative to improve marine resources, while developing the fisheries sector.
He said this in Parliament yesterday, joining the Committee Stage Debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018, under the financial heads of Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.
A sum of Rs. 200 million had been allocated for the development of the Ghandara and Welimankada Fisheries harbours and also for the purchase of new boats.
Through this blue green budget, measures have been proposed to provide fishermen with small refrigeration units. This is a welcome move as the fishermen could fetch a good price for their catch, he said.
The State Minister noted that during the previous bout of bad weather, several fishermen had lost their lives. He said the Fisheries Ministry had proposed to provide fishermen with life jackets and life boats for their fishing boats.
We need to promote community based management. We have also allocated a large sum for the propagation of aquaculture. We also intend to develop the fresh water fishing industry as well. In 2016, we allocated Rs. 808 million for the development of the fresh water fishing industry, while in the 2018 Budget, Rs. 2,435 million had been allocated.
Wedaarachchi said the fishing industry should move forward utilising modern technology, while digital technology could be made use of in marketing fish products.
Marine resources are so vast that it could have benefits for economies of many fields. He noted that these poor fishermen should be afforded every possible measure to improve their livelihood and income.
CEB employees salary anomalies to be taken up within next three weeks: Siyambalapitiya
The decision to rectify salary anomalies of the Ceylon Electricity Board(CEB) employees, would be taken within two to three weeks, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya in Parliament yesterday.
He said that several rounds of discussions by the Cabinet of Ministers in this connection had been completed with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made these observations joining the Committee Stage Debate of the Appropriation Bill 2018, under the financial heads of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.
The minister said that the government could reach the electricity provision a record making rate of 99.7 percent. When I was appointed the Minister, there were 275,000 houses without power, although they had power lines right in front of their houses, Minister Siyambalapitiya said. By now, we have been able to provide electricity to 250,000 houses. If there were 2 children in those houses studying with under a kerosene oil bottle lamp by now, those half a million children are learning under electricity.
The minister said that some opposition members spoke of CEB employees being under contract. He added that the CEB had recruited 6,700 employees under this government. He also added that under the Soorya Bala Sangrama project, the CEB had been able to generate 100 MW and the same achievement was celebrated recently. These projects should have been initiated a long time ago, but under President Maithripala Sirisenas guidance, the projects were expedited, Minister Siyambalapitiya said. Now we have a plan to set up solar power generating villages. In addition, there is a plan to permit the people to generate solar power as a source of income. They would be provided with low interest loans.
He also said that many questioned of the grant of tenders for wind power generation. He added that due to this reason, the price of a solar power unit had been reduced to Rs 12.29 from Rs 20.42. He also said that the price of a unit of solar power could be reduced to Rs 17.06 from Rs 23.10 due to tenders being granted. He added that due to the revolutionary decisions taken by the Ministry, the solar power unit importers have increased to 200. We have several power plants that have the capacity to use liquid gas, but runs on diesel, Minister Siyambalapitiya said. Due to this reason, we incur a loss of Rs. 30 billion. Cabinet approval would be given to convert the change soon.

Pledge to strengthen alternative care options for children
Several prominent government officials said at a conference in Colombo on Tuesday,that Sri Lanka needs to stop institutionalizing children at such high rates. There are over 14,000 children in institutions in Sri Lanka.
Speaking at an event at the Grand Oriental Hotel yesterday on deinstitutionalization and alternative care for children, former Supreme Court Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane pointed out that under the law, children defined as in need of care and protection could be orphans, victims of sexual violence, or alleged criminal offenders.
This results in many children with diverse needs and circumstances being held in the same institutions.
If we can do something, we should, and not allow the burden to fall on the child, she said.
Justice Tilakawardane said judges needed to be further educated in the nuances of the law, especially in cases of sexual violence.
All children should not be in the same system, said City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Sudarshini Fernandopulle. There needs to be some kind of revision, she said.
State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne said he believed increased economic stability would lead to a decrease in institutionalization, as taking more families out of poverty would make children less vulnerable.
We have to change the environment for women, he said, arguing that there should be more child care centers, and increased maternity leave, in both the private and public sectors.
The event was sponsored by the SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka, Childrens Emergency Relief International, the Parliamentary Caucus on Children, and the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Women and Gender. At its conclusion, the organizers handed policymakers a list of proposals to strengthen alternative care options in Sri Lanka.
Our effort is to have a systematic and formal system of deinstitutionalization for our children, SOS Board president Nandasiri Ponnameperuma said.

Political analysts yesterday said that the much hyped Badulla rally organised by the Podu Jana Peramuna was a flop as many party leaders in the Joint Opposition refrained from participating in the rally.
They said that absence of Joint Opposition firebrand Dinesh Gunawardene, National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila reveals that a major rift is looming within the Joint Oppositon.
The Podu Jana Peramuna had given wide publicity ahead of this rally but the absence of Joint Opposition party leaders may have been linked to infighting among party leaders, Political analysts say.

Racket of adulterating coconut oil uncovered
A long-standing racket involving the adulteration of coconut oil by mixing it with palm oil to be sold as genuine coconut oil to customers countrywide was uncovered by Dambulla Police STF flying squad when they raided a facility near the 7th km post at Enamalpotha Galewela in the wee hours of Monday.
The businessman involved was taken into custody along with a lorry and a double cab. Police said they also seized over 25,000 litres of adulterated coconut oil during the raid.
The businessman had been arrested the previous night for allegedly engaging a team of men on a treasure hunting expedition in the backyard of the premises. A suspect, arrested in this connection on integration, had spilled the beans about the coconut oil adulteration racket going on in the premises.
Inspector Lal Jayatilleke of the Dambulla STF camp said investigations revealed that palm oil bought at Rs. 260 per litre was being mixed with coconut oil to be sold as genuine coconut oil at Rs. 370 per litre to take advantage of the sharp increase in coconut oil price and make a quick buck.
Galewela PHI H.K. Dayaratne who thanked the STF officers for unraveling the racket, said even though they raided the facility several times in the past to uncover the racket, the businessman evaded detection by misguiding them.

Roots England roar  back in Ashes thriller
ADELAIDE: Skipper Joe Root led a spirited English fightback to frustrate Australia and raise hopes of a miracle victory in the gripping second Ashes Test in Adelaide on Tuesday.
After three days of Australian dominance Root took up the challenge of a record run chase with a fighting unbeaten half-century as the momentum began to shift towards England, roared on by their bellowing Barmy Army supporters.
In contrast counterpart Steve Smith, who attracted criticism for not enforcing the follow-on despite a 215-run first innings lead in the day/night match, burned two reviews in the space of three balls and put down a tough catch.
At the close of an absorbing fourth day, England were 176 for four with Root unconquered on 67 and nightwatchman Chris Woakes not out five -- 178 runs from victory with six wickets in hand heading into Wednesday's final day.
The highest winning fourth innings at the Adelaide Oval is 315 for six by Australia against England in 1902.
Root had a leg before wicket decision on 32 off Nathan Lyon overturned on review, with the 'Hawk-Eye' tracker plotting that the ball would have gone over the stumps.
Australia lost their second and last review when Dawid Malan survived a lbw shout on three off Josh Hazlewood, with the ball again tracked as going over the stumps, in the 43rd over.
Adding to Smith's anxiety, he also dropped Malan on eight in a sharp one-handed attempted catch at slip off Lyon.
After the chaos of the previous night's session when Australia lost four wickets, England had a much better time under the floodlights.
They only lost the wickets of James Vince and Malan and otherwise scored freely.
Vince was beaten by a pitched-up Mitchell Starc delivery, getting a big nick to Peter Handscomb at slip for 15. Malan put on 78 with Root before he was bowled by Pat Cummins for 29.

Rs. 32.1 m road project launched
A road construction project to develop a 3 km road in the Ratnapura district at a cost of Rs. 32.1 million was launched by Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne recently, a Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the project will be carried out in two phases. The National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry will fund the project.
Addressing the gathering after launching the project, Minister Seneviratne stated that a lot of efforts had been made in the past to construct the road but it did not become a reality due to various reasons. About 40 schoolchildren do not go to school because of the hardships they have to face without a proper road to travel to school.
The government has taken a decision that all children up to the age of 16 should go to school. Developing infrastructure facilities will help to implement this decision, he said.
Sri Lanka is first in Asia when it comes to eliminating child labour and it is education which helped the country reach this position, the Minister stated.

SC allows Trump travel ban to take effect
US: The US Supreme Court said Monday that the government could fully enforce a revised ban on travelers from six mainly Muslim countries pending appeal, backing President Donald Trump in the year-long battle over the controversial measure.
The court stayed October rulings from two lower courts that had blocked implementation of the ban on visitors from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen while legal challenges to it continued.
The third version of Trumps travel ban, unveiled in September, drew immediate challenges in federal appeals courts in Richmond, Virginia and San Francisco, California.
Plaintiffs argued that the measure targets Muslims in violation of the US Constitution and did not advance security goals as the government claimed.
The challengers convinced the lower courts to put implementation on hold while they and government lawyers fight out the legality of the policy.
But the Trump administration, which says the ban is crucial to protect US national security and deter terror attacks, secured strong support from the Supreme Court in a 7-2 vote to let the government move ahead while the appeals continue.
We are not surprised by todays Supreme Court decision permitting immediate enforcement of the Presidents proclamation limiting travel from countries presenting heightened risks of terrorism, the White House said.
The proclamation is lawful and essential to protecting our homeland.We look forward to presenting a fuller defense of the proclamation as the pending cases work their way through the courts, it added.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nations largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, criticized the ruling.
This decision ignores the very real human consequences to American citizens and their families abroad imposed by President Trumps Muslim Ban 3.0, said CAIR National Litigation Director Lena Masri.
The Supreme Court justices said they expect the lower appeals courts to expedite their decisions, leaving open the possibility that the policy could return to the Supreme Court in yet another legal challenge to the White House.
The San Francisco court will hear the case on Wednesday and the Richmond court on Friday.
The ban also covers people from North Korea and a selection of senior officials from Venezuela, but its main focus is travelers from the six mainly Muslim countries.
Trump has battled to implement a travel ban since just after he became president on January 20, after having repeatedly promised during last years election campaign to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.
Those promises have undermined the administrations argument in a series of court challenges that its policy is not Muslim-focused but rather based on security needs.
After Mondays court ruling the Department of Homeland Security said: the administrations common sense travel restrictions on countries that do not meet basic security standards and do not share critical information with us about terrorists and criminals are designed to defend the homeland and keep Americans safe.
The initial ban was to be for 90 days, ostensibly to give the US and the targeted countries time to implement tougher and more thorough vetting procedures for visitors.
After rolling court battles, the 90 day ban was finally allowed in June. Meanwhile, vetting for US-bound travelers from every country has intensified.
But when the six-country ban expired in September, the administration sought to replace it with an open-ended ban, with Chad added to the list while Sudan was removed, and North Korea and Venezuela appended as well.
Immigration and civil rights activists maintain it still essentially targets Muslims, which would violate the US Constitutions guarantees of religious rights. When Trump last week retweeted three video clips from an extremist British group that vilified Muslims, his critics said it supported the idea that his immigration policies were anti-Muslim.
President Trumps anti-Muslim prejudice is no secret -- he has repeatedly confirmed it, including just last week on Twitter, said Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. - AFP

## Title: Social entrepreneurship;  an unexplored path  to development

Social entrepreneurship;  an unexplored path  to development
Entrepreneurs that put land, labour and capital together with their exceptional expertise for running a business can be considered the backbone of any economy. An economy needs not only consumers but also producers to let its cycle go smoothly. Successful entrepreneurs that produce a lot in the economy contribute towards the economic growth. Then, what about economic development
Even though entrepreneurs can accelerate economic growth which means an increase in the capacity of aneconomyto produce goods and services, compared from one period of time to another, they cannot assure of economic development which means qualitative progress of the economy, improving life expectancy, living standards, creating employments and making sure social and political welfare of the people in the country. That is where social entrepreneurs presence is a must.
Social entrepreneurship
Even if this seems to be a new concept to Sri Lanka, it is widely practiced all over the world. Social entrepreneur is a person who establishes an enterprise with the aim of solving social problems or effecting social change. Furthermore, this can be done in profit-making motive as well. How social entrepreneur can be differentiated from a general entrepreneur is his focus not only on profits but also solving community-based problems.
No country can be developed by consumption only. It has to produce a lot. It is for that purpose that an economy needs entrepreneurs. However, there are things that a business entrepreneur may miss. That may be positive impact on the society, being different from the charity organizations. Todays businesses that are running a rat race to generate more profits than that of the last financial year, have introduced the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to give the society something in return. Nevertheless, they cannot be called social enterprises, as their objective is to earn profits rather than creating a social and environmental impact.
Self-sustainable
If it is a charity organization dedicated for creating a better world for others, it needs to be fully funded by someone. Social enterprises are self-sustainable, meaning that they dont become a burden on the society to be funded, because social enterprises are made to achieve both financial and social values. As mentioned above, charities are made to achieve social values. Business enterprises are made to achieve financial values. Social enterprises are a combination of both. Thats why; it can be called self-sufficient and self-sustainable. What we see at present is that government allocates a large amount of funds for promoting entrepreneurship as well as for ensuring social well-being separately. A pride of place has been given to the entrepreneurs in the budget 2018 as well, being considered backbone of the economy. It doesnt seem that the government has clearly identified social entrepreneurs. If they have, a huge amount of money that was divided into two major streams, could have been put into social entrepreneurship, in order that social entrepreneurs will actively contribute towards the economy, having a positive impact on the society and environment at once.
Areas to be covered
Even if it is true that social entrepreneurship can be connected with almost every aspect of the societyalways stricken with hundreds of issues, certain areas which are of course in dire need of social entrepreneurship, can be identified. When the garbage landslide in Meethotamulla was reported, it was discussed that public-private partnership was essential to seek sustainable solutions. At the same time, some youth presented themselves with innovative ideas to turn trash into cash. These are actually social entrepreneurs that need financial assistance to go ahead. A youth in Gampola had invented a recycling machine which separates iron, glass and plastic, so that they can be used for commercial purposes. Another man came up with an idea to make bricks out of garbage disposed from vehicles.
Central Environment Authority (CEA) banned the use of polythene, lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags, as a part of its mission to properly manage solid waste in the country.
This is in my opinion an area where social entrepreneurs can excel in revenue-generating, contributing to the national effort, if they wish to manufacture biologically degradable plastic and polythene or some eco-friendly products made with banana leaves.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has been a serious problem whereby the whole nation has suffered immensely. It has been revealed that water contained with harmful chemicals causes this deadly disease which has already claimed hundreds of lives in the country. Sri Lankan homes still use imported water purification filters. It is up to social entrepreneurs to make more sophisticated water purification filter and make it available at cheaper prices, so that it can reach every household in the country.
AthPavura
AthPavura is a TV reality show telecast on ITN, promoting social entrepreneurship among the public. Two major problems that any kind of entrepreneur has to face are how to find capital and knowledge. AthPavura has made itself a real platform for social entrepreneurs in dire need of capital for further expansion of their businesses. Finding the first capital is the hardest part for any start-ups. When you go to a bank, asking loans to start a business, be it a business enterprise or social enterprise, they will ask for collaterals. In fact, funding for start-ups is something highly risky. On the other hand, even if they receive a bank loan, they are bound to settle the loan, irrespective of the profit or loss that their businesses generate. Hence, many social entrepreneurs with great innovative ideas, give up their effort, mainly due to the lack of capital, having economic and social impact very negatively.
Tuskers of the program are currently comprised of Co-Founder Chandula Abeywickrema, veteran banker Rajendra Theagarajah, entrepreneur Dulith Herath and Upul Daranagama, reputed Chartered Accountant Sujeewa Rajapaksa and few other investors. They actually share the risk with these social entrepreneurs. Since they buy shares of these start-ups, they share the risk, being ready to incur even losses in the future. In other words, these social entrepreneurs have an opportunity to obtain capital as well as professional expertise so as to take their business to the unprecedented level.
Thamoda Karunaratne, a final year student studying entrepreneurship at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, recently participating at the program, presented a production; a lunch box made with leaves, actually an alternative to polythene. She assured that youth leaving from orphanages will be employed for this venture. She was financially supported by an athpavura investor, claiming for 10% ownership from the business.
Conclusion
Social entrepreneurship should be made popular among the public by financially assisting budding social entrepreneurs in the country. The government cannot and should not get involved in resolving every social issue. Thats why; social entrepreneurs have to be further empowered, in order that they are able to solve even serious social problems, giving economic benefits to the society. What is recommended is that government ought to empower social entrepreneurs, in place of allocating funds for subsidies.
Empowering social entrepreneurs means letting the community an opportunity to come up with solutions for themselves. Thereafter, economic development; a broader target going beyond economic growth, can be achieved. Consequently, it can be called a silent economic revolution

For almost 40 years, St. George's University ( SGU ) has been training more than 17,000 doctors who have practiced in over 50 countries and US states.
Since 1999, we have trained nearly 1,000 veterinarians in our now AVMA-accredited Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program who have practiced in 29 countries. Over 700 public health professionals from our CEPH-accredited Master of Public Health program have practiced all over the world. SGU is the 4th largest provider of Doctors for the entire US workforce.
SGU has also ranked as the #1 provider of doctors into first-year US residencies for the last seven years. Over 900 US residencies in 2017 and still counting, said South Asia - Regional Manager, St Georges University Salil Gupta.

Sudiptas fascinating English
My enjoyment in reading the fiction, The Crossroads, by an Indian writer Sudipta Mukherjee was primarily governed by her use of the English language in an effective manner, especially in her narration and descriptive power of characterization. This is her maiden novel covering three cities, two friends, one girl and it is one story.
But what is the plot about The blurb helps:
The Crossroads is a story of Aparajita Basu, a girl from a humble household of Kolkata, who tears away from her family to settle her roots in America, with her childhood friend, Aniruddha. To Aparajita, he is everything she ever wanted.
Love dwindles slowly. Fate turns in a blink.
Disheartened, she returns, not to her hometown but to a different city, where she finds herself a stranger, Haunted by her disturbed thoughts, obsessed by that one name, she finds no escape until she discovers herself, standing on a new crossroads.
An ordinary girl, who loses herself to love.
A lover, who turns out to be a betrayer.
A friendship born on a stormy night.
Wisdom bred out of miseries.
A homecoming that completes one full cycle.
But simple or a triangle of love story it may seem, the richness lies in its craftsmanship.
The book is divided into three sections: Kolkatta, Pullman and Chennai. It runs to 386 pages that include a Prologue and an Epilogue. Published by Frog Books in Mumbai in 2015 it is priced at USD 13
The book is dedicated to Brahma, Vishnu and Siva in the Sanskrit Sloka as follows:
Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat, Para Brahma, Tasmai Shri Guruvay Namah
The felicity of language is admirable for a maiden work. More than the meat in the novel the sheer poetry in prose entertains me ravishingly. The English is marvellous by any standards.
On pages 86-87 there is beautiful erotic writing too written from a feminine point of view.
Her novel is not merely a fiction but a study to be relished slowly and analyzed. It has many layers and nuances that have been analysed as if for a thesis.
Let me now show you only a few passages from Chapter 22 only among the many I loved to relish and a few observations on the vitality of the author's fascinating expressions:
01. Parallelograms of paddy fields with mud ridges, and soaked with ankle dip water offered me a rustic panorama. An opaque landscape stood before my gaze, in a breathless calm Clusters of banana trees, short and broad, and palm trees, tall and tender, and huts caked with mud and capped with hay stood at a distance Like a gush of wind pregnant with fragrance. (Prologue)
02. Page 200: Somewhere, I knew that even if I were at once ready to shift to the dorm, I would not have met my old Anir upon returning. The old Aniruddha, who had been my friend once, was lost somewhere, so much so that even if I had invested everything under the sun. I would not have got him back.
03. Page 202: It was hard for me to believe that the hands that once embraced me, cuddled me became so cold, so unknown as if I never held them before. The looks that comforted me became indifferent as I had never known them before. The lips that kissed me, that motivated me now did not even move Our love story, which was my pride, pleasure, and passion, suddenly got lost into oblivion
04. Page 205: Raunak always brought with him a gentle breeze of freshness and impactful cologne. He wore a hooded grey jacket, atop his denim, his hair shining with gel, his lips, and cheeks crimson. His jaws were mildly greenish.
05. Page 211: See, Aparajita , I have high regards for you, I know how much you love Aniruddha, I am aware of it, Now, I think you should not give anymore, to him, to your relationship, You are a nice girl, but things may not be as nice as you are, So please move out of this relationship Raunak finally gave me his verdict.
06. Page 212: After a long time, I enjoyed a friends touch on my body, skin to skin that went straight into my being. Something inside me stirred up, like a fine flick of flame caressed by a calm breeze.
07. Page 213: Aniruddha and Leena together; their bosoms tightly held, Lenas hand garlanded Aniruddhas shoulder, and Aniruddhas hand girdled Leenas bare waist, above her low fit denim, both their eyes closed and lips erotically locked in sensual felicity, amidst thousand other laboratory equipments.
I wish that I show many illustrations from her writing which are much more elegantly written to exemplify her talents as a writer in English coming from the Indian subcontinent. But it is not essential as our readers with a fine tone of tuned sensibility would catch the feel of the fiction.
Sudipta Mukherjee (Bhattacharya) was born in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand and raised in Kolkatta. A graduate of Calcutta University, she did her Masters from Indias Sericulture Research and Training Institute, affiliated to the University of Mysore, where she was awarded gold the medal for her academics. She had worked with multiple organizations before quitting her professional world to pursue her dream of being an author.

Udayanga Weeratungas FR petition re-fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by the Colombo Fort Magistrate was yesterday re-fixed for support on March 29 by the Supreme Court.
The matter was not taken up for support on the basis that the bench was not properly constituted.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, over financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Udayanga Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, the power of attorney holder of the petitioner.
In his petition, Udayanga Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing on Mekhanizatoriv Street Kyiv, Ukraine.
The petitioner further sought an Interim Order restraining the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank from suspending the petitioners bank accounts and continuing to suspend the bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, a Chief Inspector of the FCID had moved the Magistrates Court for a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner. The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the Constitution.
The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution by the purported decision to suspend and suspension of a debit transaction of the bank accounts of the petitioner in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lanka and Ukraine.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena appeared for the Attorney General.

US to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital in world first
US President Donald Trump will unilaterally recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, senior administration officials say. But the officials said Trump would not immediately move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The news comes ahead of an expected speech by Trump on Wednesday. Arab leaders earlier warned against moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, with one saying this would be "a flagrant provocation to Muslims".
The status of Jerusalem - a holy site for Israelis and Palestinians - is extremely contentious. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital city, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. In recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the US becomes the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948.
What has the US just announced The Trump administration officials said recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was seen "a recognition of reality" by the president. However, specific boundaries of the city would remain subject to a final status agreement, the official said.
The status of holy sites will not be affected. Trump also would direct the state department to begin the process of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem - but this could take several years. He promised the move to pro-Israel voters during his campaign for the presidency.
The US officials added that the president would be signing a regular waiver blocking the embassy's move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem until the new building was completed.
Ahead of his formal announcement, Trump phoned several regional leaders to tell them he intended to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
Before the confirmation of the US move, Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud told Trump that the relocation of the embassy or recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital "would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world".
The White House said the president spoke to Middle East leaders including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.
Among the reaction from those leaders: Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas warned "of the dangerous consequences such a decision would have to the peace process and to the peace, security and stability of the region and of the world"Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would "undermine efforts to resume the peace process" and provoke Muslims.
Jordan acts as custodian of the Islamic sites in JerusalemEgypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi urged Trump "not to complicate the situation in the region" US government employees and their families have been barred from personal travel in Jerusalem's Old City and the West Bank for security reasons ahead of planned protests.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned his country could sever ties with Israel if the US recognised Jerusalem as its capital. And Ismail Haniya, the chief of the Islamist Hamas group that runs Gaza, said a shift of the embassy and recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital would cross "every red line".
France, the European Union and the Arab League have also expressed concern. Israel's intelligence Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that Israel was "preparing for every option", including an outbreak of violence. What is so contentious about Jerusalem's status
The issue goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the rest of the Arab and wider Islamic world.
The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem.
Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital.
The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

Voice of the future
The English literary world has been strewn with an exotic bouquet of roses in the form stories, plays and poems. Many have been translated into languages spoken around the globe.
However, a few have not read and heard about works of H G Wells, Herbert, George wells born in 1866 passed away in 1946. He was an Englishmen. Parents were simple but with a vision of making their son a visionary expert. Herbert had a normal education in Science School. His vision in the study of the planet and its inhabitants made him a writer who gave his generation a glimpse of the future, human lifestyles, religion and history. Wells was a novelist, teacher and journalist.
His books gave the reading world a fantastic glimpse into the future. His stories wafted into the future. He was called The Voice of the Future'.
Futuristic mortal
His first book The Time Machine was out of this world. Literary giants were awed. Who is this futuristic mortal with brains to delve into the future of a planet
A teacher who brought tomorrow to the present. Our very own late Martin Wickremesinghe says that Wells takes us to the void between the present and the future or two ages. It reminds him of his own presentations that spoke of two generations or lifestyles Gamperaliya, Madul Duwa, Kurumini Saththu, Karuwala Gedera and Yuganththaya'.
H G Wells was with his readers long before the Ionosphere was invaded by man. Man conquered space for the future longevity of man and also to terminate his existence with ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs. But our gentle author strived to unite an ailing world with his stories  Time Machine, Invisible Man and War of the Worlds and also many more.
His masterpiece Outlines of World History takes him to the very pinnacle in giving us a concise glimpse of what happened how it happened and when it happened to our mother earth and her occupants from the beginning of time until the authors existence.
There are two volumes, divided into a number of books. He speaks on many topics, were inventions, authors, religion. He speaks about celestial teachers. He does not go deep into the teachings of these Divine Masters but takes us how where, when and the aftermath of the preaching by them. He makes our mind to go back with time to be with our beautiful, Divine Gurus.
Different postures
The photographs in these. Volumes help. The book on the birth and the spread of the Teachings of Buddha is mentioned with photographs of the enlightened one in different postures as found in many an Eastern Country. Our Ceylon takes pride of place with the Bo Tree, Kandy Temple, the Sacred Tooth Relic and our ordained priests. He calls the words of the Buddha, gentle and often generates a smile He speaks of the everlastingly resplendent Bo Tree at Anuradhapura.
Next, he says that the greatest monarch in the world King Asoka. He conquered Afghanistan up to a part of now Chennai. He conquered Kalinga lying along the coast of Chennai, up to the tip of India. Then came repentance. He was abhorred in seeing the massacred on the battlefield. He throws away his sword and begins to spread the word of Buddha. His edicts are for all time. He helped the downtrodden and sent his son to our land with the words of the Buddha. Later his daughter with a sapling of the Bo Tree. He also sent missionaries to China. As a Christian, I am proud to relate these gems to him.
Once, late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera had told his good friend late Rev. Fr. Tissa Balasuriya, that HG Wells should be honoured by the Buddhists of Lanka.
Wells did not go into the essence of the Buddha's Words, but his writings speak a lot about the great strides taken by the Buddha to heal the world. The late unforgettable Thera had said Tissa, we have come to speak about our Masters.
Who was with his in trying to heal the world, but H G Wells has made the letters of the English Alphabet to join together in speaking about Buddhism by an English writer. He should be honoured'. He had said, as said in the Outline of History, Book IV Pgs. 246-248 (unquote). The pictures in this chapter make us Christians to look up to him and meditate. He also speaks of the teachings of Prophet Mohamed. His teachings on submission, giving alms and seeking knowledge from cradle to grave.
Long stills
The writer ends his immortal stories and articles with The War of the Worlds'. The world is conquered by aliens. Their spacecraft stand aloft on long stills. The world is awed. The fighting forces and weapons cannot subdue these visitors from outer space.
Wells wants mankind to see the intervention of the celestial teachers in whom they believe to be with them. All in prayer. Then suddenly, a .......... man, who was about to be annihilated by aliens see their invaders falling. Dead, scientists probe into the reason.
Our tiniest of micro-organisms that had been with the man in good times and bad giving us diseases, curd and yoghurt had killed the aliens. The space invaders had never encountered bacteria. Their anatomical system faced a diabolical alien. Fascinating don't you think.
Atom bombs, nuclear missiles, the gunfire could not stop the invaders, but they were conquered by our tiny bacteria. Yes, a bacterium was able to save the world and mankind.
A lovely story by H G Wells:
Says Fredrick Forsythe the modern maestro in storytelling quite. Herbert George Wells was at times looked down by many for his very authentic declarations about man's leanings about religions. Also about the Origin of Man.
His story war of the worlds says Forsythe, wants to show us that faith could, at times, be with the man, taking many shapes making life to waft happily till death.
Many I most humbly request my dear readers who have had neither the time nor the opportunity in reading the works of the wells to spare some time in reading H G Wells Outline of World History.

Volvo revival gets boost from China
HANGZHOU- On Nov 28, Yuan Xiaolin personally handed over the keys to the 100,000th Volvo vehicle owner in the Chinese market in 2017, marking a new annual sales record.
Yuan, senior vice president of Volvo Car Group, said an annual sale of 100,000 vehicles in China will be a normal thing for the company in the future.
In the past three years, Volvo's global sales have seen significant growth, especially in China, which has become its biggest market. In 2015, Volvo sold 81,588 vehicles in the country. A year later, sales jumped to 90,930.
Back in 2010, only 22,000 Volvo cars were sold in China that year.
The good performance in the Chinese market has become a strong impetus for reviving Volvo brand glory.
The success is traced to technology and market cooperation between the group and Geely, the company which acquired Volvo in 2010. The powerful supporting ability of Chinese manufacturing industry and the comparatively cheap labor in China also contribute to Volvo's success.
The acquisition has benefited both Volvo and Geely.
For Volvo, China has become a key link in Volvo's manufacturing strategy.
From 2015, Volvo's S60 Inscription models, manufactured in Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province, started to be exported to the United States. This year, Volvo's S90 models, produced in Daqing, in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, have been transported to Belgium via trains connecting China and Europe.
Volvo Car Group CEO Hakan Samuelsson said that China will play an increasingly important role in the group's global manufacturing strategy.
While Volvo continues to make breakthroughs, Geely has also gone through a transformation. Seven years after the acquisition, it has gained more reputation and stepped up efforts to expand globally.
On the same day that Yuan handed over the keys, the jointly developed LYNK 01 hit the market in Zhejiang province. The car's manufacturer, Lynk & Co, uses Volvo engines and scalable platform architecture, while employing Geely's compact modular architecture and transmission.
In June, Geely signed an agreement to acquire a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton. In November, Geely's Belarus factory was completed. Sedans made in the factory will be sold in Belarus, as well as in other Eurasian Economic Union member countries.
Geely plans to make more breakthroughs, cooperate with others and become a leader in the global auto industry, according to Li Shufu, Geely chairman.

## Title: WASTE OR WASTAGE

Proactive Solid Waste Management in Sri Lanka
WASTE OR WASTAGE
In the backdrop of increasing garbage and consequences thereof, Sri Lanka is facing a significant crisis having various implications. While the municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is 6000-7000 Metric Tonnes per Day, the MSW Collection is 3600-4200 Metric Tonnes per Day (Waste Management Authority, 2017). The predicted MSW generation is continuously increasing until 2050. Therefore in this context, citizens and authorities have begun encountering loss, damage and harm in different aspects.
The present waste management mechanism suggests the categorisation of waste between degradable and non-degradable. While this is a basic classification of waste, the Municipal Councils need to strike a balance between cost of waste disposal and the process convenience for individuals and nation at large.
However, there is a paradox between the cost of waste disposal and the impact of the waste disposal mechanism, positing reactive waste management in Sri Lanka. The cost of waste disposal is increasing due to two reasons.
Firstly, the improper methods of classifying waste by households. This results in consuming more labour hours for reclassification of garbage by the collectors. Secondly, the inefficiency of waste collectors, disposers and administrators of the municipal authorities. This results in undue delays of garbage collection, obstructing the right of ways and spread of diseases due to rotten materials. Process convenience for garbage is described under three themes. These are society, economy and ecology.
Type of garbage
The societal perspective regards the consequences of improper waste disposal- the spread of diseases, unpleasant sight among others. The cost of waste disposal is considered in the economic perspective. Further, the ecological perspective regards the aspects of reduced soil, water and air pollution through the proper garbage disposal.
In order to achieve proactive waste management, it is worthy to study the processes of other jurisdictions. Singapore households profess a structured waste management strategy. General waste, aluminium, plastics and paper are the four different classes of waste categorisation (Sentosa, 2017). Despite it being a wider classification of waste, the long-term benefit of garbage process convenience is high. In the short-run, individuals need to practice rationality, reduce malpractices, due diligence and discipline in methodically disposing of waste according to the type of garbage.
At this juncture is it important to cite two legal aspects of waste management-contributory negligence and polluter pay principle. In the context of the rising cost of waste disposal in Sri Lanka, both households and municipal authorities have a shared responsibility to help the process of waste disposal at a lower cost. On the other hand, theoretically, the polluter is the garbage disposer (Household) who disposes of garbage in an improper and irregular manner. He should be liable to pay a fine for any irregular actions committed or omitted thereof. In certain countries, such wrongdoers have been imposed a penalty for cleaning a public area (roadway or sea beach) for a reasonable time period. This penalty is implemented if the wrongdoer has committed the act or omission more than once even after being warned. This is a strategy to recover the cost of garbage disposal.
Culture, discipline and attitude
Sri Lanka can capitalise on such inventive foreign practices. However, the effectiveness of adoption depends on various contextual factors- culture, discipline and attitude towards achieving an environment [cleaner] devoid of unmanaged waste. On the short-term, the cost of implementing such processes will be high but would yield long-term benefits such as cost saving for the country, time of employees of municipalities, healthier soil, air and waterways. Hence the opportunities for proactive waste management comprise of both tangible and intangible benefits for Sri Lanka.
The practical implications of proactive solid waste management are two-fold. Firstly, it is an action-driven initiative of planning, organising, leading and controlling the waste disposal process from household to the dump yard. Secondly, this action-driven process fuels the planning, processing and proliferation (3PTM) of effective waste management practices. It is each individuals drive towards the collective realisation of benefits of proactive solid waste management.

Weerawansas NFF plunges into grave crisis
Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake, the Deputy leader of the National Freedom Front (NFF), is likely to cross over to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Daily News reliably learns.
Dissanayake addressing a gathering in Anuradhapura yesterday had indicated the decision whilst calling on the general public to support the mandate of the SLFP.
This new development ahead of the much anticipated local government polls comes just days after another member of the NFF Jayantha Wijesekara resigned from the NFF. Wijesekera, a former member of the NFF and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, had decided to resign following the resignation of the party secretary Priyanjan Vitharana.
At a media briefing, Wijesekera cited that he had decided to quit the NFF following Vitharanas resignation. He called on progressive politicians from the JVP and the NFF to join forces with President Maithripala Sirisena.
It is unclear the exact reason for Weerakumar Dissanayakes change of heart, however, sources told the Daily News a growing sense of disenchantment exists in the party.
The resignation of Wijesekara and Vitharana has prompted many to rethink their decision to remain in the party.
National Freedom Front (NFF) National Organiser Piyasiri Wijenayake, who criticised party leader Wimal Weerawansa over his statement on bombing Parliament, was sacked from the party recently.

Wilde in love
Wilde was a happily married man with two children. He was from St. James in Paddington to make Constance Lloyd his wife on May 29, 1884. He was deeply in love with her to the contrary to what many thought he was marrying wealth.
The affectionate husband, the fond father, Oscar Wilde in a new role that many suspected will not last long and true enough they had not gone many years before Wilde stopped at a flower stall where he chose the loveliest blossoms to send with a message of love to the bride he had dumped.
Charming bride
Constance understood and loved him unto death though they lived far apart. The beautiful and charming bride of five summers earlier was heartbroken as to what happened to the man she adored and cared for, the man who wrote beautiful verses to her all the time.
I can write no stately poem
As a prelude to my lay
From a poet to a poem
I would dare to say,
..If these fallen petals
One to you seem fair
Love will waft it till settles
In your hair.
 And when wind and winter harden
All the loveless land,
It will whisper of the garden
You will understand.'
Understand Which she did no matter how cruel he sounded. The fond husband, the proud father, the advocate of matrimony, an unusual facet with Oscar Wild which was destined to end no sooner it started.
People believed that the reason Wilde distanced himself from his wife was that he was suffering was from the recurrence of a disease contracted during an affair while at the university. Later, it was claimed the cause of his death was this particular disease though on and oft-disputed. It was extracted from one of his biographies that Oscar Wilde when at Oxford contacted syphilis for the cure of which mercury injections were administered. It was probably due to the treatments that his teeth subsequently turned black and became diseased.
Pathological obstacle
Wilde went to see a doctor in London before proposing to his future wife who assured him that he was completely cured with no pathological obstacle to his marriage but later he was to discover that the disease had been dormant and was forced to give up physical relations with his wife. It was at this juncture when Wilde was feeling depressed that his friends tempted him to homosexuality. Wilde was feeling guilty about the mess he had got into to cool of his relations with a sweet, gentle and exceptionally beautiful wife with whom he had been deeply in love with. But Alfred Douglas found it hard to comprehend and did not believe it.
The literary circle was gripped by the horror that fell upon the country's most brilliant son, playwright Oscar Wilde when he was at the height of his popularity that was reduced to a psychological evolve and destined to suffer humiliation.
It was at Oxford that Robert Rose was introduced to Oscar Wilde in 1886 when Rose was about seventeen years his senior and was to play an important role in wild's life in the years when Wilde turned to the unnatural from the natural ways of men. This was history veiled in obscurity and was to be proved beyond any doubt in the years that followed attested by ample document. The emergence of Ross was always there in the background paving the way to his downfall but its presence carefully covered up and scarcely discernible while all the time Wilde was innocently unaware of the danger lurking in the form of Rose.
Threatening letter
When Sherard visited Wilde later, he found his friend in good cheer. There were no bars between them and Sherard threw his arms around his friend and embraced him. He saw tears rolling down Wilde's face and a look of gratitude.
Wilde knew that it was Sherard whose efforts that brought Constance to him. Wilde's happiness brought fury and anger on Douglas. He had heard about the reconciliation. He was afraid of the consequences that would fall upon him that he never imagined. Alfred Douglas wrote a threatening letter to Sherard that if he were to lose his friendship with Wilde in the future through any words used by Sherard that he would shoot him down like a dog. He was still very much in love with Wilde no matter whether Constance was by his side.
During the first few weeks of his stay with prison routine, it appeared that Wilde would succumb to its rigours as he felt the shame he had brought upon himself. The most affected among his friends was Sherard who shared his pain and was determined to promote reconciliation with his wife who was pressed by her family to seek a divorce. If she was to abandon him, he would have died quicker. So the loyal Sherard wrote many letters to Constance to forgive her husband and it took time for response because of her family advisers but the kind and loyal Constance who still loved him agreed on the advice of her brother asking Wilde to write to her that she would seek no divorce proceedings, Apparently he wrote and she crossed over to England from her refuge in the Continent and obtained permission to meet him.
Wilde had to face the truth, there was no way out as the evidence kept loading upon him and his sexual activities. He was sentenced to prison in May 1895 to serve his term at Wandsworth and Reading and later released in May 1897. He experienced the greater part the prison rigours of the silent system then in force and was helpless with nothing to do.
Reading Goal
However, the last few months were a blessing when a humane prison governor was appointed to replace the strict disciplinarian at Reading. He was permitted to use pen and paper and Wilde seized the opportunity to write and wrote the letter of Reading Goal, extracts from which were published but was not made public until 1949. His experience at Reading provided inspiration for his famous, THE BALLAD OF READING GOAL which became his last completed work.
Wilde accompanied a friend to various Catholic gatherings. They went to hear Mannings, raised that year to the purple, preach at St Aloysius. The outward visible sign of what Roman Catholicism could have impressed that responded a mind and Wilde as a Cardinal would have found his place among the great figures of Rome of the Renaissance. How far Wilde pressured this imagination no one knows
His father, Sir William Wilde rejoiced that his son went Oxford away from the feel of longing for the vision. He was of opinion that the corrupting influence of Catholic Ireland and then Oxford had faltered in Protestant orthodoxy. In many years that his friends, Manning and Newman had gone over to Rome. It appeared that Wilde too was keen on joining them if not for his father. Another friend, David Hunter Blair, surrendered all his wealth and position to become a Benedictine monk and Abbot.

Wimal Weerawansa betrayed our program and joined Mahinda Rajapaksa: Jayantha Wijesekera
The politburo of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna had earlier adopted five resolutions. Two of them were to win national independence through a national movement and unite Maithri and Mahinda. But our leader Wimal Weerawansa betrayed our program and joined Mahinda Rajapaksa by going to him on bended knees said SLFP Trincomalee District organiser and former National Freedom Front (Jathika Nidahas Peramuna) Provincial Council Member Jayantha Wijesekara. I decided to leave the party altogether because I could not withstand such envious activities on the part of the party leader, he said.
Wijesekara was addressing the gathering at a reception accorded him at Kantale town on December 4. Justice and Buddhasasana Deputy Minister Dushmantha Mithrapale presided.
Wijesekara said he was keeping such envious actions perpetrated against the JNP since 2004 in his mind to settle scores whenever Basil visited Trincomalee if he could in the near future.
Wijesekara who said that he received an invitation from Mahinda Rajapaksa to join the Pohottuwa party (SLPP) after leaving Maithri's Camp added that he flatly refused the offer saying that Maithri was not a cheat but a genuine and sincere leader who had established national unity by fostering communal amity in the country. I also told him you are just an ordinary Parliamentarian but Maithripala Sirisena is the Executive President of the Country and you are no where when compared to him.
Moreover, I told Mahinda that you are a member of a feudal family but Maithri is the son of a real farmer from Polonnaruwa.

Worlds worst zoo
Tourists who flooded to a new zoo to see extremely rare penguins from the South Pole were furious when they realised the birds were all inflatable toys.
Guishan Zoo advertised the special event in Yulin City in Chinas southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region which attracted huge crowds of locals and visitors.
With ticket prices set at a very affordable 15 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (1.68), and with a chance to see animals such as arctic penguins, local residents had little reason not to take a look.
But after arriving at the attraction, they were left puzzled and then angry when the so-called penguin exhibit turned out to be a dozen plastic inflatable penguins.
To make matters worse, the only real animals to see at the zoo were chickens, ducks and tortoises.
The reptile was placed inside a glass display box and named a fortune tortoise so passers-by would chuck money at it.
The false advertising and the depressing photos from the penguin expo have since gone viral on social media and also made headlines across China.
Members of the public were unable to get their money back from the zoo, and most soon gave up and went home.

Youth enterprise in Sri Lanka
The 2018 Budget speech, presented to Parliament by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, featured the words youth or young people nineteen times. Specifically, there was an emphasis on youth enterprise or entrepreneurship, with an entire section of new policies and initiatives aimed at fostering the development of youth-led businesses. Clearly, the intention behind the speechand the budget more generallyis to appeal to the sensibilities of young people in the country, to demonstrate to them that these new government initiatives have their back if they are to take the leap into becoming entrepreneurs.
Chairman, Youth Business Sri Lanka Samantha Ranathunga.
Chief Economist of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando.
The question however is how far will this reach extend And will this motivate greater entrepreneurship in the country In reporting this article, we spoke with people from across various fields to discuss what processes young people have to go through today to start businesses. What we found is that these new policies and initiatives included in the 2018 Budget would be a welcome change from an environment currently seen as hostile to young entrepreneursbut only if they are implemented efficiently and effectively.
How does the 2018 Budget Help Foster Youth Enterprise
If Enterprise Sri Lanka is to succeed, said Finance Minister Samaraweera of the budgets various policies aimed at reawakening the countrys entrepreneurial spirit, the youth of our country must be made stakeholders of this national venture.
All our young people, whatever their social and education status may be, must be given equal opportunities to succeed and utilize their respective talents to the maximum.
In this context, he spoke of three main elements to the governments strategy of harnessing young entrepreneurs in the country to ensure that no youth will be left behind. First, he spoke of 13 years of educationpromising to invest in primary and secondary education to ensure that young people will get 13 years of education irrespective of the outcome at O/Ls, and emphasizing the necessity of vocational and skills training. Second, he spoke of world-class university educationpromising to invest in university education with focus on modern curricula, research facilities and standardization.
Lastly, Samaraweera spoke of market-oriented vocational trainingpromising to invest in developing vocational training institutions to develop high quality market oriented training programmes. He elaborated that a common issue faced by youth today is that many lack the necessary skill set demanded by a competitive job market. So he outlined and detailed a forthcoming Employment Preparation Fund which the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs will manage. This EPF will finance three to six month training programmes in specific skill sets demanded by the private sector. As well, he added that the National Youth Corps will receive more than Rs. 2 billion to strengthen its various skill development programmes.
Separately, he stated that the budget, from 2018 to 2020, will support the formation of 150 youth-centric startups. These startups will be supported by a comprehensive government package which includes both non-financial and financial assistance including grants and the credit through the Enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme to these companies. The enterprise Sri Lanka Credit Scheme are a group of credit schemes with low interest rates in which the government will bear the interest subsidy.
Finally, acknowledging that the lack of capital or difficulty in accessing capitaldue to both the cost and the requirement for collateralhave been main impediments for the development of startups, the budget proposes for the establishment of a Development Bank with an EXIM (exit-import) window, to enable the much desired long-term financing for our private sector ventures.
Current Hurdles for Youth Entrepreneurs
Youth Business Sri Lanka is a subdivision of the Chamber of Commerce, set up with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship among youth. Mentors are appointed to coordinate with new entrepreneurs on their projects to teach them about market, regulation, and business practices.
According to Chairman Samantha Ranatunga, also the Managing Director of CIC Holdings, young people are constantly facing problems with commercializing their projects and promoting them at a high level.
The biggest issue for young entrepreneurs is to find collateral for their bank loans. The business ideas get stuck [when the bank loans arent attained] and they find it hard to move forward, he said.
Ranatunga said that until now there had been very few government initiatives implemented to encourage startups, and thus appreciated the budget proposals put forward to empower entrepreneurs. However, he was skeptical of how well these proposals would be implemented.
He suggested that a proper program be formulated for small and medium entrepreneurs to make funding easier, test business ideas, identify affordable market supply, and conduct research.
Sri Lanka is a country full of entrepreneurs but the older generation started with nothing. There was competition but it was less compared to the current context and the entrepreneurial market that exists now. The older generation focused on hard work and self-generation; there was no support from government. But the current generation needs it.
He said that if the government could support the entrepreneurs on a structural level, it could produce even more successful entrepreneurs and make them contribute better.
In addition to lack of accessible loans, he also mentioned that in Sri Lanka there was a limited to nonexistent availability of venture capital.
There should be five to ten angel funds, he said. Not just one.
Another huge problem Ranatunga said was that young entrepreneurs faced the unavailability of office space.
They cannot afford expensive office space. That needs to be considered by the government.
Start-up Activity on the Rise
Access to finance is also a key concern in particular when trying to expand from a small scale operation, added Chief Economist of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando as he agreed with many of the current hurdles facing young entrepreneurs delineated by Ranatunga.
But we are seeing in particular in the startup space that there is increasingly more competitions, mentorships and investments by investors, he said.
Still, he said he noticed an increase in innovation and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, and added that relative to five years ago, there was more visible activity in the startup and innovation spaceeven amongst the more established companies.
Fernando was impressed by the allocations made for credit schemes in the 2018 budget (both for startups and enterprises), as well as its IT initiatives. Emphasizing that youth do best in IT and tech-related industries, he said that such initiatives should be targeted well and operationalized during 2018.
From Engineer to Entrepreneur
The idea for Igniter Space (formerly known as Kids Ignite) came to Hasith Yaggahavita after he noticed that there was no advanced technology program to enroll his own kids.
Yaggahavita is an engineer in the Sri Lankan tech industry. He first initiated the program at his residence with the support of parents with a similar interest. Igniter Space was started in March 2016. In July 2016, its second market space was established in Narahenpita and later moved to other parts of the country.
According to, Yaggahavita, Igniter Space is committed to the cause of guiding the current young generation to become innovators and creators of technology.
Children get broader exposure to technology and they use modern education systems and we teach different disciplines in combination, he said.
He added that the drive for entrepreneurship was currently peaking. He further said that he did not depend on the government to initiate his idea.
What I see now is that new tech-based startups are not solution-focused. Several new tech entrepreneurs first find the solution and then start looking for problems. Therefore, it hardly solve the existing problems. As a result, the business does not generate any revenue, he said.
Yaggahavita pointed out that startups should focus more on products to turn their new ventures into a success. However, he said that real acceptance of start-up businesses was missing in Sri Lanka.
When a young entrepreneur initiates a novel business idea and goes to a government institution or a corporation, the institution or corporation is hesitant to buy or use their products. Therefore, nobody knows how long those enterprises would last. Sometimes, the government is ready to accept the newly established startups based in foreign countries but not the Sri Lankan young entrepreneurs, he said.
According to Yaggahavita, in Sri Lanka there are only two successful ways to establish their business. The first is to ride on investor money, build a huge eco system with millions of users, and monetize the user base. The second was to offer something to the users for which they are prepared to pay.
He believes that in Sri Lanka, the second way was the most sustainable, because it allowed the entrepreneurs to extend their market spaces once they were financially stable.
Still, like Ranatunga and Fernando, Yaggahavita feels that it was up to the government to do whatever it can to ease the process, if not fully facilitate it. And in this regard, all three remain skeptical of how well the proposals in the 2018 Budget would be implemented.
