UAE to extend labour rights awareness to Sri Lanka

As the country marches on with the guidance of prospective domestic workers and labourers, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has announced extension of awareness programmes to Sri Lanka following a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) the ministry entered with Sri Lankas Ministry of Foreign Employment.
The MoU paves the way for a new stage of cooperation between both countries to ensure a balanced and effective management of the contractual work cycle in line with the laws and regulations applicable in the UAE, said MoHRE Minister Nasser Bin Thani Al Hamli. He was flanked by his counterpart, Thalatha Athukorala.
Colombo was represented by one of the leading suppliers of manpower to the UAE. Last year, the Dubai Police released statistics of their followers on social media with Colombo registering huge traffic.
Al Hamli said the MoU is meant to regulate the activities of recruitment agencies working in both countries to ensure that Sir Lankan workers are recruited in line with the principles of transparency and respect for law.
Last week, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), Dubai, issued a booklet titled; A Guide Book for Foreign Workers to be distributed among 100,000 expatriates this year alone before covering at least a million of them in the near future, according to the GDRFA senior official.
It [the guidebook] will be in the hands of every worker in Dubai as part of a new plan to enhance their living experience in the country and avoid falling into troubles, said the Deputy Director General of the GDRFA-Dubai and Chairman of the Permanent Committee of Labour Affairs in Dubai (PCLA), Major-General Obaid Muhair Bin Surour.
The MoHRE minister said the Lankan MoU stipulates mutual activities and programmes, including awareness programmes, to be carried out to inform the contractual parties of their rights and obligations towards each other.
The Sri Lankan minister said the MoU underscores the keenness of both countries on developing cooperation to ensure transparency between the contractual parties at all stages.
The memo stipulates that a standard job offer and employment contract will be submitted by the employer to guide the workers to review the descriptions of jobs available on the ministrys system.
In case of dispute between the employer and worker, a complaint shall be submitted to the competent department in the MOHRE, which seeks to settle the dispute within a specific period of time or to refer the dispute to the concerned courts.
Under the agreement, only recruitment agencies registered at the ministry are able to offer recruitment and employment applications for domestic workers that have been submitted by employers.
The recruitment agencies are tasked with sending the job offer to the employee in their home country and listing the obligations of the labour contract. The contract will be signed by the employer and employee upon the arrival of the latter to the country.

## Title: Ultra-processed foods may be linked to cancer

Ultra-processed foods may be linked to cancer
Ultra-processed foods include pot noodles, shelf-stable ready meals, cakes and confectionery which contain long lists of additives, preservatives, flavourings and colourings  as well as often high levels of sugar, fat and salt. They now account for half of all the food bought by families eating at home in the UK, as the Guardian recently revealed.
A team, led by researchers based at the Sorbonne in Paris, looked at the medical records and eating habits of nearly 105,000 adults who are part of the French NutriNet-Sant cohort study, registering their usual intake of 3,300 different food items.
Forget five a day, eat 10 portions of fruit and veg to cut risk of early death
They found that a 10% increase in the amount of ultra-processed foods in the diet was linked to a 12% increase in cancers of some kind. The researchers also looked to see whether there were increases in specific types of cancer and found a rise of 11% in breast cancer, although no significant upturn in colorectal or prostate cancer.
If confirmed in other populations and settings, these results suggest that the rapidly increasing consumption of ultra-processed foods may drive an increasing burden of cancer in the next decades, says the paper in the British Medical Journal.
France is one of the few countries that already specifically warns its people against high levels of ultra-processed foods in the diet on the precautionary principle, said Mathilde Touvier, lead author of the study. The foods have already been linked to obesity, but the association with cancer is new.
The results are very strong  very consistent and quite compelling, she said. But we have to be cautious. It is the first study. We should not be alarmist. These results need to be confirmed in other prospective studies.
Ultra-processed food is a definition created by a group of scientists led by Prof Carlos Monteiro in Brazil, a country which also has national dietary guidelines urging they be eaten as little as possible. The classification system, called Nova, puts foods into four groups  raw or minimally processed foods including seeds, fruit, eggs and milk; processed culinary ingredients such as oils and butter; processed foods including bottled vegetables and canned fish and cheeses; and ultra-processed, which are formulations made mostly or entirely from substances derived from foods and additives.
Critics of ultra-processed foods say the processing strips out most of the nutrients, but Touvier says they do not believe the low nutritional value of biscuits and sweets and cakes are the cause of the raised cancer risk they saw. We did a statistical analysis to try to see if the whole association was only due to poor nutritional quality, she said. But the results do not depend on that.
She said they needed to do more research to figure out whether any rise in cancer is down to the high load of sugar, fat and salt or possibly the additives. We need to understand the mechanism, she said. Maybe in the future we will have an idea whether one or two molecules are the problem and not all the ultra-processed foods.
Her team now have a massive database of all the additives in specific foods, by commercial names and brands. Over the years to come, she said, we will be able to quantify the chronic exposure [of people] to the food additives. They will be able to study their effects alone and in combination with other additives, she believes, to find out whether there is a cocktail effect.
Other scientists questioned whether it was practical to group foods as ultra-processed. The term ultra-processed food is difficult to define in terms of food quality, and is not widely used by nutritional scientists, said Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at Kings College London. From a nutritional standpoint, this classification seems arbitrary and based on the premise that food produced industrially has a different nutritional and chemical composition from that produced in the home or by artisans. This is not the case.
The approach of categorising dietary patterns that depend on industrially processed food in relation to disease risk is novel but probably needs refining before it can be translated into practical dietary advice.
A spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation said they were proud of the industrys track record on reformulation but recognise that obesity and diet-related diseases are a complex and serious issue and more needs to be done. We believe a whole diet and lifestyle approach, which includes consideration of net calorie intake, and not just the role of individual nutrients or ingredients, is the correct way to tackle such issues.
Processed food should not be demonised  by working closely with our partners throughout the food supply chain, we can use processing positively to ensure all sectors of society have access to safe, affordable food.
Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: A lot of research has limitations and the scientists here are honest enough to acknowledge that theirs needs more work to be conclusive. But there is no smoke without fire: we should heed their fears  and read food labels more carefully. Huge quantities of everyday processed food have excessive levels of sugar, fat and salt stuffed in them and its all listed on the packaging.

UNSG Guterres hails Lanka's disarmament CONFAB efforts
The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has welcomed a decision adopted under Sri Lankas Presidency to advance work of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
The Conference on Disarmament (CD) presided over by Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha on Friday adopted a decision to establish five subsidiary bodies to discuss all items in its agenda, with a view to advance the substantive work of the Conference, the Sri Lankan mission in Geneva said in a statement.
The decision described as a well-brokered balance between flexibility and safeguards and offered a framework for a more focused and continued debate on core issues, seeks to bring the CD back to its original mandate of negotiating disarmament instruments.
Since its negotiation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996, the CD is yet to negotiate any new treaty.
In a statement released the same evening in New York, the Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the Secretary-General welcomes the decision adopted today by the Conference on Disarmament to take forward its substantive work.
The Secretary-General commends the Members of the Conference for achieving this positive step, which he hopes will lead to resumption of negotiations on effective measures for disarmament and arms control. The current international security situation underscores the vital need to restore disarmament as an integral component of our collective efforts to prevent armed conflict and to maintain international peace and security. It added that the Secretary-General urges Member States to make use of this opening, redouble their efforts and forge a new consensus for disarmament the statement from the Secretary Generals office said.
In his concluding remarks at the CD, Ambassador Aryasinha observed that the adoption of the decision was an important moment in the collective efforts to bring back the Conference to substantive work and negotiations. It represented a compromise between differing positions in the Conference which had for too long hampered its proper functioning. This decision would represent the beginning of a new phase which would allow the Conference to move forward through a search for commonalities and technical substantive work.
The President urged the Conference to be guided by the Rules of Procedure, but not to use those Rules to inhibit itself. The Sri Lanka delegation to the CD included Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Mrs. Samantha Jayasuriya and First Secretary Mrs. Mafusa Lafir.
Highlighting the elements of the Decision, the UN Office in Geneva (UNOG) in a media release on noted that the subsidiary bodies would pursue the following areas, and any other areas agreed to in accordance with the Rules of Procedure: reach an understanding on the areas of commonalities in the Conference on Disarmament by taking into consideration all relevant views and proposals past, present and future; deepen technical discussions and broaden areas of agreement, including through the participation, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, of relevant experts; and consider effective measures to advance the substantive work of the Conference, including legal instruments for negotiations.
Each subsidiary body would be chaired by a coordinator appointed by the Conference, under the guidance of the President on the basis of equitable regional distribution.
Reporting on the earlier lengthy negotiations that culminated in the decision, the UNOG, while noting initial concerns expressed by some delegations, said other delegations had agreed that the initiative would be the first progress on substantive work of the Conference in twenty years, and urged the adoption of the text especially as there were not many other options at the table. The proposal was a well-brokered balance between flexibility and safeguards and offered a framework for a more focused and continued debate on core issues. Delegates urged trust, compromise and flexibility, stressing that the initiative was not an end product and that its outcome and final results should not be prejudiced.
The Conference on Disarmament (CD) established in 1979 as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community, was a result of the first Special Session on Disarmament of the United Nations General Assembly (SSOD-I) held in 1978, and constitute of 65 Members, including the five Permanent Members of the Security Council.

When Radio Ceylon ruled the South Asian airwaves!
Tuesday, February 13 was World Radio Day. The United Nations General Assembly (UNESCO) invited all radio stations and supporting organisations to join in the celebrations which it says is a chance to pay tribute to the medium and to express our gratitude as to how it helps shape our lives!
World Radio Day was first celebrated in 2012, following its declaration by the UNESCO General Conference. It was subsequently adopted as an International Day by the organisation. World Radio Day 2018 focuses on the interplay between radio and sports, and its impacts on bridging divides, gender equality and diversity.
Radio is still the most dynamic, reactive and engaging medium there is, adapting to 21st century changes and offering new ways to interact and participate. Where social media and audience fragmentation can put us in media bubbles of like-minded people, radio is uniquely positioned to bring communities together and foster positive dialogue for change.
In reality, Sri Lanka should be at the forefront of the festivities and has every right to hold such an exalted position. Few may be aware that this nation was a pioneer among broadcasting nations and was the first among South East Asia. In actual fact, the history of Radio Ceylon dates back to year 1925, when its first precursor, Colombo Radio, was launched on December 16, 1925. Certain historians claim that radio transmissions commenced just three years after the launch of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), making it the first ever radio station in Asia and the second oldest in the world.
Broadcasting on an experimental basis was started in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, by the Telegraph Department in 1923. Gramophone music was broadcast from a tiny room in the Central Telegraph Office (CTO) with the aid of a small transmitter built by the CTO, with the radio equipment of a captured German submarine.
Long before TV became ubiquitous, most Sri Lankans had to get their breaking news from the radio or the daily newspaper. Anxious listeners tuned in regularly to their wireless sets  thats what radios, modern marvels of the time were called then  for the latest breaking news being aired across Asia from Colombo. During this time the Allied Forces had taken over radio operations in the capital and Radio SEAC was born. SEAC was the well-known abbreviation for the South East Asia Command , the body set up to be in overall charge of Allied operations in the Asian Theatre during World War II.
Colombo based British announcers David Jacobs and Desmond Carrington  they joined the BBC after the war  were among those who presented the news and radio programmes for the Allied Forces across South East Asia in their crisp plummy voices. At the end of the war Radio SEAC was handed back to the Government of Ceylon which changed the name to Radio Ceylon.
Clifford R. Dodd was an administrator and radio expert, with twenty years experience in broadcasting in Australia before he arrived in Sri Lanka. He was seconded by the Australian Government under the Colombo Plan to work in Radio Ceylon. He was appointed Director of the newly formed Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon. Dodd was charismatic and innovative and there was a real 'buzz' in Radio Ceylon after his arrival.
Dodd brought in tough new measures, some of which were far from making him win any popularity poll. He maintained that some Radio Ceylon staff, including the announcers who were on the payroll, were not entitled to permanency, or to retire on a pension. Radio Ceylon announcer, Mervyn Jayasuriya, observed in his memoirs: 'His credo was hire and fire.'
Yet, under Dodds tenure Radio Ceylon grew in immense popularity and stature. The training at Radio Ceylon was rigorous as Dodd demanded the highest professional standards in broadcasting. He had the rare distinction of being immortalised in a cartoon by the celebrated Sri Lankan cartoonist Aubrey Collette who published a cartoon titled, Odd Man Dodd.'
The 'Playback and Fast Forward Magazine in India noted: For millions in this country, Radio Ceylon was not just a broadcasting station. It had a form and a personality. Radio was King in South Asia in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and Radio Ceylon really did rule the airwaves - the station was like no other - it led the field in South Asia.
Soon after conquering Mount Everest On May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay turned on their transistor radio - and the first thing they heard was the All Asia Service (English) of Radio Ceylon, more than 3,000 kilometres away. They joined millions of people across the Indian subcontinent who regularly turned in to these broadcasts.
For Indian radio enthusiasts of decades gone by, it was Radio Ceylon that set the standards. Those were days before commercial broadcasts commenced in India and taking a break from the monotonous, though informative, broadcasts of All India Radio (AIR) meant twirling the knobs of those vintage radios to trap Radio Ceylon's programmes. Once tuned in, the listener was treated not just to music of the highest quality.
The magnetic voices of broadcasters such as Livy Wijemanne,Thevis Guruge, Jimmy Barucha, Mervyn Jayasuriya, Percy Bartholomeusz, Greg Roszkowski, Mil Sansoni. Hector Jayasinghe, Eardley Peiris, Iris Cockburn, Mark Anthony Fernando, Tim Horshington, Vernon Corea, Lourdes de Kretser, Bob Harvie, Chris Greet, Pearl Ondaatje, Prosper Fernando, Norton Pereira and Shirley Perera, to name but a few thrilled the listeners.
One of those legends, the late Mervyn Jayasuriya paints a vivid canvas around those past whimsical days of Radio Ceylon, the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation and finally the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation through nearly three decades of transition, dexterously bringing to life images of those exalted fellow broadcasters and other inhabitants of the station in his memoirs.
Mervyn adroitly tickles the reader's fancy with some hilarious anecdotes about the outrageous pranks of Greg Roszkowski, who would at the drop of a pin, or rather drop of his pants, do literally anything to raise a laugh. With a seeming flourish of his pen he generously spangles lucid skits of other such frolicsome escapades, shocking faux pas, and a cluster of indiscretions among the fraternity that makes boisterously entertaining reading.
The book unravels several delectable vignettes of some of the elite broadcasters of the day who were obviously more neurotic than modest celebrities at the time.
But then they were almost living legends and one must make concessions for a type of narcissism and rakish nonchalance in a business that demanded total concentration compounded with the challenges of ad-libbing and creating a sort of classical refinement.
On World Radio Day today we fittingly raise a toast to them all. We will never see their likes nor hear their deified voices again.

Balancing nature and security:
wildlife and bird strike hazards
(The inaugural Wildlife Hazard Strike Reduction Symposium builds awareness of the the hazards of bird strikes on aircraft. From ICAO Journal, Vol 72, No 3)
When it's bird versus airplane, both lose. The energy released when a 3 kg (6.6 lb) bird is hit by an aircraft travelling 150 mph equals the energy released by dropping a 47 lb object from 100 feet. The result can be devastating.
Just ask Jeff Skiles, First officer of US Airways flight 1549, the famed Miracle on the Hudson in which Skiles captain, Chesley Sully Sullenberger, landed their Airbus A320-214 in the middle of the Hudson River after birds struck both CFM56-5B4/P turbofan engines shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York City. Skiles was a keynote speaker at the inaugural ACI-ICAO Wildflife Strike Hazard Reduction Symposium.
Robird, a drone which mimics the flight of a falcon, will be integrated into the Edmonton, Canada airport's wildlife management programme. Robird will help guide birds safely away from air traffic while discouraging nesting near airside operations and glide paths.
Skiles speech put symposium participants in a virtual jump seat as he described how he saw a flock of birds, languidly flapping their wings, already too close to avoid. A split-second later, the birds impacted the plane. Skiles compared the feeling to flying through a hailstorm. Before he could begin to assess the damage, both engines failed. The flight was at minimum speed and he said he felt the aircraft sag in the air. Sully immediately took control, calling out my aircraft, while the ran through the checklist to assess and troubleshoot.
Angela Gittens, Director-General of Airports Council International (ACI), told delegates, Wildlife strikes affect airports, small and large, in all regions of the world. It is both a risk to aviation safety and a financial burden. We are committed to working with ICAO, regulators, and the rest of the industry to reduce hazards from wildlife strikes  a critical element in improving aviation safety.
Bob van Eekeren, President of the World Birdstrike Association, warned that in the next 20 years, not only will air traffic increase, so will the increased risk of birds strikes as the avian population increases, alters migration patterns, becomes more dependent on human food sources and settles near urban areas...and airports. If policies are not changed, van Eekeren predicted, The risk to passengers will increase considerably.
Young Wang, Chief, Airport Operations and Infrastructure for ICAO's Air Navigation Bureau (ANB), outlined some of findings from recent updates to the ICAO wildlife strikes analysis database, known as IBIS:
* 89 percent occurred on or near the aerodrome.
* The overwhelming majority of strikes occurred when the aircraft was below 1,000 feet  28 percent occurred during the take-off run or climb; 61 percent during the approach or landing roll; 68 percent occurred during the day (when birds are most active); 25 percent at night.
About one-third of bird strikes against aircraft are from perching and shore birds. Fewer than 10 percent are hawks, eagles, and vultures and only 2 percent ducks, geese, and swans. Three percent are mammals  deer, moose, bears, wolves.
The vast majority of reported strikes are in North America and Europe, nearly 70,000 of the approximately 100,000 reported by 91 states. Of the wildlife strikes for which the damage was coded (33,376 strikes), 17 aircraft were destroyed, 600 strikes caused substantial damage to the aircraft, and 1,874 strikes caused minor damage, Wang noted. Wildlife strikes represent 3.6 percent of all aviation accidents.
Wildlife strikes can cause accidents and serious incidents, costing the aviation industry billions in losses due to aircraft damage, flight delays and other operational impacts, commented Stephen Creamer, Director of the ANB. All aviation stakeholders need to work together to formulate a global strategy to address these hazards.
Creamer advocated long-term efforts to tackle the challenge of wildlife strikes globally, including strengthening regulatory requirements, States need to have appropriate legislation and regulation to address the safety concerns, including those related to land use around an aerodrome, he said.
Wildlife strike hazards should be assessed through a national procedure for recording and reporting wildlife strikes to aircraft, the collection of information on the presence of wildlife constituting a potential hazard and an ongoing evaluation of the hazard by competent personnel, Creamer explained.
Habitat research, dogs, and radar
Multiple speakers described various low-and high-tech approaches to mitigating the risk from birds and other wildlife.
Dr. Travis Devault, Project Leader for the US Department of Agriculture National Wildlife Research Center, Sandusky, Ohio, encouraged research into habitat use and foraging strategies of hazardous wildlife, which could be used to develop non-lethal methods and tools to reduce wildlife food, water, and cover attractants. He suggested using geographic information systems (GIS) to explore the effects of landscape structures, analyzing landscape patterns and interactions which influence the occurrence of bird strikes.
Some airports are using satellite tracking of hazardous birds. Others are identifying alternative land covers on or near airports, such as non-herbaceous ground covers or solar arrays, as well as development of aircraft lighting techniques and acoustic devices which use sound to disperse wildlife.
Melissa Hoffmann, Senior Wildlife Officer for Airports Company South Africa described how her team uses dogs to scare birds away from strike danger zones. The dogs are trained as puppies and taught not to wander too close to runways. Breeds include Springer Spaniels which help to flush birds out of dense tall grass areas and can even sniff out nests and eggs.
Tanya Drapeau, Site Manager, Avisure Pty Ltd., said at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, wildlife harassment techniques include pyrotechnics. Australian-style 'stock whips', visual deterrents such as lasers and spotlights to direct wildlife away from danger zones into safer areas and trained predators such as border collies and falcons.
David Bradbeer, Wildlife Program Specialist, Airside Operations, for Vancouver airport, advised:
1. Identify the hazardous species on your aerodrome.
2. Determine the habitats used by hazardous wildlife and why. Is the runway a habitat appealing to reptiles seeking warmth Is there water nearby that could be an attraction to birds What is the wildlife in the vicinity eating and is that prey nearby
3. Manage the habitat by reducing the number of attractants in the area.
Nico Voorbach, Director, ICAO and Industry Affairs, Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), said air navigation service providers (ANSPs) can look at changing routes of aircraft, changing Standard Instrument Departure (SIDs) and Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STARs), and changing runways.
Captain Ron Abel, President of the International Federation Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA), said, in addition to wildlife strike reports, flights crews can offer operational insight to local Runway Safety Teams.
Pratt and Whitney accident and incident investigator Chris Demers explained how both engine design and regulation have evolved as we gain more knowledge about the threat of bird ingestion.
Examples of turbofan engine design improvements include shroudless fan air foils, automatic surge recovery and automatic restart logic, improved compressor vane retention designs, optimized rain/hail/FOD (foreign object damage) core rejection geometry and reduced fan rotor speeds.
Steve Osmek, Manager, Airport Biologist for Seattle-Tacoma (Washington) Airport, addressed avian radar: It's easier to predict where wildlife strikes will happen, versus how they will happen. That's where the avian radar and FOD sensors come into play. The radar can help identify wildlife hot spots, allowing aircraft to slow down or take appropriate measures before a strike occurs.
Dr Edwin Herricks, Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois Center of Excellence for Airport Technology, declared, At this point in time, technology will not stop wildlife/aircraft collisions  it is not a silver bullet." He added, There is an unfortunate mismatch between expectations of what the technology can actually do (particularly at low cost).
Dr Herricks explained, No single sensor type or design is available to meet local to regional scale requirements for wildlife management, but multiple sensors can be integrated, even fused, to provide a comprehensive picture of wildlife activity. Integration/fusion of multiple sensors is the future.
He noted that unmanned aerial system (UAS) technologies can benefit wildlife management, whether by flying cameras or harassing wildlife. We can expect significant improvement in bird radars because birds and drones present similar detection problems.
One airport at a time
Gilberto Lopez-Meyer, Senior Vice President, Safety and Flight Operations, at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), described one success story at Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. In 2011, the airport experienced a high number of bird strikes. A Wildlife Coordinating Committee was established with representatives from the airport, airlines, ANSPs and IATA; they commissioned a study which highlighted a local garbage dump nearby. A package of safety measures was implemented, said Lopez-Meyer, "including working with the local garbage dump, training of personnel and the introduction of falcons to keep the other birds away.
Within three years, the number of bird strikes was significantly reduced and the safety level was recognized as acceptable.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution, cautioned Creamer. Wildlife around the world varies significantly and the wildlife control programme at each airport will be different." He said it is essential to apply Safety Management System (SMS) thinking. Control measures must be weighted and evaluated against requirements and should lead to the production of a Wildlife Hazard Management Plan for the airport, including training of personnel to manage an effective wildlife control programme.

Women determined to rise
There have been recent calls to not implement fully the legal requirement of having at least 25% women in each local government authority. The Daily News (Feb. 15) reports that The Election Commission is to ask that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No 22 of 2012 to be amended to allow councils to be established even without the mandatory 25 percent quota under special circumstances. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the 25% quota is of very recent origin and is from Act No. 16 of 2017. And second, no such decision was ever taken at any meeting of the commission.
The Island (16 Feb.) has a statement by womens groups that speaks of moves to change the 25% quota for women and of recognizing the exceptions in the quota. The Financial Times (15 Feb.) says Fresh amendments for the Local Authorities Elections Act would be essential to allow local governing bodies to establish councils, even without the mandatory 25% quota for women, under unique conditions.
Colombos Mayor-elect, Rosy Senanayake, refers in the Daily Mirror (Feb. 16) to the implementation of the 25% quota for women in local government elections being uncertain, and urges that steps be taken to implement the 25% Quota for Women in LG polls immediately.
Speaking for myself as a member of the Election Commission (and not for the Commission) I say that the women are right in feeling their long-fought-for gains are threatened. Indeed, I do not see any lacunae in the law that needs urgent attention. When the quota is the law, we cannot have exceptions. In my view, backdating changes to the law to affect the elections that have already been conducted, is improper.
The problem that many see is from the fact that the Local Authorities Election Act states 27F. (1) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Ordinance, not less than twenty five per centum of the total number of members in each local authority shall be women members
That is, if we do not have 25% women as members in a local authority, that authority has no standing. This would not be an issue (and in my view is not a serious issue) if not for the exemptions provided 65AA. (1) Where the number of members elected from any recognized political party or independent group for a Local Authority results in an overhang and thereby exceeds the number ascertained to be elected and returned as members under [subsection] (3) of section 65(3), and such number of members so elected [does] not include any women members, then the provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of this section shall not apply to such recognized political party or independent group.
(2) Where any recognized political party or independent group has received less than twenty per centum of the total number of votes polled in a local authority area, and [note well the word and] has less than three members elected or returned, then the provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of this section [which are on the method of apportionment of members] shall not apply to such recognized political party or independent group.
First note that the exemption applies only to parties fulfilling both conditions  receiving less than 20% of the vote and getting fewer than 3 representatives. The purpose is to give such small parties wide choice in putting forward their best nominees for the few seats they have.
PR list candidates
These conditions are often misstated as exemptions for meeting either condition as in one of the news articles cited above. There is also the wrong idea that ward candidates contest and that those on the PR list do not contest. In fact, they all contest. In English, a voter elected is returned; but some official documents in Sri Lanka use elected and returned as being of different meanings. We voted only for the party of our choice and that led to the election of both ward candidates and PR candidates. To ensure their getting in, the PR list candidates also had to campaign  so they too are elected. Therefore it is incorrect to suggest that choosing a person from the PR list is choosing a person who did not contest.
What then is the problem today As seen by many, it is twofold. First, it is that the methodology specified by Parliament is unlike what one would expect  that 60% of seats are filled from the wards and 40% from PR. To explain, let me take the Ambalangoda UC results that all three Commission Members sat down together to check the method employed by our staff:
See Table
After the eligible PR eligibility list is computed by the method prescribed, the numbers earned from the wards are taken off. Thus the Podujan Peramuna with 10 from wards and nine eligible for PR gets no PR seat (that extra seat is what is called an overhang). So it gets no PR seat and since all 10 of its representatives are directly elected, any contribution from it to the womens quota can be only if any of the 10 elected /returned persons happens to be a woman.
The second alleged problem is that small groupings in a chamber (with less than 20% of the vote and fewer than 3 members) are exempted from having to nominate women. Thus in Amabalangoda, the Podujana Peramuna cannot contribute to the womens quota, the PLF cannot be asked to contribute because they have only two members and 7.5% of the vote, and the UNFF has no seat. So the womens quota (with the exception of any women elected to wards from the Podujana Peramuna) will have to come only from the UNP and UPFA. In Batticaloa, the ITAK with the most seats by far had all its ward winners men with no PR member.
This might be unfair only insofar as the parties that need to contribute have less choice than the smaller groupings in choosing whom to nominate from among the pool of men and women on their lists. To call that a burden or unfair is a stretch. It is an insult to women  recall strong and determined women who ruled us effectively (if not always justly) such as from Queen Victoria to Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. It would never be a burden if the parties had chosen their best women and not their relatives.
Is it really a burden or unfair to name a woman instead of a man It shows that we men, especially we old men, do not want to let go. We imagine (because it fits our prejudices) that the 25% quota is a set quota. It really is a minimum standard to exceed which is no crime. We think it is a burden. That by itself shows we really need our women to be liberated from such insulting caricatures.
Local Authorities Elections Act
There is talk of having to amend the laws. No indeed. The Local Authorities Elections Act as recently amended reads 27F. (2) The [Elections Commission] shall by notice published in the gazette, specify the number of women candidates to be nominated in respect of each local authority.
Thus the Commission has the authority to force the groupings that can, to nominate more than 25% women.
The so-called problem is said to stem from the concept of the opposite of an overhang defined in the ordinance as overhang means the number of candidates elected for a local authority from any recognized political party or independent group in excess of the number of such recognized political party or independent group is entitled to have elected in terms of subsection (3) of section 65B of this Ordinance;
A party has to nominate a woman after the declaration of results only when it wins fewer ward seats than by PR. So why complain even if they all have to be women, especially when they are the partys own nominees Besides, even here, the above referenced Act gives the Commission the authority to decide on its own:
65B (4) Upon ascertaining the number of candidates entitled to be elected and returned as members of that local authority by each recognized political party or independent group, as the case may be, in terms of subsection (3) [which states how to arrive at the figures], if it is found that the number of members elected from such recognized political party or independent group for that local authority
(a) exceeds the number ascertained to be elected and returned as members under subsection (3), then such overhang shall be determined by the [Elections Commission].
Lets please not see problems where there is none. Lets not delay the inauguration of these long awaited local authorities by waiting for parliament to tinker where no tinkering is required. Any legal change would be required only if even with all free PR candidates nominated by the parties able to do so are women, the 25% quota is not met.
Women have a right to be representatives knowing better than us men the special needs faced by women, children, and the elderly; and knowing and possessing the skills to address as well as us men the general needs of all of us in society. They worked hard for this miserly 25% quota. Lets not haggle over having to cede just a little more to be in mandatory compliance with the law.
The world over, devolution of powers is seen as the way to include everyone in decisions that concern them. Local authority decisions must be taken at local level and further delays in the inauguration of these bodies cannot be brooked. We men have been deciding all these years with just 1.8% women in our midst in local government. It is time to devolve our powers and let women too have a say.

Youth drowns in escape bid
Residents of Heraliyawatte recovered the body of 20-year-old Nalinda Kasun of Kahatuduwa, Piliyandala, which was found floating in the Heraliyawatte canal, on Saturday morning.
Mount Lavinia ASP Sarath Jayasekera who held a spot inquiry, transferred a Police Sergeant and a Police Constable of the Kahatuduwa Police to the Mount Lavinia Police Division, pending a full inquiry, in connection with this incident.
It transpires that on Friday, a police party of the Kahatuduwa Police had arrested two suspects for possession of two grams of heroin, while they were walking close to the canal in the Kahatuduwa Police area.
One suspect, identified as Nalinda Kasun, escaped from police custody and, when police gave chase, jumped into the canal.
Although residents and police searched the canal, he could not be found. His relatives rushed to the police station and had a heated argument with the police. They staged a protest against the OIC and other policemen who were involved in the alleged incident.
The crowd was however brought under control with the arrival of Mount Lavinia ASP Sarath Jayasekera who promised an impartial inquiry into the matter. He held a preliminary inquiry.
After the body was found, the Kesbewa Magistrate visited the scene and held an inquiry. The postmortem was held by the AJMO of the Colombo South Hospital and a verdict of 'death due to drowning' was recorded.
The Mount Lavinia SSP has ordered an inquiry into the incident and a team of officers of the Mount Lavinia Police is conducting investigations.

FTA with Singapore,  positive signal to world
Sri Lanka has managed to send a positive signal to the world, demonstrating the countrys openness to investments and its willingness to create much-needed business links with the rest of the world by signing a comprehensive, high quality FTA with Singapore, one of the most liberalized countries in the world.
These views were expressed by the Chief Negotiator of the National Negotiation Team, K. J. Weerasinghe, speaking at a seminar on Expand Your Business Opportunities Through Sri Lanka- Singapore FTA, held at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Auditorium.The Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA is the first comprehensive agreement for Sri Lanka beyond trade in goods and covers goods, services, investments, technical barriers to trade intellectual property rights, rules of origin, customs procedure and trade facilitation, trade remedies, competition, transparency provisions, government procurement, dispute settlement and general and final provisions while it includes chapters on telecommunications, e-commerce and financial services annex.
K. J. Weerasinghe
Research Director at Verite Research, Subhashini Abeysinghe also speaking at the seminar said singing a FTA with Singapore is not going to be a game changer for Sri Lanka especially in terms of export of goods.
Sri Lankas export sector is facing significant challenges in competing with international markets. I have been rather skeptical about the overall benefits of signing a FTA with Singapore or any other country especially in terms of export of goods. FTAs can bring certain benefits in terms of
export of goods. It is complimentary, but it is not going to be a game changer for Sri Lanka.
To revive exports in a sustainable manner, Abeysinghe stressed the need to make simultaneous efforts to showcase that Sri Lankan businesses operate in a competitive environment and sell products at a competitive price with the right quantity. According to Abeysinghe, no country has experienced FTAs generating that kind of export growth and to revive exports, efforts must be made to do something more than signing agreements.
Singapore is Sri Lankas 20th export destination and the third largest importer. Singapore is also the eighth largest trading partner in Sri Lanka. In terms of trade in goods, Singapore is not a significant export market of Sri Lanka.

Good Governance must continue
The responsibility of the Good Governance Government is to continue with the January 8 mandate, while providing reliefs to the people, Leftist Circle Convener Chameera Perera yesterday said.
He said the two main parties have to go forward since the benefits of instability goes to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government should be smart enough not to get trapped in his ploy.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Centre for Society and Religion at the Church of Our Lady of Fathima, Maradana.
He said the enemy of their coalition was Mahinda Rajapaksa and the government should not allow them to take over power. He added that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gained only 47 percent of the votes, while the rest had rejected him.
Perera said the Rajapaksa has taken the benefit of the high tax increase and the curtaining of the relief to the people.
He added that Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members are corrupt and if they took over the government, the situation would be worse.
He said the people are moulded by the political culture and they expect relief. He added that they should be given relief including the fertiliser subsidy.
Even Mahinda Rajapaksa did not give them quality fertiliser, they gave bags of soil, Perera said.
The people should be given those relief. They appreciate not money but a piece of cloth for their uniform no matter if it was substandard.
The Prime Minister has to dedicate for the victory and future of the Party, he said.

Over 7,000 jumbos killed during last two centuries
Retired Government Officer of the Wayamba Environmental Authority Dr. Saman Senanayake said the human-elephant conflict have worsened in Sri Lanka today and many answers given to resolve it failed since they lacked proper planning and commitment.
He said Wildlife Conservation Department statistics show that since the 19th century to date, 7,284 wild elephants have been killed including 56 tuskers.
He said the hill country now hardly had wild elephants and they exist only at dry zone plains.
Villagers engage in chena cultivation in dry zones plains and wild elephants have to undergo severe difficulties in finding their food, he said.
Saman said the Mahaweli Project took thousands of prime habitats of wild elephants resulting in the starting the second phase of the human-elephant conflict.

SHAME ON YOU! Student survivor blasts Trump
US: A survivor of the Parkland school shooting called out US President Donald Trump on Saturday over his ties to the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), as several thousand rallied in Florida to demand urgent action on gun control.
Three days after a troubled teen armed with an assault rifle killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez delivered a fiery address to a crowd of students, parents and residents in nearby Ft. Lauderdale.
To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you! she thundered, assailing Trump over the multi-million-dollar support his campaign received from the gun lobby. The crowd chanted in turn: Shame on you! We are going to be the last mass shooting... We are going to change the law, she vowed -- slamming the fact 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz was able to legally buy a semi-automatic firearm despite a history of troubling and violent behavior.
The question on whether or not people should be allowed to own an automatic weapon is not a political one. It is question of life or death and it needs to stop being a question of politics, Gonzalez told AFP following her speech.
In Washington, the political response has made clear that the powerful NRA pro-gun lobby remains formidable, while Trump himself suggested the root cause of mass shootings was a crisis of mental health -- making no mention of gun control.
If the President wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, Im going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association, Gonzalez said in her impassioned address.
It doesnt matter because I already know. Thirty million, she said, citing the sum spent by the NRA to support Trumps election bid and defeat Hillary Clinton.
She then ran through a list of the pro-gun lobbys talking points -- for example, that a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun, that no law could ever stop a madman intent on killing -- answering each argument with We call BS. The young womans powerful address immediately went viral, with her name a top trending topic on Twitter.
Trump tweeted a day after the massacre that neighbours and fellow students had failed to flag Cruz to the authorities.
We did, Gonzalez fired back, her voice shaking with emotion as she insisted the community had done its best to raise the alarm. Time and time again. Since he was in middle school. It was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump slammed the FBI Saturday for failing to heed signs that could have prevented the Florida school shooting, charging the agency was too preoccupied with probing his campaign team over Russian election meddling. Allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential race and collusion with the Trump campaign are being investigated by several congressional committees and by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who took charge of the federal governments probe from the FBI last year following the sacking of its former chief James Comey.
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable, he wrote on Twitter.
They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! Troubled teen Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people with an assault rifle at his former high school in Parkland, Florida on Wednesday.
It was the 18th school shooting of the year and sparked renewed calls for gun control. US authorities have come under mounting scrutiny for failing to act on a series of warning signs. The FBI admitted Friday it received a chilling warning in January from a tipster who saidCruz could be planning a mass shooting, but that agents failed to follow up. Trump spoke by phone Saturday with the Parkland mayor, the county commissioner and the principal of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to express his condolences and offer his support. He then turned political in a tweet Saturday night, asking why didnt the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didnt want to, and now they just talk! Trump is staunchly opposed to additional restrictions on guns or gun ownership, but Vice President Mike Pence said at an event in Dallas the president would make school safety a top priority when he meets with governors of US states in the coming days. Lets pray for wisdom. For all in positions of authority that we might find a way to come together as a nation to confront and end this evil in our time once and for all, Pence said.- AFP

Technology is eating the World
Many of the major industries in the world have experienced upheaval due to tech companies entering their space. Ubers entry into the taxi industry and Airbnbs entry into hospitality are some of the famous examples, along with Amazons disruption of how we think about retail. These tech companies have been successful by going beyond simply iterating upon the way industries run or innovation processes; they have used technology to completely disrupt the way that these industries serve their customers.
These views were expressed by founder of Sysco LABS, Mani Kulasooriya and Vice President of eSolutions at Sysco, Ron May in a meeting with the American Chamber of commerce in Sri Lanka recently on How technology dominates the customer experience and changes industries and Technology is eating the World.
Uber, Airbnb and Amazon, are leveraging the online marketplace systematically.
These disruptions have fueled both the growth of tech companies and their transformation. The largest companies in America in the previous decades were Oil and Energy companies, but in 2016, the trend shifted towards tech companies occupying the top five slots; Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook respectively. This growth was driven by a transformation within the tech companies themselves. In the late 90s, technology was a support function of organizations and more often than not, one that could be outsourced out of the organization if not out of the country, so many of the largest tech companies were BPOs. However, as technology continued to develop, the leading tech companies became those that specialized in creating technology to be used by consumers: The Apples, Microsofts and Googles of the world. But today, in the Silicon Valley, the leading tech companies are those that provide a more traditional product or service but with a superior customer experience driven by technology - Netflix, Amazon, Uber, etc.
This latest trend of superior customer experience through technology is growing fast as the latest innovations in technology allow tech to make a greater impact along the value chain. More obvious innovations such as the IoT (Internet of Things), robots, drones, automated cars, virtual assistants and employees, are driving change on the customer facing end of the value chain, while more invisible innovations like blockchain technology - which drives cryptocurrencies and the big data produced through smart sensors and edge computing - transform value chains at their base. Together, what we are witnessing is an ever-growing influence of tech in business that will only allow tech companies to survive the future.
So, if you arent a tech company yourself, how do you react to this change Well, start operating like one. Lead like a founder - which is to say that you need to lead with the will to take large bold decisions the way that the founder of the company would. These decisions are the forces which will allow you to transform.
Secondly, organize your company like a tech startup - with agility in mind. Small teams that own projects, move fast and are held accountable. Thirdly, hire techies and integrate them into you teams; this allows you to bring technology to every aspect of your organization and allows your teams to operate with entrepreneurial dexterity and independence.
Finally, to really operate like a tech company, you need to focus on the customer experience. The experience that your customer has with your product and your service, but also the experience your customer has through all their interactions with your business, and the emotion that the brand carries through these numerous touch points.
The experiences that your customer has along this journey creates the new brand. The experience-based brand that works across every touch point, and a positive customer experience transforms your consumers from customers into fans. A fan of a brand is more than a customer; while a customer is fickle and may switch your product out for a competitors if they perceive even a slight improvement, a fan will stay with you even when they may have an anomalous negative experience because of the history they have with the brand and the positive experiences you have created. In the market of the future, it will be brands that can create fans using technology that will thrive, as all industries become tech industries.

Advice on Love from Nietzsche and Sartre
Locking lips and interlocking fingers are harmless enough, but locking into love is seductively dangerousboth figuratively and literally. Twenty-first-century lovers have become so captivated by the metaphor that, in 2015, the pont des arts in Paris had to be released from the crushing weight of forty-five tons of padlocks that lovers had secured to it. Keys, tossed over the rails, litter the Seine. While the Parisian love locks were auctioned to raise money for charities, padlocks still smother memorials around the worldfrom other bridges in Paris, to the Brooklyn Bridge, to fences in Hawaii and Australia. Urban planners have now become accidental heroes in the crusade against the obsession, although the phenomenon persists despite their best efforts to thwart it.
On a Valentines Day that comes hot on the heels of #MeToo, its worth reflecting on some of our rituals and symbols of love. For example, while I hope chastity belts are a relic of the past, ironmongery such as wedding bands are still among our ultimate signifiers of commitmentperhaps even more so than the marriage certificate that binds us legally. In some ways, this makes sense. Steely icons are strong, stable, and durable. Metallic tokens outlive us to such an extent that they remind us of the possibility of everlasting love. Most of us want love, and we want it to stay, so no wonder were tempted to fetter it in chains. However, these exalted symbols are deeply troubling in other ways. Not only are they cold and hard and inflexible, but theyre also relics of a long tradition of possessiveness: wedding rings are a vestige of dowry traditions and signify being owned.
Greatest stimulus
Friedrich Nietzsche might have been disappointed, but not surprised, to learn that were still obsessed with locks to symbolize love. Love, he thought, can be the most angelic instinct and the greatest stimulus of life. But too frequently, love manifests as a greedy and decadent desire for possession. As Nietzsche postulated, lovers all too often act like the dragon guarding his golden hoard and treat a beloved like an exotic birdas something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away. Chains can be comforting, like lovers arms, but Nietzsche was an advocate for freeing ourselves from these petty shackles of romantic mythology, particularly the ideal of securing love. Love is a feeling, and its absurd to thinklet alone vowthat we will feel a certain way till death do us part.
Jean-Paul Sartre, who read (and ruthlessly mocked) Nietzsche in college, spent most of his time drinking aperitifs in Saint-Germain-des-Prs cafs just steps from the pont des arts, scribbling in notebooks, and pursuing young, beautiful women. As a champion of existential freedom, Sartre argued that to accept other peoples view about how you should live involved a kind of self-deception that he labeled bad faith. No friend of bourgeois norms, he argued that each of us is responsible for our own life choices. A free individual shouldnt lock him- or herself down in a relationship that may grow to be an uncomfortable cage. Throw away the key, and you throw away your freedom. To be free is to have the possibility to change course, redefine yourself, and overturn others images of what you should be.
According to Sartre, love exists only in its actions. So if buying a brass lock and leaving it, along with thousands of others, to weigh down a monument is for you a special, beautiful, and meaningful act of love, Sartre probably wouldnt have stopped you. However, he would have been dubious about the authenticity of such a gesture. The love lock is not an ancient tradition but a fad that started in Rome in 2006 after the popularity of the book (and subsequent film) I Want You, by Federico Moccia. In the story, two lovers lock a chain around a lamppost on the Ponte Milvio in Rome and throw the key into the Tiber. It symbolized the idea that they would always belong to one another.
Inner being
The symbol of a lock may seem completely inimical to an existential view of love. Once the key has been thrown away, there is no exit. Yet Sartre used the same metaphor differently, suggesting that lovers could act not as a lock but as a key to unlocking your inner being. Without someone scrutinizing, engaging with, and appreciating you, there may be aspects of yourself that will remain forever invisible. A lovers intimacy can reveal those desires and attitudes.
For Sartre, the joy of love is when we feel secure in our possession of one another and find the meaning of our lives in and through the other person. The problem is that this is just an illusion. There is nothing at all secure about romantic love. Since lovers are free to choose to be in a relationship, they are also free to leave, and this makes love perpetually vulnerable. According to Sartre, this drives lovers into vicious circles of sadomasochistic power games. They try to control each other and demand the sort of possession that the padlock implies. The outcome is that lovers end up attempting to rob each other of their freedom without ever fully achieving the possession they lust after, which is why Sartre concludes that love is conflict.
There is nothing wrong with hoping that love will last. In fact, the hope that it will endure differentiates romance from lust. For Sartre, lovers define themselves by choosing to love each other both now and in the future. Yet that is the paradox of love: we cant know what we will be like in the future, and as much as we can freely choose to commit to it, to tie down a future self is its own denial of freedom.
One might wonder: Cant we just let go of the desire to be one anothers ball and chain Simone de Beauvoir certainly wondered about it and argued that the best relationships are authentic. In authentic relationships, lovers respect one anothers freedom and keep exercising their own. Beauvoir and Sartre had an open relationship, a radical departure from the conventions of the time. Still, they demanded an assurance that they were each others primary partner, which may have denied them certain other freedoms.

[APPRECIATIONS - (19-02-2018)]
Dr. A. M. M. Sahabdeen
An ardent universalist
The death anniversary of late Dr A. M. M. Sahabdeen falls on February 21.
Dr. Sahabdeen was the eldest of our family and was a well-known administrator, educationist, humanist, philosopher and founder member of the A. M. M. Sahabdeen Trust Foundation.
His primary education was at St. Andrew's, Gampola, secondary education was at Kingswood College, Kandy and his tertiary education was at the Peradeniya University, when Sir Ivor Jennings was its vice chancellor. He graduated with an Honours Degree in Western Philosophy and Economics in 1949. He sat for the Ceylon Civil Service Examination that same year and ranked second in the island. He completed his PhD at Peradeniya University in 1985.
Dr. Sahabdeen's administrative career began in 1950. He held several senior administrative positions in government. He functioned as the Health Ministry Deputy Director, Social Services Director,People's Bank Director, Commodity Purchases Commissioner and chairman of many important government organisations until his retirement in 1973.
Thereafter, he became an entrepreneur and then, Leedons Chairman. He was committed to serving the public, and this continued even after his retirement from government service.
From time to time, the government requested Dr. Sahabdeen to serve as a member of various commissions, such as the Public Service Commission, Presidential Commissions on Delimitation, Taxation Commission, Finance and Banking Commission, Press Council, and Presidential Industrialisation Commission.
His service was considered exemplary and he enjoyed serving the government.
I slept and dreamt that life was nothing but joy
I woke and found that life was nothing but service.
I served and realised that service is joy.
- Tagore.
His intellectual pursuit continued after his retirement; he was appointed the Vidyodaya University (later, Sri Jayawardenepura University) Western Philosophy Department Head. He authored several articles and books on philosophy and literature such as God and the Universe and Beyond the Horizon. He received his second PhD at the Ceylon University in 1985. His interest in social work commenced right from the time when he served as the Social Services director. Being a universalist, he was concerned about poverty and deprivation. He felt that people deserved a better stake in the country's education and social system.
In order to provide assistance with available resources, he spearheaded the creation of a charitable trust named Abdul Majeed Mohamed Sahabdeen Foundation, which was later incorporated by an Act of Parliament as The Abdul Majeed Mohamed Sahabdeen Trust Foundation.
At the inception of the Trust, educational scholarships were given to underprivileged. An important project of the Trust Foundation was the setting up of the Deshamanya Mohamed Sahabdeen Institute for Higher education. Dr. Sahabdeen believed that education was the best wealth that could be bestowed on humans, quoting Victor Hugo, He who opens a school door, closes a prison. This institute was established as a campus-style educational centre for higher education, and is situated at Pahamune Narammala, Kurunegala. It is a pre-university institute with external degree programmes provided by the Peradeniya University. An affiliate of the Trust Foundation was set up as the Pahamune House. As a humanitarian gesture and in response to a request from the the the National Child Protection Society commissioner, the Pahamune House was converted into a reception centre for Tsunami victims in 2004.
Dr. Sahabdeen was a complex thinker. His generosity was the hallmark of his character. His faith in humanity was as great as his religious faith and his sense of humour was evident at all family get-togethers; the events were always vibrant in his presence.
He hailed from a well-known family in the upcountry. His paternal grandfather was late Muhandiram Issac Lebbe, a realtor. His parents were late Abdul Majeed and Hajiani Saharuwan Majeed, who were landed proprietors. He had nine siblings.
Dr. Sahabdeen marreid Ruchia Halida, daughter of the then Beruwala Urban Council former chairman late S. M. Jabir. He was blessed with two children. His son, Rizvan, is an Economist who completed his Master's at Lancaster University and his daughter, Samiya, is a Barrister-at-Law in the UK, married to former Oxford Union president and consultant Spinal Surgeon Dr. Hilali Noordeen.
Dr. Sahabdeen passed way on February 21, 2017, surrounded by his family. His passing is a great loss to our family. Nevertheless, he shall be cherished by his wife, children and all other family members.
May Allah grant him Jannathul Firdhouse.
Verily we are from Allah, and unto him shall we return.

Trila Perera
Musician par excellence
It has been 20 years since she departed to be with the Lord, but the music she imparted reverberates through her sons; Rukshan Perera and Melantha Perera, prominent composers/performers in the music field.
The amiable and energetic Trila Perera came into our lives over 50 years ago at our communicant church. Annette and I, being newly-weds then, took an instant liking to her. Her affection was contagious. Her care and concern was irrespective of considerations of class, caste or creed, and no recipient could ever resist responding to that disarming love which knew no bounds in transmission. Immense were the acts of her love, sharing and feeling for people both rich and poor.
Trila Perera was a teacher of western music at Princess of Wales, Moratuwa, but her flair and skill for music were well-known far and wide. As a teacher, she reserved no skills from her pupils. Many are her students who cherish the memory of their teacher as one who was generous and perfect in giving. She was mild and loving in chastening the students and peers. Aggression was never in her vocabulary. A tribute from a group of her students said, She was a beautiful lady who had a beautiful heart. We had the good fortune to be taught by one of the rare human beings to walk this earth. She had compassion, understanding, love, joy, happiness and readiness to forgive and forget, always with a beautiful smile that brightened the room. She was a teacher to whom her students always came first, and she loved them dearly. She was courageous and never hesitated to stand up for justice. She has gone to the principal many a time on behalf of us. She taught us to sing joyfully and love music. We learnt not only to sing joyfully, but to live joyfully as well. Another said, She is not my teacher, she is my beloved pink rose. That capsules it all about Trila as a teacher. She instilled high values and ideals in her students that made them not only good singers, but also great citizens. Once, a rendition of Blue Danube under her tutelage won for the All-Island Band Competition and her choir has won several awards.
For over 30 years, the YMCA National Council was her second home. Her husband, Boyd, was its CEO, who decidedly changed its course from a social service-oriented NGO to that of a development-oriented social action movement, instilling into it the grit and Christian commitment to help the poor and the downtrodden combat the causes of poverty and oppression. Trila instantaneously took a liking to the idea and helped her husband to make his dream come true. The YMCA, the YWCA and the Y's Mens Association were three institutions that benefitted from her social consciousness. Her involvement in youth development and social reformation activities, both in the National Council and the YMCA's of Moratuwa, Dehiwala, and Nugegoda were excellent examples of Christian concern for the hapless.
For many years, she was well-known for her untiring efforts as the honorary music director of three important Annual Y activities. i.e. the sunshine camp in Dehiwala, family camp in Welimada, and the christmas carols in several other places. Alongside the late Harris Manickam of the YMCA, she organised the three-day sunshine camp every year for 200 paraplegic and epileptic children. The five-day Annual YMCA Family Camp in Welimada was another event where she excelled as an organizer. Over 100 lower middle-class families were exposed every year to an action-packed holiday plan where Trilas passion for music captivated campers every evening and helped strengthen family bonds.
She was a silent counsellor. She rushed to those who needed help. Her enchanting smile touched people. Like her music, her smile too was all-encompassing. Never did we hear her talking ill of others. Though diminutive, she walked as a colossal amidst all whom she came into contact with. Trilas carol service is something that Moratuwites and Ys Men and women looked forward to and still talk about.
To her, religion and music were inseparable. She loved God and his creation unreservedly and gave him her all. Up until her final hour on this earth, she served him. She was training her choristers in church when she fell ill and was rushed to the doctor, never to be back again at the church organ. She understood the importance of carolling and how it should reflect the message of Christmas. Every year, it was a different theme; it was a labour of love. She was the most sought-after during the advent time, each year. The YMCA, YWCA, Ys Mens Clubs and many churches and institutions rallied around her every Christmas. Annual carol services that she conducted were replete with all what was best. She organised Niger Minstrel and, in association with choral maestro Lylie Godridge, produced an amazing 1,000-voice choir. Today, many of her trained voices serve God in their own churches. She was a musician par excellence and a livewire of the YMCA/YWCA Movement. Trila was always cheerful and gentle, but task-oriented. We thank the Lord for a life well-spent!
She imparted her music to her three children and left behind a legacy for us to cherish. Rukshan and Melantha in particular, are stalwarts in the arena of Sri Lankan music, today.
Rukshan Perera just completed his 8th annual concert of original music at Bishops College Auditorium to a packed audience, Melantha launched the Riversheen School of Music in Moratuwa and is continuing the teachings where his mother left off, while the eldest, Prasantha, is a talented multi-instrumentalist who has been living in the US for decades.
Twenty years after her death, the memory of Trila lingers in our hearts. She is still an inspiration to many. We thank God that his earnest rewards are with her today.

Sivagamie Obeyesekere
Woman of vision
Sivagamie Verina Obeyesekere or Siva Obeyesekere as she is popularly known, was born to Amybelle Charlotte Valerie Corea and Lois Robert Clifton Dassenaike on May 7, 1929.Educated at CMS Ladies College up to the Senior School Certificate, Siva was a hostel prefect, games captain, and netball and tennis captain from 1943 to 1948. She married Senator James Peter Obeyesekere, the only child of Sir J. P. Obeyesekere and Lady A. E. Obeyesekere in 1948. James Obeyesekere, having schooled at Royal College, finished his education at Cambridge University and piloted his own airplane back to Ceylon in 1946. When S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike broke away from the UNP to form the SLFP in 1951, James and Siva were among the first to join him. James was the Member of Parliament for Attanagalle, Deputy Health Minister, Deputy Finance Minister and a Senator. The Obeyesekeres have two children, Peter and Chantal. Chantal, who has donned her parents mantle, currently works towards the developing indigenous arts and crafts and promoting local talent. Married to Dijen de Saram, they have two children, Dhevan and Chiara.
Siva Obeyesekere can be most appropriately referred to as the Lady with the Midas Touch. Being a woman of matchless vision, her sincerity of purpose and her boundless capacity for hard work and producing results brought her into the limelight. Behind every successful man, there is a woman, and needless to say, Siva was a force to be reckoned with, supporting James to the hilt. During 1960 to 1965, when James was Member of Parliament for Attanagalle, Siva organized community health programmes in 127 villages located in the Attanagalle electorate and actively began to develop handicraft and hand-loom centres as well. After bring appointed as Small Industries Board Chairman in 1961, she organized sewing centres and traditional crafts centres, reviving district cooperative unions in hand-loom textiles.
In 1963, she was appointed as Accommodation Committee Chairman and Tourist Development Council member, and was responsible for the drafting of the Tourist Development Act. In 1964, Siva inaugurated Laksala, the first government cottage industries emporium and was the Chairman of its Advisory Board. She established the Craftsmans Association of Sri Lanka and promoted the Master Craftsmans Apprenticeship Scheme.
Elected National Artisans and Craftsmans Association President in 1973, she inaugurated Lakpahana, a private sector organisation for the promotion of local handicrafts. In 1991, she was the first woman to be awarded the Deshamanya title for her services to the nation by President Ranasinghe Premadasa and was elected the first UNESCO World Crafts Council President and in 1996, was elected the first World Crafts Council Asia Pacific Region President. In 1993, she was the first foreigner to be awarded the Kamala Saamaan in memory of Kamala Devi Chattopadyayi of India, for the development of Laksala. In 2006, she was appointed as Rural Industries and Self-Employment Promotion Ministry National Consultant. She was also the Presidential Advisor to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
A founder member of the SLFP, she worked tirelessly for the party from the age of 22. A devout Christian, Siva Obeyesekere broke tradition by challenging the UNP at the parliamentary election in 1965 by contesting the Mirigama seat, which is a UNP stronghold dominated by a Buddhist population. Although her opponent underestimated the chances of this 36-year-old Christian winning, she beat the more experienced Wijayabahu Wijesinghe by an overwhelming majority.
In 1970, her opponent was Prof. W. S. Karunaratne who was an eloquent speaker. The crowds, in large numbers, came to see and hear Siva who was able to reach out to people with her brand of oratorical skills. She won the seat and almost immediately got down to nursing her electorate with determination to alleviate poverty.She was appointed Deputy Health Minister and later, Health Minister.
She introduced the National Family Health Programme which was adopted by the United Nations as an international model, and for this effort, she was given a special award of appreciation by Senator Edward Kennedy.
Between 1973 and 2003, Siva Obeyesekere represented Sri Lanka at several international conferences. In 1973, she was elected Status of Women in Family Planning Vice President in Jakarta and led the Sri Lankan delegation to the World Population Conference in Bucharest. In 1977, she led the Sri Lanka delegation to the World Health Organization in Geneva and was the first Asian woman to be elected vice president. From 1977 to 1987, she was a delegate representing Sri Lanka at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in Bangkok on population-related conferences and conferences relating to indigenous crafts in Japan, Austria, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. In 2009, she was appointed to the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation by President Rajapaksa.
In addition to her official commitments, Siva Obeyesekere was also a trustee of the Boys' Scout Movement and was intensely involved with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and as a past president, established branches in Kandy, Galle, Batticaloa, and Jaffna and also played an active part in the School for the Deaf and Blind, Wathupitiwela Home for the Elders, and The Attanagalla Childrens Home and was a popular fundraiser for educational institutions such as S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia and her alma mater, Ladies College, Colombo.

Jinasoma Weerasuriya
Phenomenal scholar
I humbly believe that my beloved father, late Jinasoma Weerasuriya, deserves some space in the national press to be appreciated for his invaluable service to the nation when mother Lanka was passing through the transitional period from the colonial rule to postmodern period of national independence. An administrative officer of high calibre he was, and his scholastic capabilities were in Sanskrit. My father epitomized both to the hilt and he put my two sisters and me on a high pedestal in life. His patriotism paved the way for him to serve the nation with a new vigour until he ceased to be on February 14, 2015.
His academic brilliance and administrative acumen were instrumental for his upward mobility in his chosen career path. The modern generation could emulate his professional success to reach the zenith of their professions by taking a leaf from his book. Thus, my write-up would serve a dual purpose; to reminisce the good work he rendered to the nation and to present my undying gratitude to him.
My father passed his Senior School Certificate in English medium in 1947. In 1954, he was able to earn a BA (Hons.) degree with a second class from the Ceylon University. His perseverance in academic pursuits was inscribed in his MA in Sanskrit from the Kelaniya University in 1969. His thesis for the degree, Sanskrit Lexicographical Literature, catered to the dire need of such studies in the sphere of oriental studies during that period.
His administrative service started after he passed the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Competitive Examination in English medium in 1970. His administrative capabilities enabled him to enter class 11 grade one effective from July 1, 1980. He then became a class one officer of this coveted service in 1990. His steady climb of the administrative service was coupled with many a training programme on his career progress and the successful completion of a two-year Land Settlement and Development Diploma conducted by the Colombo University was one of them. My father represented our country at the UN/APDC Regional Programme on New Trends in the Training of Development Administration held in New Delhi, India, in May, 1983. He enjoyed the rare opportunity of attending The Symposium on Productivity Measurement and Analysis in public services held in Chiang Mai, Thailand.
My fathers experience in the sphere of public administration deserves encomium. He became a full-fledged translator of the Official Language Department in 1957 and served till 1970. From 1970 to 1978, he served as Assistant Land Settlement Department Settlement Officer. On release from public service, he assumed duties as the National Youth Services Council Deputy Administration Director. After three years of service there, he held the post of Deputy Engineering Services Board Director until 1983. His next placement was Public Administration Ministry Deputy Combined Services Director. His impeccable service led him to be the Combined Services Director in 1988. The Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration greatly benefited from his administrative expertise.
When my father bade adieu to the public service, he was the SLIDA Administration Manager. His services did not end there; he became the consultant of the Salaries and Cadres Committee, which he held from 1996 to 1998. His language and administrative skills made him the Official Languages Department Translators Superintendent. He was the coordinating officer of the Apprentice Translators Training Project for a number of years. His teaching experience speaks volumes for his multi-disciplinary acumen of a fruitful life. He has served on the academic staff of both St. Joseph and Aquinas University College to his credit. He was selected to teach Sinhala to non-Sinhalese professionals, scholars, UN consultants, UNICEF personnel, diplomats and other officers in various grades. He was one of the few who were registered as language teachers at the US Embassy.
In addition to the many services he rendered to uplift the country, he was greatly sought after for essential services on short notice, for which he responded with courage and confidence. His service was catapulted to prominence when the country was going through dark periods. My father proved his mettle in every sphere he touched. I fail in my duty towards my father if I do not mention his invaluable service to dhamma education at the Sri Poorvarama Temple in Kirulapana and Sri Vajiragnana Dharmyatanaya in Maharagama. His genial personality and benign words still echo in these hallowed places of religious significance.
Above all, he was veritably a family man to the letter. Togetherness in the family amongst the spirit of a genuine father, has made us humble. His colossal figure in my memory bank enlivens me every minute. Our humble abode at Poorvarama Mawatha, Colombo 5, felt his loss and still mourns in silence. My mother late Harindrani Weerasuriya, who served on the tutorial staff at Royal College, was always the pillar of strength behind his fruitful life. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana at the end of the cycle of Sansara.

Arithmetic of LG polls
Local government election results point to a significant setback for the coalition government as a whole. Both the leading parties of the regime have suffered heavily, particularly in the Southern districts. The newly formed party under the de facto leadership of the former President, which functioned as a proxy for the traditional SLFP was able to capture much of its traditional voter base, forcing the official SLFP to a third place in most areas.
The above pattern of voting should not surprise anyone. 2015 electoral triumph of the coalition of the SLFP-UNP was essentially a victory of the liberally minded political forces that transcended ethno-religious and political party lines. Those who accepted the broad, liberal political agenda presented by the newly formed coalition led by common candidate, irrespective of their traditional party affiliations, could vote for it. Sixty two percent of the vote secured by the coalition Presidential candidate by and large represented the liberal voter base of the country.
The good governance agenda that was presented to the voters in 2015 represented a programme that substantially deviated from the policies pursued by the previous regime. Key elements of the new agenda included (a) rejection of corruption, fraud and abuse of power, (d) restoration of human and civil rights, (c) constitutional reforms to address the grievances of ethnic minorities, (d) strengthening of democracy and political accountability by creating effective oversight bodies to bring about depoliticisation of state institutions, (e) establishment of mechanisms to promote reconciliation and national integration and (f) the adoption of policies to reduce economic and social pressure on low income groups.
Political challenges ahead
The agenda clearly deviated from the policies and practices of the incumbent regime, in particular, the latters explicit ethno-nationalist orientation. The former regime that came to power at the height of the conflict mobilised nationalist forces to face the political challenges ahead, both from within and without. Once the war was concluded in 2009, the incumbent President emerged as an iconic figure commanding a large dedicated, Sinhala nationalist political base. His nationalist credentials became stronger over time when liberal political forces began to agitate for national reconciliation and other reforms.
The political and other developments following the end of the war need no elaboration here as these have been widely discussed. Suffice it to say that the demand on the part of liberally oriented groups to bring about a change in the way the country is governed became stronger. It is on the wave of growing popular support for political change that the present ruling coalition rode to power. In other words, the country was divided into two broad ideological camps.
The present President, being the Common Candidate then had to identify with the liberal camp and stood for political reforms. But, this situation began to change when the incumbent President became the leader of the SLFP. Given the long standing Sinhala-Buddhist credentials of the party and its followers, and the looming political threat posed by the former President, the newly elected President began to appease the Sinhala nationalist forces. Yet, it was not possible for him to convince the nationalists that he could represent their interests. This is what is evident from the recently concluded local government election results.
Another major factor that contributed to the decline in popularity of the coalition is the much talked about bond scam. The latter substantially undermined the good governance credentials of the UNP and the credibility of its leader. On the other hand, the growing divisions and in-fighting within the coalition no doubt frustrated many voters, persuading some of them to abstain from voting.
Economic and social issues
The failure of the government to manage the development process in a convincing manner no doubt made the situation worse. Despite the increasing complexity of economic and social issues in the country, those who are responsible for decision making continued to take ad hoc decisions leading to disastrous results. Increasing concentration of capital and labour in the services sector at the expense of agriculture and industry continued to distort the economy. The lack of a national plan for human resource development led to a chaotic situation with respect to labour. All these in turn prepared the ground for the rise of income and employment insecurity, inadequate social protection, exodus of skilled and unskilled labour and wage inflation in the country.
In the run up to the parliamentary elections in 2015, a large group of intellectuals congregated in Colombo to point out the need to rationalise the government machinery in order to ensure evidence based policy making in diverse sectors but political expediency prevented the leaders from adopting such an approach and this has eventually led to disastrous consequences in many sectors. Many examples to illustrate this point can be given. An obvious one is the increasingly chaotic situation on our roads.
An integrated transport system that gives priority to public transport while discouraging private transport would have reduced the number of private vehicles on the roads giving multiple benefits to the wider public. The lack of any interest on the part of our leaders in integrated development planning has resulted in similar or worse situations in many other areas such as education, health, energy and water.
Urban infrastructure projects
Much of the public and private investments continue to flow into urban infrastructure projects, further marginalising rural and estate areas where the living conditions and income opportunities lag far behind those in urban centres. No one has asked the question as to whether these are the priority areas of investment for a country where the productive sectors of the economy have been neglected for many years.
In other words, people could not witness a significant improvement in the way the economic and social issues were managed under the new regime. If no attempt is made to arrest this trend, the situation can only get worse over time, leading to disastrous consequences. In this regard, it is absolutely necessary for the leaders to go beyond a small circle of friends and acquaintances and mobilise expertise around important issues on a rational basis so that effective remedies to pressing problems can be found within a reasonable period of time. While the economy is key, social sectors are also important.
Among these, education is the most important because it has wide ranging implications for development, social justice, and national integration. This is an area where intellectual leadership is critical but is sadly lacking today. There is also an urgent need to improve on constitutional and institutional reforms already commenced with the 19th Amendment and other legislation.
In conclusion, it is necessary to point out that the country has reached a critical juncture in the difficult journey towards much desired sustainable and inclusive development, civility, human security and social justice.
Many people who have the voting rights do not necessarily seem to understand the need for progressive policies to guide the country forward, while many others are anxious to ensure that the leaders make every effort to go beyond their own whims and fancies, listen to rational voices and adopt evidence-based policies to deal with pressing issues in the country. It is hoped that the leaders rise above their parochial interests and live up to the expectations of the vast majority of people in the country.

The art of living
Vedanta is a philosophy that presents the eternal and universal principles of life and living founded by an eminent philosopher A. Parthasarathy, popularly known as Swamiji. It provides the technique to achieve success and peace in all aspects of life  official, social and domestic.
The Vedanta Institute Colombo disseminates the values of Vedanta to people of all walks of life. Umayal Venugopal speaks to daughter-disciple of Swami Parthasarathy, Sunandaji who will be delivering discourse series on the chapter XVIII of the Bhagavad Gita from March 2 to 6 on Vedanta the ancient philosophy of India.
* What is Vedanta
Vedanta is derived from two Sanskrit words veda and anta. Veda means knowledge and anta means end. Hence Vedanta literally means culmination of knowledge. The knowledge of ones real self.
Vedanta explains the true meaning and purpose of life - expounding eternal truths that do not change with time. People fail to understand that living is an art, a skill, a technique. If the principles are not learnt and implemented, life will be full of strife and struggle.
Vedanta is scientific in its approach. It trains one to think independently and not follow blind faith, superstitions and rituals. The philosophy shows the way to the state of human perfection which is enlightenment.
* What is the relevance of Bhagavad Gita in the modern world How does it help in day to day life
Bhagavad Gita is a manual for life. The message of the Bhagavad Gita is scientific and universal. It is referred to as Sanathana Dharma or Eternal Truths of life meant for entire humanity, irrespective of cast, creed, religion, race, gender or age. It establishes the existence of the highest Truth and prescribes different techniques to recognise it.
With this knowledge one is able to live a life of dynamism and peace. People often become helpless victims to challenges of the world incapable of dealing with situations.
They succumb to external pressures and stress. The knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita fortifies the human intellect with knowledge and prepares one to face and overcome any challenge in the world. Lead a stress-free and successful life.
* Can you tell us about Swami Parthasarathy and Vedanta Academy
My father and guru has been rendering service to humanity for over 60 years through four avenues:
1. Swamiji has authored 11 books, a product of extensive research for over 30 years.
2. He has been imparting the philosophy of Vedanta, the message of the Bhagavad Gita and their practical application in life to individuals and general public around the world.
3. His pioneering lifetime research has formulated Self-management courses for corporations worldwide. He has been acclaimed as one of the leading corporate gurus for international organisations and business schools.
4. In 1988 Swamiji founded the Vedanta Academy, which runs continual three-year residential courses to impart the knowledge of Vedanta to youngsters from India and abroad. At the academy students enquire, reflect, contemplate upon concepts and ideas presented through the various texts. Question and answer sessions are conducted daily to aid and develop the process of thinking. The students follow a schedule which begins at 4:15 am and concludes at 9 pm. The schedule is designed on the three traditional disciplines- Karma Yoga: Path of action, Bhakti Yoga: Path of Devotion and Jnana Yoga: Path of Knowledge.
* Swamiji has written many books. What book do you recommend to a person who just begins to pursue the spiritual path
It is essential to cover a minimum of the following four books in the given order: The Fall of the Human Intellect, Governing Business and Relationships, The Holocaust of Attachment, and Vedanta Treatise: The Eternities. These books would prepare ones inner personality and help face the challenges of the world. The knowledge also leads one to the ultimate state of human perfection. The best time to study this literature is in the early hours of the morning, ideally between 4 and 6 am or as close to this time as possible.
* After completing the three years Diploma in Vedanta course, what do the students do Can they go back and pursue their interest i.e. study/work or do they have to stay at the Vedanta Academy
The academy course is designed for three years. After the completion of the course, students may opt for continuing their interest in Vedanta by serving the cause either in India or any place abroad. A few choose to pursue their interests in the world.
* How often do you come to Sri Lanka What are the activities you do in Sri Lanka How are you planning to promote Vedanta in Sri Lanka in future
Swamiji has been visiting Sri Lanka annually since the 70s to conduct lecture series on the Bhagavad Gita for the general public. Since 2002 I have been carrying on with the same work on the island.
Every year one chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is presented to the public. Accordingly, it would take about 18 years to complete the entire Bhagavad Gita.
People of different ages, particularly the youth, who have been following these lecture series could further help themselves by studying the recommended books.
In addition, they now have the option of the Vedanta E-learning course through a structured course on Vedanta philosophy comprising video lectures and question and answer sessions by Swamiji. For more details visit elearning.vedantaworld.org

## Title: Call for release of MMDA report

Call for release of MMDA report
The long-awaited report by the Justice Saleem Marsoof (JSM) Committee that was set up to consider and propose reforms to the Muslim personal law and Quazi Courts System delivered its report to the appointing authority, the Minister of Justice, on January 22, 2018.
This labour on reforms to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) has taken nine long years. It is somewhat akin to a complicated and arduous delivery of a baby. There are claims that what has in fact been delivered are twins. Although consensus has been reached on a broad range of issues, the committee was unable to reach consensus on all aspects where reform is needed. The result is different sets of recommendations in relation to such issues. The Minister has not made this report public yet. This has left many groping in the dark.
Hilmy Ahamed, writing on the subject in his article Long Awaited MMDA Report, a Faade, has accused Justice Marsoof of miserably failing to negotiate a consensus. Responding to another article by Ibn-al-Rushd titled Make the MMDA Report Public  A Response to Hilmy Ahamad, Ahamed has, himself, claimed some credit for what he describes as a much improved document that was dated and produced on December 21, 2017, by what he refers to as the majority group in which agreement was reached on some contentious issues. However, he complains that the Chairperson of the JSM Committee had already made up his mind on what should be said in the report and hence had no interest in studying the so-called improved version.
Prior to that, the Minister of Justice had called a meeting to sign the JSM Committee report the previous day, December 20. That meeting was not attended by seven of the members who are said to have signed the differing set of recommendations. The Report is said to contain a narrative of the events that led to the circumstances that made it virtually impossible for the whole committee to arrive at a consensus.
In her article Are Muslim Men Against Equality, which is written more objectively, Rizani Hamin poses the question as to whether Muslim men are against equality. Obviously some certainly are! Hamin likens the debate surrounding the MMDA in Sri Lanka to the debates around issues involving Muslim women globally: a gender war.
Contrary to her own assurances and undertakings at the meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Women and Gender chaired by Dr. Thusitha Wijemanna, Member of Parliament, held on December 6, 2017, at Parliament, the news media (see Thalatha gets Marsoof Committee report" in the Ceylon Today of January 23, 2018) have reported that the Minister of Justice is considering not publishing the report until it is forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers and discussed in Parliament.
Rather than follow the proverbial blind men inspecting an elephant, I spoke to a few members of the Committee themselves. This confirmed my belief that the Chair of the Committee and the members had been working hard towards consensus and were almost there when, in October 2016, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal by the former Minister of Justice, Dr. Wijeyedasa Rajapakshe, to appoint a Cabinet sub-committee to make proposals on amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, which allows girls under the age of 18 to be married. Whilst some, including the All Ceylon Jamiayathul Ulema (ACJU) welcomed the proposal, some including the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ) protested. However, the government wisely decided to await the Justice Marsoof Committee report.
Hidden Hands
It is learnt that with its politicisation since October 2016, the Marsoof Committee got into turmoil. The consensus that had emerged prior to October 2016 was disrupted by what a member of the Committee described as hidden hands. This apparently led the Chair to ask the president of the ACJU, M.I.M Rizwe, who himself was a member of the MMDA Committee and who was also considered to have contributed to the delay in finalising the report, to host meetings of the Committee at ACJUs auditorium. On a proposal by the said Rizwe, a small committee within the JSM Committee was apparently appointed to discuss issues and try to reach consensus. Despite meeting thrice nothing positive has emerged from them.
It is learnt that a meeting of the MMDA Committee scheduled for September 17, 2017, had to be postponed as certain members claiming to be the majority group failed to attend. Instead, they emailed a document containing their views that morning. But on November 26, the meeting had to be again adjourned as a report containing a majority opinion had been brought by M.I.M Rizwe whilst the other signatories to that opinion kept away from the meeting making meaningful discussion impossible. Hence, members present had decided to meet on December 20 for purpose of signing the Report whilst resolving to endeavour to reach consensus in the interim. However, on December 19, the said Rizwe had informed the Chairperson by email that a signed majority' report would be sent to him by noon on December 21.
Thus, it appears that some members of the JSM Committee turned out as scheduled on December 20 and signed a report dated December 20 and those who did not turn up for that meeting signed their own set of recommendations the day after, on December 21. Although claims of a majority have been made, in fact the committee has been evenly divided. Two sets of recommendations have been signed by nine members each.
This is perhaps how the Report submitted to the Minister of Justice by the Chairperson has come to consist of two sets of recommendations, one dated December 20 and the other December 21.
If the above chronology is correct, it would seem unkind to state that the Chairman of the MMDA Committee, the respected Justice Marsoof, either failed to attempt at arriving a consensus or didnt bother to read an alternate opinion or had made his mind up on his own. On the contrary, the claim that those amongst the committee who did not want to agree to certain reforms that are in line with Shariah and Fiqh may not have had the courage of their convictions to meet as agreed to discuss different opinions in the open within the committee, may hold water. Needless to mention, we Sri Lankans have enough experience to know very well that majority is not necessarily always correct. Since the Committee is divided on certain proposals, the best course of action would be to make them public to enable a broad discussion. Based on that, an informed decision could be made.
Shariah and fiqh
It is also interesting, if not ironical, that those who claim to follow the Shariah principles in letter and word take pains to emphasise the majority. In the Islamic tradition and system, the decision is made by the Ameer (the chair in this case) who has only to consult (Mashoora), but his decision, even if he is the sole attributor with a preponderant majority differing from him, prevails and everyone accepts without dissent. Maybe the principle of Mashoora and adhering to the decision of an Ameer can go fly a kite when it comes to interpreting Shariah, fiqh, and so on for self-serving purposes by men claiming to be (un)holy!
It is pertinent to reflect on the divide in the way Muslims approach the interpretation of the Holy Quran and Sunna. The Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1959) averred in paragraph 54 of its report to this divide as follows:
There was one extreme point of view advanced by witnesses that the Quran establishes an exhaustive religious code of conduct for all time which no Muslim or other person has the right to amend in even the slightest degree. There were others who maintained, with equal reverence to the Quran, that considerable reforms of the law were possible within the very framework of the Shariat.
This apparent conflict of opinion may be easily dispelled by a better understanding of the concept of Shariah and its divine origins, and the dynamism of the principles of fiqh, which has been developed by jurists including great Imams such as Imam Shaffei and Imam Abu Haniffa.The word shariah, literally meaning the way to God, is generally used to refer to the body of Islamic canonical law based on the teachings of the Holy Quran and the traditions of the Holy Prophet (Hadith and Sunna), prescribing both religious and secular duties and sanctions to deal with lawbreaking.
The term fiqh which literally means deep understanding or full comprehension, refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources and constitutes an important aspect of the Shariah. It is this body of law that is referred to as the Muslim law in various provisions of the Sri Lankan MMDA. It is necessary to stress that progressive reform of the law is possible within the very framework of the shariah owing to the dynamic nature of Islamic fiqh and the methodology of ijtihad, which is known as usul al-fiqh. They certainly do not oppress and/or discriminate against women.
It must be emphasised that the JSM Committees work could not have been easy in view of the complexities of the issues involved and the diversity of opinion held by members of the community and the committee itself. Nevertheless, as these issues affect the very life of all men, women and children over whom the MMDA has jurisdiction, they have to be considered in great depth from both the shariah and pragmatic perspectives.
The work done by the committee and which resulted in its report of December 20, thankfully, resolved most of the differences of opinion. For that and for having diligently worked for so long and, more importantly, for having reached agreement on a set of recommendations, whether it be by majority, evenly divided or otherwise  the men and women in the committee and indeed the Chair need to be applauded and thanked.
It is now left to the Minister of Justice to take the Committees Report to its logical fruition. This would include making it public, so as to afford an opportunity for discussion among society at large, as expeditiously as possible. Reforms to the MMDA are five decades overdue.
As has been said by many and umpteen times, the MMDA contains many provisions that are discriminatory and inconsistent with the Islamic concepts of justice and equality. Litigants who had to invoke the jurisdiction of Quazi courts have suffered in silence for nearly seven decades and it is indeed satisfying to learn that the recommendations of the JSM Committee are said to be both comprehensive and shariah compliant. The recommendations are said to include upgrading Quazi courts and the Board of Quazis by making all Quazis full-time judicial officers. They address knotty issues of substantive law arising from the description of the applicable Muslim law as governing the sect to which the parties belong. They fix a minimum age of marriage and provide for pre-marital counselling, for the bride to sign the marriage register and for registering the terms of any marriage contract. Solemnisation and registration of a second or subsequent marriage to adhere to shariah requirements too are said to have been dealt with.
However, most notably, consensus seems to have eluded the Committee regarding the appointment of women Quazis and representative appearance in Quazi courts, which women regard as essential for the protection of their rights and which are necessary to avoid miscarriages of justice.
Justice Marsoof and the members of his Committee deserve to be congratulated in making much progress to a very great extent in difficult times and circumstances. Yet, whether they have successfully crossed what some would call a gender divide or not can only be ascertained once the report is made public.
It is also incumbent on the members of the committee, who are considered to be erudite and learned, to make their views, justifications and recommendations contained in the report public. This will afford them opportunities to explain their convictions, be transparent and quash unnecessary groping in the dark resulting in warped speculations.
If they, or anyone of them, are pressuring the Minister not to make the report public, this would be an admission on their part that their opinions and recommendations are not only not Shariah compliant, but also cannot be defended in public. The MMDA is a vital matter of public importance that should not be mired or mystified by self-serving calls garbed under the false pretexts of emotional religious rights and identity manifestations claiming special laws and treatment that would only drive the community to exclusion, chauvinistic regression and backwardness. The Muslim community as a whole needs to be clear that it wishes to be enlightened, adhere to Islamic jurisprudence on social justice, equality and pluralism and be compatible citizens of a pluralist democratic country whose Constitution aims at equality, freedom, protection and autonomy for all.

Cardiff pounce on Aston Villa defeat in promotion push
LONDON, Saturday: Cardiff City moved into the Championship top two on Saturday as Wolves and Aston Villas promotion push stumbled.
Sean Morrisons solitary strike was enough to give Cardiff a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough to leapfrog Villa, who lost 2-0 at Fulham.
Wolves remain 11 points clear at the top, but failed to cash in on a man advantage for the final half hour in a 1-1 draw at Preston.
Villa had won seven league games in a row to storm into contention for automatic promotion prior to their visit to Craven Cottage.
However, Fulham are another of the divisions form teams and consolidated their place in the playoffs, six points off Cardiff, with a dominant second-half display. England youth international Ryan Sessegnon opened the scoring with his 12th goal of the season and Floyd Ayite made the points safe 19 minutes from time when he fired into an unguarded goal from just over the halfway line after a botched clearance by Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone.
Cardiff took full advantage in the Welsh capital as defeat further damaged ninth-placed Middlesbroughs playoff chances.
Preston are just two points off the top six in seventh and briefly looked like they could inflict just Wolves fifth league defeat of the season at Deepdale.
Alan Brownes towering header put the hosts into the lead seven minutes into the second-half but Prestons joy was short-lived as John Welsh picked up a second yellow card on the hour mark.
Just two minutes later, Helder Costa levelled for Wolves, but Nuno Espirito Santos men failed to find a winner as Preston held on for a valuable point.
At the bottom, Sunderland slipped closer towards a second consecutive relegation as Brentford ran out comfortable 2-0 winners at the Stadium of Light through first-half goals from Kamohelo Mokotjo and Neal Maupay.
Burton Albion are now just below Sunderland on goal difference at the foot of the table, but will rue a missed opportunity as they failed to break down a Nottingham Forest side down to 10 men for over an hour following Eric Lichajs red card in a 0-0 draw. - AFP

Challenges before CMC
Colombo is the countrys biggest city, with a permanent population of over 600,000 and a transient population of more than one million. Though no longer the administrative capital, it is still the commercial capital where the local economy takes shape. Colombo is almost a city state at 37 Sq Km, with a growth rate that exceeds the rest of the country put together.
Colombo needs an efficient administrative machinery to run smoothly. This is the task of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), established in 1865. It is naturally the countrys biggest local body with earnings and resources that other local bodies cannot match. The position of Mayor of Colombo is a very significant one in this context.
Colombo had had illustrious Mayors who have gone to achieve even higher positions in the countrys political and governance structure. Among these men were R. Saravanamuttu, A.E. Goonesinghe, R.A. de Mel, Dr. Kumaran Ratnam, Dr. N.M. Perera, V.A. Sugathadasa, M.H. Mohamed, Vincent Perera, Jabir A. Cader, A.H.M. Fowzie, Sirisena Cooray, Hussain Mohamed, Ratnasiri Rajapakse and Karu Jayasuriya (the present Speaker of Parliament). If you noticed the word men in that sentence, it is there with a purpose  no woman has ever become the Mayor (Mayoress, rather) of Colombo. Until now, that is.
That glass ceiling was shattered on February 10 as Rosy Senanayake was voted in as the first woman mayor-elect of Colombo. An experienced politician and a steadfast campaigner for womens rights, Senanayake has what it takes to become an exceptionally capable mayor for Colombo. She will no doubt use this peoples mandate to do the right thing(s) for Colombo, which faces plenty of problems and challenges.
The biggest challenge facing Colombo has always been garbage disposal. Disposing 800 tons of solid and semi-solid waste a day is not an easy task by any means. A temporary solution has been found, but the incoming mayor must focus on this problem to find a more sustainable solution  perhaps the garbage can be used to generate power or turn out other materials. In the meantime, the public should be educated on the significance of reducing waste and the 3Rs  Reduce, Recycle and Re-Use.
The Mayor will also have to address Colombos traffic woes. Many roads in Colombo are heavily congested at any given time, leading to a massive loss of fuel, man-hours and time. The CMC, together with the Road Development Authority and the Megapolis Ministry, must identify traffic-choked roads and take appropriate steps. The new Mayor must also assemble a team to study the one-way roads in Colombo, which only help to waste more fuel and inconvenience bus commuters. These were introduced apparently for the protection of certain VIPs of the former regime and serve no useful purpose now. There should be a bigger focus on public transport, with preliminary work on the Light rail Transit project starting this year. Colombo should also get the lions share of the electric car charging stations due to be installed by the Government.
Police must be instructed not to interfere with the traffic lights at rush hours. This creates mile-long traffic in every direction. Just let the lights do their work. There are still a few junctions where traffic lights have not been installed  the new Mayor should look into this and take appropriate action. The CMC must clearly mark on-street parking spaces and No Parking areas  as per a Court decision, this power is vested solely in local Government bodies and not the Police. More parking spaces should be created where appropriate and possible.
Housing is another matter that requires urgent attention. Despite many attempts by various governments to re-house slum dwellers, slums still exist in Colombo. The mayor should address this problem in collaboration with the Provincial Council and relevant line ministries.
One can see construction cranes almost everywhere in Colombo. Colombos skyline will look different just three years from now, thanks to the array of new hotels, apartment complexes and other buildings now coming up. But these present many infrastructure challenges such as sewerage, energy, water supply, garbage disposal and traffic/parking. This calls for an integrated approach to face these problems. The CMC should also insist on a renewable energy component for all new buildings and residences coming up within city limits, along with other measures such as rainwater harvesting.
There have been calls to expand Colombo City beyond its current 1-15 zones and borders. There is some merit in this proposal as Colombo is getting congested in every possible way  people, traffic, buildings etc. However, this proposal will necessarily be a controversial one since neighbouring local bodies may see it as an intrusion that dilutes their identity. The Government and the CMC should study this suggestion further before taking any action.
The ratepayer is the heart and soul of any local body. Rosy with her long years of experience will no doubt make their interactions with the CMC a pleasing experience. An efficient CMC that always puts the ratepayer first will be an example for all other local bodies to follow.

More trains needed on Negombo Colombo route
Thousands of passengers travel by train daily to work places from Negombo to Colombo during the rush hours between 6.30 a.m. to 8 a.m. and between 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the evening.
Even though three trains are running, due to increasing number of commuters, these trains are inadequate to meet the demand. It is pathetic and very risky since the passengers and students who follow higher studies have to travel on the footboard to reach Colombo early as possible. Due to severe traffic congestion between Wattala and Colombo the bus commuters too travel by train.
This situation has worsened due to the absence of 7.26 Bangadeniya train. The passengers are unable to travel by some other modes of transport due to their inadequate monthly income and other expenditures. The situation is no better in the evening too.
Transport Minister, we would be much grateful to you if you could deploy a few more trains along Colombo Negombo route, in the morning and evening too. It would bring great relief to all.

CSSL offers support for tech startups  to empower Sri Lankas ICT industry
Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has announced that they are offering support and resources for Tech Startups as a new initiative. The Resource Center which is within their existing office in Colombo 7 will help to uplift Sri Lankas IT Tech Startup arena to greater heights and offer talented and interested individuals the resources they need in order to pursue their new business ideas.
Established in 1976 by a group of dedicated professionals, CSSL was established to promote information and communications technology and throughout the course of over four decades in the industry, CSSL has risen as a stalwart pillar in the information and communication technology fraternity in Sri Lanka.
Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama
The resource center is particularly aimed at ICT tech startups and CSSL has put forward this initiative to make Sri Lanka a strong platform for tech startups and for technology talent. Speaking more on this, Yasas V. Abeywickrama, the President of CSSL explained, While there is a lot of talent in our country, Sri Lanka is unfortunately lagging behind in the race of innovation while other countries have played to their advantages. This is why we want to provide the platform and set the stage to uplift Sri Lankas IT industry to greater heights and unleash the potential of our talented young people.
CSSLs Tech Startup Resource Center will provide facilities such as the board room to conduct meetings, facilities to interview staff, well equipped training centers, facilities for distinguished client meetings, and workstation space. Added benefits at the center include refreshment services, washrooms and parking space.
The CSSL will also connect experts from its membership with IT entrepreneurs where requested for expert guidance on technology related matters. Speaking more on the initiative, Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama stated, This new center resonates CSSLs passion for driving development of the IT industry in Sri Lanka.
We understand that great ideas and talents come from collaborative work and we are confident that this new center as well as expert guidance from our membership will push the boundaries and open up a world of possibilities for the next generation technology and services. With the establishment of this new IT resource center, more IT professionals will gain access to resources that are essential when starting a new technology business.
The focus of CSSL with this initiative is to make Sri Lanka a world leader for technology innovation and while its early days as yet, Abeywickrama believes that this resource center can set the foundation to build a strong tech companies in the long run.
We are in desperate need for innovative business that can go to global level but we feel that those young entrepreneurs do not have access to basic facilities and resources at affordable prices.
This is why we believe that CSSLs Tech Startup Resource Center could be the stepping-stone for their success and we eagerly look forward to the prospects this initiative will offer to both, the IT industry in Sri Lanka and to all members who are involved in it, both presently and also in the future, he concluded.

England win battle, but Munro ensures New Zealand win the war
Hamilton: An aggressive Colin Munro belted New Zealand into the Twenty20 tri-series final against Australia despite England claiming their final round-robin match by two runs in Hamilton on Sunday.
Munro plundered the England attack at the top of the New Zealand innings, equalling the sixth-fastest half-century of all time in cricket's shortest form as he raced past 50 in just 18 deliveries.
England, on the back of an unbeaten 80 by returning captain Eoin Morgan, posted 194 for seven after being sent into bat.
New Zealand, with Martin Guptill adding 62 and Hong Kong-born Mark Chapman unbeaten on 37, made 192 for four in reply.
The narrow two-run winning margin was a bittersweet result for Morgan.
It provided a confidence-boosting first win in the series but England needed to win by 20 runs to overtake New Zealand on overall run-rate to face unbeaten Australia in Wednesday's final.
New Zealand passed that target at the start of the 18th over but the groundwork had been laid by opener Munro's whirlwind 57 in a big-hitting innings that included seven sixes and three fours.
"Not that good," Morgan said when asked how he felt.
"Given the start they got off to, with Colin Munro and Martin Guptill in that sort of form, there's a bit of dew around, the ball skidding on, it was quite difficult for our attack," he added.
"We played our best game today. Good enough to win the game but not good enough to go through to the final. We just haven't been good enough throughout this T20 campaign."
After New Zealand's rollicking start, England spinners Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson quietened the pace through the middle of the innings.
New Zealand were 77 without loss after six overs when Rashid came on and quickly claimed Munro's wicket.
Seven overs later, when Rashid was bowled out and Dawson had claimed the prized wicket of Kane Williamson, New Zealand were 108 for two with Guptill and Chapman primed to finish the innings off.
"At the top of the order, Colin Munro was brilliant," said Williamson, who also played tribute to the role played by Guptill, a century-maker gainst Australia two days ago.
"Martin played so well through that middle period to suck it up after whacking it to all parts a few days ago, to do what the team required to get as close as we could to that total."
Dawson missed a caught-and-bowled chance from Guptill on 25, who then lashed out to reach 62 off 47 balls before he was dismissed in the 17th over.
England skipper Morgan, who missed their last two matches because of a groin strain, hit six sixes and four fours in a crucial innings that ensured his side posted a competitive score.
He went to the middle in the fourth over when England were two for 24 and featured in a 93-run, nine-over stand with Dawid Malan who made 53 -- his fourth half-century in five international Twenty20 innings.
Opener Jason Roy made a flying start to the innings with 21 off 13 balls, while Dawson and David Willey with 10 each were the only other players to reach double figures.
For New Zealand, Trent Boult took three wickets at an expensive 50 runs while Tim Southee was economical with two for 22. AFP

Exclusively for ladies
Shes Mercedes, is a platform dedicated to inspiring, connecting, and empowering women globally to unleash their full potential. To introduce this unique platform to the empowered ladies of Sri Lanka, the first ever Sri Lankan Shes Mercedes event, organized by DIMO, was held recently at DIMO 800  Mercedes-Benz Centre of Excellence.
An intimate evening of stimulating conversation, indulgence, and cocktails was held exclusively for the ladies. Concluding with an enjoyable dinner, the networking event provided an ideal opportunity for guests to reflect upon the hard-hitting and impactful nature of the Shes Mercedes movement.
Shattering gender stereotypes across the world, Shes Mercedes is an inspiration circle and a hub where empowered women of varying interests meet to exchange ideas, share experiences, and spark conversation.
Indeed, the history of Mercedes-Benz demonstrates that it is no stranger to the powerful influence of inspiring women. In 1888, Bertha Benz, a German automotive pioneer, business partner and wife of automobile inventor Karl Benz, undertook the first long-distance journey in the early days of the car. Channeling her spirit, Shes Mercedes is devoted to inspiring and emphasizing the modern idea that the female clientele of Mercedes-Benz has unlimited choices, free of the constraints of gender-stereotyping.
Nothing about a car categorizes it as a mans or a womans. It is an individual choice. I think Mercedes understands this better than any other, considering the inspiration that the company has drawn from women over the years. This event is not intended to launch an exclusive car for ladies, but to celebrate women and invite them to view our entire range of cars, Dilrukshi Kurukulasuriya, Chief Human Resources Officer at DIMO PLC, states in a press release.
Shes Mercedes tackles gender-stereotypes in a brilliantly unique and exceptional manner, employing a mix of several formats, such as intimate portraits, home stories, and interviews. Strong and successful women from various fields and industries provide personal insights by delving into topics related to both business and private life, and impart fresh new perspectives on life. To date, the series has featured remarkable personalities and dynamic individuals such as the model, actress, and activist, Amber Valletta, the founder of Blogilates, Cassey Ho, and inspiring mathematician, Anne-Marie Imafidon. These pioneers are dedicated to pushing the boundaries.
The elegant evening hosted exclusively to inspire, connect and empower women and successfully introduce the Shes Mercedes platform will undoubtedly aid in shattering the cycle of gender-typecasting in Sri Lanka. This enriching experience was merely a stepping stone for more engaging activities to follow. Indeed, the idea of a successful woman in a Mercedes car will certainly remain familiar.

Federer on top of the world and into Rotterdam final
ROTTERDAM, Saturday: Roger Federer celebrated becoming the oldest man to reach the world number one ranking by making the Rotterdam Open final on Saturday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) victory over Italys Andreas Seppi despite losing sleep watching early-morning coverage of the Winter Olympics.
The 36-year-old Federer racked up his 14th win from 15 matches with 33-year-old Seppi, the world number 81 who had enjoyed a memorable week in the Dutch port city by reaching the semi-finals as a lucky loser.
Top-seeded Federer will face Grigor Dimitrov in the final.
Dimitrov, the second seed, advanced to the semi-finals when Belgian opponent David Goffin was forced to retire after injuring his eye when the ball flew off his own racquet.
Dimitrov was leading 6-3, 0-1 at the time.
Federer said that despite not getting much sleep due to the excitement of his latest achievement -- and draining more energy by watching the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the pre-dawn hours -- he expects to be fighting fit for his Sunday showdown which could result in a 97th career trophy.
I felt OK today, maybe a bit heavy on court but I was aggressive, the 20-time Grand Slam title winner said.
I started finding energy midway through the first set, but the start was tough.
The two-time Rotterdam champion, who guaranteed a return to the world top spot by seeing off Robin Haase in the quarter-finals on Friday, added that he will be ready to go for his first afternoon match of the week after playing the night showcase slots.
Im good, its not been a tough week physically, maybe a bit harder emotionally, he added.
I hope to play one more good match and thats it for the week.
Federer also dropped a big hint that he still might play the Dubai tournament, which begins a week from Monday.
The seven-time winner of the Gulf tournament said that he will take a decision later in the week one way or the other.
Its still open, he said.
Despite enjoying a 6-0 career stranglehold over Dimitrov, with their last meeting in the 2017 Wimbledon fourth round, the top seed will not take anything for granted on Sunday.
I know him very well, he had an incredible year last season, winning London (the World Tour Finals) and Cincinnati. Hes beaten some good players and started this year solid.
This has to be a week where he wants to win this tournament. Ill try my best and hope its enough, said Federer. - AFP

The 50 recruits are entitled to a monthly salary of Rs. 40,000 in addition to many other privileges. They are provided with meals, transport, medicine and pension rights in the Army on retirement.
Their family members including parents have access to Army medical facilities depending on their marital status.
They were deployed basically on the Army farm in the Palaly Army Cantonment where a massive coconut cultivation project is now underway to grow 100,000 coconut trees to be in parallel with the ongoing national drive for tree planting. By early this week, the SFHQ-J has planted 8,000 coconut saplings inside the farm.
On Thursday (15), a simple ceremony welcomed the 50 new recruits at the SFHQ-J Headquarters on the first day of working. The SF-J Commander underlined the importance of the employments and the service expected of them to the Army during their eight hours of stay on the farm.
He also appealed the young men and women to work with commitment as Sri Lankan nationals of one family while taking care of their own future. Commander, SF-J, Colonel General Staff, SFHQ-J and the Officer in Charge of the Army Farm, Palaly were present.

The Fine Art of Falling to Pieces
Once upon a time I was falling in love, But now Im only falling apart. Bonnie Tyler, Total Eclipse of the Heart
What happens to a woman alone This question, though in theory settled by experiencethey muddle on much like anybody elseis one we cant seem to quite let go of. Books are written in defense of the single womans experience (against whom, its not quite clear), in praise of their revolutionary potential (for whom, its not quite clear). Even if in the real world, such a person no longer raises anyones eyebrow, that woman, in literary terms, is question.
Anyway, the answer isshe falls apart. Going entirely to pieces is an option available to anyone, but in fiction its usually the prerogative of women. Men might run into grand existential dilemmas, but they resolve it by, for instance, killing their pawnbroker. If, on the other hand, you do little but sleep and drink, you are likely to be a woman. How far one can let oneself go, when one is entirely alone and shut in! wonders the wife in Simone de Beauvoirs The Woman Destroyed after her husband has left her to vacation with his mistress. Later, when she realizes he has truly left her, she writes:
Utterly paralyzed
Now I am a dead woman. A dead woman who still has years to drag outhow many Even a single day, when I open my eyes in the morning, seems to me something whose end I can never possibly reach. In my bath yesterday the mere act of lifting my arm faced me with a problemwhy lift an arm: why put one foot in front of another When I am by myself I stand there motionless for minutes on end at the edge of the pavement, utterly paralyzed.
At the end of the story, the woman prepares to re-enter her empty house with dread. She has nothing but the empty and unstructured prospect of her future before her, from which she cannot be saved, and which she cannot bear. Her life was supposed to be overshe had moved through courtship, marriage, and childrenbut in destroying her, her husband has given her life again. The trouble is, she doesnt want it.
Courtship, marriage, and children is a story. But a solitary personwhat kind of story can she have Shes shapeless; her life is a problem for her. She has to keep on putting one foot in front of the other. Other people get bored of hearing how her husband left her, and even she gets bored. Though the womans been destroyed, shell have to go on living in the ashes of her feeling. Her life is a problem for her. But why women In real life, to be undone by romantic loss is not peculiarly female. Women who do nothing cannot bear those who work, the husband in de Beauvoirs story tells his wife, and perhaps work is part of the answer. For his wife, work was merely the prelude to the actual story of her life, which began and ended with him. Her life exists to support his. Without that, shes nothingand nothing is what she becomes.
Boiling water
But a solitary personwhat kind of story can she have Shes shapeless; her life is a problem for her.
The premiere artist of the crack-up isnt Simone de Beauvoir, however. Its Jean Rhys, a woman who herself was almost incapable of boiling water, whose posthumous reputation has languished in the foyer of the canon without ever being admitted all the way inside. Too admired to be underrated, too consistently remembered to be forgotten, but with a reputation too slim to be firmly and solidly recognized, she lingers and will continue to linger at the threshold of respectability, talented and beautiful and yet curiously helpless. Shed like you to rescue her, but enjoys knowing she cant be saved.
Rhyss women were never specimens of health in the first place, but by the time we meet them, theyve lost their men, so they might as well be dead. To be so abandoned is a failure of being; their role is essentially parasiticalthey need to be cared for by a man. So they disintegrate, exquisitely, falling to lower and lower depths, shabbier and shabbier hotels. Rhys and her novels inspire two reactions. One is over-identification. In Flaneuse, Lauren Elkin recalls teaching Rhyss Good Morning, Midnight to her students, only to be confronted by the school psychologist:
Youre the culprit! she said. Youre the one who taught Jean Rhys last week. Yes, I said warily. Why I had four of your students come to see me, totally shattered by that book! A couple of those students came to my office hours. One was the most dynamic person in the class, a Gallatin student who had so identified with the book that he waved it in the air and declared: I am Jean Rhys! He was having a tough time romantically, and was worried that there was nothing he could do to be happy again.

Hathurusingha says B'desh knowledge helped team
SYLHET, Saturday - Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusingha said on Saturday his inside knowledge of Bangladesh helped his side come out on top in all three new formats.
Hathurusingha coached Bangladesh for more than three years before he quit in October to join his struggling home team. He faced his former charges in his very first series as Sri Lankan coach, guiding the visiting side to success in all three formats of the game so far.
Sri Lanka started the tri-nation one-day international tournament in January poorly, losing their first two matches to Zimbabwe and Bangladesh respectively before they came back strongly to reach the final.
They won the final comfortably by 79-runs and then dominated the hosts in a two Test series, winning it 1-0 in earlier this month. Sri Lanka also won Thursday's first Twenty20 international, overcoming Bangladeshs record score of 193-5 with relative ease to take a 1-0 lead in the two match series. The win in the first Twenty20 international also snapped Sri Lanka's eight-match losing streak, spanning nearly a year.
I think yes, to be honest, Hathurusingha said when asked if his Bangladesh knowledge had made the difference.
We had some strategic plans for some of the players. We knew how they would react under pressure, he said. Hathurusingha added: All in all, it was a satisfying tour for me personally.  AFP

Asma Jehangir
An icon of courage and wisdom
The news of the passing away of Asma Jehangir in Lahore at the age of 66 came as a shock having got to know her in 1988 when she famously sent us a telegram asking for Election Observers for elections scheduled for the National Assembly after Gen Zia died in an air crash.
A towering figure
She was called to the Lahore High Court in 1980 and to the Supreme Court in 1982. She later went on to become the first woman to serve as president of the Supreme Court Bar Association. She became a pro-democracy activist and was jailed in 1983 for participating in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, which agitated against military dictator Zia-ul-Haqs regime. She was also active in the 2007 Lawyers Movement, for which she was put under house arrest.
She co-founded the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and the Womens Action Forum. She received several awards, including a Hilal-i-Imtiaz in 2010 and a Sitara-i-Imtiaz. She was also awarded a UNESCO/Bilbao Prize for the Promotion of a Culture of Human Rights and an Officier de la Lgiondhonneur by France. She also received the 2014 Right Livelihood Award and the 2010 Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee. The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Mian SaqibNisar, and other Supreme Court judges expressed deep sorrow and grief on her demise in a statement. The Pakistan Bar Council announced three days of mourning across the country.
We had known each other for close on three decades. She leaves behind a shocked group of colleagues at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. She followed in the footsteps of an equally famous mentor Dorab Framrose Patel lawmaker who served as a former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Pakistan and former Chief Justice of Sindh High Court.
Justice Patel was a prominent campaigner for the human rights, and was a founding member of the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) in 1987 and the co-founder of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. A Parsee by faith, he rose up the ranks of the judiciary to become one of Pakistans most senior most judges, only to resign on principle after refusing to take an oath of allegiance to Chief Martial Law Administrator and Chief of Army Staff at that time, General Zia-ul-Haq in 1981. He was an acquaintance for whom I had the highest respect.
Much has been written and said about her. I could only add she knew no fear.
As a result of our association with Asma, a renaissance around Track two work in South Asia began. It led amongst others to work with I.K. Gujral.
The Gujral doctrine
The Gujral Doctrine is a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with Indias immediate neighbours as spelt out by I.K. Gujral, first as Indias foreign minister and later as the prime minister. Among other factors, these five principles arise from the belief that Indias stature and strength cannot be divorced from the quality of its relations with its neighbours. These principles are: first, with neighbours like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, India does not ask for reciprocity, but gives and accommodates what it can in good faith and trust; second, no South Asian country should allow its territory to be used against the interest of another country of the region; third, no country should interfere in the internal affairs of another; fourth, all South Asian countries must respect each others territorial integrity and sovereignty; and, finally, they should settle all their disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.
According to Gujral, these five principles, scrupulously adhered to, would achieve a fundamental recasting of South Asias regional relationships, including the difficult relationship between India and Pakistan. Further, the implementation of these principles would generate a climate of close and mutually benign cooperation in the region, where the weight and size of India is regarded positively and as an asset by these countries.
Neem Rana initiative
Days after the Lahore Summit, in a modest hotel room in Delhi, unknown to anyone but their respective prime ministers, NiazNaik and R K Mishra conducted a dialogue on the Kashmir problem.
In 1997, Nawaz Sharif was elected prime minister on a platform that included a proposal to improve relations with India. In February 1998 behind closed doors, without the knowledge of their advisors or Foreign Offices, Vajpayee and Sharif were ironing out a daring initiative to tackle the thorniest issue of all: Kashmir. The two leaders agreed on three points: first, the status quo was inadequate and the Kashmir issue must be resolved; second, both sides must try to solve the problem by the end of the century (ie by 2000); and third, given the publicity glare of the press, especially considering the emotive nature of the Kashmir dispute, any preliminary negotiation must operate discreetly through quiet back-channel diplomacy.
Based on the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo model of negotiations, the two prime ministers agreed to select one personal emissary each to meet on a one-on-one basis to solely negotiate on Kashmir.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee in early March, Vajpayee telephoned Sharif with his choice: R K Mishra, editorial board chairman of the Mumbai-based Observer group of newspapers. When Sharifs first appointee  his principal secretary  passed away, the PM called upon a former diplomat outside his trusted circle: Niaz A. Naik a veteran diplomat and a leading player in various Track II initiatives.
In mid-March, Mishra arrived in Islamabad for an initial meeting with Sharif and Naik. Naik and Mishra agreed to meet in New Delhi for their first discussion on Kashmir.
On March 27, 1999, Naik traveled to Delhi as a private citizen and checked into a tourist hotel. There, he and Mishra met daily for several consecutive days in Naiks hotel room. The two emissaries agreed on four initial elements: first, both would move beyond the rigid publicly stated government positions on Kashmir. Mishra would not refer to Kashmir as an integral part of India; Naik would not mouth Pakistans demand for a plebiscite based on the 1948 UN resolution.
Second, any solution had to be balanced and take into account the interests of India, Pakistan as well as that of the Kashmiri people.
Third, the solution had to be just, equitable, feasible and implementable. Finally, as per Mishras suggestion, it was decided that any solution had to be final, not partial. The mistake of the 1972 Simla Accord, which deferred a final settlement, would not be repeated.
The fourth clause ruled out all proposals that would place contentious regions under temporary UN trusteeship or joint Indo-Pakistani control for 5 to 10 years without a final plan.
Governed by these four elements, over the next few days, the duo discussed all possible solutions to the Kashmir dispute.
First, Mishra suggested the proposal common in Indian circles: to convert the Line of Control  which had been established by the 1972 Simla Accord that ended the third Indo-Pakistani war  into a permanent border. Naik predictably rejected the proposal. Its the status quo. Then why did we fight two wars Naik asked.
Communal factor
Second, Mishra suggested increased autonomy within Kashmir through fairer elections. It wont work. Elections are not a substitute for the Kashmiri demand for a plebiscite, Naik countered.
In turn, Naik offered the Owen Dixon Plan, drawn up by UN mediator Owen Dixon in 1950, which recommended the redrawing of regions of the state as majority-Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim. Why not use the same criteria of Partition to divide Kashmir Naik suggested. Mishra said India could not afford to introduce the communal factor, especially with the Hindu-nationalist BJP in power. It will result in a blood bath, he said.
Finally, both discussed the option championed by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the original, secular organisation which had launched the Kashmiri secessionist movement in the late 1980s: an independent Kashmir. Both rejected the idea.
From there, Naik and Mishra rapidly went through the Indian journalist Kuldip Nayars proposal, the Finnish-Sweden model over a disputed island, the recent power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland, and other plans, without success. Discussions had reached a dead-end. Mishra reported to Vajpayee that all existing possibilities had been exhausted. You are working on the right lines, Vajpayee told Mishra, Ask Mr. Naik to come up with a new initiative.
Pressed to innovate, Naik proposed that the duo explore easily identifiable geographical boundaries as possibilities for establishing a new border. He suggested the Chenab River, which flows through southwestern Kashmir, as one potential new border. Mishra said he didnt know the rivers location. Naik went down to the hotel lobby and bought a map.
Mishra still had many more questions about Naiks proposal, especially regarding the percentages of Hindus and Muslims in the area. On April 1, the day Naik returned to Islamabad, Mishra asked his counterpart to send detailed, blown-up maps of the Chenab. He neither rejected nor accepted Naiks proposal.
Days later, bunkers were spotted on the Indian side of the LoC. Soon, the Indian external affairs office discovered the surreptitious communications between Naik and Mishra. All through, only Naik, Mishra, Vajpayee and Sharif had known of the existence of these talks. The back-channel initiative on Kashmir  the first such exercise in recent history  had run dry. The two never discussed Kashmir again.
In the coming months, as the worlds two newest nuclear powers inched towards an all out war, Naik materialised in Delhi on several occasions, carrying messages from Sharif to Vajpayee. Naik traveled to Delhi for the last time on June 26, 1999. India had readied tanks along the border in Rajasthan and looked to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict.
Things were really getting out of hand, Naik said. Sharif had dispatched Naik with four points: first, restore sanctity of the LoC, second, cease all aerial bombing, third, reaffirm a commitment to the Lahore process, and fourth, take concrete steps to resolve all issues, including Kashmir, as agreed in Lahore. After a half hour meeting with Naik, Vajpayee agreed to all four points.
The next day, Sharif was set to fly to China in a last-ditch effort to shore up support for Pakistans flagging campaign. Naik had a plan: The Pakistani PM would fly over Indian airspace, and send a diplomatic greeting from the aircraft to the Indian PM. Vajpayee would reciprocate and invite Sharif to make a technical halt in Delhi on his flight back from China. The two would meet in Delhi, and jointly declare an agreement to end the conflict.
The two sides had agreed to exchange drafts by fax of the politically loaded salutations beforehand. That evening, Naik faxed a copy of what would have been Sharifs airborne greeting to Vajpayee. But, Vajpayees invitation never came. Instead, the Indians sent back a fax of a statement of war. The next day, Sharifs flight never went over Indian airspace. The plan collapsed.
A little over a week later, Sharif travelled to Washington DC to sign a joint agreement with US President Bill Clinton. According to Naik, aside from one paragraph in which Clinton promised to take a personal interest in the sub-continental dispute, the Washington agreement mirrored the four points Vajpayee had accepted a week before.
We at present have no such vision to bind the region nor persons able to articulate and coax the region in to coming together as one.

Increased demand for luxury pet hotels
With time, the demand for luxury pet hotels, dog spas, and pet massages has seen a considerable rise in China.
Nowadays, people don't just satisfy themselves by taking care of their pets' basic needs, but as the population is getting wealthier, they are looking for better services for their furry friends.
As per the recent collected date published in the South China Morning Post, last year, Chinese consumers spent some 17.5 billion yuan (US$2.8 billion) on their pets.
Surprisingly the figure is expected to rise to 46.3 billion yuan by 2022, according to Euromonitor. As the pet owners are pampering their pets with the best, imported, products, the extravagant pet services have become increasingly common in the country.
As per an owner of a luxury spa, some people just want to have pets instead of a baby. Apart from this, homemade food for pets is also in demand here.
The average customer spends roughly 600 yuan per month, which includes the cost of the food; delivery is free and customers receive complimentary treats and bones.

## Title: India looks to build military presence in Seychelles

India looks to build military presence in Seychelles

The Seychelles is not typically associated with geopolitics. But beyond the white sandy beaches and tropical jungles, the tiny archipelago nation is emerging as a key player inIndia's battleto counter growing Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.
Late last month, India and the Seychellessigned a revised agreementgranting India permission to construct a military base on the Seychelles' Assumption Island, roughly 1,650 kilometers (1,025 miles) east of mainland East Africa.
The deal, which follows several years of diplomatic negotiations, will provide India with a crucial military staging point in what is fast becoming a critically strategic region.
In 2016,approximately 40 million barrels of oil per day-- equivalent to just under half of the world's total oil supply -- traveled through Indian Ocean entry and exit points, including the Straits of Hormuz, Malacca and Bab el-Mandeb.
India, which has more than 7,500 kilometers (4,700 miles) of coastline and sits at the very center of the Indian Ocean, is dependent on free and open access to those same shipping lanes for trade.
According to theIndian Ministry of Shipping, around 95% of the country's trade by volume, and 70% by value, comes via the Indian Ocean.
Chinese consolidation
India's attempts to better secure its access to the region mirrors a similar strategy deployed by its neighbor and long-standing rival China.
Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, China's naval reach has grown considerably, expanding far beyond its immediate coastline into areas not previously considered within its sphere of influence.
In July last year China established its first overseas military base inDjibouti, near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, among the world's busiest shipping lanes and one of three crucial Indian Ocean arteries.
The strait, which is only 29 kilometers (18 miles) wide at its narrowest point, connects the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean beyond.
The opening of the Djibouti base was followed several months later by the country's controversial acquisition of the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, just 22.2 kilometers (13.8 miles) by some estimates from the primary Indian Ocean sea lane that links the Malacca Straits to the Suez Canal.
Speaking to CNN, Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Sydney, described the Hambantota deal -- which sawSri Lanka grant China a 99-year leaseon the port to service some of the billions in debt it owes to Beijing -- as part of a "determined strategy by China to extend its influence across the Indian Ocean at the expense of India."
"That port then gives them not only a strategic access point into India's sphere of influence through which China can deploy its naval forces, but it also gives China an advantageous position to export its goods into India's economic sphere, so it's achieved a number of strategic aims in that regard," said Davis.
Stoking fears
Earlier this month, China took the unusual step ofdenying accusations that it was "land grabbing" in another critical Indian Ocean seaport-- this time in the Maldives.
Like Sri Lanka, the Maldives has long been considered within India as a close regional ally. But in recent years, the country, led by President Abdulla Yameen, has drawn closer to China, inviting investment under Beijing's expansive "One Belt, One Road" economic initiative.
This has prompted concern in some corners, not least from the country's opposition leader, Mohamed Nasheed, who has stated publicly that China is "buying up the Maldives" under Yameen's rule.
Speaking to reporters last month, Nasheedclaimed as much as 80%of the Maldives' foreign debt was owed to China, raising the prospect that the nation, much like Sri Lanka, could eventually be forced to hand over infrastructure to help pay off its debts.
Though China has denied the accusations, such views have helped to stoke fears in India ofpotential encirclement by China, and that analysts say, is playing into India's renewed push to consolidate regional alliances.
Speaking to CNN, Gurpreet Khurana, the executive director of India's National Maritime Foundation, said the new Seychelles deal was part of an Indian effort to safeguard territorial integrity.
"India has a primary area in the northern Indian Ocean and the secondary is the Indo-Pacific region. We (India) have interests that we have to preserve. With the Chinese going into the Indian Ocean in a big way, our strategic interests are expanding as well, and this is the only way India will be able to preserve itself," said Kurana.
No details confirmed
Though specific details of India's newly signed Seychelles agreement have not been released,a report by Janessuggests it includes provisions for a naval base and air strip.
A previous version of the accord, first proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, failed to takeoff, due toconcerns over sovereignty and costs.Issues that this time around appear to have been ironed out. A statement released by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs sought to characterize the new, revised agreement as a joint endeavor.
"India and Seychelles have drawn up a cooperation agenda that covers within its purview joint efforts in anti-piracy operations, and enhanced EEZ surveillance and monitoring to prevent intrusions by potential economic offenders indulging in illegal fishing, poaching, drug and human trafficking," readthe statement.
The move has stirred resistance in the Seychelles, however, where earlier this month, a group of 50 residents held a demonstration to protest the accord, citing a lack of transparency and environmental concerns.
The organizer of the protest, Ralph Volcere, told the officialSeychelles News Agencythat the island republic should not become involved in the "conflicts of superpowers."
"We need to remain nonaligned, friendly to all -- enemy to none," Volcere was quoted as saying.
Speaking to CNN, Arun Prakash, a retired four-star admiral and former Indian naval chief, refuted claims that the Seychelles agreement draws the island nation into a wider geopolitical rift.
"(What India is building in the Seychelles) is a facility, not a military base. It has not been our policy to set up military bases on foreign soil ... We were a colony for centuries, and after we became free, we do not want to do the same to another country. Setting up military bases is another form of colonialism," said Prakash.
"In international relations, China's approach is called a realist approach. India is far more sensitive to the opinions to its neighbors. Ours is a softer one ... China has a lot of money to spend. If they want to build a base, they can do it overnight. We don't have the financial and technical means to do this like them," said Prakash.
Close ties between India and the Seychelles stretch back several decades, though have tightened in recent years under Prime Minister Modi.
During a previous visit to the Seychelles by Modi in May 2015, the Indian leader outlined a vision for the Indian Ocean region with "collaboration as its backbone."
Under the banner of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), a Modi-led initiative that seeks to develop better cooperation among Indian Ocean nations, Indian naval ships have helped to patrol the waters around the Seychelles, and in 2016, India installed a coastal surveillance radar system in the archipelago to gather and analyze intelligence.
The new agreement, which according to theSeychelles News Agencywill be valid for an initial 20-year period once ratified, includes a clause that allows the Seychelles government to suspend operations at the base in certain circumstances it considers detrimental to its national interest, such as the outbreak of war.

India ranked top exporter of ICT services: UN report
India has been ranked the top exporter of information and communication technology services in a new UN report which highlighted the rise of the country as an emerging innovation center in Asia.
The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in its 10th edition of the Global Innovation Index (GII) ranked India 60th on its list of 130 most innovative countries in the world. The report, co-authored by WIPO, Cornell University and INSEAD, added that India maintains its top place in Central and Southern Asia, moving up six spots  from 66th last year to 60th this year overall.
It further said that a group of nations including India, Kenya, and Viet Nam are outperforming their development-level peers.
According to the UN agency, rich countries continue to dominate global innovation in terms of most new products and services, with Switzerland at the top for the seventh year running and high-income economies taking 24 of the top 25 spots  China is the exception at 22, moving up three places in the last 12 months.
India performed well on a number of parameters, coming on the top spot in ICT services exports, 10th in category of graduates in science and engineering, 27th on e-participation, 14th on the presence of global research and development companies, 33rd on governments online service, 32nd in general infrastructure, 18th on creative goods exports, 30th on knowledge impact and 29th on intellectual property payments.
However in some categories it has ranked comparatively low, including 106th on political stability and safety, 121st on business environment, 114th on education, 104th on pupil-teacher ratio at the secondary level, 109th on use of ICT, 108th on environmental performance, 114th on ease of starting a business and 118th on ease of paying taxes.
The report said India outperformed on innovation relative to its GDP per capita for seven years in a row. India has shown improvement in most areas, including in infrastructure, business sophistication, knowledge and technology and creative outputs.
Public policy plays a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment conducive to innovation. In the last two years, we have seen important activities around the GII in India like the formation of Indias high-level Task Force on Innovation and consultative exercises on both innovation policy and better innovation metrics, said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, Confederation of Indian Industry, which is among the 2017 GII knowledge partners.
The report stated that as demonstrated in the GII for some years, India has consistently outperformed on innovation relative to its GDP per capita. Recently it made important strides in innovation input and output performance.
India is now in the top half of the GII rankings. The continual improvement of India in terms of investment, tertiary education, the quality of its publications and universities, its ICT services exports, and its innovation clusters deserves mention, it said.
The report said it hopes India will continue on this trajectory, with innovation investments leading to more dynamic R&D  intensive firms that are active in patenting, high-technology production, and exports.
If India then increasingly connects its innovation system to the innovative countries in the East as well as to standing innovation powerhouses in the West, it will make a true difference in Asias regional role in innovation, and to global innovation more generally, the report added.
Each year, the GII surveys some 130 economies using dozens of metrics, from patent filings to education spending providing decision makers a high-level look at the innovative activity that increasingly drives economic and social growth.
For the last ten years, it has observed an innovative capacity gap between developed and developing nations and lacklustre growth rates for research and development activities at both the government and corporate levels.

Invisible world of microorganisms
Microbes are tiny little creatures that are not visible to naked eye. They should be observed with the help of a microscope. Microorganisms can belong to different categories. They are bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae and viruses.
Natural decomposers
Microorganisms are the natural decomposers. These decomposers include bacteria, fungi and Actinomycetes. They are the creatures who degrade the complicated organic substances into simple inorganic substances, releasing energy and nutrients hence facilitating plants to uptake the nutrients and involving in nutrient recycling in the environment. Certain steps in major biogeochemical cycle such as Nitrogen cycle, Sulphur cycle and Carbon cycle involve several types of microorganisms. Some examples are Rhizobium involving in nitrogen fixation, Nitrosomonas involving in nitrification process, Thiobacillus and Green sulphur bacteria involving in sulphur oxidation process and etc. In Carbon cycle microbes mainly act as decomposers, helping to decompose dead plant and animal material.
Bioleaching
The next important activity done by them is the Bioleaching. It is the process described as the dissolution of metals from their mineral source by certain naturally occurring microorganisms or the use of microorganisms to transform elements so that the elements can be extracted from original sample. Fe and Cu are such two metals that are extracted from bioleaching procedure. If we take the use of chemical and physical methods, lot of gases and harmful chemical substances will be released to the environment, causing environmental pollution. But by using the microorganisms and providing suitable conditions to them we are able to leach out the element we need without causing much environmental impacts.
Bio insecticides and fertilizers
The exposure of economically important plants to various pests and insect attacks is a critical problem faced by the field of Agriculture. In mass cultivation, lot of economical disadvantages will be caused due to this. Thus the use of insecticides is increasing. One of the major problems when using these chemicals is that the insects create a resistance within them by exposure to such chemicals. To overcome this issue bio insecticides are now being used. These bio insecticides contain live bacteria that produce toxins which cause stomach poison in the insect and kill them. Those are not poisonous for the plants and microorganisms are used to supply nutrients to the plants as well. These are named as bio fertilizers. They produce essential nutrients like nitrogen, sulphur, phosphate. These bio fertilizers are beneficial over chemical fertilizers, because chemicals decrease the quality of soil and create health issues in humans as well as animals. The use of bio control agents and bio fertilizers which are composed of microorganisms is much effective in agriculture.
Purifying wastewater
Another use of microorganisms is to treat the wastewater. There in the secondary treatment microorganisms are added and they are allowed to grow. They use the organic matter and decompose them.
Then the water can be separated from the deposited matter.
Bioremediation is another important process when talking about microorganisms. It means use of biological organisms to solve an environmental problem such as contaminated soil or groundwater. Contaminants treated using bioremediation include oil and other petroleum products. If we see how it works, some types of microbes are capable of eating and digesting those contaminants.
They usually change those contaminants into small amount of water and gases like carbon dioxide, hence cleaning the environment from pollution. These bioremediation relies on microbes that live naturally in soil and groundwater. And they create no threat to human. So bioremediation process is safer process to make use of to clean contaminants from environment.
Microorganisms for a healthy life
Field of Medicine also incorporates the use of microorganisms very much. The vaccines we use for various diseases are made of microbes that are dead or inactivated, so that they are unable to cause the disease. The antigen in the vaccine is the same as the antigen on the surface of the disease causing organism. The vaccine stimulates the body to produce antibodies against the antigen in the vaccine. When the vaccinated person then comes into contact with disease causing microbe, the immune system remembers the antibodies and make them faster. So the person is protected. And also certain antibiotics like penicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin are extracted from microorganisms. These antibiotics either help to prevent microbe cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis and hence protecting the person against infections. And also microbes are used in the field of recombinant technology to make various proteins. Human growth hormone and insulin are such two hormones produced using recombinant microorganisms.
Some microorganisms keep us healthy. Those microorganisms are in large numbers inside our body and they stop the development of disease causing organisms. One example is our gut microbial population. And now there are commercially available products named as probiotics. These are the supplements made of beneficial friendly lactic acid bacteria formulated to reflect composition of healthy gut microorganisms. These help to increased tolerance to infections, control diarrhea and etc.
Microorganisms are also used in the field of food and beverages such as wine industry, beer industry, edible microorganisms and etc. For the production of wine grapes are used and grape pulp is kept for fermentation. The yeast used for the fermentation grows a film on the fruit or in the environment. And also some cultivated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeare added in order to improve the quality of our wine product. Beer is also an alcoholic beverage made from fermentation of starch sources such as rice. And the process includes the microorganisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Saccharomyces uvarum. Brandy and whiskey are some other beverages produced from fermentation activity of microorganisms. Fermented milk and dairy products also make the use of microbial activity. This fermentation is done by the lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus are some lactic acid bacterial groups. Lactic acid bacteria ferments the carbohydrates such as lactose in milk into lactic acid. Because of this lactic acid proteins are precipitated and it gives a thicker consistency to our dairy product. Microbes are also taken as food supplements such as single celled proteins. These are dried cells of microorganisms such as algae, bacteria and fungi. Spirulinais one such example for those food supplements.
Microorganisms are tiny organisms. Apart from above mentioned activities they may possess many more uses. It is true that certain types cause diseases. But we cannot neglect microbes as disease causing organisms because without them much of ecosystem and human activities will be interrupted.

John Keells Properties  launches TRI-ZEN
Connecting the dots between peace of mind, life in the city and liveable space, John Keells Properties announced the launch of TRI-ZEN, a new residential property on Union Place.
These smart living spaces in the heart of Colombo are for women and men on the go in the city; a stones throw from its many business hubs, yet designed for comfort and style. The project is expected to be completed by 2023 and is currently open for sales.
John Keells Properties leads the charge on the property development and real estate sector in Sri Lanka, with a significant portfolio of real estate in Colombo and the suburbs. The companys most recent acquisition is a property on Vauxhall Street valued at Rs 4.2 billion.
Recently the company led and successfully completed the design and construction of two landmark residential properties in Colombo-OnThree20 on Union Place and 7th Sense on Gregorys Road. It is also the property developer transforming Colombos cityscape with Cinnamon Life, the ongoing Integrated Resort bordering the Beira Lake.
TRI-ZEN is John Keells Properties newest project focusing on metropolitan spaces that cater to the needs of Colombos growing class of working elite. From Union Place, TRI-ZENs residents will have immediate access to the citys best hospitals, restaurants, schools, hotels, shopping malls and more. Moreover, its central location takes hours spent in traffic out of the equation-which means residents can luxuriate in the extra time freed up every day to spend time with family and friends.
TRI-ZENs apartments are based on smart design principles to maximize space and comfort, and this efficient design allows these apartments to be affordably priced. Common open spaces are a key design feature throughout the property; the perfect spaces for conversation, relaxation and contemplation.
This project is designed for both solitude and company- stay in on a Sunday and enjoy the citys drowsy reverie, or go out on a Friday night to one of the many cafes, bistros and restaurants situated only minutes away.
TRI-ZEN meets and exceeds the expectations on location, style and comfort. When we designed this complex, we dedicated a lot of resources to understanding the market - to analyse customer needs and wants, said Suresh Rajendra, President of the John Keells Property Group. He also added, Colombo is changing, and with it our clients lifestyles and tastes are changing. Were responding to this by really thinking about how we can redefine what it means to live well in Colombo. So this is an exciting project for us, as we strengthen our metropolitan property portfolio by creating eminently livable spaces for our clients.

Kohli limps off as India beat SA by 28 runs in first T20
Johannesburg: Virat Kohli limped off the field before India completed another dominant performance over South Africa in the first Twenty20 international at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.
Shikhar Dhawan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were mainly responsible for Indias 28-run win, just two days after the tourists completed a 5-1 thrashing of the hosts in a one-day international series.
India captain Kohli left the field 13 overs into South Africas innings after suffering a left leg strain while batting.
I tweaked my glute a little bit. Thankfully its not my hamstring, he said.
I felt a little more stiffness (in the field) so I decided to go off and not be stupid and tear a muscle.
Dhawan made 72 in an Indian total of 203 for five after they were sent in to bat.
Then opening bowler Kumar produced a masterly display as he claimed career-best figures of five for 24 as South Africa were restricted to 175 for nine.
Kumar took the first two wickets and put a clamp on South Africas scoring rate with an opening spell of two for 19 in three overs, displaying superb control and changes of pace.
Then he came back to settle the contest and secure the man of the match award by taking three wickets and conceding only five runs in the 18th over.
South Africa were outplayed once again despite a fourth wicket partnership of 81 off 54 balls between Reeza Hendricks (70) and Farhaan Behardien (39) with India superior in all departments.
Kohli hailed one of our most balanced performances in a T20 international.
South African captain JP Duminy admitted he was very disappointed but backed a policy of short-pitched bowling in an attempt to take wickets when India batted.
The left-handed Dhawan hit ten fours and two sixes in a 39-ball innings.
He was lucky to escape on ten when he flicked at a ball down the leg side from Junior Dala.
South Africa appealed half-heartedly for a catch behind and the ball was called wide. Replays showed the ball had brushed his glove.
India made a flying start, with Rohit Sharma square-cutting the first ball from Dane Paterson for six. He added a second six in an over which yielded 18 runs.
Sharma was caught behind off new cap Dala in the second over but all the Indian batsmen followed his attacking example on a ground where there had been three successful run chases of over 200 in T20 internationals.
Kohlis run of big scores ended when he was leg before wicket to left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi for 26. He had been dropped off the same bowler at long-on when he had ten.
South Africa were without star batsman AB de Villiers, who was ruled out of the series after suffering a blow to his left knee ahead of the sixth one-day international in Centurion on Friday.
India also suffered an injury blow, with left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav missing because of a thumb injury suffered in Centurion when India completed a 5-1 series win. AFP

Led by the disabled
At first, they had no idea how a simple wooden stick could be used for theatrical gestures when the circle was formed. But creativity does not come at once. One by one, those in the circle took some time to kindle their imagination. The very first one of the circle used the wooden stick for the theatrical gesture of fishing. That was followed by the next one who saw it as an arrow. For another, it looked like a weight-lifting bar. Another used the stick to play the flute. Such gestures were slowly, but steadily, leading them along miscellaneous avenues. The circle had many gestures of miracles with the wooden sticks in their hands. They played a guitar, threw a javelin, drummed, swept by a broom, wrote by a pen, played pool and even combed hair.
The circle was formed by a gathering of delegates from the 30th batch of the Ship for World Youth Programme and the students with disabilities of the Thidora Theatre. Seated in the middle of the circle, Rohanadeva Perera challenged the norms of creativity. How could mental or physical oppression be used for creative advantage, he questioned from the gathering circled around him. Disability used to be a sign of discrimination in the Sri Lankan arena. However, thanks to organisations such as Thidora Theatre, founded by Rohanadeva Perera, the phenomenon is now changing.
Nippon Maru, carrying over 240 youth from 11 different countries of the world set its journey to Singapore, India and Sri Lanka from the port of Yokohama, Japan on January 29. A group of the delegates from countries such as Peru, New Zealand, Australia, Oman and Japan chose Thidora Theatre workshop to gain insights on how the traditional attitudes of disability could be changed in a creative spectrum.
Delivering the keynote speech at the workshop, Professor Sunanda Mahendra enlightened the audience of Youth Leaders on the brief history of traditional Sri Lankan rituals and how they evolved into modern dance forms of the country.
The gathering was naturally interested in the genesis of Thidora. In Sinhalese, it can mean three doors (mind, body and word). In English, it is the acronym of Theatre Institute for Disability Oriented Research and Advocacy. The Thidora, founded by Rohanadeva Perera and Ramani Damayanthi, employs dance as a tool to enhance the communication skills of disabled persons.
Following a brief introduction on Sri Lankas traditions by Professor Sunanda Mahendra and Rohanadeva Perera, the Youth Leaders took part in various ritual-like performances. The young crowd mingled with the disabled students of the Thidora Theatre and explored the art of utilitarian creativity. They performed various exercises.
I appreciate that I learned very important things here. Though the workshop is simple, I learnt a lot about music and dance. When I used the stick, I began to feel my own body and emotions, said Ryoko from Osaka adding that she will introduce this exercise for children in Japan as well.
Thidora Theatre came to the fore as a concept in 1987, though it actually materialised in 2008. With the financial aid of theatre enthusiast Wolfgang Stange, who is also the founder of AMICI Dance Theatre Company in London, the Thidora Theatre was established to promote theatre activities of the people with disabilities.
It was such an absolutely lovely job. It was such a beautiful hour and the smiles I saw were magical in a land far away from my country. I felt at home. I am thankful to the Institute for sharing the gift of music and dance with us, Noemi del Castilo from Mexico said.
Shu from Japan expressed appreciation of the amazing family at Thidora Theatre. Here is an acceptable place for everyone and us including normal or disable people or whoever can share the same music and happiness for dancing. I hope their work goes well.
The workshop was a touching experience for Nikki Vivienne from Australia, a sister of an autistic brother.
I saw a wonderful family at Thidora theatre. It was a privilege to be here with them. I sincerely hope they will receive more recognition and support for their amazing work. I thank them for crossing a safe and creative space that welcomes disabled and disadvantaged people. They offered a voice to the disabled community. It truly touched my heart and gave me hope in humanity, Nikki added.

LG polls result, a sound warning - Arjuna
The Local Government election results is a sound warning to the Unity Government to march forward during the balance two years after correcting its mistakes and shortcomings, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
He was speaking to the media after presiding over a discussion held with petroleum distributing agents in the Northern Province recently.
Minister Ranatunga said people gave a mandate to President Maithripala Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to eschew party differences and form a Unity Government and resolve burning issues in the country.
We have governed the country now for three years. The Local Government election results is a warning given at the correct time for us to correct mistakes and move forward for the rest of the term while creating awareness among the people but the services we have already rendered, he said.
Minister Ranatunga said both the President and the Prime Minister should join hands to take the country forward without ignoring the request made by the people.
What the country needed today was natural politics other than party politics. This agenda of natural politics adhered by the Government had enabled the country to gain international acclaim and confidence, he added.
A major part of the pledges given by the Government still remained unfulfilled. They have overlooked the pledge given to catch corrupt and fraudulent people and punish them. What ought to be done now was to fulfil those pledges to rid the country of corrupt politicians and their cohorts, Minister Ranatunga said.
He said the Government should beware of drug and casino racketeers and Bookie owners who were using money to win over Parliamentarians in order to stifle the Governments forward march. He was confident that the President and the Prime Minister would step into resolve outstanding issues and take the Unity Government forward.

Life-size cake models for first birthday
If you're a professional cake maker, there's probably quite a lot of pressure to have the best and most creative cake on offer at your children's birthday.
We're guessing you can't just ice an Asda Victoria sponge or stick some candles in a Colin the Caterpillar cake.
So when it was time to celebrate her twin daughters' first birthday, Lara Mason knew she had to do something special.
She said: "I was under a bit of pressure with the girls' first birthday cake/cake smash because I used to make cakes on the side of my real job.
"So I decided to do what any other slightly bonkers person would do and combine the two." Lara, who lives in Walsall in the West Midlands, made life-size cake models of Lily and Lyla, and they're incredibly realistic.
She said: "I totally get this won't be everyone's cup of tea, but not a lot of other people do this crazy thing that I do so I thought to myself Why not!
"I mean, what other kids get to say that their mum made them life-size cakes of themselves for their 1st birthday! "I'll be cleaning buttercream out of the floorboards for months but I reckon it was 100 per cent worth it." The cakes babies are both wearing first birthday t-shirts and pink tutus to match the real Lily and Lyla for the unique photoshoot. Unsurprisingly the ingredients list for the two cakes is rather long.
To make them she used, 44 eggs, 2.2kg flour, 5kg of chocolate, 3kg of fondant icing, 4kg of buttercream and a lot of butter. It wasn't a simple task and it was even tricker as poor Lyla was poorly in the run up to the big day. Lara said: "The cakes have taken a fair few hours, Id say about 100 to 120 hours over the last few weeks. "Most of that time goes into the decorative icing pieces, so the cakes themselves I've been rushing to get done over the last week.
"They are made up of 22 6inch round Madeira cakes and the hair is made out of pulled sugar so I had to make every individual strand separately, I'd say that was the hardest part. "Its the most critical I have ever been while making 'cake people' because I feel like I did such a good job making them so cute in the first place!" And by the looks of it cake Lily and Lyla were a bit hit with the real Lily and Lyla!
Definitely a first birthday to remember. Lara shared her story with parenting website The Motherload.

Love wins!
For 25-year-old acid attack victim, Pramodini, this was the perfect Valentines Day as she and her long time friend Saroj Sahu, who stood by her in the most trying of times, got engaged on February 14.
Way back in 2009, in Odishas Jagatpur, a young Pramodini not only suffered 80 per cent burns but even lost her eyesight when a spurned lover attacked her with acid.
Overcoming the physical and the emotional trauma was an arduous task. But Sahus undithering support helped heal her emotional scars while medical treatment helped her gain 20 per cent eyesight.
I was critically injured in the attack on that fateful day when I was returning from college after appearing in an examination I had to be taken home from the government hospital where I was admitted after nine months as the family had no funds for treatment, Pramodini told the news agency.
After having spent five years in bed, Pramodini was admitted to a private hospital near her house in 2014 where she was introduced to Sahu, a medical representative by profession, through a nurse who brought him to see the problems the young girl was going through. Sahu, took it upon himself to help Pramodini get on feet. And she did it, in four months, when senior doctors had declared it would take at least ten months. He even quit his job to stand by me during those trying times, Pramodini recalled. Pramodini, vividly remembers that it was on January 5, 2016 that she came to Delhi for proper medical treatment on after getting in touch with the Stop Acid Attack Campaign.
Meanwhile, her departure made Sahu realise the meaning she had brought to his life. Days later, he called her and proposed marriage. She was only a dear friend till then, but when she left Odisha, I found what she meant to me. And on January 14, I confessed my feelings for her on phone and proposed to marry her, Sahu said.
But it was not a proposal that Pramodini found easy to accept. She felt her lack of eyesight and physical challenges would not allow them lead a normal life. But, on his persistence, I underwent eye treatment and today I have 20 per cent eyesight, she said.
And with dreams of togetherness in their eyes, both Pramodini and Sahu, who is 26 now, took their first step towards making their bond a lifelong one at the Sheroes Hangout Cafe here, which is run by the Stop Acid Attack Campaign. The Cafes convenor, Alok Dixit, who made all preparations for the engagement, hoped the two will tie the knot next year on the same day. As for their future plans, Pramodini and Sahu say they want to return to Odisha after the wedding and run a Sheroes Cafe there to give employment to acid attack victims like the one here.

Lukaku double sends Man United into FA Cup quarter-finals
LONDON, Saturday - Romelu Lukaku extended his impressive FA Cup scoring record by netting twice in Manchester Uniteds 2-0 win at Huddersfield Town to earn Jose Mourinhos side a quarter-final tie at home to Brighton & Hove Albion.
The Belgian has scored in each of the three rounds United have played of this years competition and now has 11 goals from his past 10 FA Cup appearances and 21 in all competitions this season.
Lukakus first came after three minutes, and the striker scored again in the second half after United mounted a quick counter-attack against a side who beat them at the John Smiths Stadium in the Premier League last October.
Saturdays fifth-round late kickoff also featured English footballs latest video-assisted referee (VAR) decision when Uniteds Juan Mata had a goal disallowed after being ruled fractionally offside before the interval.
Yes, the decision went in our favour but this VAR for me kills the emotion of the game, said Huddersfield manager David Wagner. This is why I dont like it but I am not the person who makes the decision.
Uniteds midfielder Paul Pogba missed the game due to illness.
West Bromwich Albions tumultuous week took a final turn for the worse as they were knocked out by Southampton, whose 2-1 victory at the Hawthorns secured the visitors a quarter-final berth for the first time since 2005.
Defeat always seemed likely for West Brom, who are bottom of the Premier League and sacked their chairman and chief-executive on Tuesday. They then had four senior players interviewed by Spanish police over the alleged theft of a taxi from outside a fast-food restaurant in Barcelona.
Two of those involved in the incident, Jonny Evans and Gareth Barry, both started against Southampton after issuing a public apology, although Evans was stripped of the captaincy by Albion manager Alan Pardew.
I felt I needed to make a little bit of a statement about the events, Pardew said. I was far from happy over them.
Evans could do nothing to stop Southampton taking the lead through Wesley Hoedt on 11 minutes, with Dusan Tadic adding the second after the interval.
Salomon Rondon quickly countered for West Brom but Southampton held on to record their second win at Albion in two weeks and earn a quarter-final at either Wigan Athletic or Manchester City, who play on Monday.
DEBUT GOALS END COVENTRY DREAM
Brightons Jurgen Locadia scored on his debut in the 3-1 win over Coventry City who, after knocking out Stoke City in the third round, failed in their attempt to make FA Cup history by becoming the first fourth-tier side to beat two top-flight teams in the same season.
There was never much chance of that with Brightons record signing Locadia scoring with his first shot on target after 15 minutes and Leicester City loanee Leonardo Ulloa, who is in his second spell with the Seagulls, rounding off the win after Connor Goldson netted his first goal in almost two years. Jonson Clarke-Harris scored Coventrys consolation.
The last time Brighton were a top-flight team they reached the FA Cup final in 1983, when they lost to Manchester United, their opponents in next months quarter-final. At Hillsborough, both managers bemoaned the replay after second-tier Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City shared a goalless draw, with Swanseas Carlos Carvalhal suggesting everyone would have been happy to play on to penalties.
Its a score nobody wants. I also believe (thats the case) for Sheffield Wednesday - the same one more game. Maybe in the future we can think that if the managers and referee agree after the first game we can go to penalties and we can finish the game today, said Carvalhal who was given a warm reception on his return to the club he managed for two and a half years.
The replay is Swanseas third in succession as they continue to juggle cup commitments with a Premier League survival battle that has become more difficult after impressive defender Alfie Mawson injured himself before kickoff and was subsequently seen wearing a knee brace.
The winner of the replay will host Rochdale or Tottenham Hotspur, who play on Sunday.  Agencies

Point of view
Equity markets remained relatively calm following the outcome of the LG polls which showed a landslide victory for the Former Presidents proxy party over the existing coalition Governments political parties.
Markets reversed the uptrend it experienced over the last three weeks (+129 points) but the overall negative position ( -8.60 points) was marginal as a 40 point loss in the immediate aftermath of the election results, was immediately offset by an ~31 point recovery over the latter half of the trading week.
Despite the benchmark Indexs overall stability over the week ,daily average turnover levels fell ~27% to Rs.0.72Bn this week, down 15% from the average of Rs.0.85Bn over the last three weeks.
Sluggish market turnover levels were driven by the low HNI and Institutional investor participation levels which fell to ~13% over the week, 12% lower than the average participation levels of 25% in Feb18 and significantly lower than the average participation levels of 62% in Jan18.
Meanwhile, net foreign inflows to the market which showed a declining trend throughout most of the week, closed the week as a net positive (Rs.0.49bn) as the domestic equity sell-off was reversed with the net inflow of 0.11Bn on Friday.
In bond markets too, foreign investors sold government securities following the ruling coalition parties LG election defeat1, pushing the LKR down to 154.78 (against the USD) by week end (cf. 154.31 the previous week).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current momentum while continuing gather cues from the ongoing corporate earnings releases for the Dec17 quarter.
Policy rates unchanged as inflation and credit fall
The CBSL held policy rates steady at its 1st Monetary policy review for the year, with the Monetary Authority sounding relatively positive on the back of better inflation and private credit numbers.
The move which was widely anticipated by markets left the key standing deposit facility rate (SDFR) unchanged at 7.25% while the standing lending facility rate (SLFR) was kept at 8.75%. The CBSL noted that due to timely monetary and fiscal policies, the economy has stabilized with private sector credit moderating to desired levels and export earnings reaching an all-time high of ~$11.4Bn in 2017 due in large part to the increase in export earnings from the restoration of the GSP+ to the EU, favorable prices for key commodities in global markets and a flexible FX policy maintained by the CBSL.
The Bank also noted that stronger tourism earnings and better FDI flows in 2017 have led to gross official reserves of $7.7Bn by Jan18 and a depreciation of 0.9% against the USD so far this year.
The significant slowdown in urban food inflation levels in Jan18 meanwhile, is expected to be reflected in national inflation levels for the month and the CBSL anticipates both headline and core inflation levels stabilizing at targeted mid-single digits during the remainder of 2018.
The Monetary Authority cautioned however, that the economy is currently operating at a level below potential and that the countrys overall fiscal performance is expected to deviate from target mainly due to the increased flood & drought related relief expenses and some slippages in revenue collection.

Mendis drives Sri Lanka to T20 series sweep
Sylhet: Opener Kusal Mendis hit a blazing half-century as Sri Lanka thrashed Bangladesh by 75 runs in the second Twenty20 international to complete a 2-0 series sweep on Sunday.
Sri Lanka rode on Mendis' 70 off 42 deliveries to post 210-4 and then bowled out the hosts for 135 in Sylhet.
Kusal Mendis reacts after scoring a half century (50 runs) during the second Twenty20 (T20) cricket match between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in Sylhet on February 18. AFP
Skipper Mahmudullah Riyad top-scored for Bangladesh with 41 before being run out, with opener Tamim Iqbal making the only other meaningful contribution with 29.
Sri Lanka paceman Shehan Madushanka, who left the field with an injured hamstring after bowling just 2.1 overs, and off-spinner Danushka Gunathilaka claimed two wickets each to wrap up a comprehensive victory.
"We had a really bad couple of years. I think now players are getting some confidence. That's the main thing," Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal said after the win.
"Hope the boys do their best moving forward -- we have a really good combination of youngsters and seniors."
Mendis once again stood out for the visitors with his second successive fifty of the series, as his 98-run stand with fellow opener Gunathilaka gave Sri Lanka a solid start after being put into bat first.
Mendis, who was named both man of the match and series, hit six fours and three sixes in reaching his T20 international career-best score, taking the attack to the opposition while Gunathilaka at the other end made a brisk 42.
Bangladesh dropped Gunathilaka twice on 15 and 28 and had to wait until the 11th over for their first success in the game.
Number three Thisara Perera chipped in with a quickfire 31. Upul Tharanga then hit 25, and Dasun Shanaka smashed an unbeaten 30 off 11 balls, to lift the score past the 200-run mark.
In reply, Bangladesh lost three early wickets for just 22 runs and never caught up with the ever-increasing required run-rate. Apart from Tamim and Mahmudullah, Mohammad Saifuddin and Mahedi Hasan were the only other batsmen to manage double figures for the hosts, who were all out after 18.4 overs.
"You need to have partnerships when you are chasing 200-plus," said Mahmudullah.
"You must have at least 60 to 75 runs in the powerplay. But today we succumbed to scoreboard pressure. I am feeling quite disappointed."
Sri Lanka also won the preceding tri-nation one-day international tournament and a two-Test series by 1-0 in their successful month-long tour. AFP

LG poll elected members imbroglio
Minister makes several recommendations
Provincial Councils and local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha has made several recommendations to the Elections Commission Chairman regarding the problem which has arisen in selecting elected representatives to local government institutions due to the mandatory women representation introduced by the Local Government Elections Amendment Act.
The Minister observed that the Amendments were introduced by incorporating recommendations made by the Elections Commission and the Elections Department and if any problem had arisen, it is recommended that future decisions should be made after consulting the Attorney General.
Since there are legal problems in amending the Local Government Act with retrospective effect to include the 2018 local government election, any practical problems arising in relation to the selection of elected members can only be corrected in a future local government election.
When taking these factors to account, the election results should be announced based on the existing law, and the beginning of the period of office of the newly elected members could not be decided until the related results are announced, it has been observed.
The Minister has pointed out that even when the total number of members have not been properly appointed to a council, the main local government Institution laws have made provisions to constitute a council on a date specified by the Minister to begin its term through a gazette notification.

Minister requests private hospitals, SJH to Provide free treatment to organ donors
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday requested the Managements of Private hospitals and the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital (SJH) to offer free treatment to patients who donate parts for organ transplants, since some relief should be granted to such donor patients. He hoped to make it mandatory through a special directive in future.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said this participating in an organ donation day walk organised by the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital last morning.
The walk which began from the precincts near the Sri Jayawardenepura Parliamentary Complex, ended at the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital grounds, where a meeting followed.
At this meeting Minister Dr. Senaratne presented special awards to four persons who had donated organs.
In lighter vein, Dr. Senaratne said the government too was undergoing an organ transplant at the moment. But, safeguarding peoples organs was much more important.
Minister Senaratne said that when he assumed office as Health Minister, organ transplants had been disrupted.
After I assumed office liver transplants were resumed followed by heart transplants. Organ transplants were now being done at the Anuradhapura, Kandy, Peradeniya and Sri Jayawardenepura hospital, the Minister said.
However, the second heart transplant failed due to a conflict among some specialists, transplant should be performed humanely without considering commercial, religions on other petty difference, Minister Senaratne said.
He said kidney transplants on foreigners had been temporarily banned in this country due to a racket involving some Indian nationals. Regulations in this field in Singapore and the ban may be lifted if laws and regulations in this field followed in Singapore were applicable to Sri Lanka after a proper study.
Deputy Minister Faizal Cassim, Health Services Director General Dr.Anil Jasinghe and Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital Director Dr. Susith Senaratne were also present on the occasion.

Motor  traders in dilemma over abrupt Euro IV implementation
The recent Budget proposal to introduce Euro 4 engines and the safety features to be implemented by January 31, 2017 has seriously created a crisis situation in the Auto Industry.
The Budget has made it a prerequisite that vehicles imported to the country be equipped with Euro IV or above emission standards.
The Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) is of the opinion that even though they welcome the decision to implement these policies, the policy makers should have given serious thought about its implication and of its all of a sudden introduction,that will adversely affect the average vehicle buyer as well as the commercial operations of all businesses and the franchise holders of brand new vehicle importers. The exact guidelines are not yet clear and are very vague even though a grace period till June 31, 2018 was granted for implementation, because it has not stipulated the categories of vehicles.
As a result at this moment of time CMTA members are unable to place orders for commercial vehicles considering the cost factor and the lead time as the authorities have still not decided the type and category of vehicles that should comply to these regulations.
Whilst most passenger cars and SUV simported from some countries will comply with, there is a serious concern with regard to the commercial vehicles in the transport sector.
The requirement of Euro IV standard for passenger vehicles are accepted for the sake of better environmental conditions even though it will make vehicles more expensive despite the time period given is insufficient. The commercial vehicle sector will also face a significant price increase, and in this instance one needs to analyze the pro and cons and the viability of introducing to the commercial vehicles. This will make things worse for the business community using the commercial vehicles which will become more expensive than what it is today.
The requirement of airbags for driver and passenger for commercial vehicles is a debatable question, as most manufacturers have not introduced air bags for both driver and passenger as this is not a mandatory requirement by most standards. However this too will push up the price further.
Whilst, CMTA considers these regulationsas a positive step contributing to the environment and safety standards it should be mentioned that there is a serious need to look at the need for such policies at this moment of time and process followed for implementation. (If the environment is the concern we could also look at strategies such as reducing the age of used truck and bus imports, and providing incentives for scrapping of used vehicles etc.)
At the same time it is worthwhile in investigating the cost benefit equation of these requirements for a country such as ours. Below highlighted are some of the areas that need attention of the policy makers as it seems these budget proposals are to be implemented without clarity of its clear objectives and merits. Shifting to a higher emission standard is a very serious decision that can affect all stakeholders in different fronts.
For this ideally there should have been a proper consultation process with the trade representatives and experts in the field.
The policy implementation had not even considered the professional approach taken worldwide in implementing this type of new policy by gradually uplifting standards without jumping many steps ahead at once.
For example as of today there is no clarity as to how these are to be implemented. Who is the implementing authority What mechanism is to be followed to ensure that the standards are maintained Which of the methods will be used for this Is BS-4 and SU-Lev standard equals to Euro IV etc.
The band new importers are the main casualties of this sudden proposal ignoring their rights and the contribution they make to the society as a whole. These established companies are the leading automobile companies that represent the manufacturers and those who do legitimate business by employing thousands, paying all taxes to the last cent and maintain a great degree of corporate governance.
It is a fact that these companies have to follow a proper process of homologation in order to import engines with higher emission standards and this cant be done without having proper information such as the ones highlighted above.
It is also a fact that the world renowned manufacturers will need time in testing the fuel standards and will need specificstandards set in terms of technical and tolerance levels of the new standards before approving new products to a market. It is also evident that if applied as proposed the higher emission requirements will increase the cost of the vehicles by many folds, making them more expensive.
Above all there is a need to ensure that the Euro IV compatible fuel is available Island wide and the two companies CPC and LIOC involved in the business of importation and distribution of fuel are able to facilitate this process by ensuring the fuel availability with the right specifications so that these engines can run without issues.
As we understand this will be a major barrier as well as these oil companies might not be able to offer non contaminated Euro IV compatible fuel island wide in the shorter run.
In the above circumstances there is a crying need for the authorities to meet the trade representatives in order to clarify these and lay a plan that will spell out the entire process of implementation once the fuel availability is certified. If this is not a possibility it is fitting that these proposals are amended and set the implementation dates for latter date so that business can take place as usual for all concerned. (MFJ)

Parties to be notified this week
The number of female members elected to Local Government bodies from each party will be counted and notified to the respective parties within this week, Additional Commissioner of Election M. M.Mohamed said.
Although March 6 is the date for constituting Local Government Institutions, there is a possibility of the date being postponed, Mohamed said.
The Additional Election Commissioner said the General Secretaries of the respective political parties should provide a list of their nominated members to the Elections Commissions on dates notified in the future.
The nominated members should be notified without delay as the names of members appointed from the additional list will also be included in the Gazette notification giving a list of representatives elected on the ward basis.
Earlier it was stated that the 8,325 new members elected to 340 Local Government institutions island wide will assume their duties in their respective local bodies on March 6.
Meanwhile, the political parties which have won a majority of seats but have failed to secure a working majority at LG bodies are facing a dilemma when forming administrations at the relevant LG bodies.
In such LG bodies, both parties and independent groups are negotiating with each other to obtain a working majority.
It is said that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which won the majority of Local Government bodies at the recent election is in a dilemma to form an administration in at least 160 LG bodies as they have no working majority.

Peradeniya Teaching Hospital creates history
The Peradeniya Teaching Hospital has created history by being the first and only hospital in South Asia to have successfully performed 100 kidney transplants on children.
This achievement was made within 14 years after performing the first such kidney transplant in 2004.
The hospital was able to make this achievement due to the dedicated contribution of the entire hospital staff, including doctors, Consultant Surgeon Prof. M. D. Lamawansa said.
The Professor disclosed this addressing a ceremony at the hospital premises on February 16, with the participation of children who had received a new lease of life following kidney transplants received at the hospital.
Prof. Lamawansa said children who underwent kidney transplants earlier faced certain death.
A child received a kidney transplant should at least be 2-years-old and 10 kilogrammes in weight. However, they were able to perform a kidney transplant on a child who was 1 year 8 months old and 8 kilogrammes in weight and this even gained international acclaim, consultant Paediatrician Prof. Asiri Abeygunawardene said.
At this ceremony Miss Min Hadjiar, the first child to undergo a kidney transplant in 2004 and V. Danukshan of Batticaloa the 100th child to undergo a transplant conveyed their thanks and compliments to the doctors who gave them a new lease of life.
Hospital Director Dr. Arjuna Tillakaratne, Consultants Dr. Oswald Fernando, Dr. Tilak Abeysekara, Dr. M. L. S. Beligaswatta, Dr. Arjuna Aluvihare, Dr (Ms) Vasanthi Pinto, Dr. Kapila Gunawardene, Dr. Channa Ratnatunge, Dr. Chula Gunasekera, Dr. Gamini Buthpitiya and the rest of the hospital staff were also present.

## Title: Poetry of Puritanism
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, February 19, 2018 - 01:00
Poetry of Puritanism
Looking back I realize that I have spent a great part of my adult life working to rescue wounded or discounted reputations. Ive always known that there are risks. To say that Jonathan Edwards is not hip is to test the limits of understatement. As much might be said of Shakespeares Henry VI plays, John Calvin, Puritanism.
At this point in my life there can be no doubt about the tropisms of my mind and soul, even though for a long time I thought I was just tidying up a few misunderstandings for my own sake, before I went on to other work.
I somehow thought I was devoting the time to people and things that lacked poetry, were utterly unpoetical  believing what was always told me, implicitly and explicitly. These stereotypes are hard to eradicate, however unwelcome they might be. Distinguished names associated with Puritanism in England include Edmund Spenser, Mary and Philip Sidney, Arthur Golding, Thomas Middleton, Fulke Greville, Andrew Marvell, John Milton, John Bunyan.
In Britain, social and legal disabilities as well as outright persecution discouraged nonconformist loyalties, especially before and after the parliamentary revolution and the Commonwealth.
So the style of thought, the world view, associated with Puritanism naturalized itself to the environment of the dominant culture. But about these figures I have named there is no ambiguity.
Polemical sense
It is true that their writing does not satisfy the polemical sense of the word Puritan, which is so overwhelmingly its modern sense that the most careful efforts at historical precision in the use of the word are always compromised by its associations with priggishness, acquisitiveness, hypocrisy, narrow-mindedness, and fanaticism. Still, for years I accepted, or did not know how to reject, the bleak stereotype, when it is precisely the poetry of Puritanism, and more generally the use and celebration of the English language always associated with it, that has enlisted my devoted attention.
Europeans often say our culture is Puritan  Lollard, according to Freud  and we dont know enough history to understand what they might mean by this. We have made a project of freeing ourselves of even minimal standards of taste or discretion, and still the word clings.
Ethical rigor, aversion to display, the ideal of vocation are all diminished things among us, and still we are Puritan. Most recently I heard us denounced in these terms at a dinner table in London. How horrifying our rules against sexual harassment! It is the most natural thing in the world for students to fall in love with their professors, subordinates with their superiors! And so on.
My suggestion that this might all seem very different from the perspective of the student or the subordinate, and my thoughts about fairness, merit, and so on, were not of interest. They were merely one more Puritanical pretext for denying the pleasures of life. I think in many cases Puritanical may simply mean reformist, tending to assume that even very settled cultural patterns and practices can be called into question, that they are not presumptively endorsed by culture, that what is traditional cannot claim therefore to be rooted in human nature. We tend to forget that our revolution was one in a series  Geneva expelled its Savoyard rulers and was governed by elected councils. The Dutch expelled the Hapsburg emperor and in the process trained sympathetic British volunteers who took the experience home with them.
Parliamentary government
Then with the Puritan Revolution England tried and executed its king and attempted a decade of parliamentary government. More than a century later the American colonies rejected monarchy as a system on the basis of the abuses of the king then in power. This is not logical, strictly speaking, but it affiliated the Americans with the great precedent of the English revolution, the revolution of Milton and Marvell. The most revolutionary idea contained in all this is that society as a whole can be and should be reformed. This Puritan energy does indeed continue to animate American life.
Sometimes on the strength of a reformist movement history is recovered  there are innumerable instances of this in the last half century, in this country often as a consequence of the civil rights movement. In Europe, perhaps as a secondary consequence of this movement, Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries have begun to acknowledge the enormous extent of their roles in the Atlantic slave trade. It says a great deal about human consciousness, collective and individual, that a phenomenon of such scale, duration, and consequence could be obscured so thoroughly. One of the many advantages of my long life is that I remember how things were before that old oblivion began to break up a little. The past really is a foreign country, even the near past, the one you have lived through.
You have to have been there to have anything like a true sense of it. This does not make the past understandable, any more than living now makes the present understandable, but it does allow you to call to mind the cohesion of its elements, from which the whole strange mind-set derived its authority, as dreams and eras and cultures do, always including our own.
We continue to learn how important slavery and racism have been to the construction of Western civilization, literally as well as figuratively. Without question we have vastly more to learn.
Through all this it is important to remember that history that is grossly incomplete can feel coherent, sufficient, and true. The reality of history, whatever it is, is perhaps best demonstrated by the power it has when the tale it tells is false.

Short children at higher stroke risk
Short children are at greater risk of suffering a stroke later in life, according to new research. The latest findings were based on more than 300,000 Danish schoolchildren born between 1930 and 1989.
Those who were two inches shorter than average at seven, 10 and 13 were 11 per cent more likely to have an ischaemic stroke as adults than their taller peers. This is the most common form of the disease where a clot blocks blood and oxygen flow to the brain. Most cases were diagnosed between the ages of 55 and 75.
Men, who were short as children were also 11 per cent more likely to suffer a stroke triggered by bleeding on the brain, called an intracerebral haemorrhage. This did not apply to women.
Strokes, which occur when the blood supply to the brain is cut off, are the third most common cause of premature death and a leading cause of disability in the UK. They affect 57,000 people a year in England, alone.
The average height of a 13 year old child is five feet three with a seven year old measuring around four feet. A previous study of more than a million adults found those who were two and a half inches taller than average were six and ten percent less likely to die from an ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhage, respectively.
But this is the first of its kind to look at the link with height in childhood. It could lead to prevention strategies, such as promoting healthier lifestyles for youngsters and encouraging women to eat well in pregnancy.
Senior study author Professor Jennifer Baker said: 'Our study suggests short height in children is a possible marker of stroke risk and suggests these children should pay extra attention to changing or treating modifiable risk factors for stroke throughout life to reduce the chances of having this disease.'
These include healthier diets and protecting against stress, said Professor Baker who is a metabolic geneticist at the University of Copenhagen.
She added: 'Although short stature has associations with the risk of stroke that are nearly as strong as for body mass index, studies investigating growth, as opposed to weight gain, have been neglected.
'A potential explanation is that it is not possible to intervene on adult height, and the effects of doing so in childhood are uncertain.
'However, in addition to being genetically determined, adult height is a marker of exposures affecting childhood growth - for example, maternal diet during pregnancy, childhood diet, infection, and psychological stress - of which many are modifiable and all are thought to affect the risk of stroke.'
Researchers noted that a decline in stroke incidence and mortality rates in most high-income countries, mainly in women, occurred simultaneously with a general increase in adult height.

The collective sale tender attracted keen interest from developers, Colliers International said, adding however that they flagged concerns which included uncertainties arising from the Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS) on traffic impact which will affect the number of units that can be built on the site.
The collective sale committee then instructed Colliers International to enter into private treaty negotiations with interested parties who needed more time to assess the impact of PAFS.
According to collective sales rules, the owners may enter into a private treaty contract with a buyer within 10 weeks from the close of the public tender. It was during this period, Colliers said, that it managed to seal the deal for Pearl Bank Apartments, selling it to CapitaLand.
The sale price - which met the owners' reserve price - translates to a land cost of about S$ 1,515 per square foot per plot ratio, said Colliers International.
This is after factoring in an upgrading premium of approximately S$201 million for the lease top-up. There is no development charge payable.
The 37-storey development comprises 288 units (280 apartments and eight commercial units) and has a 99-year leasehold tenure with effect from June 1970.
Apartment owners whose unit sizes range from 123 sq m to 371 sq m stand to receive between S$1.8 million and S$4.9 million.
Owners of commercial units with sizes ranging from 65 sq m to 523 sq m will potentially receive between S$1.2 million and S$6.9 million.
In a news release, CapitaLand said it plans to redevelop the site into a high-rise residential development comprising about 800 units with a host of "social, shared facilities which will foster community spirit and celebrate the area's unique heritage".
Our upcoming residential development offers a rare opportunity for young urbanites to own a home in a mature estate brimming with local culture and heritage," said Ronald Tay, CapitaLand Singapore's chief executive officer.
"Targeted for completion by early 2023, right after the opening of the third MRT line in Outram, the Thomson-East Coast line, the commute from the development to Shenton Way, Marina Bay and Orchard will be even more convenient for residents," he added.
The site is subject to the Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS) announced by the Urban Redevelopment Authority last November, which the chairperson of the building's collective sale committee said was a "setback". Channel NewsAsia

Sirio offers financial aid to restore damaged houses
Sirio, a leading export-oriented apparel company in Badalgama, is currently engaged in a programme aimed at offering financial assistance to restore 65 houses to people who suffered losses due to the recent gale that hit the area.
The event to provide financial assistance to such residents, which took place at the company premises, was presided over by Sirio CEO and Omega Line Group Director Felix A. Fernando, Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary H. M. L. S. Herath, Katukenda Grama Niladhari J. P. I. L. Jayakody, and Badalgama Police Kolitha Ranatunga.
Representatives of Sirio Ltd. spoke to residents affected by the disaster, including Sirio employees, to estimate the cost required to repair the damaged houses.
Providing financial assistance was done in three categories. In the first category, finances were provided to fully restore houses of 26 workers of Sirio Ltd. who live in Katukenda, Menikwatte, Diklanda, Heeralugedera, Agalegedera, and Pethigoda. The second category saw financial assistance being provided to people of 15 houses in the vicinity. In the third category, Sirio Ltd. provided financial assistance to renovate houses of 23 families in the Katukenda Grama Niladhari Division (where Sirio is located), who are currently taking refuge in temporary shelter tents provided by the government.
In addition to this, on a request made by Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary H. M. L. S. Herath, Sirio Ltd. offered Rs. 100,000 to an underprivileged mother with a disabled son who also lost their house recently to the inclement weather.
Further, Sirio provided meals for ten days to around 250 families who suffered from the disaster that happened on January 12. The company spent Rs. 1.2 million for this purpose.
Felix Fernando, speaking on this activity, said, The unfortunate incident that took place on January 12 caused damages to houses and also to our company. We realized in the midst of this disaster, how much the youth in the vicinity love our company. Power failure and road blockages due to trees falling on electricity wires caused us losses. Many workers of ours got stranded in the company premises, unable to return to their homes. The youth in the vicinity took swift action to clear the roads and provide us relief.
Because of this mutual relationship between Sirio and the people of Badalgama, we always come forward as a company to help these people when they have difficulties. That is the reason we took immediate steps to restore houses in the vicinity, without sticking to restoring our company premises which too, was affected by the disaster. I must also pay my respect to Chairman Vincenzo Joppolo and Calzedonia Italy Company Chairman Dr. SandroVeronesi for their prompt intervention for this just cause.
Many members of our company too, worked to bring relief to their neighbors, and I pay my respect to them, he added.
The Sirio Company is affiliated to the Calzedonia Group, Calzedonia S. p. A. in Verona City, Italy.

Success story of  an unsuccessful  200 attempts to can  king coconut water
Hela Coco Inventor Hareendra Mahakumara endeavouring to establish a local brand among international soft drink brands said he was unsuccessful 200 times in his attempts to can king coconut water.

Thomas Alva Edison who invented the first incandescent light bulb was unsuccessful for 999 times in his experiments to find the ideal metal for its filament. But he never gave up his efforts and ended up lighting the whole world.
Only people of persistency know that the endless curiosity to succeed in a targeted task and shedding sweat to satisfy it are the roads to success. Such people shed sweat with persistency to achieve their objectives.
Hareendra Mahakumara
Hareendra Mahakumara, whose experiments to make his product successful failed over 200 times, achieved success at the end, becoming an exporter bringing pride to our Motherland.
A statement given to a newspaper by 2012 Olympic Medalist Tennis player Andy Murrayto a newspaper made a deep impact on my mind. He had stated that the energy drink that made way for his victory was young coconut (Kurumba)water. Seeing that, I got desirous of canning, bottling and marketing water from king coconuts and young coconuts, abundantly available in our rural areas.
That was how Hareendra embarked on his long journey. But, his journey was not smooth. All his friends and acquaintances questioned whether consumers will drink bottled and canned king coconut and young coconut water in a country where king coconuts and young coconuts are amply available.
But I did not think the way they did My argument was, If countless bottles of drinking water are selling in this country with so many freshwater resources, is there any reason for bottled king coconut water not selling
Hareendra started bottling king coconut water utilizing his full strength and the support of his family. Soon after opening a king coconut or a young coconut, the water in it is affected by micro organisms, causing differences in taste and freshness. There was no way of preserving it for more than one day under any conditions.
He walked all over the village seeking king coconuts and bottled their water bearing massive business dreams in his mind. But, there was a flaw somewhere.
There were massive errors in my manufacturing methodology. Truly, I was unsuccessful in over two hundred attempts. But, every time I was unsuccessful, I endeavoured to experiment with a new methodology.
Hareendra realized that, if the king coconut is to be sealed as it is opened; new technological machinery is needed for this industry. Even though a local research organization had discovered that technology, Hareendras expectations were in vain as it had been sold to a large-scale manufacturing organization even at that time.
I manufactured the machinery needed for my industry myself. I developed the Beverage Can Seamer, necessary for canning king coconut water truly to the level of an imported machine. Such a machine would cost over rupees two million if imported.
The best evidence of the level of development of Hareendras machine was that two local large-scale organizations getting their beverage can seamer machines manufactured by Hareendra.
Canning and bottling king coconut water under the Hela Coco brand is launched through such a challenging environment. He selected the tourist hotels of this country first as the market for his products.
When I tried to market my Hela Coco energy drink to tourist hotels, their Managers asked me whether I dont have any other product to manufacture other than this nonsense (vikara) product. I did not receive positive feedback from all hotels.
But, not being discouraged by such reactions is an excellent quality that can be observed in him. He always likes facing and overcoming challenges. Hareendra has trained himself to derive satisfaction from overcoming such challenges.
I supplied my product to more and more hotels. Once, a tourist hotel proprietor tasted my energy drink and offered it to tourists in his hotel. Those tourists told me that they got the same enjoyment of drinking a king coconut through drinking the Hela Coco energy drink. The opinions of those tourists made me strive harder.
With his local market gradually developing, Hareendra desired to make themark of a Sri Lankan brand among popular drink brands of the world. The best place for that was the Export Development Board.
Among the State Intuitions of Sri Lanka, the Export Development Board is one institution that extends a helping hand to up-and-coming entrepreneurs and really acts. The field of exports is very complex. The guidance they offer people like us who have only local market experience to overcome its challenges is excellent.
When taking a particular product to the international market, being manufactured to comply with international standards and having quality assurance certificates is as important as creative packaging. Nothing artificial such as taste enhancers, preservatives or chemicals are used in the production process of Hela Coco energy drink. It is a value-added product that can be kept at room temperature for over a year. According to Hareendra, the secret is in its packaging. Furthermore, the Hela Coco energy drink has passed laboratory tests in about 15 countries.
Hareendra, who used to earn a monthly salary through doing sales promotions for various businesses, is today an up-and-coming exporter. By now, he has reached a production capacity of about 30,000 king coconut water cans and bottles.
The nutrients in king coconut water can be absorbed by the body very quickly. Furthermore, the opinion of Doctors is that, king coconut water, having more special nutritional qualities than conventional energy drinks is optimally suitable for those who do tiring work and specially sports persons. There will be a high local and overseas demand for Hareendras indigenous drink in the future because of that.
Hareendra, who had overcome the export barrier in the midst of various challenges and social pressures, has one more dream remaining.
One of my biggest expectations is taking the brand name Hela Coco, manufactured in our country, to the level of cola drinks with the highest demand in the world in five years
He says that, during his endeavours to build up a business enterprise of his own, the only thing he did not do is climbing king coconut trees. All his sacrifices for the sake of his business are embedded in that statement.
As a young entrepreneur, he is sad about not properly utilizing the vigour of youth and mature intellect. He states is not a tragedy that the youth generation, that can supply an invaluable contribution to the economic process of the country, is wasting their time sitting in three-wheelers or seeking Government jobs.
Entrepreneurs change the world. If a youth could experience the happiness of creating a new business enterprise, he or she will realize that that is the highest happiness that can be experienced.
Isnt this young man of courage that has conquered the world of exports, requesting the whole youth generation to attain the exhilaration of entrepreneurship he is experiencing
