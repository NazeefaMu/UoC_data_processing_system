Anxious US teachers train for school shootings
US: "Active shooter, active shooter!" comes the announcement over the megaphone, brutally interrupting a typical morning at Harry S Truman High School in Levittown, Pennsylvania.
Stress kicks in immediately. In seconds, tables are turned over and rammed up against the door to barricade the classroom. The shooter cannot enter.
The flurry of activity is just an exercise -- but one repeated across the country in hundreds of American school districts.
After a scourge of shootings have killed dozens in schools and colleges, training programs have been set up to help teachers react quickly to the invasion of a shooter on campus.
This morning, around 30 adults gather in the library to listen to a trainer reel off statistics and advice, before splitting into small groups to take part in practice drills in unused classrooms.
Barricade the door with tables and chairs. Disperse within the room. Look for an escape route. And if the shooter comes in, create a disturbance or throw whatever you can to cause a distraction.
"There are more options than sit and wait," says trainer Michael Kimball, a former police officer who says most shootings only last a few minutes and often end before the police turn up.
The two-day training, organized by local and regional authorities, costs $595 per person.
It is geared towards teachers and school support staff as well as fire fighters, police and other security professionals, all concerned about being prepared in the event of the worst.
Former police officer Greg Crane, whose wife used to be an elementary school principal, set up the training after the 1999 Columbine massacre. It is called ALICE, which stands for Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter and Evacuate.
The institute says it has trained more than a million people in 2,600 school districts, 600 universities, 2,300 law enforcement agencies, 700 businesses and 500 healthcare facilities. Those who take part are told how to react, handle stress, know their environment and how a shooter behaves psychologically.
"When you train you learn to win," Kimball told them, explaining that a shooter believes he is all powerful but that's not necessarily so. "If you take the control from them, they have nothing else," he said. Those taking part in the training in Levittown are confronted with six possible scenarios, including a shooter invading the school and a student whipping out a firearm in class. The scenes, which unfold after a megaphone announcement, play out very quickly as if in real life, followed by a debriefing where laughter chases away the stress.
"We are teaching them life skills, we are teaching them common sense... to help to mitigate losses and injuries when there is a violent intruder or violent killer," Kimball told AFP.
Success is a question of making the situation harder for the shooters -- to "slow them down" -- when each second counts. "The most important thing... is for you to be proactive for your own safety," Kimball explains.
In the classroom, the participants play along, barricading themselves when a shooter barges in. On another occasion, they jump on the fake shooter in order to stop him.
Mike McHugh, a special education teacher for disabled teenagers, is planning to adapt the training for his students. "It's kind of scary, but we are going to practice, building a barricade, seeing whether we can get out of the window," he said, adding that he would have to go through it several times given the challenges that his students face.- AFP

Sharmini Tennakoon:
A sister like no other
It was past midnight last year on November 10 when my brother Anil rang me and conveyed the sad news that my sister Sharmini had passed away.
Had she followed the doctors advice earlier that evening and gone back for the nebulizer test she would have still been with us. The fact of the matter was that she was not concerned about her own health but cared for others.
She had a commitment to care for the less fortunate, specially children. During the tsunami days, working for the YWCA, she went out of her way to get some funds from overseas to build houses for those in the beach area in Panadura whose houses had been washed away. They were filled with gratitude and came to pay their respects on the day of her funeral.
My sister worked very closely with the YWCA over the years, arranging programmes like drama, harvest festivals, sing alongs, and conducting health clinics. She was doctor on call for me. Even for a common cold she advised me what to take. Sharmini was a regular radio listener to the SLBC and often requested songs of her choice. On many occasions along with her late husband Indra, she organised Christmas and birthday parties at their home. Two weeks prior to her death, she rang me and said she would do everything for my birthday on October 27 and planned the whole menu. Before she left my home, she promised to do the same the following year, but a few days after that she passed away.
A large crowd was present at her funeral to show their gratitude, including many members of the YWCA. She was excellent in English like our father, and used to write to the press regularly. She worked as a librarian at the public library both at Panadura and Colombo.
My sister was a good practicing Christian and served the Catholic Church in Panadura in her later years.
Had she cared more about her health, she would have still been with us. We sincerely miss her, but there are no tears in heaven.

Keerthi Sri Karunaratna :
Charming, well mannered and simple
The most senior king of the fashion world is no more! After nearly six decades of untiring work, he left us. It is undoubtedly a great loss to the fashion conscious females, especially a few who craved for publicity.
Keerthi, to everybody who knew him, was a charming, well mannered, simple and an unassuming person who was sincere and honest up to the letter.
He was a man of few words, who firmly believed in the adage, Lend your ear, to every man, but few thy voice,Take every man Censure but, reserve thy judgement. (Shakespeare)
He never spoke ill of others nor did he carry tales against his clients. That was one secret of his popularity.
At an interview with the print media once, he recalled his salad days as a young fashion designer.
"I started my fashion career just after leaving Ananda College, Colombo. I had a love for art and that kindled my talents in designing clothes, my mother was my first model.
Paying a tribute to his mother he commented: "It was her patience, that I inherited later, which paved my way to success as a designer."
He had a rare talent of turning out ugly ducklings to angels with his expertise in makeup. He was well recognised by all he knew him for his genuine comments that never gave hard feelings to any of them.
He was very hospitable and never failed to serve his visitors with his favourite food, club sandwiches with asparagus.
The thousands of females dressed by him include brides, models, and beauties for parades.
He was so humble in his speech that it takes me back to a comment he made once: "I am saving money to visit USA."
He fulfilled his desire before he bade good bye forever. He travelled by bus and continued to save for the trip.
He passed away recently after a prolonged illness. It is undoubtedly a great loss to the fashion conscious females both young and old! May he attain the eternal bliss of Nirvana!!

John Newton Fernando:
He did much for us
It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I pen these few lines on behalf of my brother and sister about my father, John Newton Fernando who died on October 16 at the age of 95.
His father, Marshall Fernando was a brilliant cricketer and scored the first century for St. Benedict's College. Having completed his education at St. Mary's College, Negombo, he joined a private bank and was also their goal keeper. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living pensioner at the bank. He was a gifted musician and could play any instrument and participated in many musical programmes at the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation along with famous singers like Vincent de Paul Peries, Patrick Denipitiya and others.
He married Doreen Fernando in 1949.
My father helped me and my brother to be champion athletes at St. Benedict's College from under 13 to 19 and also to win public school athletic meets. This is a temporary departure and we know when the Lord comes for his bride, his soul, now in the presence of the Lord, will be brought and given a new body to live with him eternally and if we are alive, our bodies will be changed and given new bodies and will join him to meet the Lord in the air [1 thessolonians ch4:13-17]

Hameed Abdul Kareem:
A longstanding friend
O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be (against) rich or poor: for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest ye swerve, and if ye distort (justice) or decline to do justice, verily Allah is well- acquainted with all that ye do.Verse 135 of Surah Al Nisa (The Women) of the Noble Quran.
Hameed Abdul Kareem that we knew is someone who lived by this command of Allah, the Most Just. Hameed was a man of principle who spent his time, mind and energy on the path of justice and care for other human beings.
His heart would warm, his mind would cogitate and his body would haste to act, whenever and wherever he saw people suffer injustice or oppression. His constant words for those who are suffering, against the perpetrators, spoke of his relentless determination to get the message across, to be a voice for the voiceless.
Hameed was a longstanding friend, who was a livewire at the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine. He identified himself with the struggle of the Palestinian people, who lost their loved ones, their lands, their livelihoods and their country but never lost their dignity or resolve.
Hameed never missed a meeting, as long as he was in Sri Lanka, or never missed a commitment. His concern and energy were contagious, able to awaken good souls to empathize and act.
Prophet Muhammed said, The best of people are those that bring most benefit to the rest of mankind.
Indeed, we felt he was amongst the best of us, while he was with us. May Allah, with His Grace, make him amongst the best in the Hereafter, and grant him the highest level of paradise.

Dr. Shankilal Seresinhe:
He led a full life
Fifteen years ago on November 13 morning my husband and father of Avantha and Ruwini passed away suddenly.
His death at the age of 51 came as a severe shock to me and to my children as well as to our family members, relatives, colleagues and friends.
After completing higher studies in Switzerland, he returned to Sri Lanka in 1992 and served the University of Ruhuna for a short time.
Both of us with post-graduate qualifications from Switzerland and as a family started our lives and university carriers with a fresh outlook. None of the many people whom he met would have ever thought that within a few years he would depart from us for good.
Everyone thinks that I am strong and has moved on.
Adequate time has passed, they say. What is adequate time I was left with my two children, 18-year-old son and eight and a half year old daughter. I had to continue but I still feel so lonely at times without my husband, precious father, batch mate, colleague,friend and an academic of the same university.
He has been such an integral part in our lives. With his sudden departure, a great vacuum was created in our lives, because, I lost his great partnership which we developed through years sharing all aspects in our lives.
I met him for the first time in 1973 at Mahailluppallama sub-campus during the first year practical training of our undergraduate career.
He was very friendly and cheerful at all times and shared his knowledge gathered during school days with us. Subsequently, we became good friends and I knew that there was something special about him.
He was my very first friend at the university. He has been my best friend ever since and we became wonderful friends and were inseparable. Ultimately we became lifelong partners until his untimely death.
All of us who knew Sera find it hard to reconcile ourselves. But we have the satisfaction of knowing that although its short, he lived a full life; performed his duties devotedly and meticulously as a husband, father, son, and brother and also as an academic.
He left an enormous reservoir of goodwill and fond memories. Sera was a dedicated teacher who often demonstrated his practical experiences to the students. His talented teaching and practical lessons conducted for under graduates are being still conversed among the staff and students.
Sera was always honest in all his dealings, adhered to principles and was unbiased, which amply reflected his refined teaching and administrative carrier at the university.
He was very strict about his own and family discipline as well as of the university students. Sera was a very independent person who managed his own affairs well and was satisfied with what he had.
Still as a family, we respect his great virtues and try to live the way he led us by example. As a Christian married to a Buddhist, he allowed the children to follow a religion of their choice with an open mind, typically illustrating Seras nature and attitude towards many such aspects in his life.
He always wanted to have a closely knit family life with full of love and affection to each other.
He also had a pioneering spirit and a desire to educate the son and daughter with great care and to give them meaningful lives. However, I am revived and strengthened and even given courage by his spirit to take on my family in to greater heights. So far I am happy with the progress of our family and achievements of our children.
I believe that we have so far lived up to his expectations with great respect to him. My grievance is that, he is not fortunate enough to share the achievements of our children along with me.
He got others to agree to his will not with brashness or aggression, but with quiet poise, dignity and his own distinctive brand of compassion.
For me, Sera represented a kind of ideal academic, administrator and a true gentleman. But above all that, he was my loving husband and precious father of my children.

Dr. Ajantha Horadagoda:
An inspiring teacher
This is a personal tribute to Dr Ajantha Horadagoda who passed away on October 18, 2015 in Sydney, Australia.
Dr. Horadagoda was my biochemistry teacher during the first year at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences at the University of Peradeniya. She introduced us to amino acids  the foundation of life. Yet, unbeknown to her, by example, she also introduced us to the foundations of a life worth living:seamless kindness, empathy, generosity, humility, joy and the love of adventure.
Accomplished yet humble, helpful yet unassuming, simple, righteous, caring, and down-to-earth  she had it all.
She represented the good as we know it, as defined by any religion. We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths....  as such, she lived her life to the fullest.Yet, in truth, it offers little reparation for the gaping void in those she left behind.
The role Dr. Horadagoda played in our lives extended far beyond any job description of a university lecturer.
I will always gratefully remember the time she accompanied me to the hospital in her own vehicle as I was preparing for my Final Year examination and had fallen ill. Similarly, when my best friend was admitted to the ICU, she sat with us on a hospital bench until past midnight until the critical hours passed.
She even brought freshly laundered towels from home. These are, by no means, isolated incidents as each student had their own story to relate as to how she had helped them at some point in their lives.
I have admired not only Dr. Horadagoda's altruism but also her courage and conviction in helping people through numerous situations.
Her kindness transcended people of all walks of life. She saw no boundaries. It did not matter what you were. Or what you werent. For her, any individual was first and foremost a human being; and they were fallible. She seemed silently determined that no one deserved to be isolated irrespective of controversy, political correctness or popular view.
Her exuberant personality came through even in the lecture hall. Interesting examples often brought to life the most mundane of topics, making them memorable to us, to this day. Her remarkable ability to remember (quite literally) all our names (and our nick names too) meant that we could not dodge her questions or skip practical classes. If she noticed us catching a quick snooze during an after-lunch lecture, we were all good-naturedly put through a couple of minutes of stretches.
In spite of the many academic accolades and positions of responsibility she held, Dr. Horadagoda remained very much an 'undergrad at heart. She enjoyed the company of students and was even happy to play cupid for a number of blossoming romances. On educational excursions she was as delighted as the students to make an unscheduled dip in a random roadside brook - fully clothed in day attire.
On such an occasion I was partnered with her in an impromptu water-polo match that was played with a coconut husk where I was left defending a highly competitive player.
On her last day at Peradeniya before leaving for Australia in 2002, a long line of students patiently queued at the Faculty Biochemistry building to bid her good bye - Veterinary students and others; seniors and juniors; Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese; the toffs and the union leaders - they were all there, I too amongst them.
To this day I am amazed to have witnessed such a scene - a rare occurrence no doubt in a university setting. Inside the building, Dr. Horadagoda stood at the centre of the hall as grateful students fell at her feet, one by one. She hugged them all and at times ruffled their hair fondly as one would do to a young child.
Perhaps to her, all these strapping men and young women symbolised just that - children in the wider context of society. She took us under her wing, batch by batch, and watched us over  like a mother would do. I am one amongst hundreds that she fondly referred to as Mage lamai  her brood of adopted kids from Peradeniya that mourns her absence today.
I've known Dr. Horadagoda for almost 20 years. Even after she left for Australia she kept in touch with me as she did with many of her other students who were scattered across the continents. She followed us closely and was proud of our achievements but was quick to reach out and comfort us at times the unexpected happened and our worlds crumbled for various reasons, as they occasionally did.
With her endearing smile she graciously shared our burden, offering us gentle reassurances.
Today too our world has crumbled once again and we silently mourn the parting of an inspiring teacher, a true friend, and an exceptional human being. If you believed in angels on earth, to the many students at Peradeniya, she was one of them.
I will think of her often, fondly, and with profound gratitude, for I amongst many others were truly privileged to have known her. "When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth, you are weeping for that which has been your delight - Kahlil Gibran
My dearest teacher, may you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Avant Garde employed over 2,000 Army deserters - Fonseka
The Avant Garde Company employed over 2,000 Army deserters and earned money illegally during the last three years, said Democratic Party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
He said this matter could be investigated by checking the names of security guards the Company employed with the lists of the Army deserters in the Police.
Fonseka made these observations at a press conference at the Democratic Party headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
"The Avant Garde employed more than 4,000 workers and 50 percent of them were Army deserters," Field Marshal Fonseka said. "It underpaid its employees and got the services of deserters getting the cover of the then Defence Secretary."
Fonseka said the head of the Avant Garde Company spoke to him over the telephone three days after the Presidential election and offered to fund his general election campaign fully.
"I said he could fund the construction of my Party Office but I would never call off investigations over allegations against him," Fonseka said. "However he did not call me later".
He said he was aware for whom Avant Garde funded during the last election campaigns.
"Did the UNPers vote for Wijayadasa Rajapaksa to protect Avant Garde Company and its leaders, Gotabhaya Rajapksha or any other corrupt Rajapaksa" Field Marshal questioned. "Wijayadasa Rajapaksa says persons who speak against Avant Garde are those who were not funded by it".
Field Marshal Fonseka said the same statement implies that those who attempt to protect Avant Garde are those who are bribed.

DP wants Wijayadasa removed from ministerial portfolio
The Democratic Party urges the President, the Prime Minister and the government to remove Wijayadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial portfolio as his conduct is not fitting for the Good Governance Government, party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
He said the party would urge President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to remove Rajapakshe who is acting with a hidden agenda before he defames the good governance government and damages its image. Field Marshal Fonseka made these observations at a press conference at the DP headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
"Wijayadasa Rajapakshe is attempting to cross over and join the Rajapaksa gang," he said.
"This is why he has suddenly begun praising the Rajapaksas."
Field Marshal Fonseka said Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said that there were no computer gimmicks at the 2010 election.
He said Rajapakshe was the only UNPer who said the 2010 election was fair.

Fonseka to sue Wijayadasa for Rs. 5,000 million
Democratic Party leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said he would sue Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe demanding Rs. 5,000 million as damages. He made this observation at a press conference at the Democratic Party headquarters at Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday.
Field Marshal Fonseka said he would sue the minister for making defamatory and false allegations against him. "If an attorney is worth Rs. 500 million, a Field Marshal is worth Rs. 5,000 million," Fonseka said. "Wijayadasa Rajapakshe misled the media by saying that Danuna Thilakaratne (who is no more a relative now) had asked permission to release Rs. 80 million belonging to Hicorp," he said. "It was a letter seeking permission to release Rs. 6 million that he had saved in his bank accounts which was later sealed by court."
Fonseka said it was also contempt of court.
He added that Thilakaratne too could sue Minister Rajapakshe.
"Wijayadasa Rajapakshe had attempted to translate my rank of Field Marshal into Sinhala in a funny manner," Fonseka said. "There are only a few Field Marshals in the world which includes Prince Charles."
He said Rajapakshe attempted to humiliate President Maithripala Sirisena by humiliating the rank offered to him for his services rendered to the country.
Fonseka said the name Wijayadasa could be translated into English as "Victory Servant" if it was translated in that funny manner that Wijayadasa translated the rank of Field Marshal into Sinhala.
He said Rajapakshe's business friends gave him only Rs. 5 million during the 2010 election period.
"If the businessmen gave him Rs. 50 million as he says the rest might have been stolen by him assuring the businessmen that the money was given to me," Fonseka said.
He added that Rajapakshe gave him only five national suits and not 25 as he told the media.
Fonseka said the clothes were not of good quality as those given in prison.
He added that his security guards used them to wash his car.
"It was so useful and I thank him for the same," Fonseka said. "People who speak later of what they give are called Hene Mama (Uncle from Chena) in my village. What do you call such people in your villages" Fonseka questioned.
"I was not given Rs. 8,000 million for my election campaign in 2010 as Rajapakshe said but Rs. 250 million," Fonseka said.
"I had to pay Rs. 12 million for the office opposite Royal College, Rs. 40 million for T-shirts, Rs. 100 million for electronic media advertisements and Rs. 80 million was taken by the then government".
He added that he did not steal them like Rajapakshe.
Fonseka said he never requested Rajapakshe to arrest Gotabhaya Rajapaksa or anybody else.
He added that he openly urged to take action against those who committed offences.
Fonseka said he openly said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had committed offences when constructing his parents' monuments and from the Api Wenuwen Api Fund.
Field Marshal Fonseka said there was nothing wrong in LTTE suspects and convicts being released under certain conditions.
He added that they have served a sentence for years.
Fonseka said if the second in command of the LTTE like KP was living freely, the others too should be given the same freedom.

Goodbye letter from resistance fighter delivered 70 years on
GERMANY: The family of a World War II Dutch resistance fighter killed in a Nazi concentration camp has received his farewell letter seven decades on, an archive centre said Thursday.
Peter Will wrote the goodbye letter to his wife and six sons shortly before he was deported to a concentration camp in 1944 by his Nazi captors.
That letter would not find its way to its intended recipients until this year when a family friend spotted a wallet belonging to Will while surfing an online archive documenting the fate of Nazi victims.
That discovery led to the return of the wallet -- which held not just the letter, but also photos -- to the family, said the International Tracing Service (ITS) archive.
"It was extremely emotional for us. This isn't something you expect any more," said one of Peter's sons, Joop Will, who was just 10 years old when his father was captured. "There is no end to the story for us, it is always in our thoughts," he said.
Peter's family had not expected to find any more personal belongings after his bible, wedding ring and a fountain pen had already been returned to them as early as in 1949.
But it turned out that the wallet had been mistakenly matched to someone else's name. Over the years, Joop's brothers Peter and Bert have been tracing the life of their father and had even compiled a book about it.
They found out that their father, a meat inspector, had helped downed Allied pilots to escape, including hiding them in an abandoned shed at a slaughterhouse. "After learning this, the older sons recalled that their father would often stand on the terrace, holding a pair of binoculars, watching the air attacks and then would disappear," said the ITS.
He was finally arrested in Nijmegen in December 1943, and was killed in the final days of the war in 1945.
His family decided not to speak about the content of the letter.

Avant Garde: MR in premature delight
Govt. turns political typhoon into storm
Writing on this day of National Mourning at the passing away of the Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, this is a further lament for this sad loss to our people and country. We have lost one who enhanced the abiding respect for his robe through years of service to the Buddha Sasana, and extended it towards an unmatched commitment to political change to preserve democracy and a civilized society. The lament at this great loss must lead us to the path that will help our society realize the goals that he fought so hard for, especially in his final years. These came through giving leadership to the National Movement for a Just Society, which championed the cause for a Common Candidate to challenge President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and helped bring to an end the many dangers that such an extended term would have brought to the country.
He gave leadership to a political campaign that political leaders were unable or unwilling to accept. He gave guidance to a campaign that sought a commonality of purpose far beyond the capability of the opposition political leaders of the day; and, had the daring to challenge a leadership that had already shown contempt for serious opposition and vengeance to those who dared stand against the power that prevailed.
Regrettably, or through the impact of fate on our society, if such is possible, at the time the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera was closing his eyes to this world, far away in Singapore, we were caught in the midst of an emerging political typhoon, arising from a key issue he was deeply concerned about in his campaign for good governance. It was the Avant Garde affair.
What would have been a political typhoon of major destructive impact on the Government, has now been changed to a political storm by the even belated action of the Government to revoke all pacts with Avant Garde and go ahead with prosecutions against individuals and institutions involved. This would seem an unplanned but a deserving tribute to the late Ven. Sobitha Thera, knowing his commitment to the fight against corruption.
Avant Garde remains
The departure of Tilak Marapana from the Cabinet, over the Avant Garde issue, good as it was, did not defuse the issue. Even though belated, his realization of the error in defending his legal client in Parliamentary debate is welcome. Yet, there were many unresolved issues in this matter that cannot be concluded with a single resignation. It appears that both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe understood the major rumblings of Avant Garde that will continue in consensual governance, involving the two major parties in the country.
Underscoring the very nature of the issue is the public boast by Mahinda Rajapaksa to the media that "Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana, being an honest politician, had told the truth about Avant Garde in Parliament....If the Minister of Law and Order, the Justice Minister and the Attorney General are speaking the truth, what others are speaking about Avant Garde is nonsense," the former President said.
The Government's action to revoke the pacts with Avant Garde and proceed with prosecutions gives the lie to this boast by the leader of the Government that promoted the Avant Garde corruption and criminality. The fact is the truth about Avant Garde has yet to come out. There is an inquiry about a floating armoury recently intercepted by the Sri Lanka Navy, found to have weapons not initially declared, more weapons than were subsequently admitted, weapons that had their serial numbers erased, and a huge amount of ammunition, too. There is much more than a boatload of questions about this arms shipment alone that will require the closest examination, before any receipt of honesty and clearance is issued to Avant Garde, and those who were responsible for promoting its activities, during the past regime and even today. It is important to note that this floating armoury was not included in the observations made to Court by the Attorney General, and referred to by Mr. Marapana in Parliament.
Importantly, we are now reminded that the Attorney General's original investigation report on Avant Garde presented to the National Executive Council earlier this year, recommended criminal action be instituted against the institution and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, which recommendations were not implemented.
It is, therefore, far too early for Mahinda Rajapaksa or Tilak Marapana to give a clean sheet to Avant Garde, and far ahead of any proper legal possibilities to arrest any person, however important, on this most sensitive matter of the issue and control of arms.
The matter of permitting or allowing the arrest of persons on this issue needs emphasis, because of the statement by a Cabinet Minister himself, that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, responsible for forming Avant Garde, would not, or should not, be arrested because he played a major role in the defeat of the LTTE. The role that anyone played in the defeat of the LTTE, especially in leadership positions, will always earn due respect. But such respect and regard surely cannot be extended to matters that had nothing to do with the battle to defeat the LTTE, and is very much involved with the depths of corruption to which the country was dragged.
Such thinking, even coming from the Ministry of Justice, could also be used to prevent any action against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too, on matters of established corruption or alleged criminality, because he gave political leadership to the defeat of the LTTE. It must be recalled that both the President and Prime Minister have acknowledged this leadership role of Mahinda Rajapaksa, but remain bound by the mandate of the people to cleanse this land of the forces of corruption. Those who make such calls to prevent the arrest of key personalities, involved in criminal or fraudulent activity, are obviously not aware of the mandate given by the people for good governance on January 8, under the clear guidance of the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
This is worth remembering by all who benefited from the late Ven. Sobitha Thera's guidance and leadership, and hold important positions today, at the time when the nation mourns his demise and extends to him our sincere wishes for the eternal bliss of Nirvana.
Challenges to unity
The coming weeks will be of the utmost importance to the Government, in ensuring its unity based on consensual understanding within a Grand Coalition. The challenges to unity will be varied with the new "Joint Opposition" in Parliament led by Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena; the emergence of trade union opinion against the move to take the EPF away from the Central Bank and merge it with the ETF, under a different administration; increased activity on the call for the release of all Tamils held under detention without indictment, trial or conviction; and, the continuing voices against the issues of Geneva 2015.
The manner in which Mahinda Rajapaksa used the resignation of Tilak Marapana and what he said in Parliament on Avant Garde in an attempt to show that all charges of corruption against the Rajapaksa regime are not valid or false, is just one aspect of the range of challenges the Government will have to face in the coming weeks.
The emerging divisions within the TNA - gaining increasing importance, can be a major burden in carrying out the tasks of peace building and reconciliation. This will require swifter action, especially by President Sirisena, on pledges made in the Yahapalanaya Manifesto and his address to the nation at the last Independence Day, on peace building based on development, reconciliation and understanding. The challenges to this will come from the pro-racist grouping in the new "Joint Opposition" that will seek to gain strength from any direct political activity in the North, and the release of Tamil detainees, whether in smaller or larger batches.
Moving ahead
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe showed the strategic path ahead for the national economy when he informed Parliament of his Economic Policy Statement last week. Giving flesh to some of the immediate aspects of this Economic Plan will be the first Budget of this consensual government to be presented next week by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The best economic policies will be worthless amidst delays and obstacles in efforts to rid this land of fraud and corruption, as in Avant Garde. The people, who gave their mandate for Good Governance on January 8, are keen to see faster and genuine progress against corruption.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe must be strengthened in the fight against corruption, for the country to reap the fruits of this economic policy, whether this requires more resignations, and speedier arrests that lead to good convictions in court, of whoever deserves it.
Tilak Marapana walked the plank by trying to pass the buck to police creativity and fiction. Remaining firm on a policy of truth will bring the best results.

The Railway Department is running at an annual loss of Rs. 3 billion. If the situation is confounded by problems relating to Trade Union issues, the government may be compelled to lose its attention on the Railway Department which may even lead to the transformation of the Railway Department into an authority, said Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The minister was addressing a meeting attended by delegates of railway unions at the ministry on Thursday.
He said railway employees should not lead themselves into such a predicament by persisting and quarreling with trade union issues. The minister said there were nearly 100 old trade unions in the Railway Department.

Grant redress to tea, rubber and paddy farmers in next budget - Dullas
The government should grant redress to tea, rubber and paddy farmers in the next budget by ensuring they are paid the minimum guaranteed price promised, Matara district Member of Parliament Dullas Alahapperuma said.
The tea and rubber industries are facing a serious crisis due to the drop in global sales which has resulted in the farmers not being paid the government guaranteed price of Rs. 80 per kg of green tea leaves and Rs. 350 per kg for rubber, he told a press briefing in Matara yesterday.
The guaranteed purchase price for paddy is Rs. 50 per kilo. Green tea leaves are purchased between Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 while rubber is purchased at Rs. 190 per kg today. Four tea factories in the Matara district have been forced to stop purchasing green tea leaves, Alahapperuma said. "The tea and rubber industry faced a similar crisis in 2008 but former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to safeguard the tea and rubber farmers as well as the factories. The present government can take similar action and save the tea and rubber industry. We demand that the tea, rubber and rice paddy farmers receive redress and are safeguarded when the government presents the budget next week," he said.

'Harry Potter' gets Hollywood star
US: British actor Daniel Radcliffe, who rocketed to fame in the "Harry Potter" films, said he was "in awe" as he got his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
"A few months ago, I was walking along here with a couple of friends and just becoming sort of in awe and slightly overwhelmed by the names I was going to be joining," said the 26-year-old, who was presented with the 2,565th star.
"Growing up in England, you hear the word Hollywood and right after, you picture the sign on the hill, you picture these stars."
Radcliffe, who played the boy wizard in the wildly popular eight-film blockbuster "Potter" franchise before moving on to more adult roles, was in Los Angeles to promote his new movie "Victor Frankenstein." In the film, which opens in the United States later this month, he plays assistant Igor to the mad scientist obsessed with creating life, portrayed by James McAvoy.
Radcliffe is one of the rare child stars to have successfully maintained his career as he moved into adulthood.
He has starred in a number of films since finishing up as Potter, including "The Woman in Black" and "Kill Your Darlings." He also had a cameo in this year's comedy hit "Trainwreck."
Radcliffe has appeared on Broadway, notably in the musical comedy "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and the psycho-drama "Equus," in which he stunned fans by disrobing on stage.

International sports federation votes to suspend Russia over doping scandal
The International Association of Athletics Federations voted Friday to provisionally suspend Russia as a member amid a doping scandal, the IAAF reported on its website.

The action will keep the All-Russia Athletic Federation, the nation's leading athletic association, out of international competition for an indefinite period that may include the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil.

"This has been a shameful wake-up call and we are clear that cheating at any level will not be tolerated," IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.

"Today we have been dealing with the failure of ARAF and made the decision to provisionally suspend them, the toughest sanction we can apply at this time," Coe said. "But we discussed and agreed that the whole system has failed the athletes, not just in Russia, but around the world."

The 24-1 vote was taken by teleconference. Russia was not allowed to vote

The action by IAAF, the international sports federation that rules over track and field, followed an explosive report that detailed widespread doping in Russian athletics. It said officials at all levels of sport were party to the cheating.

The report -- commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and led by former WADA President and International Olympic Committee Vice President Dick Pound -- detailed a "deeply rooted culture of cheating at all levels" of Russian athletics. It implicated athletes, coaches, doctors, laboratory personnel and even the state itself.

Among the myriad allegations in the report, investigators said athletes were often given notice of out-of-competition tests, used false identities and frequently bribed doping control officers to get around other tests.

The report accused Russia's state security service, the FSB, of using intimidation to influence the operations of a Moscow laboratory whose job it was to test samples for evidence of doping.

The head of that laboratory, Grigory Rodchenko, was identified in the report as an "aider and abettor of the doping activities."

The investigators accused him of leading the destruction of more than 1,400 testing samples despite WADA pleas to preserve them.

The report's authors blasted the IAAF itself, saying the investigation had revealed "corruption and bribery practices at the highest levels of international athletics, evidence of which has been transmitted to Interpol for appropriate investigation."

French prosecutors charged former IAAF President Lamine Diack last week with taking bribes from Russian sports officials to conceal positive doping results, according to media reports. The former head of the agency's anti-doping program, Gabriel Doll, is also facing charges, The Guardian newspaper reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country will conduct its own investigation and will cooperate with sporting federations looking into the allegations, state news agency Sputnik News reported.

Vladimir Putin: 'Russia must protect its athletes'

On Friday, Sputnik quoted Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko as acknowledging some doping problems in Russia, but saying that all Russian athletes shouldn't be penalized. He had previously said Russia is prepared to follow WADA recommendations, the news agency reported.

But International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he didn't think Russia would be suspended from the 2016 Summer Olympics.

"I think also that Russia will cooperate to make progress and to be sure that Russian athletics are compliant with WADA," he said this week. "This is what it needs to be in order to participate in the Olympic Games." (CNN)

ISIS 'claims responsibility' for Paris attack
THE Islamic State terror group has reportedly claimed responsibility for the co-ordinated shootings and bombings across Paris.At least 149 people are said to have been slaughtered in the French capital in a series of co-ordinated attacks last night.

A gunman reportedly shouted "it's for Syria" and "Allahu Akbar"  the Arabic for "God is great"  before slaughtering around 100 music fans at a concert hall.

The attacks came just hours after British ISIS butcher Jihadi John was said to have been killed by a US drone strike in Syria.And several ISIS supporters celebrated the horror attacks attacks using the sick hashtag 'ParisIsBurning'.

One said: "God is great and thank God for these lone wolf attacks. At least 100 hostages and countless wounded."

His tweet was sent from the Kuwait port of Mina Abdulla, according to Twitter's location settings.

Another added: "Oh God, burn Paris as you burned the Muslims in Mali, Africa, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine."

Some fans even boasted London, Rome and Washington DC would hit by the next horror attacks.

But some social media users used the hashtag to share their sympathy with those hurt and killed in the attacks.

Cameron Dylong said: "Prayers up to Paris right now."

And Armani Bradley wrote: "Disgusting how ISIS Twitter accounts are hashtagging 'Paris is burning'.

"Celebrating the deaths of innocent people, what a vile world we live in."
In January, ISIS praised two gunmen who killed 12 people at the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

The terror group called them "heroic jihadists", according to the Site Intelligence Group.

In June, a suspected Islamist decapitated a man in a gas factory in the south-eastern city of Lyon.

Two months later three tourists overpowered a heavily armed gunman linked to ISIS on a Paris-bound train. (express.co.uk)

In the early days it was played every year, once in 2006 to 2009 the game was not held, again it was revived after a lapse of four years 2010.
This time the game was played at the Peradeniya University grounds. The forecast was gloomy with just a few glimpses of sun predicted during the day.
The biggest mistake made by the medical side was they took strike on the wet wicket first. Any way both the Doctors and Lawyers were on the field to give of the best. The Lawyers team led by Pradeep Wijeratne combined to bowl out the Doctors for 80 runs in just 27.2 over's. Captain of the side Raskika Manatunge batted well to score 20 runs and Doctors folded meekly due mainly to excellent bowling by Supun Rajapakse (4 for 12) , Jeewan Basnayake (4 for 17) and Ranjan Ranatunge (2 for 8). It was very cautious start by the Lawyers, former skipper Roshan de Rafayel batting in good form added 40 runs off the first few over's. Jeewan Basnayake made a quick unbeaten 15 Charuka Kanakahewa and Suenth Chandraratne bowled best to pocket two wickets each for 26 runs.
Kandy Doctors XI: 80 all-out in 27.2 overs (Rasika Manatunga 20, Jeevan Samarasekara 14 not out, Supun Rajapakse 4 for 12, Ranjan Ranatunge 2 for 8, Jeewan Basnayake 4 for 17)
Kandy Lawyers XI: 81 for 4 wickets in 23.3 over's (Roshan Rafayel 40, Jeevan Basnayake 15 not out, Charuka Kanmakwhewa 2 for 26, Suneth Chandraratne 2 for 26)

"A good coach will make his players see what they can be, rather than what they are." A good coach is a man who always works behind the scenes, and yet remains one of the key reasons for his team's success, that is Aubrey's style.

## Title: Key questions answered following Wada report
## Supertitle:

## Date: Saturday, November 14, 2015 - 01:00
Key questions answered following Wada report
Athletics has been shaken by the doping allegations contained in the World Anti-Doping Association's (Wada) independent report - but who is involved and what might it mean for the future of athletics
What are the key findings
Russia is alleged to have 'sabotaged' London 2012 through systemic doping: Many of Russia's athletes at London 2012 had suspicious doping profiles, including 800m champion Mariya Savinova.
Some athletes are alleged to have refused and avoided tests: Athletes refused to take doping tests, gave incorrect phone numbers to anti-doping officials, paid money to cover up positive tests and returned from doping bans early.
Russia could be banned from sending competitors to the Rio Olympics if the IAAF upholds Wada's recommendation
Some doctors, coaches and lab staff were in on the alleged cover-up:Doctors and coaches provided banned substances to athletes, coaches and team officials hindered and bullied anti-doping officials, and laboratory personnel destroyed samples and covered up positive tests.
And so too was the Russian government: The Russian security service FSB allegedly operated a "culture of intimidation" at the anti-doping labs, and it was "inconceivable" that Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko did not know what was going on.
The IAAF was 'inexplicably lax' in tackling the problem: Athletics' global governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations failed to deal with the problem until it was too late, delaying its investigation of individual cases so long that suspect athletes were allowed to compete in London.
Wada needs more money: The World Anti-Doping Agency's budget of $30m (20m) a year is too small for it to be effective. It needs more investigators and more resources to increase its educational efforts.
Other countries could be cheating too: Report co-author Dick Pound said the revelations surrounding Russia were "just the tip of the iceberg". He alleged that Kenya "has a real problem with doping and has been very slow to acknowledge it".
Russia could be suspended from the 2016 Olympics: That is the recommendation of the Wada report, if Russia does not "volunteer to take remedial work". IAAF president Lord Coe says the governing body will wait for Russia's response before deciding on a sanction on Friday.
What is the evidence
The report was commissioned to investigate revelations in a documentary by German broadcaster ARD last year that alleged widespread doping in Russian athletics.
It looked at claims made in that programme by whistleblowers from inside the Russian system, including former Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) official Vitaly Stepanov and his wife Yulia (nee Rusanova), formerly an 800m runner who was banned for doping.
There was also testimony from Russian athletes, including former London Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova, who admitted to taking drugs and observing corruption.
It also found evidence of destruction of samples, interference with doping controls, and payment of bribes to conceal positive tests.
Medicine and syringes were found in athletes' rooms at a training camp. The report noted that such was the atmosphere of intimidation, many of its interviewees were afraid to testify for fear of reprisals.
What is Russia's response
It has been mixed. The Kremlin has described the accusations as 'groundless'. The All-Russian Athletics Federation (Araf) said past problems with doping had been tackled and accused Wada of avoiding established protocols for dealing with doping.
The Araf general secretary Mikhail Butov told BBC Newsnight that they were working to "change the mentality of coaches" but that any ban would punish their "clean athletes".
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that thousands of samples were destroyed, but says Russia only did so at Wada's request. Domestically, Russian officials have been painting the report as a "politically motivated hit-job".
However, a statement from the sports ministry said Russia was "fully committed to the fight against doping in sport" and would be prepared to co-operate more closely in order "to perfect its anti-doping system".
And Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded "professional co-operation" with anti-doping bodies after ordering an investigation into the claims.
"The battle must be open," said Putin. "A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."
Have athletes been named
Wada's report recommended that five athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime bans for alleged doping violations.
These allegations are unproven and the athletes (named below) are yet to respond to the report's findings.
The athletes listed below were mentioned in the ARD documentary in December 2014 but the commission says a number of others should also be investigated.
Mariya Savinova - 800m champion at London 2012 and gold medal winner in 800m at the World Championships 2011
Ekaterina Poistogova - 800m bronze medallist at London 2012
Anastasiya Bazdyreva - 400m and 800m runner. Recent winner at Russian Championships
Kristina Ugarova - Currently ranked 110 in the world in the 1500m
Tatyana Myazina - 800m runner
Is Russia alone in systematic doping
Pound's views that these revelations were just the tip of the iceberg were echoed by UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner who suggested there are "four, five or six nations that athletics really has a problem with".
Yet the implications of the report may also not be limited to athletics alone, with Pound adding it is "not the only sport with a doping problem."
Baseball and cycling have also been beset by doping scandals in recent times, while a corruption crisis still engulfs world football's governing body Fifa.
What happens next
IA potential sanction could be the suspension of Russia if such a proposal receives a majority vote, and it could mean Russian athletes are banned from next year's Olympic Games in Rio.
Russia is a global sporting power, having hosted the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and is due to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup.
The report could also have implications for Russia's right to host such events, with UK Athletics chief Warner calling for the country to be stripped of next year's IAAF World Junior Championships in Kazan.
What do the athletes say
Britain's Goldie Sayers finished fourth in the javelin at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
She told BBC Sport the situation had left her "frustrated".
"I'm incredibly saddened and devastated for the sport," Sayers said. "When (athletes) train very hard, to think you've been denied those medals is devastating. Not only professionally but emotionally and financially.
"For most athletes it is the thought that you've lost those moments you'll never get back.
That is the hardest pill to swallow."
AAF president Lord Coe has asked Russia for a response to the report by Friday, when a council will convene to decide the next step.

Luke wants Kiwis to prove they're number one in England finale
London, Thursday: New Zealand have worked hard to establish themselves as the number one team in the world and Issac Luke is adamant they have no intention of relinquishing that title any time soon. Saturday's decisive third and final Test against England provides the Kiwis with the chance to justify their position at the summit of international rugby league.
The series is delicately balanced at 1-1 heading to the north-west town of Wigan, one of English rugby league's heartland clubs.
England scored four tries in a 26-12 victory in the first Test in Hull before the Kiwis fought back in a tight 9-2 win at London's Olympic Stadium last weekend.
New Zealand gained the number one ranking after winning the 2014 Four Nations and the 2015 Anzac Test against trans-Tasman rivals Australia.
And with England not having won a Test series since 2007, Luke is desperate for the Kiwis, coached by Stephen Kearney, to finish off the series in style.
"We've been battling with Australia for quite some time to be able to get the tag off them as the best team in the world and we want to hold on to that as long as we can," said the 28-year-old Luke.
"We've got 80 minutes to play this weekend and we want to show we are the best in the world, capable of beating anyone," he added.
"We came over here to do a job. Unfortunately we didn't manage to do that in the first week but we've managed to turn things around to give ourselves another opportunity to build again this weekend.
"It's a massive game. Both teams have won one each so it's evenly poised. Both teams will definitely be up for it this weekend, there won't be any holding back."
After their impressive defensive showing in London, Kearney has named an unchanged Kiwi squad for Saturday's Test.
- England changes -England coach Steve McNamara, however, has made a couple of changes to his 19-man squad as half-back Matty Smith and winger Jermaine McGillvary are included for the first time in the series -- the latter having been the top try-scorer in Super League last season.
Now McNamara hopes his tweaks to the squad will release the handbrake in attack after England failed to score a try in the second Test. "We should have attacked a little bit better than we did. We didn't score enough points," McNamara said.
"We had a whole lot of work to do in defence but we still needed to put more pressure on New Zealand. We did that the week before pretty successfully."
But while the attack is struggling, England's defence is looking better and better, according to prop Mike Cooper.
"There were a lot of positives from last Saturday," Cooper said.
"I'd say we're even more confident from that game than we were from the first because of the way we defended everything that they threw at us. "It probably took a bit of sting out of our attack so, if we can fix a few things up, we should be all right." AFP

Myanmar polls: Suu Kyi party wins Over 80% of seats
Aung
San Suu Kyi's opposition on Friday won a parliamentary majority from weekend polls that will allow it to elect a president and form a government in a historic shift in power from the army.
The election, the first Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party has contested since 1990, saw a huge turnout that has yielded more than 80 percent of seats for the NLD.
After a drip-feed of results from the Union Election Commission, the NLD on Friday sailed through the two-thirds majority it needs to rule, claiming 348 parliamentary seats with a number of results yet to be declared.
Government now beckons for Suu Kyi's party in a seismic change of the political landscape in a country controlled for five decades by the military.
A comfortable majority gives Suu Kyi's party control of the Lower and Upper Houses, allowing it to elect the President and form the government.
Military establishment
A big majority gives Suu Kyi, 70, leverage in the political wrangling ahead with a military establishment that has been chastened at the polls but retains sweeping powers.
Suu Kyi is barred from the presidency by a junta-scripted constitution, which also guarantees the army a 25 percent bloc of seats.
She has already vowed to govern from "above the President" saying she will circumnavigate the charter ban by appointing a proxy for the top office.
The NLD "will be able to pass whatever law they want, they won't need to form coalitions, they won't need to reach out across the aisle," independent Myanmar analyst Richard Horsey told AFP.
But during the transition the NLD will need to be mindful "to keep everyone on board," he added. Bouyed by the sweep of the polls, Suu Kyi called for "national reconciliation talks" with President Thein Sein and army chief Min Aung Hlaing.
Peaceful transition of power
Both men have congratulated the NLD on its election performance and have vowed to abide by the result as well as help a peaceful transition of power.
Thein Sein's ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, which is made up of former military cadres, has been mauled at the election.
Yet the president, a former general who swapped his uniform for civilian clothes to lead the government in 2011, has won praise for steering the reforms that culminated in Sunday's peaceful poll.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Suu Kyi for her election win, but also hailed the "courage and vision" of Thein Sein for "leadership in the reform process".
The international community has welcomed the election, with US President Barack Obama calling both Suu Kyi and the president to offer his congratulations.
Ahead of the election the US hinted it could rollback more sanctions in reward for a successful and peaceful election.
Obama has staked immense political capital in Myanmar's transition from authoritarian rule to an emergent democracy, backing the NLD's polar force Suu Kyi and visiting the country twice in the last four years.
Yet the country's military is not about to disappear. It retains major influence with its parliamentary bloc which effectively assures a veto over constitutional change. It also has key ministerial posts reserved under the charter.
Many NLD supporters remain deeply suspicious of the Army and its political allies, who are notorious for dirty tricks and crackdowns that have left hundreds dead and thousands jailed.

President invites SL expat intellectuals to work for motherland
Sri Lanka needs the services of Sri Lankan intellectuals living abroad to take the country forward, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He invited Sri Lankan intellectuals living abroad to return to the country and to serve the Motherland since freedom and democracy have been re-established.
"Being intellectuals in the higher education sector of the country, you are duty bound to create highly capable resource personnel, who are able to steer the country forward," he said.
"At the same time, it is the prime duty of the country to utilise them for the betterment of the forward march of the country," the President said.
President Sirisena made these remarks while addressing the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Directors (CVCD) at Blue Water Hotel, Wadduwa yesterday.
The knowledge, capabilities and abilities gained in various sectors, should not be misused but used for the uplift of the country, President Sirisena said.
"However, it is important to gain the latest knowledge in every sector not only for personal development but also for the country's development," the President said.
Capabilities such as knowledge and abilities are powers of a person but these powers should be well utilised without misusing them, the President noted while condemning certain reports in the social media regarding Venerable Sobhitha Thera after his passing away.
President Sirisena said anyone can perform their duties without suspicion or fear as a result of the peaceful atmosphere in the country.
"The time has come for everyone to serve the country without fear and mistrust. Being intellectuals, I believe you should do the coordination to get the expertise knowledge of intellectuals in foreign countries," the President added. He said the country inherited a brave and most advanced history.
"Many development programmes such as irrigation activities and massive constructions carried out in the past, represented the brave and significant history of the country," the President said.
"It has been revealed that we produced iron 5,000 years ago. In the field of agriculture, irrigation, technology and various other fields we achieved success.
The knowledge we obtained, should be shared with other people and other countries," he said. President Sirisena said after the passing away of Venerable Madoluwawe Sobhitha Thera, the behaviour of certain persons in the social media cannot be accepted.
"We must make use of this novel technology and not abuse it. All knowledge gathered by us should be used for the betterment of the country and nation without misusing it," he said.
The President while highlighting the responsibility of universities said universities should be responsible for bringing new technology into the country.
"Similar to introducing new technology to the country, the knowledge we gathered should be shared with our future generation," he said.

Release of Tamil prisoners, in accordance with legal framework - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said that even though he was genuinely interested in releasing all Tamil political prisoners, it had to be done according to legal framework as there were many other factors influencing the issue which needed careful consideration.
The President made this observation when he met the Board of Ministers of the Northern Provincial Council led by Chief Minister C V Vigneswaran, said Provincial Health Minister Dr P Sathyalingam.
Minister Sathyalingam said this was the first time the President had held official talks with the Board of Ministers of the Northern Provincial Council, adding that the main topic of discussion from their angle was the release of the 262 Tamil political prisoners.
The President also told them that the Attorney General's Department would be submitting a report on this matter on November 16 and steps would be taken to release the prisoners after considering the recommendations of the report.
Although the President had agreed to release the prisoners systermatically, 31 of them were released on bail on November 11.
At this meeting, Chief Minister Wigneswaran requested the President to follow a system similar to the common amnesty system given to JVP activists and the release of 12,000 LTTE members after rehabilitation and the release of political prisoners. They also discussed several other proposals regarding services that should be rendered to the Northern Provincial Council.
Following the meeting with the President, Sathyalingam said the four Provincial Ministers visited the Magazine Prison to ascertain the conditions of Tamil political prisoners, but the Chief Minister was unable to join the others due to previous engagements. They said that out of prisoners, four were on a hunger strike for the past four days. They also said that the Chief Jailor and 9 political prisoners were hospitalised following the fast.

Rooney welcomes challenge for England place
Alicante, Spain, Thursday: England captain Wayne Rooney admitted he is under more pressure for his place in the national team than at any point in his international career by an emerging group of promising strikers.
Rooney, 30, is England's all-time leading scorer with 50 goals in his 107 caps, but he will be left on the bench by coach Roy Hodgson for a glamour friendly against Spain in Alicante on Friday.
Hodgson was quick to underline his decision was based firmly on the opportunity to hand others the chance to make their case ahead of next year's European Championships.
However, with the likes of Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane having outscored Rooney in the Premier League so far this season and with Hodgson hoping Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge and Theo Walcott will all return from injury in time for the Euros, Rooney accepts he can't take his place for granted.
"It's the best group of strikers certainly since I've been involved in the squad," said Rooney.
"You've got players like Welbeck, Sturridge and Theo who are out injured and it's a huge array of talent.
"I think it's great for the country because in previous years we've gone into tournaments and we haven't really had that many match winners in the squad and now we've got quite a few which can certainly benefit us as a team.
"It is a huge challenge to keep your place in the team and that is what I want to do.
"I feel, certainly since Roy has been in charge, my international form has been great. I've scored a lot of goals and hopefully I can keep doing that."
Hodgson had been hoping to start Vardy against the European champions, but an injury picked up last weekend is likely to mean the on-form Leicester City striker misses out with Kane set to lead the line in Rooney's absence.
England romped through their qualification campaign with a 100 percent record from their 10 games to bounce back from a hugely disappointing group stage exit at the 2014 World Cup.
And Hodgson welcomes the thought of having far more difficult decisions to make when it comes to picking his final 23-man squad for the Euros than he faced before going to Brazil.
"It would be nice to have all those players back fit and fighting for a place. It's such a different situation to during and after the World Cup when I don't think we had that degree of people knocking on the door," he said.
"In the past there wasn't as many candidates which excited people so I can only see that as an advantage.
"It could lead to being a disadvantage for one or two of the candidates going forward because they might not make the final cut, but everyone has got their chance."

The SLFP will be relegated to the fourth place if it decides to go alone at the forthcoming local council election.
The UPFA should contest the election by forming a Common Opposition, said Joint Opposition Convener and Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge.
Ranatunge said if the SLFP does not come forward to defeat the UNP at the local council election, his group will be compelled to take some other option.
He said the JVP acts according to the UNP's agenda. The JVP is talking about the Avant Garde issue by being silent on the Central Bank Bond issue which was its major issue at the time of election.
The JVP and the TNA are concerned only about their common objectives while keeping mum about common problems facing the country. The economic policy statement made in Parliament by the Prime Minister hinted that the government is mulling a privatisation exercise. The government is also trying to amalgamate the EPF and the ETF. When the former government tried to do it, they created a major uproar against it, he said. The government has failed to add the Rs. 10,000 allowance to the basic salary of public servants, Ranatunge said.

Sri Lanka was elected to the Executive Board of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) on 11 November 2015 during the 38th General Conference in Paris. Sri Lanka was one of six countries that qualified to serve on the Executive Board from the Asia and Pacific Group for the period 2015-2019, having received 149 out of 186 votes at the election in which there were eight candidate countries. The countries which were elected to the Executive Board from the Asia and Pacific Group with Sri Lanka are Malaysia, Viet Nam, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, and Iran (http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference-38th/elections/results-e...).

This is the first election to a UN Specialised Agency that Sri Lanka contested for, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The decision to pursue membership in the UNESCO Executive Board was a manifestation of the Governments policy of renewing engagement with the international community and reaffirmation of the principles of the Government. Such principles include strengthening democracy and good governance, ensuring justice, liberty, equality, freedom and dignity for all aimed at achieving a durable peace and the harmonious celebration and preservation of Sri Lankas multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual character which are in line with the purposes and principles of UNESCO. The vision enshrined in the UNESCO Charter of building peace in the minds of people is in fact the vision which is at the heart of the Governments own mission to unite the hearts and minds of the people of Sri Lanka through reconciliation.


The Government of Sri Lanka is grateful to the member countries represented in the General Conference of UNESCO for the opportunity provided to serve on the Executive Board at this historic juncture and commits to make every endeavour to work with all member countries of UNESCO in the implementation of the Organizations policies and programmes.

'State parties responsible to provide leadership to strengthen CCW framework'
Ambassador Aryasinha presides over the 2015 Meeting of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)
Sri Lanka's Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha, presided over the meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) which opened on November 12, 2015, at the United Nations Office in Geneva. Ambassador Aryasinha was formally designated to this post in November 2014, by acclamation, succeeding Ambassador Remigiusz A. Henczel of Poland. Over the past year, Ambassador Aryasinha held extensive consultations with all stakeholders, state parties, non-governmental organizations and civil society members on key issues on the agenda of the CCW, including Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS).
In his opening remarks, Ambassador Aryasinha thanked members for the confidence and trust placed in him and Sri Lanka to take forward the objectives of this Convention, as a clear sign of the international recognition of Sri Lanka's steadfast contribution to the field of disarmament over many decades. "Our acceptance of the Chair in turn, was yet another manifestation of Sri Lanka's firm belief in and commitment to the UN multilateral system and the pivotal role it plays in maintaining international peace and security, notwithstanding the continued challenges it faces," he said in a Press release.
Ambassador Aryasinha said it is the responsibility of State Parties to observe and learn through historical challenges faced by the Convention and to provide new impetus and leadership to strengthen the CCW framework and ensure that it continues to remain abreast of new developments in the field of the methods of warfare, including those of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS), which may yield outcomes whose potential for dual use is unfettered, but without human control. He said the CCW also provides the necessary guarantee towards enhancing cooperative security taking into account the security interests of all States on the basis of the principle of undiminished security for all, while also ensuring the need for full compliance with IHL principles, thereby protecting both civilians and combatants from indiscriminate attacks and unjustifiable suffering.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a message to the meeting, noting that "Sustainable Development Goals explicitly recognize the symbiotic nature of development and disarmament," observed that "the CCW and its Protocols are among the most vital tools at the international community's disposal to ensure that and future generations enjoy a safer and more secure world."
The Director-General of the UN Office in Geneva Michael Moller, said "the strength and ongoing credibility of the CCW regime will be judged by its responses to both old and new threats in the area of conventional weapons," and urged that it be tackled "with an increased sense of urgency and purpose."

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said the matter came up for discussion during a meeting presided by him but no decision on the matter had been taken.
"Such a boat service may be popular among people in the coastal areas and fishing ports, but, it would not be practical during the off season when strong winds and rough seas are prevalent," State Minister Wedaarachchi explained.

The Truth alone will stand...
Lankan government decided to revoke a purported agreement Avant Garde had entered into with the defence minister under former Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and asked the navy to take over the private firm's operations. President Sirisena has ordered the immediate cancellation of the so-called joint venture deal between the private security company and the defence ministry's private arm known as RALL and to take legal action against Avant Garde within a week
According to Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the President has ordered to hand over the operations of Avant Garde to the Sri Lanka Navy with immediate effect. The decision was taken at a meeting held with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena. Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon, Attorney General, Navy Commander, representatives from the Rakna Lanka, Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe participated in the discussion.
Lankan government decided to revoke a purported agreement Avant Garde had entered into with the defence minister under former Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and asked the navy to take over the private firm's operations. President Sirisena has ordered the immediate cancellation of the so-called joint venture deal between the private security company and the defence ministry's private arm known as RALL and to take legal action against Avant Garde within a week.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's allegations
Inspector General of Police N. K. Illangakoon claimed ignorance over the arms scandal, but was censured by the Cabinet which had pitched into him for not carrying out a thorough investigation.
One could wonder whether the dispute on Avant Garde has created a modern crime and punishment problem. Because when JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake made his allegation in parliament, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe challenged him to a debate on this matter. Minister said "I have not taken a cent from Avant Garde. When JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake made this allegation in parliament, I challenged him to a debate on this matter and said I would resign from my portfolio if it was proved correct. But he did not take up my challenge".
Justice and fair play
At the same time Field Marshal Fonseka had criticized Minister Rajapakshe over several matters including that of not taking action to arrest former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. "He kept pressuring me to arrest Mr. Rajapaksa even without any evidence. He was keen on taking revenge from him. We came to establish good governance not to take revenge from anyone. I said I will not arrest him because allegations against him have not been proved. When I told the President and the Prime Minister about this they also advised the Attorney General not to act as others wanted but to act reasonably. .."
President Maithripala Sirisena has summoned this special meeting and has taken firm stand to clear the table. He has taken this step as tension prevailed at the last Cabinet after Megapolis and Western Region Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne accused Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana of not pursuing the allegations against Avant Garde.
In this scenario Attorney General became a sort of converse Javert, the dedicated police officer in Les Misrables, the novel by Victor Hugo. In that novel Javert is a fanatic Police Inspector in pursuit to recapture Jean Valjean - the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread.
Our Javert is accused of not taking any action against hideous culprits because his dedication to the letter of law! So he is the reverse of French Javert in Les Misrables. As a layman I assumed that the job of AG is to use the law to safeguard the flow of justice and fair play. I am mistaken; the job of AG is to safeguard the interest of the culprit until 200% evidence is brought before him by any modern Javert in the Lankan police force. Until then the blame will obviously come on the police for messing up the investigation.
Revolutionary Democracy
Fortunately in this case President Sirisena has played the role of the noble peasant Valjean. He has gallantly taken the load off the shoulders of the Attorney General and dissolved the Avant Garde.
This action shows that the mass movement that has been classified as the Revolutionary Democracy is still active; all components, peoples committees, trade unions, civil society organizations and NGOs spread throughout the country are continuing the dialogue. Maithri has felt the pressure of masses assembled.
Peoples organizations can understand what is happening and their empirical understanding obtained through common sense may look humble and simple; but closer to the truth. It is this understanding that guides the people to come out and face the power of reaction again and again.
Now that Avant Garde issue has taken a dramatic turn what will happen to our Javert
In the original story Valjean pretends to execute Javert, but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him to make a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral.
He takes his own life by jumping into the Seine. Certainly that is too dramatic for the real world. But masses can do wonders. Recent happenings prove this social principle. Slogans and actions may take various forms; but the thirst for truth and justice, will remain the force that propels the Revolutionary Democracy.
