Dineshkanthan bags mens singles title
Eighth seed Dineshkanthan Thangaraja walked away with the Sri Lanka Clay Court Nationals 2018 mens singles title beating top seed Sanka Athukorala comfortably in straight sets 6/3, 6/1 when the two top favourites for the crown battled it out in the final at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) courts yesterday.
Both Dineshkanthan and Sanka entered the final with a superb undefeated record in the tournament and the final was tipped to be a close contest between the two strong players. But the final did not deliver the expected excitement as Dineshkanthan sailed to an easy clean sweep win downing the much fancied top seed.
Dineshkanthan beat Liu-Hui Retallick 7/6(6), 4/6, 6/1 and Sanka had the better of Delwar Hossain 6/3, 6/1 in the semi-finals.

Heshan Imanga Hewa Thalagahage was the first to enter the quarters of the girls under 14 singles event when she defeated Nelini Jayasuriya 4/2, 4/1 in a third round battle.

Eighteen killed in Thai bus crash
THAILAND: At least 18 people were killed and dozens wounded when a bus travelling in northeastern Thailand veered off the road and smashed into a tree, authorities said on Thursday.
The accident occured Wednesday evening in Thailands Nakhon Ratchasima province with the double decker bus carrying around 50 people returning home from a holiday.
There are 18 people killed, of these 12 women and six men including one boy, Suthep Ruenthawil, chief of the Nakhon Ratchasima provincial disaster prevention and mitigation unit told AFP. He added that 28 people are receiving treatment for injuries.
Photos in local media of the accidents aftermath showed part of the bus lying on its side and officials standing beside a row of body bags.
Suthep said the bus driver lost control while the vehicle was going downhill, before it veered off the road and jumped a traffic island then smashed into a large tree.
The bus was torn into two parts, he said.
Lieutenant Colonel Pornpattana Pisitkarn from the Udomsap police station near where the accident occured said the bus breaks appeared to have failed.
Thailands roads are some of the most lethal in the world, killing around 24,000 people each year according to the World Health Organization.
More than half of accidents involve motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians though bus crashes involving tourists and migrant workers are also common.
In November 13 Myanmar nationals were killed when their van collided with a truck in central Thailand and burst into flames. - AFP

Experts dialogue in Colombo for rinderpest countermeasures
Veterinary officers, animal health experts and scientists from 12 countries in the Asian region, converged in Colombo to renew commitments and take action against any possible outbreak of rinderpest, a contagious disease that, throughout history, has killed millions of livestock. Over 30 experts attended a Rinderpest Tabletop Exercise conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in partnership with the Rural Economy Ministry.
The exercise focused on detection and response to a simulated scenario of a rinderpest outbreak in Asia, the sharing of national contingency plans and testing the newly-developed Global Rinderpest Action Plan (GRAP) for national, regional and international co-ordination, in order to prevent a potential rinderpest emergency.
Rinderpest, although declared eradicated by FAO and OIE in 2011, remains a priority, as stocks of the rinderpest virus that are currently held in laboratories around the world present a significant biological threat, FAO representative of Sri Lanka and Maldives Nina Brandstrup said. However, it is not yet time to end concerns regarding rinderpest. Not until the risk of a potential recurrence of the virusaccidental or deliberateis near minimum.
The second disease to be eradicated globally after smallpox, rinderpest is also the first animal disease to be eradicated. However, since stocks of the virus are present in several laboratories, the destruction of the virus or its secure transfer (sequestration) to FAO-OIE approved Rinderpest Holding Facilities are encouraged. Furthermore, a Global Rinderpest Action Plan was introduced to ensure continued global freedom from rinderpest by outlining the actions necessary to prepare, prevent, respond and recover from a rinderpest outbreak. The Regional Rinderpest Tabletop Exercise held in Colombo, which followed a similar Exercise for the East African region in Nairobi, Kenya, saw countries working to improve and harmonise national and regional contingency plans to GRAP. Rome FAO Headquarters Rinderpest Animal Production and Health Division Co-secretariat Senior Animal Health Officer Dr. Samia Metwally said that the most important finding from the tabletop exercise was that countries do not remember rinderpest and what the disease looked like. So in case of a re-emergence, the detection of this disease in the Asian region may take a long time and it will be too late to control it, she added. Dr. Metwally further said most countries were against slaughtering vaccinated animals to gain freedom from disease, if rinderpest resurfaces. Discussion surrounding the current OIE Terrestrial Code for the recovery of freedom from rinderpest highlighted that recovery could be achieved without slaughtering vaccinated animals. OIE Charge de Mission Dr. Mariana Marrana said the OIE Terrestrial Code could be reviewed upon request from the membership.
Should there be any outbreak of the virus, there needs to be adequate surveillance systems in operation and continuous vigilance maintained, enabling the disease to be detected early and managed promptly, said Ministry of Rural Economy Secretary Renuka Ekanayake. She reiterated that every country and region should have their contingency plans tested by simulated scenarios and tabletop exercises.
It was also noted that Sri Lanka had experienced the impact of rinderpest on livelihood and food security during wars and the importation of cattle. The last case of rinderpest was in 1987 and Sri Lanka declared freedom from the disease in 1994.
Human population is expected to rise to 9.6 billion by 2050 and many of these people are expected to live in urban and peri-urban areas. With rising urbanisation and incomes, food consumption patterns are likely to change and the demand for livestock products would also rise. Currently, livestock contributes 43 percent of world agricultural Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its value exceeds USD 740 billion, said Brandstrup. This creates an income opportunity for producers, not least for poor producers. But for them to benefit, their investment in production must be protected, she added.
Taking all possible measures to prevent high-impact transboundary animal diseases such as rinderpest from re-emerging, would ensure improved global food security, strengthen household economies and increase livestock investor confidence and livestock trade.

Extremism, a bane for reconciliation
The State of Emergency has been lifted. Normalcy has been restored, it is said. The electronic media shows visuals of citizens going about for their day-to-day activities leisurely. Is that normalcy How does one know the anxieties and phobias they entertain in their hearts  their fear of the immediate future
No, normalcy is not going back to the pre-March 2018 status quo. That status-quo ante was charged with communal tension that two untoward incidents could unleash a mob attack on peacefully living hapless Muslims. Nor could it be the situation since the Gintota clashes or for that matter, ever since the Aluthgama incidents in which the BBS played a lead role with patronage from powerful politicos.
Not only is the present situation not normal it is pregnant with new dangers. Embers of communal flames lie beneath the ashes. A close look at the media or reading between the lines one could discern apologists of majoritarian forces meekly weaving new theories to justify majoritarian backlashes against minorities in general and suggesting the relevance of such theories to the recent clashes in Kandy.
Socio-economic development
They say that Muslims in Sri Lanka are a privileged minority with enviable economic strength vis- a-vis the Sinhala Buddhists whose patience has reached its limit. The contrary is the truth. Though there are wealthy and educated elements the majority of the Muslim community remains poor and backward. They have reached even the present progress due to affirmative actions by past governments to improve their lot.
A hullabaloo is created over the birth rate of Muslims. It is said that at present birth rates the Muslims would outnumber the Sinhala people in the near future. Statistics claim otherwise. It is true that the birth rate among the Muslims is greater than among the Sinhala population. But there are 75 Sinhala people for every 9 or 10 Muslims. Hence there is no danger of the Muslims overtaking the Sinhala people in the foreseeable future. Besides a high birth rate is a sign of under-development.
The birth rate among the Sinhala people was also much higher several decades ago. It came down subsequent to girls pursuing secondary and tertiary education and taking up employment. With their socio-economic development, particularly education, birth rate among the Muslim community would surely come down. We must understand that economic compulsions are more forceful than religious beliefs or practices. Moreover, the overall birth rate in Sri Lanka is also in the decline.
Some persons, including well-meaning ones have described the Ampara and Digana incidents as communal clashes. However, it is inappropriate to do so because no two sides clashed with each other but one side, the aggressor Sinhala Buddhist mob attacked the unarmed Muslims who had no means of defence. To identify the clashes as a communal is to minimize the crime committed by the aggressor.
There was also talk of extremists on both sides. It was first spoken of by the Bodu Bala Sena and later echoed by others.
The repeated silence of the Muslims amidst consecutive attacks shows that extremism has not taken root among the community. However, this does not mean that there are no isolated individuals with extreme positions. Some including the BBS have identified Wahabism as an extremist trend. But Wahabists are a small minority and are engaged in a sectarian religious struggle against Muslims. They have not come out politically against non-Muslims. Nor have political parties embraced Wahabism.
In case attacks against Muslims continue unabated they could become a militant political movement. In the context of the existence of widespread Islamic fundamentalist groups throughout the word, including South Asia the consequences of some of them entering Sri Lanka would be horrendous.
Like Iraq or Syria our country too could become a battleground for world powers that would ultimately partition it among themselves. The only way to prevent such a calamity is to fortify national unity among all communities denying foreign powers any opportunity to intervene. Hence those politicians who in the name of race, religion or anti-imperialism pursue communal politics are real traitors. One positive development in the present moment is the large number of Sinhala Buddhists, including members of the Maha Sangha who rose to the occasion and defended the Muslim brethren facing the ire of the communalist forces. Communalism among the majority community has certainly decreased comparatively.
Political parties based on race and religion
However, communalist and tribal sentiments are being disseminated by interested groups and the ordinary people are liable to be misled. That is an uphill task. In addition to awareness campaigns to enlighten the masses structural changes are also required. For example, it is necessary to do away with racial segregated schools and settlements. Political parties based on race and religion are also a bane. A national land alienation and utilization policy giving priority to local residents is also an urgent necessity. Domains of religion and State should not overlap though religious freedom including the rights of believers, practitioners and leaders of religions to take up political positions should be guaranteed and respected.
It would be also advisable for the government to declare a National Unity Day and celebrate it appropriately. Setting up ethnic and religious unity committees in every mixed village or settlement would be of assistance in preventing Digana type attacks.
Not a single person has been so far punished under the law for the attacks at Aluthgama and Gintota. The Government and the law enforcement authorities have failed miserably. This has resulted in a virtual impunity for racist offenders. Equality before the law has become a myth. This state of affairs is part of the status quo. It should change for a return to normalcy.
Former President has said that here are only two types of people in the country - those who love the country patriots and those who do not- traitors. Well said. However, those who love the country would obey the rule of law. They would not steal or misappropriate public property. They would never resort to bribery and corruption. No would they disturb communal and religious harmony.

Fed announces US rate increase
The US central bank has said it will raise its benchmark interest rate citing a strengthened economic outlook.
The Federal Reserve said it had decided to raise the rate by 0.25% to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
Policymakers also signalled they would increase rates twice more this year, while raising the forecast for rate hikes in 2019.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Jay Powell also sounded a warning about rising trade tensions.
The Trump administration recently announced steel and aluminium tariffs and is weighing sanctions against China, actions that have led to threats of retaliation.
Powell said some Fed members are worried about the possibility of a trade war, referencing conversations between central bankers and business leaders.
Theyre seeing it as a risk to the outlook, Powell said at a press conference at the close of the Feds two-day meeting in Washington.
Members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which votes on rates, predicted the US economy will grow by 2.7% this year, faster than the 2.5% predicted in December.
Officials are also expecting slightly higher interest rates in 2019 and 2020 than they did in December, according to projections released after the meeting, which reflect the median of estimates by committee members.

## Title: 'Global corrugated box industry in crisis'

'Global corrugated box industry in crisis'
Paper related industries around the globe are going through a crisis and incurring huge losses during the past months due to continuous price increases by paper mills, said Chairman, Agrarian Insurance Board, Sydney Gajanayake.
Box manufacturers and other paper related industries all over the world have faced serious consequences and some of them have already wound down the operations in the face of unbearable losses they have been incurring. Under these circumstances, the industry does not have any other option but to pass this increase to consumers to sustain this impact.
The box manufacturers in some countries have been able to sustain by recovering the additional cost from their customers while some of them are yet struggling to get an adjustment. This situation may further worsen in the current year.
The escalation of paper prices started early this year due to sudden closure of around 300 paper making companies in China. The Chinese government has toughened paper manufacturing regulations to address air pollution and other environmental problems. Small- and mid-sized paper mills have been shut down for failing to comply with greenhouse gas emission restrictions and other regulations.
Making the situation worst, Chinese government imposed an outright ban on waste paper imports, which is the major raw material for the corrugated board production. With this, Chinese demand for paper in the International market suddenly amplified escalating the prices.
Although the market expected the Chinese factories to reopen by improving their production facilities, it does not seem realizing as most of the companies yet unable to reopen as they have failed to pass the Environmental Impact Assessments & stringent approval requirements enacted by the Chinese government, resulting in a major drop in domestic supply of paper alongside the drop in overseas supply.
The situation has been ongoing and paper is still in short supply. Hence the tendencies indicate that the global price uptrend will not necessarily be ending any time soon.
Moreover, the box makers and the paper traders had much expectations, the new plant started in Vietnam by the Chinas largest packaging paper manufacturers; Nine Dragons, Paper would ease the situation to a certain extent.
Although the new paper mill has commenced operations in last September, it has not at all been able to make a significant impact to the scarcity of paper. They have also raised the price of its paper products significantly during the second half of the last year.
Although the waste pulp prices all over the world have come down slightly during the recent few months, it has not impacted towards the reduction of world paper prices. Generally, the paper industry announces price increases once in four years and for the last three or four years, rises and falls of the prices have been relatively stable.
But peculiarly with the given current market dynamics, the current price hikes are yet on upward trend though the crisis has started a year before. According to market information, the prices are forecasted to rise even further during the current year. The global market for corrugated boxes has been witnessing a surge and is expected to remain observing so over the next few years. The growth of corrugated box market is influenced by the growing trend of the online shopping and growing demand for product safety.
Geographically, North America is a major revenue generator to the global corrugated boxes market where the US market has become one of the most attractive place for the box manufacturers owing to the rising e-commerce venture and shifting trends towards online shopping. Europe is the second leading region and Asia-Pacific has emerged as the fastest growing region. This trend has resulted in high demand for corrugated boxes and paper and increasing the presser on paper price.
As per the information available from the local Corrugated Box Industry, they too are reeling under the disruptive blows. On-going paper price increases have badly affected the financial viability of the box manufacturers & they need highly excessive funds to secure the volumes and their bottom lines have turned negative in their failure to adjust the prices in the market adequately.
The Corrugated Box manufacturing industry, which is employing a significant workforce is playing a pivotal role in the Sri Lankan economy by producing almost 180,000 Mts of corrugated boxes per annum with the total market size of over Rs 25 billion per annum. In Sri Lanka there are around 30 corrugated box manufacturers from small to big-time.
The market situation basically shows signs of a perfect market situation. As per the local industry information, the various grades of imported paper prices have gone over 40% - 60% by impacting a 35% of cost escalation in their production. However, the local industries have been yet unable to adjust their prices adequately. The gap of over 20% in the pricing is absorbed by the box manufacturers creating huge losses in their bottom lines. In this scenario, some corrugated box makers and other paper related industries would face imminent closures during the current year.
The box makers are an important part of the Sri Lankan economy, as they add value to end product. Without boxes most of the products will not be able to deliver or export. The industry should have a reasonable margin to accommodate the improvements of the industry. The collapse of this industry may severely damage the export market & result in displacement of workmen employed in this Industry, which would be inevitable unless all stakeholders and respective authorities come to the rescue of the corrugated Box manufacturing industry of Sri Lanka.

Harassed student writes to President against Principal
The nine year old school girl who won back her right to schooling after being expelled from a school in Ganemulla over rumours of HIV, has written to the President, once again, asking that he intervene to ensure that she can sit for her scholarship exam.
In March 2017, a group of parents protested at the school asking that they remove the child over false rumours that she had contracted HIV. They had spread rumours that because her mother was a volunteer at an AIDS prevention programme, she too would have contracted the disease and passed it on to the child. As a result, the principal had asked the child to leave the school.
However, with the intervention of the Human Rights Commission, the school was forced to take the child back.
The child in her letter to the President dated February 22, 2018 has stated that her principal continued to berate her and that on February 19, he had called her and in front of all in school showed the media coverage on her and stated There, it is -----AIDS story.
She also informed the President that the school authorities continued to harass her and this harassment has prevented her from going to school and sit for her scholarship exam.
My father, mother and I live in a rented house. We dont have many facilities in this house. Please help me get an education.I am the first in every exam.I am sorry to have disturbed you, appealed the girl to the President.
Calls made to the Presidential Secretariat Citizens mail section could not verify whether the President had received her letter. The President is on a two day visit to Pakistan.

Highest number of corruption convictions last year - CIABOC Director General
The highest number of convictions related to corruption cases was recorded last year with 57 convictions being done, said Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC.
In an interview with the Daily News he said, last year CIABOC had filed 73 cases, while 51 were arrested over accepting of bribes.
In all 2,768 complaints had been received by CIABOC last year. So far this year CIABOC has filed around nine cases and carried out 11 successful raids, having received 605 complaints to date this year.
CIABOC has taken measures to resolve the piling number of cases through several amendments to the existing acts, completing the hundreds of thousands of piled up cases. Three acts are to be amended, pertaining to the judicial activities, bribery and corruption and public servants activities, replacing the old laws with revised and productive new ones. Accordingly, based on these amendments, all courts procedures from the Magistrates Court up will be changed, he said.
Director General Jayamanne said so far all corruption cases were only taken up by the Magistrates Courts and due to this loophole in the legal system, during the past 23 years, while over around 100-200 cases were filed, only four persons were convicted and received punishments amounting to ten years imprisonment.
However, according to the new amendments, no case will be dragged on for many years and would be heard continuously and expedited, he said.
Cases that are determined to be heard before the AG or Bribery Commission or a three member judge panel, will be heard without a break until a final verdict is completed, thanks to the new revisions to the act. Due to the delay in conducting these cases, in most instances, evidence is lost, witnesses go missing or they die, suspects flee, officials change, documents get misplaced etc and by these delays, sometimes even the most severe criminals escape the grasp of the law, resulting in further injustice to the affected parties, he added.
Among the piled up cases, there are cases that have been delayed for over 20 years. Hence, even the President noted that this mechanism needs drastic changes. The proposed amendments would allow evidence gathered by a presidential commission to be valid before court reducing the repetition of the process of gathering evidence saving time and resources and expediting the judicial process, Jayamanne noted.
However, he noted that in most of these cases, around 75 percent of the complaints are without evidence and grievances rather than substantial complaints. Therefore, he appealed to the public to refrain from sending in such complaints as it is a waste of public resources as these baseless complaints too should be investigated prior to being discarded wasting valuable time and resources.
The CIABOC Director General also said that declaration of assets for politicians, state officials and judges would be made mandatory.
Unlike the old method of doing it manually, it would save a lot of time and money if this process is done online. Thereafter when ever required to update the details, instead of having to go through the whole process again from scratch, with the online method, it can just be updated with the relevant new information, saving a lot of time and resources. Further it should be made mandatory for government officials to be liable to declare their assets, upto a period of two years even after retirement, he pointed out.
With regard to candidates contesting an election, it should be made mandatory for them to declare their assets within three months of receiving nominations.
Through the amendments most of the laws pertaining to the 1988 Bribery Act would be revised, he said.
Through these amendments the loopholes that thus existed would be closed leaving no room for offenders to creep through them and escape punishment. These amendments have now received Cabinet approval and is currently measures are being taken by the legal draftsman to initiate necessary action, he added.

IndiGo clarifies on Air India bid, says no  ongoing discussions with Qatar Airways
Denying reports of a possible joint bid for Air India, budget airline IndiGo has said that there are no ongoing discussions with the Gulf-based carrier Qatar Airways. The clarification by India's largest airline in terms of market share comes at a time when the government is chalking out on the final details for the sale of debt-ridden national carrier.
While IndiGo normally doesn't respond to rumors, in this particular instance, we would like to state that there are no ongoing discussions of this nature, the airline said. Last year, the low-cost carrier IndiGo had sent formal expression of interest to buy Air India's international operations.
Meanwhile, Qatar Airways has also denied reports of any involvement in any talks regarding the acquisition of Air India. Though Air India is saddled with huge debt (currently at Rs 51,890 crore), acquiring the airline can help boost the acquirer in terms of foot print, bilteral flying rights, parking slots, etc.
As per reports, the government is planning to split the airline into four entities - core airline business (Air India and Air India Express), regional arm (Alliance Air), ground handling and engineering operations. Each entity will be sold separately with at least 51 per cent stake on offer. The disinvestment process is likely to be completed by the end of 2018.
Last year in June, the Union Cabinet had approved privatisation of the debt-laden national carrier, which is kept afloat on taxpayers money. On January 10, in an attempt to fast-track Air India's divestment process, the Cabinet allowed foreign airlines to invest upto 49 per cent in Air India.
A group headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with Rothschild and Ernst & Young as consultants has been appointed to chalk out the strategy for Air India's stake sale. The airline has six subsidiaries, out of which three are making losses, with assets worth about $4.6 billion. The government has pumped $3.6 billion since 2012 to bail out the airline. Last year, Turkey's Celebi Aviation Holding and Delhi-based Bird Group had shown interest in buying state-owned Air India's ground handling operations.

Interim Order preventing police acting against Gota extended
The Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday further extended until March 27 its interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate's Court inquiry.
The two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on a Magistrates court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
On November 29, 2017 the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex-parte proceeding by the Court of Appeal. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The Court had upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.

iPhone to offer cheaper phones
Apple is expected to launch three new handsets in 2018; an update to the iPhone SE, a phablet-sized iPhone X Plus, and a refresh of the iPhone X. Digitimes is reporting that the 2018 version of the flagship iPhone X will have a significantly cheaper bill of materials.
The bill of materials cost to Apple could be reduced by as much as ten percent. Although there are other costs to consider (such as the cost of assembly and shipping to retail stores) the reduced cost of the parts feeds into a very important decision for Tim Cook. He can either drop the price of the regular iPhone by around $100 on the final retail price, or he can keep the price at the same level and pocket the extra revenue.
I suspect the instincts of Apples CEO will be, as it has done so many times in the past, to keep the unit price as high as possible and extract the maximum revenue. That maintains the status of brand Apple it maximizes the short-term return to investors and it is the way things have always been done. No matter the constant clamour for cheaper tech out of Cupertino, Apple has been reluctant to move its hardware out of the tight price bands it applies.
With the iPhone X SE expected at some point this year to fill the $799 entry point, and the iPhone X Plus expected to come in at $1199, that leaves the $999 price point the natural spot for the middle device; in the tier. Cut the bill of materials, increase the revenue per handset, maintain the income, stand by for record earnings, and everyone will be happy.
Tim Cooks decision will be to trade unit sales for margin. Less iPhones will be sold, but with each handset earning a larger margin, revenue can continue to climb. In the short-term, theres no issue with that. But this short-term approach can lead to a handset manufacturer falling off a cliff-face. (www.forbes.com)

The Japanese embassy in Colombo in a letter to the Daily News clarified the news item titled Japanese envoy says no to foreign judges, published in the Daily News of March 22.
The letter from the Japanese Embassy clarifying its position on the issue of foreign judges, says the above article has misinterpreted what Ambassador Suganuma told during the Q & A session after the signing ceremony of Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects in Sri Lanka held on 21 March, 2018.
Asked about the position of the Japanese Government on the issue of foreign judges, Ambassador Suganuma said that Japan is supporting the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka for national reconciliation, including those for justice, and that it is ready to extend the assistance to these efforts if necessary.
Asked further on whether foreign judges are needed or not, Ambassador Suganuma replied that this has to be decided by the Government and people of Sri Lanka, and thus Japan is not in a position to say yes or no on the issue.

Japanese government to provide firefighting gear
The Japanese government has decided to provide eight fire engines along with firefighting equipment, to Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in Katunayake, Biyagama, Seethawaka and Wathupitiwala, where more than 100,000 employees are working.
The equipment donated by local governments in Japan would be utilised for the safety of not only EPZs, but adjacent areas as well. The grant contract for the Project for Upgrading Fire Units in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) of Sri Lanka amounting US$ 90,778 (approx. Rs. 14.1 million) under the scheme Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Securities Project, was signed on March 20, at the Board of Investment (BOI) head office in Colombo, between Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma and BOI Director-General Duminda Ariyasinghe.
Ariyasinghe said, BOI acts as the first point of contact for investors who intend to set up projects in manufacturing, infrastructure, tourism, agriculture, IT-related services or other chosen sectors in Sri Lanka. To ensure safety and security of the people in BOI Zones, BOI Fire Units are based in the Katunayake, Biyagama, Seethawaka and Wathupitiwala Export Processing Zones.
Every effort is being made to provide a secured working environment for a considerable number of workers and factories located within these zones. In 2014, BOI received five firefighting vehicles from the Japanese government, which are now used in several EPZs. Through this new project, in which we would receive another set of eight reconditioned fire engines, BOI could enhance fire units at BOI EPZs, as well as factories outside those zones. We thank the Japanese government.

Jerusalem  The Holy of Holies
Juliet Coombe went to Jerusalem to learn more about some of the great religions of the world and discovered a fascinating city half as old as time.The light from the sunrise danced across the old city of Jerusalem throwing sparkles of golden light over the Wailing Wall. The air buzzed of people who for three thousand years have been rolling up prayers like the Dead Sea Scrolls and putting messages in the worlds most sacred wall, kissing the stones as they look to the heavens for impossible answers to questions that are as old as man. How does one protect the innocent, when the laws so often protect the unlawful
After making a prayer and leaving a folded up note, one can walk for hours, losing oneself in the maze of back streets where walled shops are owned by mischievous characters like Zeyad Mujahed on King David Street No 4  opposite the Christian quarter road, which start to open one after another. His Aladdin like bazaar is just one of the attractions found in the narrow stone built alley ways that draw you in with the contrast of the well worn white stones and colorful Bedouin sequins, along with beautifully hand woven products and fluffy carpets to sit on. A trader through and through he had honed his skills in the family business and at 62 years of age created a style that was genuinely welcoming in contrast to the touts who try to pick you up on the ramparts. Be firm with them as it is so much nicer to walk alone and enjoy in silence the Old City, which was originally built by King David in 1004 B.C.E. and has always been considered the center of the world.
Greek Orthodox trader Zeyad always with a twinkle in his eyes is an original Bedouin and had a big heart and plenty of fascinating local knowledge I was born here he explained and this is my grandfathers shop, an original Bedouin treasure trove. A desert nomadic family who in the 1920s when bringing in yet another camel train of goods through the sacred citadel ancient center decided to make it their home. Clearly so enchanted by its mysterious past and religious foundations Zeyad had lots to say about the place. Big smiles he handed a hot glass of nana, literally translated from Hebrew it means mint tea that he kept hidden in bountiful supply behind his wooden beaded kitchenette store room amongst the kurtha robes, old Bedouin dresses that sparkled when rays of sun light hit them, leather camel bags and mirrored lanterns.
Sitting amongst hand embroidery, dusty ceramics, and Bedouin bags I found myself drawn into this trading characters fascinating history and his magical stories about the Old City of Jerusalem. Seeing I was hungry after my early start to see sunrise over the city he offered freshly made hand crushed hummus with mountains of olive oil and flat bread. To say no was churlish and to miss a chance to talk about the holy sites of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions with a local who clearly loves the place would be a real mistake. So as I waited for five minutes for the food I talked about the life of the original walled community woven with layers of history of war and peace, love and hate, destruction and hope through resurrection. Just wandering through Jaffa gate one cant miss the bullet holes that have left the city so recently scarred. This historical place is where the Jews built the Temple, where Jesus was crucified, and where Mohammed rose to Heaven.
Still chatting a young man arrived with steaming pile of bread, plate of vegetables and I tucked into the hand pressed chickpeas perfectly complimenting the chapatti style breads straight from the oven. I was mesmerized by the stories and the setting of a city that was built into the original hills of the City of David and surrounded by a thick ramparts stone wall over four kilometers long with seven gates, 34 towers, and a citadel (the Tower of David). The citadel is divided into four residential quarters each one representing the key religions of the world and the people who remain carry its spirituality with them. The history of the world can be summed up on so many levels by the people that pass heritage from one generation to the next and in the process make the buildings living history and in their stories the true life of a city is brought to view through its kaleidoscope of different lives. An ancient citadel that feels like it was hewn out of the rock like a woman giving birth to mankind.
After eating, chatting and picking some fascinating pieces as momentous of our time. I am amused with the sales pitch in which he contrasts cheap Chinese machine mass produced with hand made Bedouin pieces woven with simplicity that would make them the perfect accessory on any Parisian cat walk. When asking the price he said as you please and then an astronomical figure was fixed, but I did not have the heart to haggle with a man who had already given me a priceless experience.
As I paid for my shopping he pointed me in the direction of the Armenian Quarter the smallest quarter of the Old City. Telling me as I go that the Armenians settled in Jerusalem in the 4th century for religious reasons, and the St. James Cathedral was built in the 12th century. So off I went through a sea of traders and religious pilgrims to look at one of the most beautiful churches in the country and its built upon the remains of a Byzantine church. At the center of the church is a dome resting on four pillars, through which the sun shines and sheds light on the oil paintings on the walls.
From here I explored the Christian Quarter with more than 40 churches, and monasteries, in the heart of the Christian quarter, which was the highlight of my trip to Jerusalem. In particular the breathtaking Church of the Holy Sepulcher or the Church of the Resurrection, which, according to Christian tradition, was the site upon which Jesus was crucified and buried following his final walk along the Via Dolorosa, or the Stations of the Cross. Walking the same route with so many people holding crosses or short prayers is deeply spiritually uplifting and a reinforcement of the importance of faith in our world.

Joes firm favourites over Antonians today
St. Josephs College Maradana will be at full strength and raring to go when they take on St.Anthonys College Kandy in their Singer A Division Inter-Schools league rugby first round encounter at Havelock Park at 4:15pm today.
Led by speedy centre Sameesha Veranga the Joes got some good players who could be match winners for the Maradana outfit.
Players such as centre cum play maker Gamunu Chethiya, wingers Dulanjana Piyatissa (Sri Lanka national under 19 and former Dharmaraja College Kandy rugby player) , K.D. Kavinda, fly half Santhush Algama, number eight Tharindu de Alwis, flankers Shehan Kelaniyagoda and John Ganegoda along with prop forward Shevon Gregory, Nimesh Kavinda, full back Shan Akila and scrum half Rashen Gunawardena should be marked well by the Antonian lads if not they will be in deep trouble.
The Joes, one of the strongest contenders for the Singer rugby league this year, will be out for their third win against St.Anthonys. The Joes are coached by former junior Sri Lanka coach and Sri Lanka national sevens coach in Nilfer Ibrahim (head coach) who is assisted by forward coach Anuranga Walpola and kicking coach Dev Anand. They should have things their own way in this encounter.
The Maradana school beat S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia convincingly (33-10) and ran out worthy winners last week against the formidable Trinity College Kandy by 32-25 in a tense battle up in Pallekelle. Also fly half Algamas kicking boot will play a major role in this game.
Meanwhile Antonians the dark horse of the Singer League, who are slowly but steadily getting into peak form after close 11-15 loss to arch rival Trinity College suffered an unexpected heavy loss to Royal College last week by 13 points to 55 after trailing 13-15 at half time at Nittawela. Hence they will be out for their first win this season to keep their chances alive to move forward in the round two Cup segment.
They will be heavily dependent on their skipper and prop forward Kavinda Amarakoon, number eight Mohamad Shabeer, fly half Mohamad Makarim, cracking flanker Isuru Ariyapala, second row forward Jithen Daulagala, scrum half Suhail Waseem, centre Theeksha Gunasinghe and full back Janindu Himsara (this years St.Anthonys 1st XI cricket captain).
This year they are coached by their 1986, 1st XV rugby captain Sanjaya Amunugama.
This encounter should be a close tussle for supremacy with St. Josephs holding a clear edge with two consecutive wins this season, while the St.Anthonys have yet to win a game in the ongoing schools league.

Agents who take part in this programme will need to meet our stringent qualifying criteria to receive our certification, allowing us to acutely assess their eligibility of having them on-board as a verified property agent. This will in turn offer a multitude of benefits for property seekers, as they will be able to easily find genuine agents to handle their property needs and be assured of peace of mind and better purchasing decisions as a result.
It was also mentioned that several other agents are currently participating in the verification process.

Discussions have also been held with agents in this regard on assisting them form an association with the capacity to self-regulate its members and which could be the voice for the industry.

LG Refrigerators, with linear inverter compressor save electricity
If your refrigerator does not possess a Linear Inverter Compressor or a Door Cooling Feature, then its not energy-efficient. Oftentimes, conventional inverter refrigerators simply store your food without offering any other benefits. Because of this, these refrigerators are highly energy-draining, meaning that they host the potential to create hikes in your electricity bills.
However, LG Refrigerators are not just your regular inverter refrigerator. Designed with LG-patented technology, LG refrigerators provide you with positive results that extend beyond food storage.
One of the most striking features present in these refrigerators is the Linear Inverter Compressor. A stark improvement on the Smart Inverter Compressor, this compressor employs a streamlined linear piston drive that uses a simple linear motion to power the refrigerator. Since it consists of only a cylinder block and piston, the Linear Inverter Compressor has just one friction point that drastically reduces vibration and noise as well as enhances the refrigerators durability. The Linear Inverter Compressor also constantly adjusts the cooling temperature based on the quantity of food within the refrigerator which in turn conserves energy up to 42%.
The energy-efficient capabilities of the LG Door Cooling Inverter+ Refrigerator is further amped by the Door Cooling function. A technology solely exclusive to LG, the Door Cooling System consists of special back and side vents that circulate cool air throughout the refrigerator, which ensures that every corner of the refrigerator, from the shelves to the door, receives balanced cooling.
The progressive Hygiene Fresh+ filter system combines both to deliver a refrigerator that keeps food fresh and crisp. Using a 05-stage air filtering system, the Hygiene Fresh+ focuses on wicking away moisture and odors emitted by vegetables, fruits, meats, and cooked food as well as cleansing the air within the refrigerator of foreign impurities.
LG, a world-renowned brand, emphasizes on providing consumers home appliances that will guarantee them a happy, healthy home. Consistently reinforcing its commitment towards conserving Earth for future generations while possessing a keen understanding of consumer needs, LG has constructed its home appliances to be truly energy-efficient and eco-friendly. Unlike any other brand, LG keeps improving on its technologies and designs to give you the very best for your family and your home.

Love affair with a wood!
Historian, naturalist and farmer John Lewis-Stempel admits he came late to woods, but succumbed to a delirious xylophilia during the four years he managed Cockshutt Wood in southwest Herefordshire, which he describes as three-and-a-half acres of mixed woodland with a secluded pool where the winter moon lives.
This lyrical book is the diary of his last year at Cockshutt Wood. It begins in December: a minimalist, milk-toned month. The hedgehogs, toads, frogs, snakes and insects with whose activities Lewis-Stempel enlivens later pages are all hibernating. Instead he watches the gaudy cock pheasants samurai bowing at each other and brings his pigs to rummage for goodies among the leaf litter.
The Wood is the diary of John Lewis-Stempels last year at Cockshutt Wood.
As a farmer, Lewis-Stempel is keen to remind readers that although the woodland is no longer part of modern farming, historically, its bounty sustained livestock through the winter. Holly would have been ground up for cattle fodder, hawthorn was cut for the sheep and pannage  the traditional practice of releasing pigs in woods  was widespread.
Indeed, according to the Herefordshire Domesday Book, not much else mattered locally. There was woodland there for 160 pigs, if it had born mast [fruit], runs the entry for Pembridge. Lewis-Stempels mothers family held the pannage rights up the lane in the Golden Valley until 1600. Today, he is funny and tender about his pigs and their jolly, rootling expeditions. His favourite sow, Lavender, smells of freshly-ironed linen. Theyre always escaping. When a woman calls the farm to ask if his pigs are free range he replies: Madam, they are practically wild!
Historically, pannage served a dual purpose, providing food for the pigs and tidying up beech nuts and acorns which can be poisonous to cows and horses.
Later, Lewis-Stempel forages along with his pigs. He shares his recipes for wild garlic dolmades in April, elderflower champagne in June, mushroom pate in August and chestnut soup in October.
Its not all cosy. Lewis-Stempel often goes armed into his sanctuary. Carrying a gun concentrates the naturalists mind, sharpens the senses, he writes. On one occasion he reluctantly takes his son to execute a pair of Canada geese which have made their home on his beloved pond.
The birds have attacked frogs, moorhens and mallards. He takes out the gander with one shot and expects the goose to fly, but she stays by the floating corpse of her mate. Is it love Loyalty he asks. Dead on the water, the Canadas float on their backs, and when the wind blows them towards us they are as menacing as pillows.
As so often throughout his work, Lewis-Stempel turns to poetry for company and consolation.
On the day he kills the geese he remembers Robert Frosts line: Pairing in all paradises ends.
Elsewhere his love of language finds him unearthing forgotten, regional words for wild things. In Olde Hereford, a rabbit was a clover snapper, a small twig was a yimp and a thrush was a Mavis.
Hes brilliant on birds and their habits, enjoying the company of blackbirds as they squawk round the wood like outraged ayatollahs.
When he shoots pheasants for his table, they fall like comets. Cockshutt got its name from its game after all: cock for woodcock, shutt for trap.
Lewis-Stempels research sends him roving back deeper in time, to 2000BC when the ancient Egyptians imported all their ash from Europe to make wheels. In the new millennium he is planting ash saplings in the hope that some will resist the ash dieback that is biting into Britains 80 million ash trees.
The farmer ends his diary in November, with a murmuration of 90 jackdaws swooping through leaf-stripper winds above him and a cup of acorn coffee warming his hands.
When his tenure of Cockshutt is up he finds the parting more painful than he had imagined. I thought the trees and birds belonged to me, he writes. But I now realise I belonged to them.

Maroof, Mir seal series win for Pakistan
Captain Bismah Maroofs 89 and Sana Mirs 4/20 helped Pakistan Women to a 94-run victory over Sri Lanka Women in the second ICC World Championship one-day international of the three-match series at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
The victory gave Pakistan an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, after they had won the first ODI by 69 runs.
Opting to bat, Pakistan put up a competitive total of 250/6, Maroof being aided by contributions from Nida Dar (38) and Nahida Khan (29). Mir contributed with the bat as well, her 25-ball 27 towards the end of the innings comprising three fours.
In reply, Sri Lanka kept losing wickets and were bowled out for 156 in 37 overs. Sripali Weerakkody top scored with 29, while Chamari Athapaththu and Chamari Polgampola both scored 24 each. Ama Kanchana also got a start, with a 24-ball 23, but none of the batters managed to make them count, Pakistan nipping them out just as they got going.
Mirs four-wicket haul was a driving factor behind Pakistans victory. The right-arm off-spinner dismantled Sri Lankas top order, getting the wickets of Dilani Manodara (5), Shashikala Siriwardene (0), Rebeca Vandort (10) and Hasini Perera (11).
Sri Lanka were dealt an early blow when opener Nipuni Hansika was run out in the fifth over of the innings. Mir then scalped Manodara in the eighth over while captain Atapattu was caught by Nahida Khan off Nashra Sandhu for 24. Sri Lanka were reduced to 34/3 within nine overs.
They kept losing wickets thereafter. A 34-run partnership between Kanchana and Polgampola helped Sri Lanka cross the 100-run mark, but they couldnt pose a challenge big enough to get near the Pakistan total.
Weerakkody and Sugandika Kumari added 50 runs for the final wicket, but it was too little too late. Kumari (17) was dismissed by Diana Baig to put an end to the Sri Lankan resistance.
Earlier, a 91-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Dar and Maroof lifted Pakistan from 98/4 to 189/5 and revived the innings after Sri Lanka had made early inroads.
Maroof was the last woman to be dismissed as she was caught by Athapaththu off Weerakkody in the third ball of the final over.
Sripali Weerakkody picked up two wickets for Sri Lanka while Ama Kanchana and Inoka Ranaweera returned a wicket each.
Scores:
Pakistan Women 250-6 in 50 overs (Nahida Khan 29, Muneeba Ali 31, Bismah Maroof 89, Nidar Dar 38, Sana Mir 27 n.o., Sripali Weerakkody 2/46)
Sri Lanka Women 156 in 37 overs (Chamari Atapattu 24, Chamari Polgampola 24, Ama Kanchana 23, Sripali Weerakkody 29 n.o., Sana Mir 4/32, Nidar Dar 2/27)

Moves to strengthen laws on money laundering
The government is focusing on dealing with deficiencies in the Companies Act No 7 of 2007 which has allowed private companies to get away with money laundering activities.
Acting Industry and Commerce Minister A. D. Champika Premadasa, submitting a Cabinet paper on Tuesday, had asked for the Act to be amended to stop the country from being used as a haven for money laundering.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) - the global policy setter on Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMACFT) - has publicly identified Sri Lanka as a country with strategic AMACFT deficiencies, placing Sri Lanka in its Grey list of countries. An Action Plan for Sri Lanka has been introduced to be implemented within a given time frame to rectify the deficiencies highlighted, noted the Cabinet paper on the subject.
The failure to implement the actions required during the time frame will have serious negative consequences on Sri Lanka's economy and financial system, it further added.
The European Union, in its Parliamentary Sessions in February 2018, has already black-listed Sri Lanka.
One of the action items in the FATF Action Plan has been to introduce amendments to the Companies Act No 7 of 2007, on the identification of beneficial ownership.
The Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank and the Department of Registrar of Companies have drafted the amendments with the consultation of the Company Law Advisory Commission.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, on February 21, had requested to expedite all such amendments.
Thus, the Cabinet approved to amend the company law as per the amendments prepared by the Advisory Commission appointed under Section 506 (1) of the Companies Act No 7 of 2007.

Musings Supply Chain  Management Trends  for today's success
As companies increasingly use their supply chain to compete and gain market share, spending and activity in this area are notably on the upswing. Technology and process upgrades at forward-thinking companies clearly show that supply chainexcellenceismorewidelyacceptedasanelementofoverallbusinessstrategy and that increasing value to customers is not just managements, but everyones business.
The shift in how companies view their supply chain is taking hold. Examine how your company views its supply chain and consider your answers to these basic questions.
Does leadership view your supply chain as a strategic competitive advantage If not, are you considering outsourcing your supply chain
Are the capacity strengths of your supply chain commonly known and understood by leadership of the company If so, how do they impact growth, profitability and customer service
Demand planning sets the tone
As sources and capacities for manufacturing have increased, more companies have moved away from focusing efforts on plant-level production planning and are adopting more of a demand-driven focus of trying to influence and manage demand more efficiently. Rationalizing what you are best at selling, making and delivering, and aligning the sales force with that mindset, is critical to adopting a demand-driven model. The demand-driven approach can help a company create a more customer-focused mindset, without sacrificing operational efficiency.
Ultimately a demand-focused approach to planning can significantly improve demandplanningandmanagementeffortsandhelpoverallcostsandcustomer service efforts.
Advanced demand planning systems and proper strategies can also help uncover data and identify trends buried in a company's information systems. We encourage companies to conduct an enterprise-wide internal Demand Review to gather information from all aspects of the organization.
Goals are then set to gain consensus on what will be sold each month for each product line or category and the resulting revenue. Of course, the driver of the Demand Review process is continuous improvement of forecast accuracy.
Critical to the success of any Demand Plan is having all stakeholders, including sales, marketing, finance, product development and supply chain agree upon a con- sensus Demand Plan. It is important for all participants to discuss factors affecting customer demand patterns, such as new or deleted products, competitors or market conditions, the aggregate demand plans and associated revenue plans. Once all demand for products and services is recognized, the information is consolidated into one Demand Plan.
Demand Planning is a key input to the larger Sales and Operations Planning process and can have a significant positive impact on new product introductions, inventory planning and management, customer service, supply planning efficiency and sourcing strategies. With our clients, we have often seen that Demand Planning success is often tied to organizational structure. We have found that companies with dedicated resources focused around demand planning and forecasting yield stronger results and drive more value to their company. Organizations that focus part time on demand planning and forecasting efforts yield substandard results. With the strategic importance of Demand Planning, companies need to be committed to this from both a resource and technology perspective.
Globalization
The business landscape is rapidly becoming more global. Largely due to improve- ments in communications, globalization is dramatically impacting the way business is managed and transacted, even on the most local levels. No area of a business is affected more by the trend to a global business environment than the supply chain. Manufacturing, distribution, sourcing of materials, invoicing and returns have all been significantly impacted by the increased integration of a global customer and supplier base, and many companies find that existing processes and technology are not flexible enough for this new business environment.
As the volume of container shipments has increased, all of these ports have experienced capacity issues relating to customs clearance and transshipping. As a result, some companies are contemplating rerouting these inbound shipments to alternate ports. This change may seem subtle, but a shift in logistics of this magnitude has far-reaching effects on the overall cost and efficiency of the supply chain network. Dynamically repositioning the point of entry for inbound container shipments can have a positive impact on customs clearance times and access to increased transportation capacity, however there can be a negative impact as well. Better understanding the total landed cost and service implications of alternate ports of entry can help improve supply chain costs and performance.
The right Supply Chain Design is critical to managing the changes brought about by rapid globalization. A well thought-out Supply Chain Network Design can optimize the network and the flow of materials through the network. In doing so, network design captures the costs of the supply chain with a total landed cost perspective, and applies advanced mathematical technology to determine optimal answers to both strategic and tactical questions.
Increased competition and price pressures
Historically, price, product features and brand recognition were enough to differentiate many products in the marketplace. With the continued commoditization of many products, companies need better ways to distinguish themselves. In one case, a large global consumer goods manufacturer saw prices around some of its commodity products drop as much as 60-80 percent. Product innovation and brand equity no longer were allowing them to command a higher price in the market. In order to continue to compete with that commoditized product they made significant cost improvements with supply chain re-design and technology.
Companies are looking to their supply chains in two ways to help offset this trend. First, they are looking at ways to reduce cost and are creating a more efficient value chain to remain cost competitive. Second, companies are looking at ways they can provide value-added services to meet the demands of more sophisticated customers.
Cost improvements around inventory management, logistics operations, material management and manufacturing costs, including raw material and component acquisition can be found with:
a. Sales and operations planning
b. Transportation/distribution management
c. Improved product life cycle management
d. Improved strategic sourcing and
procurement
Suppliers can differentiate themselves in a number of ways as well as provide value, additional services and capabilities to their customers. The differentiating factors include Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), RFID, Labeling and packaging, Drop shipping and Collaboration.
Companies should not only look to their supply chain to drive cost improvement, but should increase capabilities as a means for staying competitive. Streamlining processes with better design, better collaboration across networks and new services will help your company stay competitive and strengthen relationships with your customers.
Outsourcing
As many companies step back and examine their core competencies, some realize that outsourcing parts or all of a supply chain can be advantageous. With market- place improvements around Information media and systems, Cost and quality of global manufacturing and distribution, and Product design capabilities, companies are gaining additional synergies by outsourcing all or parts of their supply chain.
There can be significant economic benefits from outsourcing all or part of your supply chain operation, but without the right systems, processes, or organizational management structure the risk to success can increase to frightening levels. In an outsource-heavy environment companies need to put more controls and systems in place to compensate for the fact that their supply chain capabilities no longer reside onsite. In an outsourced supply chain environment the need for information, controls and excellence from the information worker becomes a high priority.
The optimally outsourced supply chain, either in its entirety or just a component, relies heavily on:
a. Superior supply chain network design
b. Inclusion of that outsource partner
in the information chain
c.Establishment of control mechanisms
to proactively monitor the various
components of the supply chain and,
d.Information systems to connect and
coordinate the supply chain as s
eamlessly as possible.
Shortened and more complex product life cycles
Today many of our clients are under pressure to develop innovative products and bring them to market more rapidly, while minimizing cannibalization of existing products, which are still in high demand. In order to meet the needs of both customers and consumers, companies need more efficient product lifecycle management processes. This includes heavy emphasis on managing new product introduction, product discontinuation, design for manufacturability and leveraging across their entire product and infrastructure characteristics.
One chief benefit of PLM processes and technology is helping companies design products that can share common operations, components or materials with other products, thereby reducing risks of obsolescence write-offs, increasing cost leverage on the purchasing of key materials and ensuring that infrastructure investments are optimally utilized. Additionally, getting this right will help to improve your time to market. By focusing product lifecycle management efforts in these areas, a company can buffer itself against the risk of an unplanned cost increase, a poor new product launch, an unplanned obsolescence write off and can enhance the overall customer perception of the company as an effective innovator.
ypically when companies begin the process of introducing new products to market, they coordinate marketing, engineering, sales and procurement and develop sales forecasts to plan products in the pipeline. Without a formalized product lifecycle process the end result isnt always predictable.
As a result, the company increased parts re-use, improved document retrieval time, reduced design cycle time, and ultimately reduced new product development cos.t These improvements helped the company grow revenue by mainly from an increased rate of product introductions.
As the economy becomes more global, labeling and compliance to packaging requirements and regulations have become critical to success. Without adherence to local packaging and labeling regulations a product may violate local requirements, preventing it from being distributed and sold in that market. Product lifecycle manage- meant technology and processes can help ensure that products being produced and targeted for specific markets are well-managed and are compliant. Product lifecycle management tools and processes have helped consumer goods companies with their efforts to try to continually drive demand through packaging and labeling innovation and design. Implementation of an optimal PLM process and technology can allow a consumer goods company to effectively produce and distribute products that are only targeted for regional promotions or consumer preferences.
Collaboration between stakeholders in the extended Supply Chain
As supply chains continue to develop and mature, a move toward more intense collaboration between customers and suppliers has occurred. The level of collaboration goes beyond linking information systems to fully integrating business processes and organization structures across companies that comprise the full value chain.
The ultimate goal of collaboration is to increase visibility throughout the value chain in an effort to make better management decisions and to ultimately decrease value chain costs. With the right tools, processes and organizational structure in place, collaboration provides key people throughout the value chain with the information needed to make business-critical decisions with the best available information.
Recent examples of collaboration have emerged in the expansion of Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) processes that include upstream and downstream value chain partners as regular participants. S&OP processes help maintain a well-coordinated and valid, current operating plan in support of customer demand, a business plan and a strategy. The improved resulting operating plan provides the management of each partner with a complete picture of forecasted demand, supply capacity, corresponding financial information with financial implications and allows them to make informed, critical decisions.
Companies that expand the usage of Sales and Operations Planning have greater visibility across their owner enterprise and respective value chain, gain the agility necessary to improve the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) process, improve promotional planning, minimize unnecessary buildups of inventory, increase revenue predictability and execute customer service expectations.
The S&OP activity enables information systems to connect the value chain participants around key demand information, such as customer forecasts, and around key supply information, such as supplier inventories and capacities.
Another recent example of collaboration is seen in the increased focus around RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). Value chain leaders are looking at functional areas to better integrate the supply chains of their partners with themselves. RFID can serve as a means to quickly and efficiently ensure that critical product information is communicated as products flow through the value chain and ultimately to consumer.
Recent estimates show that major retailers can lose 3-4 percent of revenue per year due to shelf stock outs, while inventory is available somewhere in the value chain. Better coordination of store-level product availability would have a significant impact to the entire value chain for these retailers. Additionally, better visibility of retailer product availability can reduce overall logistics costs as products move through the value chain to fulfill safe stock levels and ultimately consumer demand.
The role of technology in supporting these trends
As supply chain networks have become more complex, the need for greater and improved supply chain technology solutions has become critical. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and best-of-breed Supply Chain Management (SCM) solution providers have made significant investments in developing solutions to address the needs of manufacturing and distribution companies in areas, such as, Network and Inventory Optimization, Logistics Optimization, Product Lifecycle Management, RFID, Sales and Operations Planning, Procurement, Manufacturing Optimization and Business Intelligence
These technologies have helped enable the supply chain information worker innovate, drive cost reductions, improve service and meet customer expectations better than ever. In order to have sustainable improvement in supply chain performance, a business must have the right balance of investments in organization, processes and technology. Lack of investment and focus in any one of these areas will reduce your ability to achieve fundamental, sustainable improvement.
Conclusion
Developing, manufacturing and selling a product can challenge the best organizations in the best of times. As a companys business driver's change, business processes, SCM technology investment and the overall approach to supply chain management must change and keep pace. An inefficient and poorly functioning supply chain can negatively impact every aspect of an organization, jeopardizing the long-term performance and success of a business.
To remain successful companies need organization-wide buy-in to supply chain excellence and some will need to re-evaluate their current processes and performance with these key trends in mind:
a. Demand Planning as an imperative
b. Globalization
c. Increased competition and
price pressures
d. Outsourcing
e. Shortened and more complex
product lifecycles
f.Collaboration between stakeholders
Companies that re-evaluate their business and how the current supply chain structure supports the businessfrom a strategy, process, technology and organizational perspective must focus on keeping their supply chain aligned with the overall business strategy. To succeed, companies must embrace Supply Chain Excellence as a core competency at all levels throughout the company and recognize that supply chain management is executed in many areas, not just the functional supply chain organization.

NRC project to provide safe drinking water for dry zone, NCP
Peradeniya University Professor Rohana Chandrajith said that over 3 million people in dry zone particularly in the North Central Province and it is bordering regions are at an acute water stress.
The proposed National Research Council of Sri Lanka (NRC) project hopes to provide a total solution of safe water in the dry zone selecting a model village as per the UN sustainable development goals of provision of safe water by 2030.
All project deliverables will build on firm scientific foundations as applied towards solving this problem, Prof. Chandrajith said addressing a media briefing held at the NRC premises yesterday .
"More than 300 paddy and garden soils were analysed for their chemical constitutes.The results showed the involvement of heavy metal for the onset of disease is very minimal as contents are extremely low in drinking water and soil. The effect of possible toxicological parameters on kidney cells is being tested under the laboratory conditions using cell lines,he said.
Prof. Chandrajith said the model water treatment plant is now operational at the Rajarata University.Presently the treated water is being used by the university community.The aim of this activity is to provide a robust water treatment facility to a village. After optimizing the conditions, a model treatment facility will be provided to a village this year. Our researchers will not conduct any research in the villages.They will be done at the university or national laboratories. At the same time, the villagers are not involved in plant operation. It will be carried out by university professionals in the field. However, villagers are responsible for safe guarding the water source against contamination.
In Sri Lanka, 90%of the urban population has access to safe pipe water and 60% of the rural population has access to protected well water. The rest depend on unclean water with no monitoring and protection and about 75% of the rural domestic water supply needs are met from groundwater by means of dug wells and tube wells.
As a result, some elements that are geogenic in origin has markedly affected the health of the rural population. Among the chemicals that are geogenic in origin, fluoride takes the center stage as it is the main suspected offender for the Chronic Kidney Disease of known etiology (CKDu). Additionally, existence of higher levels of calcium and magnesium found in these areas are also recognized as geogenic in origin. It has been estimated that during the past two decades there are deaths of 22,000 people from CKD in the North Central province and at least 5 to 6 out of 100 people are currently affected. And about 5% of the annual health budget is spent on the management of CKD patients as they need more dialysis machines and other equipment and services.
The high levels of nitrates in the wet zone of Sri Lanka has been attributed to several reasons of which geochemical origin being the main emphasis. According to published data, amount of metal contaminants of the Kelani river water is higher that the levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. In addition, most of the surface water urban areas is polluted due to dumping of domestic waste, sewage and industrial effluents. It has also been recorded that many parts of the Jaffna district and Gampola area,domestic water is heavily polluted with E-coli and other bacterial species. Out of 25 districts, 15 districts are clearly affected due to contaminants in drinking water.
From these data it is apparent that the amount of water population in the country is significant and the ultimate result of this predicament is deteriorating health condition of the populace which is also going to affect the country's economy.Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and easy to use water purification system particularly for rural areas. As far as the water treatment methods in Sri Lanka are concerned, disinfection, partial treatment, full treatment to advanced treatment is already in place. Of these methods, the point of use water treatment can be identified as the best technique that can be adopted in rural areas as it is simple and easy to operative.Therefore, in this project we have focused on developing water purification systems to remove both chemical and biological contaminants, based on advanced materials to provide the rural community with a low cost and effective point of use water filters which request no electricity.

## Title: Obstruction free access

Obstruction free access
Making our pavements and pedestrian areas safe and creating a barrier-free pedestrian environment is fundamentally important to those with physical impairments or the differently abled. It is essential that when designing Colombos beautification projects, attention is also paid to the needs of people with mobility impairments and these should be to the highest possible standards. This requires knowledge of the capabilities of different types of persons ease of movement. In designing or modifying facilities, the aim should be to become generous in the allocation of space.
For many of us who are fortunate to have complete mobility, it is insignificant or unimportant and most often unnoticed that a pillar or obstruction exists on the centre of a pavement or an elevated pavement or bus stand, as we have the agility to manoeuvre past it without much effort. Yet for someone on a wheel chair or with mobility impairments this can be an obstacle that hampers their free movement and restricts them from independently moving about.
Smart City needs to be liveable
During the previous government, much emphasis was placed on the beautification of the Colombo city. Even today there is greater attention paid to transforming Colombo into a smart city, but overlooking the question of whether it is a liveable city. In Sri Lanka, we have created an environment for those with mobility restrictions to be looked upon with pity and as a group in our society that needs our assistance, without empowering them to be independent and live with dignity just like the rest of us. For someone in a wheel chair or even an elderly person with limited or impaired mobility, it is totally impossible for them to use public transport, be it trains or buses. Most of the buildings in the city lack wheel chair access, such as ramps etc. and many of the toilet facilities provided at even some of the larger hotels in the city, have no toilet facilities for those on a wheel chair or for those having mobility impairments. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and fast as Sri Lanka is fast becoming a country with a high aging population. Before we make Colombo a smart city, should we not make it liveable for all
While activists have been fighting for disability rights in the past, these trio have achieved their goal not by protesting by the street side or opposite important ministries. Instead, Prasanna Kuruppu (disable rights activist), late Cyril Siriwardena (disable rights activist) and Vidya Abhayagunawardena adopted a more direct and effective lobbying approach. They targeted the right persons in key institutions, such as the CMC and took the message that people with mobility restrictions too had the right and could be independent if the right facilities and access was provided. This approach obviously worked as the Colombo Municipal Council Eng. Lalith Wickremaratne (Acting Commissioner CMC), Eng. Anura Wickremaratne (Director Traffic), Eng. M. Fazal (Director Engineering), Eng. Devika Abeysuriya (Deputy Director Engineering-Central Road Maintenance Unit), Nihal Wickramaratne (Director Engineering  Traffic Design and Road Safety) and architects and TOs at the CMC responded with much enthusiasm.
According to Vidya Abhayagunawardena, When a city meets a Liveable City status (having all the physical infrastructure in place and other services), it will help to work towards a Smart City status. Further it will make a pathway to apply to all ICT platforms for the city services which will invariably lead to a high quality of service delivery.
As a result, a meeting was held on February 21 this year with the participation of concerned citizens namely Prasanna Kuruppu, Vidya Abeygunawardane, Sasanka Mendis and CMC officials. At the meeting, a presentation was done and some locations which are not accessible for disabled persons on Baudhaloka Mawatha were highlighted.
Moving towards accessibility
All the points were well noted by CMC and it was decided to select one road and to do a pilot project. Hence, Baudhdhaloka Mawatha was selected and decided to have a site inspection with the concerned citizens and the CMC officials to identify the rectifications to be done.
The site inspection was carried out on February 26, 2018 with the participation of both parties.
The inspection commenced from No.69, Gregorys road and continued to Baudhdhaloka Mawatha. The Baudhdhaloka Mawatha (from Baseline Road to Maitland Place) and a small section of the Gregorys Road were inspected.
Several locations and the adjustments needed to facilitate wheelchair access and access for those with impairments were identified during the inspection.
1. Lowering of foot walks near the by lanes and entrances in order to facilitate a wheel chair and free movement. Approximately 40 locations were identified in Baudhdhaloka Mawatha and 6 locations were identified in Gregorys Road in front of D. S. Senanayaka College.
2. Two bus halts were identified and alterations that need to be done in order to facilitate the disabled community. There were no space for a wheel chair to move due to the step. It was suggested to have a ramp and remove a bar (shown in the photograph) which was obstructing free movement.
3. One manhole was identified to be raised. It is already informed to Dialog.
4. The road crossing at Wijerama Mawatha is fully blocked due to the bollards of the British High Commission. (Photo attached)
5. Two locations were identified to provide ramps due to the roots of the trees.
6. Foot walk near the entrance to BMICH to be lowered to facilitate them to reach BMICH.
7. A guard rail near the European Union office to be removed.
8. Guard room between European Union and embassy of China Republic to be shifted.
9. Storm water gullies which are fallen on the road crossings to be shifted in several places.
10. Old traffic signal poles to be removed at the junction of Baudhdhaloka Mawatha and Maitland Place.
11. A foundation erected for the display board across the road that was too big was also identified.
Based on the inspection and identification of the changes that need to be done in order to facilitate free movement for the mobility impaired, the CMC team commenced the lowering of the foot walks and other related works on Baudhdhaloka Mawatha on March 12.
The concerned citizens who participated in the inspection had also made a special request to provide free accessibility for the disabled community on Baudhdhaloka Mawatha from Galle Road to Baseline Road before the Vesak festival. The CMC team has assured them that they would try their best to fulfil that request.
Meanwhile, Vidya Abhayagunawardena told the Daily News that they had also requested to see the possibility of marking a wheelchair sign along the stretch of foot walk with free accessibility in order to avoid motor cycles using the foot walks once the entrances are lowered.
He said, based on the accessible regulations by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, the Supreme Court Judgment on accessibility rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) which will be implemented in Sri Lanka after having the local regulations in place, people will have more power and the State institutions should get ready to deliver such services from now onward. Having accessible pavements will bring humane face to the city and many other benefits.
What the people need
First, Sri Lankan cities should work toward achieving a Liveable City status. Improving transportation, Complete Streets, Open Spaces, Land use, Housing for poor, Employment opportunities, Water and sanitation, Waste recycling, Zero stray dog population, Crime prevention and safety, Use of renewable energy, Zero Dengue outbreak and other communicable diseases, Flood control mechanisms and overall, having an integrated environmental policy, said Vidya Abhayagunawardena.
He noted that once we achieve a Liveable City status we can think of having cities with Smart City status. Namely, Mobility, Health, Safety and Productivity - mostly run by ICT platforms and leading to a high quality of life. Singapore became the best Smart City in the World last week beating London and NY. Singapore has shown its superiority in the use of ICT advancements in their services delivery. This is the end of the tunnel story or the end goal of a Smart City. No doubt that having ICT platforms will help to ease a lot of congestion currently facing service delivery points in Sri Lanka. But that does not mean that Sri Lankan cities will have Smart City status with the use of such ICT platforms in their service delivery points.
Focusing on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, by 2030 there will be 10 targets to be achieved according to Goal No.11 and we hope that Sri Lanka will be able to achieve this Goal's target if we start planning and executing them properly from now onward, he added.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, Acting Municipal Commissioner Eng. Lalith Wickremaratne said that the CMC is committed and willing to work with the people in delivering a safe and accessible city for all. It is indeed welcoming to see normal citizens approaching us and getting involved in these activities. This will also help us to identify the areas that are sometimes overlooked. Our culture is that when a person is disabled, he must be confined to his home environment and we dont give them the opportunity to move around independently like others, probably because we dont have the proper facilities. So we have to start taking note of their rights and empowering them to make them part of our society, he said.
With regard to persons with disability, our society has an attitude problem and because of that certain things are just ignored. When children are at a young age, certain corrective action must be taken. Because of this fear of coming out, these people with impaired abilities are kept isolated within just their family circle and parents too prefer to keep them to themselves. This must be changed and these persons too are members of our society and they have a right to have their needs catered to, to live freely enjoying the same facilities accorded to every other citizen, said Nihal Wickramaratne (Director Engineering  Traffic Design and Road Safety).
The problem here is that we are used to looking at those with impairments in a charity based approach. It should instead be a rights based approach meeting their needs, added Eng. Devika Abeysuriya (Deputy Director Engineering - Central Road Maintenance Unit), under whom this project is being implemented.
Eng. M. Fazal (Director Engineering) said, People with impairments should be empowered to make them independent and live as every other citizen with dignity, instead of having to depend on others. This will enable them to function independently and reach their full potential, instead of being made to feel inferior. Most of those with impairment resent pity and they want to be treated like every other citizen, being able to live an independent and dignified life.
The CMC has assured that this programme will commence from Colombo and eventually reach all other cities as well. It is also mandatory for all new buildings that are being constructed to include access for those with mobility restrictions. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of making the city accessible and friendly to those with mobility and visual impairments. There is much to be done, but it is indeed a welcome sign that the CMC has taken the initiative in the right direction and it is hoped that the new Mayor, Rosie Senanayake will take the lead in making Colombo a city that caters to all alike, able or not and empower our fellow citizens with mobility impairments to live freely without being restricted in any manner enabling them to live a life free and independent.Singapore became the best Smart City in the world last week and rated as a leading Liveable City.

Committee to evaluate US survey firms viability: Gayantha
A Committee headed by the Land Ministry Secretary, including members of the Surveyor Generals Department, unions, and Surveyors Association among others was appointed on March 19 to discuss issues pertaining to the regularization of providing title deeds and modernization of preparing cadastral maps of the Survey Department and the involvement of the US company Trimble Inc., Lands and Parliament Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said
The Committee will issue its report today, the Minister said.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake under standing orders 23/2 in Parliament yesterday.
Dissanayake said the Government Surveyors Department is able to regulate providence of title deeds and to modernize preparing cadastral maps to a cost below 40 million US dollars. Why has the government not considered the proposal of the Survey Department It is financially more profitable and has long term benefits. But Trimble Inc. has projected a cost of 154 million US dollars (Rs. 23,870 million) for the project, he said.
Dissanayake asked how Trimble Inc. had volunteered to take on this project even without being invited.
In response Karunatillake said that according to his knowledge, Trimble had tried to engage in this task even during the previous government.
Trimble had presented their proposals to the Economic Management Committee of the Ministry in October 2015. Discussions with them had commenced at that point.
We have also taken into consideration the hidden costs of the project and the concerns of the unions and these issues are being discussed at present by the appointed committee. There are costs to be borne by the Survey Department, Land Commissioner General, Registrar General so on and all these costs will be considered and discussed by the committee and included in the report, he said.
Dissanayake raised concern over the countrys sensitive data and survey details getting into the hands of a foreign company.
Karunatillake said the data is not considered secret or sensitive. They will be managed by the Survey Department. There is no room whatsoever for the countrys sensitive or secret details to get into the hands of any external or unauthorised entity. The Minister said discussions between the unions and the government are underway. He noted that the strike action launched by the unions has been called off having understood the issue and the requirements of thousands of people waiting for their deeds.
A Cabinet paper submitted by Lands and Parliament Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka in September last year (2017) noted that the US firm, Trimble Navigation Limited based out of California, had presented a 170 million dollar proposal in this regard.
The proposal had come through the Prime Minister led CCEM or Cabinet Committee on Economic Management. The Cabinet memo also noted that through discussions, the government was able to negotiate the cost to 154mn US dollars. On October 11, 2017, the whole project received the green light from the Cabinet.
Under the first phase of the project, Trimble Inc. has been tasked with surveying 2.5mn blocks of land around the country, excluding the Western Province and regularised issuing title deeds.
The second phase will see implementing the project for 2.5mn plots of land in the Western Province.
Karunatillake noted that surveying activities will under no circumstance be handed over to any foreign party since the country has qualified surveyors. The Survey Department is the countrys oldest department. He said that the department need to be upgraded to meet current standards and if required, only technological expertise will be obtained from foreign companies.
As we pledged earlier, it is the responsibility of the government to provide lands for the landless and allocate lands for the displaced. We intend to fulfil this commitment and measures are underway in this regard. Previous government made this promise, but they have failed to reach the goal. There is an issue with our limited resources and technical expertise. Required assistance will be obtained in these areas to upgrade our institutions in order to deliver optimal results, the Minister said.
No Confidence Motion against PM for debate on April 4
Party Leaders yesterday decided to take up the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for debate in Parliament on April 4.
The decision was arrived at a Party Leaders meeting chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday morning.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the vote on the NCM would be taken on the same day following a full-day debate. The number of questions at the commencement of sittings has been reduced from 15 to eight to allow more time for the debate.
The sittings will commence at 9.30am and the debate may continue until about 9.30pm. The vote will be taken thereafter, MP Dissanayake said.
He said the JVP would vote in favour of the NCM. TNA MPs said a decision on their vote is yet to be made.
The Joint Opposition handed over the NCM containing 14 accusations against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on Wednesday with the signatures of 55 MPs. Four SLFP members in the Government ranks also signed the motion.
This is the third NCM against a Prime Minster in the Sri Lankan Parliament history. Previously, two NCMs had been submitted and taken for vote against former PMs, the late SWRD Bandaranaike in 1957 and Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1975.
Previously, there had been 23 NCMs against Governments, 13 against Ministers, six against Speakers and Deputy Speakers, one against an Opposition Leader and another one against a Chief Justice.
Wijenayakes inclusion in Presidential delegation to Japan questionable
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake questioned how former Parliamentarian Piyasiri Wijenayake, who is accused of corruption as per the PRECIFAC report, became a member of the Sri Lankan delegation accompanied the President to his state visit to Japan.
He said that about 200 individuals are accused of wrongdoing as per the PRECIFAC report and Wijenayake is among them.
The MP pointed out that Wijenayake has been found guilty of corruption as the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) tabled in Parliament last month.
Wijeyanaya travelled to Japan with the President as a member of the official delegation and even sat in the round-table discussion with the Japanese Prime Minister. How can the court cases and legal proceedings against Wijanayake proceed under these circumstances Does not this act make a negative influence on the Judiciary and Police he asked.
He requested the Government to forward his question to the Law and Order Ministry and get him a proper reply. Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunathilake said he would refer the matter to the relevant ministry.
Summon SAITMChairman before COPA
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa requested Parliament to summon the Chairman of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), Dr. Neville Fernando, before the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) over paid newspaper advertisements to sell the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), taken over by the government last year.
The advertisement is said to have been published in several newspapers a few weeks ago that the NFTH was up for sale.
Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa was participating in the debate taken up on Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Act.
He asked how a hospital taken over by the government could be put up for sale.
Raising a supplementary question during the Oral Question Round, Jayatissa raised the same question on March 20, but State Minister of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero had dismissed the question claiming that Jayatissas supplementary question was irrelevant with his original oral question.
Last year, it was reported that the NFTH was handed over to the government. The President and Health Minister participated in a ceremony marking the handing over of the NFTH to the government.
This was also reported by the media. It was reported that the NFTH was to be transformed and developed into the best hospital in Asia.
But quite strangely, newspaper advertisements appear for the sale of the hospital. How can this happen Jayatissa asked.
Jayatissa said the Government Medical Officers Association had requested for the agreement signed between the government and the NFTH when it was handed over to the government under Right to Information Act (RTI). However, the Health Ministry had notified the GMOA that there was no such agreement but only a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
The government has been paying the NFTH around Rs. 300 million per month since the acquisition for its operations. Under such a situation, how can advertisements be published putting the establishment up for sale When I raised this question, none of the government MPs cared to respond. I hope that they will be able to give a proper reply as soon as possible, he noted.
Dr. Jayatissa suggested that in the event there is some confusion over the matter, the Chairman of SAITM, Dr. Neville Fernando, could be summoned before the Public Accounts Committee and questioned about the newspaper advertisements.
Glyphosate ban should not be relaxed: Rajitha
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne yesterday in Parliament said he was strongly against relaxing the ban on Glyphosate.
Speaking during the debate on Regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, the Minister pointed out that the Glyphosate ban should not be reversed and urged the other MPs to speak up against such a move.
The call to ban the Glyphosate strongly came even during the previous government. Ven Rathana Thera was in the forefront in the campaign. But the then Government paid no heed. The ban was imposed after this government took office. Now the pressure is mounting again to lift this ban and I am strongly against such a move, he said.
He pointed out the Health Ministry has paid high attention to improve the facilities to treat the kidney patients. There were only 228 dialysis machines in the country when I took office and I have taken measures to increase the number to 1,000 by the end of this year, he said.
Call to change electoral systembefore PC elections intensifies
The call to amend the newly introduced electoral system for the Provincial Councils (PCs) grew in Parliament yesterday as Government and Opposition members admitted that it would lead to hung PCs.
The Delimitation Committee Report on the PCs was previously scheduled to be taken up in Parliament yesterday, but the Government deferred it and facilitated a one hour adjournment debate on the topic.
All the members who spoke during the adjournment debate stressed the new mix member proportional system introduced for the PCs must undergo further changes before holding the PC elections. Several of them even proposed to revert to the old electoral system.
The adjournment motion was moved by JO MP Tharaka Balasuriya and seconded by JO MP Kanaka Herath. JO MPs Jayantha Samaraweera and Janaka Wakkumbura and UNP MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi joined the debate on it.
They pointed out that the new electoral system introduced to the LG bodies has led to instability and chaos to an extent that they cannot even appoint a Chairman. MP Tharaka Balasuriya requested to reintroduce five percent cut-off marks and bonus seats which were done away with when amending the electoral system.
Provincial Councils and Local Government State Minister Sriyani Wijewickrama replied to the motion as Minister Faiszer Musthapha was overseas.
The 60:40 ratio of the First-Past-the-Post and Proportional Representation that applied to LG elections will change to 50:50 ratio at the PC elections. This will further lead to instability. I am also of the opinion that 50:50 ratio must change to 70:30, she said. She proposed that Parliament must discuss and bring in necessary amendments to correct the identified shortcomings when the Delimitation Committee report is taken up.
The report needs to be passed with two thirds majority, and if so we can proceed to hold the PC elections. If not, the Prime Minister will have to appoint an all-party representative committee to deliberate on the revisions to the report. A final decision has to be referred to the President, she said.

Peiris must explain his volte face
Pohottuwa chairman and former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris has done a series of about turns, after switching loyalties to Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2008. Peiris, it appears, has developed selective amnesia on the stands he has adopted with the regard to economic policies and the ethnic question in a different avatar. The former Law Professor who was known as the oracle kokatath thailaya in the Chandrika government, no doubt, due to his academic standing, was at one time a great proponent of the market economy and a firm advocate of devolution.
Alas, today though, he speaks as if he was nowhere on the scene when he takes up positions that are diametrically opposed what he himself had been promoting and advocating as a senior minister, under both, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing a media briefing, with his sidekick Gamini Lokuge, the other day, Peiris has discovered privatization to be a dirty word and has blamed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsighe for considering privatization as the panacea for all the economic ills of the country.
It is this selfsame G.L. Peiris it was who piloted the new look open economy of CBK, when she became President in 1994, as her Deputy Finance Minister (CBK being the Finance Minister). Chandrika, during that election campaign, told the electorate that she would not go back to the days of her mother's socialist policies, marked by nationalization, but would retain the open economy of the UNP, only that it would be an open economy with a human face, whatever that meant. Not only that, she famously said that she, who was a good socialist in the past, would now be a good capitalist, a remark that was to prompt one of her MPs, Dullas Alahapperuma, to state in parliament, that the government was signalling to the Left and turning Right, vamata signal dala dakunata haravanawa.
G.L. Peiris, it was, who was the point man in this new brand of the open economy of Chandrika. He fired the first salvo in announcing to parliament the invitation extended to the Shell Gas Company, who was shown the door by CBK's mother, when the latter was PM in 1961, to set up business again in the country. Perhaps, Prof. Peiris, who always has a ready explanation to everything, could offer his own interpretation.
This was just for starters. Thereafter, Peiris went about his business with gusto introducing several pieces of legislation in parliament for further liberalization of the economy, and by extension, privatization of state ventures, that must have made even the UNP blush and which also drew the ire of the Ministers, such as Indhika Gunawardena, representing the Communist Party, for the heresy that was being practiced.
Peiris's fidelity to privatization was not confined to the Chandrika era, but also extended to the Mahinda Rajapaksa tenure, where he readily acquiesced with MR's privatization programme, involving the Chinese. Not a word was uttered by Peiris over the handing over of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese firms and the Mattala airport project. Can Peiris explain what the Port City project, initiated by Rajapaksa, is all about, if not privatization, or, the handing over of the land, on which the army headquarters in Galle Face stood, for the construction of the Shangrila hotel, as an outright giveaway
It is this same double standards the former law professor is adopting today with regard to the ethnic question. Peiris, who has today donned the garb of a nationalist, addressing press conferences alongside the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, singing from the same hymn sheet, it was who led the government delegation to world capitals for
peace talks with the LTTE, whose delegates comprised Anton Balasingham, Thamil Selvam, Pulitheevan et al. At the time he (Peiris) had no qualms of hobnobbing with the leaders of the Tamil diaspora, which today he demonizes, and, blames for plotting to divide the country, with the UNP.
Prof. Peiris, who is today among the most vocal advocates against devolution cannot be so naive as to expect the public at large to glibly accept his protestations in this regard, especially following the prominent role he once played to make Sri Lanka a quasi federal state. This virulent critic of federalism, it was, who brought the infamous pakejaya of Chandrika to parliament that sought to convert the country into a Union of Regions, that government even going so far as to buying over members from the Opposition to ensure its passage. The effort though was thwarted, with the UNP burning copies of the draft constitution in the well of the House.
It behoves the learned professor, who is a noted academic, to explain to the public the reasons for his volte face. Is it that he has suddenly become enamoured by the brand of racist politics that is being practiced by the Rajapaksa camp, or, is the metamorphosis born out of his own convictions
Peiris should not keep the public waiting, lest he be cast in the mould of yet another garden politician craving for power and privilege, devoid of principles.

PUCSL to establish licensing framework for electricians
In 2012, there were 180 deaths from electrocution, most of them owing to poor safety and quality of wiring, revealed the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday as it held its public consultation on establishing a licensing framework for electricians in the country at the BMICH.
The licensing system is expected to come into effect on October 1.
There are close to 21,000 electricians in the country with a majority not being qualified to operate as electricians. The new licensing system developed by the PUCSL together with the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka (IESL), the Tertiary Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA), the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA), the Ceylon Electricity Bard (CEB) and the Lanka Electricity Company (PVT) Ltd, will certify electricians based on an assessment of their skills and whether they have the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificate for the job.
Electricians qualified with NVQ 3 and above can obtain a permanent license from CIDA, after proving their knowledge at an evaluation facilitated by the evaluation panel, stated PUCSL whilst others will be given a temporary license for three years to allow them to get the certificate.
Those who are not professionally qualified but have hands on experience, will be given the opportunity to prove their competency and to qualify for NVQ levels through a process facilitated by CIDA.
Permanent licenses will allow electricians to design, wire and test the installation of domestic wiring (30amps Signal phase) and issue a certificate to get the electrical connection needed by CEB and LECO. These electricians will also be allowed to wire, test and install three phase 30amps and 60 amps installations, subject to the design by a chartered engineer.
The new system proposed by PUCSL it will also be mandatory in future to produce the certification of an electrician with the permanent license, stating that the installation was designed, wired and tested in order to receive a domestic electrical connection (up to 30A, single phase).
Professionals, government institutions, electricians and interested parties making their submissions at the consultations welcomed the move to certify electricians and to make it a professionally recognised field of employment. More importantly this would help ensure the safety standards of electrical installations in the country.

Real GDP growth to rise to 4.4% in 2018 - First Capital Research
Following a series of weather related shocks in 2017, the Sri Lankan economy is gradually normalizing with the real GDP growth projected to rise to 4.4% in 2018 according to First Capital Research.
According to their monthly report this positive trend is mainly supported by the recovery in agriculture and industry. Inflation is projected to revert to around 5% by end of 2018, as food prices stabilize. On a YoY basis food category inflation decreased to 6% and non-food category inflation stood at 3.8%.
First Capital states that despite weather related shocks and some delays in implementation, program performance remains broadly on track.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has been effective in curbing credit growth and stabilizing inflation despite recent pressures, while stepping up its pace of reserve accumulation. Against this backdrop, the authorities should push ahead with their Vision 2025 strategy to support Sri Lankas rapid and inclusive growth through ambitious structural, macro-economic and social reforms.
The CBSL has prudently managed monetary policy in the face of price shocks and market volatility. The CBSL should remain focused on price stability as its primary objective and stand ready to tighten if signs of demand-side inflation pressures or accelerating credit growth appear.
However Sri Lankas private sector credit marginally dropped to Rs.59.9 billion in December 2017, thereby, credit growth continued to decline to 14.7% YoY while government credit reflected a net borrowing of Rs. 40 billion after a lapse of 6 consecutive months.
Expressing their views on the on Treasury bills and political instability created via unexpected LG poll, resulted in an upward movement in the overall yield curve. Selling interest was heavy in the mid to long tenors significant selling registered in 2021 and 2026 maturities.
The increase in foreign selling during the month saw an overall net foreign outflow of Rs. 9.01 billion in February 2018.
Meanwhile foreign reserves increased to USD 7.9 billion in February 2018 from USD 7.7 billon in January 2018. Market liquidity has picked up again in March after a sharp drop in liquidity in early February 2018.
Exports improved 18.7% YoY in Dec 2017, largely contributed by industrial exports (+ 21.6% YoY), mainly exports of animal fodder (+ 37. 8 % YoY ) supported by textiles and garment (+ 19.4% YoY) supported by rubber products (+ 19 .6% YoY) and petroleum products (+ 102. 8 % YoY) .
Earnings from agricultural exports improved by 9.3% YoY due to notable performance recorded in tea exports and seafood exports.
Once again exports improved 18.7% YoY in Dec 2017, largely contributed by industrial exports (+21.6%YoY), mainly exports of animal fodder (+37.8%YoY) supported by textiles and garment (+19.4%YoY) supported by rubber products (+19.6%YoY) and petroleum products (+102.8%YoY).

Scouting the way forward
In 1917 the Vice Principal of Wesley College, Rev. Percy T. Cash M.A. B.Sc., who was acting for the principal introduced boy scouting to the school, and thus was founded the Wesley College Scout Troop which was registered as the 14th Colombo Scout Troop.
Rev. Cash served as the first Scout Master and was assisted by S. Wijesooriya, a Kings Scout from Galle who was the Instructor. That year the school had a collective strength of 64 Scouts forming nine patrols. The keenness of the scouts was amply demonstrated, as before long the troop produced five Kings Scouts.
It was in March 1918 that the Troop made its first public appearance, when they formed a Guard of honour to the Colonial Secretary, R. Edward Stubbs, who was Chief Guest at the college prize day that year. Another important event was the celebration of the Troop's anniversary on the July 25, 1918, with the Director of Education E. B. Denham declaring open the 14th Colombo Scout den and distributing badges to the scouts. At this event the Chief Guest was welcomed by the Deputy Colonial Scout Commissioner, Vernon Grenier and the Scout Master of Wesley, Rev. Percy T. Cash. The occasion was presided by the Principal, Rev. Henry Highfield who was back from furlough.
The name of J. E. de Silva a member of the tutorial staff is synonymous with scouting at Wesley. De Silva, who later became known to the Scout World as "Blue Feather due to his dedication and keenness rested the 14th Colombo for over 20 years was a keen Scout Master.
B. R. Blaze was also a Scout Master in 1947 and 1948. The 14th Colombo also remembers with gratitude the untiring efforts of Rev. James Cartman, Wesley's vibrant Principal during the Second World War era.
J. E. de Silva too left Wesley in March 1949 and Shelton Peiris, a former Senior Prefect of Wesley took over as Scout Master at a time when the Troop was without a Staff Adviser and he had Edmund Dissanayake, yet another former Senior Prefect acting as his Assistant.
During this period the 14th Colombo also had I. G. K. Chandrasena, an old Wesleyite and Scout Field Commissioner amongst many other trained Scouters. In 1960 we had R E Abraham of the tutorial staff, and brother of former District Scout Commissioner Ratnam Abraham, as the Chief Scout Master.
In the Golden Jubilee year the 14th Colombo had eight representatives out of a total contingent of 28 representing the Colombo contingent at the Golden Jubilee jamboree 1962.
In 1963, the Cub Master E. L. Rodrigo of the tutorial staff stepped in to help the troop and was assisted by N.R. Dhanapala from Richmond College Galle who was also from the tutorial staff.
Towards the end of the 60s decade and in 1970, the 14th Colombo was fortunate to obtain the services of George Peiris as Group Scout Master. He was a Head Quarters Commissioner. The College Chaplain, Rev. John Trevanna too was associated with the Scout troop during his tenure at Wesley in the early 70s. It was in the 60s decade that the 14th Colombo produced her last batch of Queen's Scouts that included Shanti Mclelland(Former Principal at Wesley), A. K. Nazimudeen and Rohana de Silva. After a brief lull in scouting activity, in October 1972 we saw a revival of the 14th Colombo Troop with A. H. G. Ameen, a past Scout from 28th Colombo -Don Bosco Scout troop taking over the reins as Group Scout Master. Ameen infused a spirit of activity. Investitures, Camps and Parents Day were a regular feature in the 14th Colombo calendar.
With Ameen moving out in 1974 Brig. Sarath Fernando, an old boy of Wesley who was an Instructor under the tutelage of Ameen became the Scout Master.
By 1976, once again the 14th Colombo was left without a Scout Master and it was during this period of time that the14th Colombo began building a very strong, independent and capable group of scouts. The troops Court of Honour at that time had the past District Commissioner, Riza Azoor as the Troop Leader together with Sharir Azoor and Elmo Jones as the senior patrol members whilst, Riya Azoor together with Shankar Ratnadurai, Ben Manickam, Nadarajah Logeswaran -the first President Scout produced by Wesley.
In 1978, having completed the initial Scout Leaders training course, the responsibility of guiding the troop fell on the hands of Riza Azoor. After a few years - 1982 to be precise, he was fortunate to obtain the services of his brother Riya Azoor who by then had completed his school career and had undergone initial training in scout leadership to help run the 14th Colombo. From the mid 1980s, there have been many past 14th Colombo scouts lending their hand to support the Azoor brothers as Assistant Scout Masters and Instructors of the troop.
Wesley scouts have participated in international scout events and some of the many scouts who have attended international jamborees representing Sri Lanka from the 14th Colombo.
Traditions have been strongly observed and maintained over the years at the 14th Colombo, and without fail the scouts have provided their services year in, year out at the College Prize Day by according a Guard of Honour to the Chief Guest, and by providing first aid services during the college sports meet and by providing assistance in organizing and conducting the schools Founder Day program. The troop also carries out a service project at school to mark their Troop Founders Day.
Traditionally, the 14th Colombo undertakes 3 scout camps annually. A Group camp held over 3-4 nights, the senior troop Adventure camp and the junior troop camp over a weekend usually undertaken towards the latter part of the year. Since the early 1980s, the 14th Colombo troop has produced 35 President Scouts.
In conclusion it must be placed on record the encouragement, support and confidence provided by all the Principals who steered Wesley College from the 1917s, particularly her current principal, Avanka Fernando and specially the Teacher in charge Shamalee Perera and the Scout leaders Deshaka Perera and Riza Azoor. At present there are 60 scouts with the six patrols named as King Fishers, Eagles, Leopards, Peacocks, Cheetahs and Wood peckers.

Shepherdians hone dramatic skills
Blessed with talent and nurtured in a way that brings the very best out of them, the Dramatists of Good Shepherd Convent Kotahenaexcel in drama. Dramatic Moves features these gifted Thespians.
Teacher in Charge, B. Sriyani pointed out that a students character at a young age can really benefit from the environment drama places them in.
The life of a student involves constant change. It is a transition period. Through drama they get to know a different perspective of life. You get to know different personalities. They learn to understand another person. Doing drama opens up your horizons. They learn so many things from Shakespeare. They learn how to interact. They look at life in a different way. Their minds open up. You get to know a lot about English Literature through drama, said Sriyani.
Trainer Harshana Rathnayake, felt that what these students gain from drama is a very holistic training in life beyond student life.
If you take Julius Caesar, I think Shakespeare used Julius Caesar, as a triggering incident, to highlight what impacts can happen to the Geo- political system, in a situation where good ambition clashes with patriotism. And I feel that he did not intend to emphasize on the Heroic fact of Caesar. Similarly in Macbeth which was written subsequent or in the same era of the Gun powder plot which happened in England. He wanted to communicate a message to society, through his plays on how the Geo Political systems will crash if a good administrative system is overthrown due to wrong reasons, just like Duncans and Caesars murders lead Scotland and Rome in to destruction for some time, said Rathnayake.
President Annette Candappa said that engaging with diverse personalities really discovers your talent.
I like the character of Guildernstern in Hamlet. From the plays I have done I like Hamlet the most. I have learnt things about my own life from the experiences we have gone through. I learnt with cast and team work. Merry Wives of Windsor was one memorable performance. That is how I really discovered my talent even though I like doing tragedies the best. You meet totally different kind of people through drama and that in itself helps you discover the world around you. It is all how you interact with people with diverse personalities, said Candappa
Vishvani Senevirathne played the role in Hamlet, Shakespeares supernatural masterpiece.
Set in Denmark, the young prince Prince Hamlet is called to avenge his fathers death and take revenge on his uncle Claudius the slayer of his father. The ghost of Hamlets father appears to him and places this great burden upon Hamlet. Claudius having killed Hamlets father marries Hamlets, mother and the events that transpire are after the evil deed of regicide, changes Hamlets life forever.
I have up to now done two Shakespeare dramas. I like Hamlet because it is a very complicated drama. There are so many characters in Hamlet with very different personalities. I like just how complicated the drama is. I played the role of Hamlet. I really worked hard to get into the character of Hamlet. Hamlet involves various emotions, said Senevirathne.
Othello is another masterpiece by Shakespeare that involves villainy murder, grief, suicide, lies, deception and malice. Othello falls victim to irrationality and madness, and takes his own life.
In Othello I played the part of Iago. I got to know a lot about jealousy. Team work and unity is what I have really taken out of the whole drama experience, said Senevirathne
Vice President Yeshani Fernando pointed out how our lives change by the way we look at a situation.
I loved Midsummer Nights Dream and Hamlet both. Hamlet is kind of a very complicated drama, and it is something you do not see every day. Considering the fact that Shakespeare lived in the 16th Century, it is amazing how it is relatable even now. I played the role of Claudius in Hamlet. We see greed and ambition in society and family turning against family, so in that way, yes we do see a lot of people like Claudius in Society. Whether Claudius is a bad person depends on how you view him, said Fernando.
Through timeless plays like Hamlet and Othello we learn to understand life in general, because in life we see so much that these themes touch upon. We see murder in society, we see backstabbing and lying. We see manipulation. In society we get people trying to turn other people against each other.
When you are doing a play, you try and understand why each character is the way they are. Hamlet is not a perfectly pure character. We learn that no one is born bad but it is how you look at things. It is all a matter of perception how you see something. Some people see it as black and some see it as white, said Fernando.
She is doing Othello for her A/Ls and says it is about how we mostly perceive things. And it is about judgment and how much a calm demeanor you should have when making judgments and choices.
Both Othello and Hamlet cannot be taken as perfect leaders. Shakespeare tries to define them by their mistakes. He shows how mistakes can bring a leader down because both of them have amazing personalities. In the end it becomes a tragedy. In drama you learn about passion. Hamlet is our favorite drama because we have all been in it. It is how we connected with each other. It is a life changing experience. Because even after the drama was over, that effect was there, explains Fernando.
Ashvini Jayamanne, pointed out that one must not to be too hasty to come to decisions.
I have done both Othello and Hamlet. If you take Othello, society sees him as a bad person. He takes decisions according to what his friend says. Othello was not a bad person but he was too hasty when taking a decision. That is something that happens in real life also. We see a lot of leaders like Othellos in real life. It was my first Shakespeare drama. The most favorite character I did was Rosencrantz in Hamlet. He is a kind of a fun person. He is kind of personality that I like. Both plots of Othello and Hamlet involved a lot of planning and scheming. They are kind of the same, but still there are different characters with different personalities. Hamlet is not Othello and Claudius is not Iago. From Othello we learn not to be hasty, said Jayamanne.

SL could gain more with digital payments
An independent study examining the economic impact of increasing the use of digital payments in major cities around the world, including Colombo, it was found that Colombo could achieve, US$ 200 million annual net benefits. This survey conducted by Roubini Thought Lab and commissioned by Visa.
Colombo, with a population of 694,000 and GDP of US$ 6.5 bn, could gain US$ 200 million annual net benefits by moving in to digital payments, said Joe Cunningham, Chief Risk Officer, Asia Pacific, Visa in Colombo yesterday.
Estimated catalytic impacts for the city over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increases in GDP growth rate and 2.1% increase in employment.
Joe urged that there were significant benefits of going less cash and said that Sri Lankan stakeholders should move towards a less cash economy. On e-commerce, Joe opined that creating a secure payment ecosystem was critical to the success of the nascent eCommerce market in Sri Lanka.
Worldwide, E-commerce activity has been growing at over 5% YoY over the past five years, and is estimated to top USD 27 trillion by 2020. Emerging economies in Asia Pacific expected to drive a bulk of these sales, where consumers are increasingly shifting to digital experiences. Digital commerce is also being transformed by the advent of connected devices.
He also disclosed that eCommerce frauds now total US$ 57.8 billion across eight major industries across the world. Consequently, there is a strong need to ensure security mechanism both at a policy front (reliance on global standards) and technical front (Chip and pin, tokenization etc), said Joe.
Even in countries where con-tactless payments are used widely, fraud at the point of sale has remained at historic lows. In the UK, fraud losses on cards from January to June 2017 decreased 11% from the same period in 2016. (SS)

Sri Lanka must recalculate its foreign policies - PM






Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said there is a global shift of power to Asia and Sri Lanka has to recalculate its foreign policies to become a meaningful player in the region.
Addressing the annual convocation of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) yesterday at the BMICH, Prime Minister said that unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been focusing on Development than International Relations.
Our attention was fully occupied to end the war and thereafter human rights issues and international relations was connected to it. That became the political language while rest of the world was changing in different directions, he said.
He noted that 2015, was very important for the foreign policy of Sri Lanka and measures were taken to sort out many issues. We have come to agreements concerning human rights and there is only a question of implementation, which will be done gradually, he added.
He said that now the world focus is on Asia and they are very keen to know what is happening in China, India and Japan.
Prime Minister emphasised that in a such background, Sri Lanka needs to re-position itself.
We have good relations with India, Japan and China. I have not come across any other country in the region that has the same level of relations with India, China and Japan as Sri Lanka. We have to safeguard the independent relations and never try to play one against the other. And take initiatives to strengthen the relations, he explained.
He further said that two important factors that shape the foreign policy of Sri Lanka and the role it can play in the region are the strategic location and the political relations the country has with the key players in the region - India, China and Japan.
The Prime Minister noted that the key players are competing for economic power and it has now moved to the Indian Ocean.
While we keep good relations with these countries, we also have to understand the nature of rivalry and we should never get caught into that rivalry, he said.
He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to join the One Belt and One Road Initiative, (OBOR) in 2013 and subsequently President Maithripala Sirisena also reaffirmed.
Prime Minister pointing out that many people question about it, said that it was an initiative related to Chinese development and it started by pumping money and aid and subsequently it turned more economic.
We will not be dominated by Chinese, I think countries in our region are very good at using these opportunities, he said.
The Prime Minister further noted that even though some say that the government has allowed Hambantota to become a Chinese naval base, the security of both harbour and the airport lies with Sri Lanka.
As far as we maintain the neutrality and maintain friendships, there is no problem, he said.
He also added hat Japan and India has shown interest in developing the ports in Sri Lanka and the strategic location matter to the other countries.
If we can build this to be a transhipment hub in a centre of connectivity in the Indian Ocean, it is much better for our country, he said.

Stern action against filling stations misusing kerosene subsidy
The government will cancel permits of filling stations which misuse the kerosene subsidy meant for the poor, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranathunga said yesterday.
He said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) had revealed that the some of the petrol filling stations mix kerosene with petrol or diesel and provide them to buses and lorries. He added that some buses and lorries run on kerosene all along. He said that the addition of kerosene is made outside filling stations in fuel bowsers.This is illegal and has caused an artificial increase in kerosene requirement.
"Due to the misuse, the loss caused to the government during the first two months of this year had increased to Rs 2.1 billion," Minister Ranathunga said. "So the government is taking measures to take stern action against these errant traders by cancelling the filling station permits.We are also seeking possibilities of taking over such petrol stations,"he said.
"Kerosene is mostly used by the poor and the government grants a subsidy of Rs 48 per litre. He added that kerosene consumption was 138,505 kilo litres in 2014 and it had increased to 198,090 kilo litres in 2017. He added that according to the developments taking place, the use of kerosene should be reduced and this increase was artificial. "The loss the CPC incurred in 2017 due to the increase in kerosene use was Rs 5.4 billion.
The Minister said the use of kerosene incurred a loss to the government, causes environment pollution and damages vehicles causing loss to the owner as well as to the country.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Tea Research Institute has invested over Rs 40 million to import machinery to test if sugar is being added during production of tea, said Minister of Plantation industries Navin Dissannayake.
Speaking at a press conference in Colombo he said that 56 factories from 700 had been found engaged in this . we have identified them and have warned them and would take necessary action after the festive season in April.
He said that if they immediately suspend these 56 factories, the livelihoods of people working there would be lost and it would be a major issue for the workers to celebrate the new year season. Hence we differed any action until end of April.
He said meanwhile they have imported equipment to trace sugar even when the tea leaves are fired.
The Minister said that tea added with sugar makes it more dark. This is not imported tea and there would not be another issue like the Russian Bug scenario again.

Tech giants express concern over Singapore plan to fight fake news
Global tech giants including Facebook and Twitter on Thursday expressed concern about a possible Singapore plan to bring in a new law to tackle the threat of fake news, saying sufficient rules are already in place.
Officials of Facebook, Twitter and Google attended a parliamentary hearing on how to counter the threat that Singapore said it was particularly vulnerable to due to its size, its role as a global financial hub and its ethnic and religious mix.
They were among 79 people asked to speak in parliament over the eight days set for the hearing. The wealthy city state is among the countries looking to introduce legislation, so far unspecified, to rein in fake news, a trend that has stirred concern that such laws could be used to exert government control over the media.
We do not believe that legislation is the best approach to addressing the issue, Alvin Tan, Facebooks head of public policy for Southeast Asia, said in a written submission.
Singapore already has a variety of existing laws and regulations which address hate speech, defamation and the spreading of false news.
Singapore ranks 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information.
Lawmakers in the United States and Europe have called for probes into how Facebook allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data on 50 million users and use it to help the election campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Microblogging site Twitter also shared concerns about Singapores plans.
No single company, governmental or non-governmental actor, should be the arbiter of truth, Kathleen Reen, Twitters director of Public Policy for Asia Pacific, said.
A parliamentary panel set up to consider possible measures, including legislation, drew 164 written responses from the public, a record for reactions to such a committee on any issue.
Many of the examples of fake news, cited in a Singapore government paper on deliberate online falsehoods published in January, came from abroad. (BBC)

TVS Motor enters million club with scooter sales zooming this fiscal year
Leading two-wheeler maker TVS Motor Company has achieved a significant milestone in scooters with its sales zooming past million units in this fiscal.
TVS has become the second two-wheeler company in India to achieve an annual scooter volume of more than a million units after Honda, which is now the leader in this segment.
With higher-than-the-industry growth, total scooter sales of TVS Motor stood at 1,000,801 units during April 2017-February 2018 period compared with 743,910 units in the same period of the previous year. It ended 2016-17 with total sales of 826,291 units.
During the 11-month period of this fiscal, the scooter industry grew by 21 per cent at 6.2 million units. But TVS Motors scooter sales grew by about 35 per cent.
This fiscal has been a strong year for the companys scooter growth. It clocked monthly sales of more than a lakh units for three months in a row  August, September and October, with its highest monthly scooter sales at 1.18 lakh units in September.
TVS continues to be the only player that has a presence in the 90-cc sub-segment of scooters. It had three offerings in this sub-segment. But Teenz and Streak models have been discontinued, and it sells only the Scooty Pep+, which clocked total sales of 1.29 lakh units during the 11-month period against 91,558 units a year ago.
In the 90-110cc sub-segment, TVS offers  Jupiter, Zest and Wego, of which Jupiter continues to be the second-largest selling scooter in the country. In this segment, the companys total sales stood at 871,497 units against 652,352 units. The company launched its new 125-cc scooter NTorq last month to further consolidate its position in the scooter market.
Scooterisation has brought in special customer advantages that include customer convenience, flexibility and multiple use benefits. Also, in terms of fuel efficiency, scooters are also getting better and better. The feedback from consumers on TVS Motors offerings has been very heartening, K N Radhakrishnan, President & CEO, TVS Motor, had told recently.
Scooterisation is catching up in rural areas too, as increasing number of people have started to prefer automatic scooters over motorcycles.
While bikes were traditionally favoured because of their high fuel efficiency, scooters have narrowed the gap in the last few years due to improvements in technology that bridged the fuel efficiency gap with motorcycles, besides other benefits, according to Subrata Ray, Group Vice President  Corporate Ratings, Icra.
With favourable growth indicators for the scooter market, TVS Motor is expected to maintain a strong momentum in its sales in the near future.

The Bank of England has held UK interest rates at 0.5% for the third meeting in a row.
The Banks Monetary Policy Committee voted by seven votes to two to keep rates unchanged, in a departure from the MPCs unanimous vote in February.
The last time rates moved was in November, when the Bank raised rates from 0.25% to 0.5% - the first increase since July 2007.
More rises are expected this year even though the pace of inflation has eased.
All nine members of the MPC, including governor Mark Carney, voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their meeting in February.
We expect the Bank of England (BoE) to remain on hold today, but we do expect an interest rate rise later this year - possibly around the autumn, Remi Olu-Pitan from the fund manager Schroders told the Today programme.
The BoE is very much focused on inflation. Inflation in the UK right now is around 2.7% - its the highest in the G7, she explained.
It is unusual [to raise interest rates] when growth is so weak in the UK, but I guess because global growth is so strong, somehow the UK should benefit from that.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has raised its UK growth forecast, but warns it will be among the worst performing G7 economies until 2020.
The BCC has raised its GDP forecast for 2018 from 1.1% to 1.4% and in 2019 from 1.3% to 1.5%. Its first forecast for 2020 is for 1.6% growth.
The hike is driven by slightly stronger than expected consumer spending.
And it says the UKs export performance is expected to remain robust on the back of strong global growth.
But it says with imports also likely to continue to grow, the contribution of net trade to the UKs GDP growth over the near term is to be limited, particularly with little evidence of a sterling boost to the UKs overall net trade position.
And despite the upgrades, UK GDP growth is set to remain well below the historical average throughout the forecast period.

U.N. member states welcome overall improvement in HR, democratic reforms
The main sponsors of the Human Rights Council (HRC) resolutions 30/1 and 34/1 on Sri Lanka; the United States, United Kingdom, Macedonia and Montenegro in a joint statement on Wednesday reiterated that Sri Lanka still had a historic opportunity to avoid returning to divisions of the past and that the implementation of the resolutions would help give all
Sri Lankans the assurance of the safe, peaceful and prosperous future they deserve.
We welcome the overall improvement in human rights and democratic reforms. Sri Lanka is safer and freer than it was in 2015. The Governments constructive engagement with the UN special procedures and support for the Peace building Priority Plan is welcome. The Consultation Task Force issues an important report to reflect the views of Sri Lankans and recent legislation on enforced disappearance is also positive, read the joint statement.
The four countries however observed that they were disappointed that the pace of progress of implementation has been slow.
Much still remains to be done to implement Sri Lankas commitments. We remain concerned about reports of abuse of authority by some officials. And multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks and hate speech against minorities are alarming and demonstrate the need for reconciliation efforts.
The statement also highlighted Sri Lankas acknowledgment when co-sponsoring resolution 30/1, that devolution of political authority through constitutional reform in integral to lasting reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations and abuses. The countries also continued to urge Sri Lanka to make the Office of Missing Persons fully operational, take meaningful steps to establish the other transitional justice mechanisms, bring about effective security sector reforms, repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and release more military occupied land to civilian ownership.
With determined leadership and a clean timeline for action, this Government can deliver the reform and justice agenda, encouraged the statement further.

Water Board to undergo reform
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem, marking the United Nations World Water Day, said the countrys Water Board was in need of serious reform.
He was speaking at the 26th World Water Day ceremony, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, yesterday.
Minister Hakeem said the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, as a monopoly, has a duty to look after its customers.
The Water Board is in charge of distributing purified drinking water to the whole island.
Our financial viability is something that we need to focus on, Minister Hakeem said. It would be a tragedy if the Water Supply and Drainage Boards financial viability is to be a perennial question.
He promised to announce serious reforms this year.
He also criticized some members of trade unions, saying that they should be more concerned with the quality of service than wage increases.
We need to do several reforms to make ourselves an institution which would be of great service to the nation, he said.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board Chairman K. A. Ansar said Sri Lanka was blessed to have many tanks, built by past kings.
It was the great King Parakramabahu who said: Let not one drop of water that falls on earth be allowed to reach the sea without being used by man, he said.
Ansar reiterated President Maithripala Sirisenas pledge to renovate 2,000 tanks this year.
He said clean, reliable water is an insurance during times of drought, a benefit to man and nature alike.

Important, yet challenging journey:
The legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy
The Statement made by Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana at the 37th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, Geneva on March 21, 2018.
It is an honour for me to be here today at the 37th Session of the UN Human Rights Council representing the Government of Sri Lanka.
I am joined today by my Cabinet colleagues, the Minister of Special Assignments, Dr. Sarath Amunugama, and the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faiszer Musthapha. My colleagues and I represent the two main political parties that form the coalition government. We are here before this Council together in unison, to speak with one voice, demonstrating the Governments firm commitment to the advancement of reconciliation, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, justice, equality, and dignity for all our citizens, based on the 100 Day Programme on which President Maithripala Sirisena was elected in January 2015.
We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the High Commissioner, the Deputy High Commissioner and the staff of the OHCHR for their consistent and constructive engagement with Sri Lanka, the invaluable technical support extended to us, and for their support and encouragement at all times.
We do not consider the reconciliation process in our country as a box-ticking exercise. We are deeply committed to uphold the rule of law and to ensure the equal protection of the law to all individuals without discrimination as guaranteed under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. We also recognize that we owe our citizens equitable socio-economic development, which can only become possible through the establishment of durable peace and reconciliation. We are making every effort, therefore, Mr. President, despite the socio-political and economic constraints and challenges that we face, to realize our vision of a reconciled, peaceful, stable and prosperous Sri Lanka for all our citizens.
In this context, and in response to the High Commissioners observations on progress made by Sri Lanka thus far, we wish to place on record our most important achievements since Sri Lanka last addressed this Council at the 34th Session on February 28, 2017. Much progress has been made throughout the course of last year as well as previously, demonstrating Sri Lankas firm commitment, willingness and ability to advancing truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence of conflict.
We are mindful, Mr. President, that the reconciliation, judicial and reparation processes are for all affected communities irrespective of race, religion, and gender, including the families of missing security forces personnel.
On Sri Lankas Independence Day in February 2015, just a few weeks after President Maithripala Sirisena was elected, the Government made a formal Declaration of Peace, which said Terrorism and violence have ended. The time and space required for healing and building sustainable peace and security for all is upon us. It is now for us to seize this opportunity to ensure that the fruits of democracy and citizenship can be equitably enjoyed by all. Mr. President, this continues to be our vision  of all our citizens united, irrespective of ethnicity and religion, working together, overcoming the legacy of tragic conflict and guiding our nation towards durable peace and prosperity.
As you are aware, the action by the Sri Lankan security forces during the conflict was against a group designated as a terrorist group by many countries, and not against any community in our country. The operations of the terrorist group, which for the first time in recent history have deliberately targeted innocent civilians have now been adopted by terrorist groups all over the world. All communities in Sri Lanka were united against terrorism in my country, and now that terrorism has been defeated, all communities today work in unison towards reconciliation and economic progress of the country.
A comprehensive list that demonstrates the progress Sri Lanka has made in the advancement and protection of human rights, reconciliation, and good governance since January 2015 to-date has been distributed to all members of the Council. I will therefore set out some of the most important steps we have taken.
In September 2017, the President formally operationalized the Permanent Office on Missing Persons, pursuant to the enactment of the Office on Missing Persons Act in August 2016, as amended in July 2017. On the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council, the President appointed the Chairperson and members of the Office on February 28, 2018. At a meeting with the Chairperson and members on February 28, the President assured them of the fullest support of the Government to ensure the effective functioning of the Office. Sri Lanka Rupees 1.4 billion (approximately 9 million USD) has been allocated in the National Budget for 2018, for this Office. The members selected, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, represent the pluralistic society of Sri Lanka. The appointed members are currently receiving training and studying practices of similar mechanisms elsewhere which will help them to discharge their mandate effectively.
Over 70% of private land which had been with the security forces during the conflict period has now been released to be given to their original and rightful owners. A Committee chaired by the Secretary to the President was set up in January 2018, which will continue to meet frequently with all relevant local stakeholders to oversee and monitor the process of land release, the payment of compensation, and address connected issues.
The public is already benefitting from the Right to Information Act which was operationalised in February 2017. The Right to Information Commission is currently functioning effectively, and has disposed of a large volume of appeals.
Demonstrating its firm commitment to a zero-tolerance policy on torture, Sri Lanka acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in December 2017, and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is designated as the National Preventive Mechanism.
The Cabinet of Ministers, on March 6, 2018, approved the formulation of legislation by the Legal Draftsman, for the establishment of an Office for Reparations. Once the draft legislation with translations into local languages is finalised, the draft Bill will be presented to parliament.
Legislation to give effect to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was passed by the Parliament on March 7.
Continuing its active engagement with the Special Procedures, in July 2017, Sri Lanka received the Special Rapporteur on Countering Terrorism while Promoting and Protecting Human Rights. In October 2017, the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Guarantees of Non-recurrence visited Sri Lanka, and in October 2017, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited the country.
Demonstrating our firm commitment to reconciliation and ensuring non-recurrence, Sri Lanka acceded to the Ottawa and Oslo Conventions (Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction and the Convention on Cluster Munitions) on December 13, 2017 and March 1, 2018 respectively, and also received the Special Envoy on the Ottawa Convention earlier this month.
Sri Lanka participated in reviews of its periodic reports by the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in February 2017, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in June 2017, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in January 2018.
The Prevention of Terrorism Act is proposed to be repealed and replaced with a counter-terrorism law that conforms to human rights safeguards and other international standards. In terms of our Constitution and legal processes, this legislation will be finalized after due parliamentary procedures are followed.
Amendments were brought to the Local Authorities Election Act and the Provincial Councils Election Act, ensuring a quota to elect female representatives to the Local Government and Provincial Councils, which are important grass-root-level decision-making bodies. At the recently concluded Local Government Elections held on February 10, 2018, the legislation ensuring 25% quota for women was implemented ensuring the election of a record number of women to local government bodies for the first time.
For the effective implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021, a three-tier mechanism was established in December 2017, to regularly monitor progress being made by all the relevant line ministries and agencies, and to give necessary guidance and direction.
Sri Lanka participated in the 3rd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review in November 2017, and its report was adopted on March 19.
The draft legislation on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, taking into account relevant recommendations made by the Consultation Task Force, is now in an advanced stage of consultations and will be submitted, at the earliest, for approval by the Cabinet of Ministers.
As we proceed on this important yet challenging journey, we are conscious of the need for the participation of all sections of our society to ensure that these important transformative steps through legislation and administrative means are well entrenched and duly institutionalised. Our firm commitment is reiterated to all stakeholders to reach consensus on a sustainable basis.
Through our firm resolve to ensure non-recurrence of conflict, we are committed to fulfilling the agenda on reconciliation. This agenda is unprecedented. We have undertaken to implement a vast agenda in a very short time. Such measures have taken most other countries, several decades to implement. Despite challenges, our commitment remains firm because we fully recognize that it is the duty of the State to all victims on all sides, to all communities and most of all to future generations to ensure that we lay the foundation for a stable, peaceful, reconciled and prosperous society. We recognise that we must not leave the burden of having to deal with the difficult legacy of our past, to our future generations.
As a nation we are pained by the recent incidents in a few areas of Sri Lanka targeting members of the Muslim community who represent an integral part of the pluralistic society of Sri Lanka. Such acts which go against our shared vision of a Sri Lanka where equal rights and rule of law are guaranteed for all, have no place in a democratic, pluralistic society. The Government has taken swift action against perpetrators of these incidents and is investigating any lapses that may have taken place. Stringent measures will be initiated to ensure non-recurrence. A victim compensation programme has already commenced. We have reason to believe that certain interested parties were behind this, to tarnish our image at a time when this Council is in session.
Following investigations, as it was discovered that social media and messaging platforms were being used not only to incite and spread hate and false messages but also to organise attacks, the Government was compelled to impose temporary restrictions on the use of social media. All these restrictions have now been lifted. The Government as a result of this experience has entered into active engagement with social media operators, to work with them on the prevention of hate speech. The emergency regulations which the Government was compelled to impose on March 6, 2018 as a measure to protect communities, were rescinded on March 17, 2018.
The reconciliation and development agenda cannot be successfully achieved by Government working alone. The participation of political parties, civil society, academia, the business community, the media as well as the international community are essential for this important national endeavour.
We would like to stress with sincerity and conviction that we will not be deterred by anyone in fulfilling the undertakings given by us to our people, which will lead to building a peaceful, stable, reconciled and prosperous Sri Lanka for all our citizens.
Sri Lankas judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms are fully capable and committed to the processes of advancing justice to all concerned. It has a long history of integrity and professionalism and since January 2015, steps have been taken to further strengthen its independence. And may I add, Mr. President, that all reconciliation mechanisms will be implemented in accordance with our Constitution.
The legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy, and it permeates our society to this day. Extremists constantly strive to take advantage of this situation to achieve political gain. This realization only makes us even more determined to ensure that we never return to the violent days of the past. It is our intention to ensure the fulfilment of our commitments to all our people and bring closure to a sad and disturbing period of our recent history.
SL Governments constructive engagement with the Office of the High Commissioner welcomed - Gilmore
Presentation of Reports under the Agenda Item on the Annual Report of the High Commissioner:
Kate Gilmore, United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, said there were seven briefings, updates and reports of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner, submitted under item 2 concerning Burundi, Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Cyprus and Iran. Concerning Burundi, in September 2017 the Council had adopted resolution 36/2 requesting the deployment of three experts to collect information concerning human rights violations in cooperation with the Burundian authorities and relevant stakeholders. The Office was finalizing the recruitment of the three experts and would update the Council on progress in the June session. Nonetheless, the situation in Burundi was of grave concern. Security forces had been employed in comprehensive human rights violations. The Governments plan to revise the Constitution had generated a host of human rights concerns. Since December 2017 and the start of the campaign for a referendum to amend the Constitution, a crackdown had been seen on civil society and political opposition in 15 out of 18 provinces. Government officials had issued statements warning citizens not to oppose the referendum. A climate of fear and violence had been exacerbated and during the voter registration period, reports of intimidation had been reported. The Government of Burundi had suspended its cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner since October 2016.
Presenting the report on Guatemala, Ms. Gilmore said that the efforts of the Office of the Attorney-General, which had been working with the support of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, were commended, as well as the efforts of the Human Rights Ombudsman. A selection process for a new Attorney-General was ongoing. Human rights defenders, journalists and members of the judiciary were performing their duties admirably but they had also been targeted by smear campaigns. Guatemala was at a crossroads and the Government was encouraged to keep pursuing the quest for equality, truth and justice.
Ms. Gilmore thanked the Government of Honduras for their cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner. Following last years disputed outcome of presidential elections and peaceful protests, the security forces had used excessive force, resulting in people being killed and injured. Continued attacks had been registered against journalists and human rights defenders. Steps that had been taken to strengthen the investigative capacity of the office of the Special Prosecutor on femicide were welcomed. With more than half of the people living in poverty, non-discrimination needed to be at the core of envisaged reforms in Honduras.
Introducing the report on Colombia, Ms. Gilmore said that the Peace Agreement between the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of ColombiaPeople's Army had entrusted the Office of the High Commissioner in Colombia to monitor and assist in the implementation of several aspects of the Agreement and to report to the Council. In January, there had been a return of hostilities between the Government and the National Liberation Army. Armed groups and criminal organisations had entered areas formerly under the influence of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of ColombiaPeople's Army, seeking to control illicit economies. A major concern was the increase in killings of human rights defenders, as 84 human rights defenders had been killed in 2017. Accelerating the reintegration of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of ColombiaPeople's Army was essential, as 36 former members had been killed in 2017. Presidential elections would take place in May so the Council was encouraged to follow closely the situation.
Ms. Gilmore said the report on Cyprus provided an overview for the period between December 1, 2016 and November 30, 2017. The persistent division of the island continued to hinder the full enjoyment of human rights. Positive developments were acknowledged related to bi-communal initiatives and confidence-building measures, and the search for missing persons continued to progress, albeit slowly. The inter-religious dialogue was sustained.
Concerning Iran, the Secretary-General had expressed alarm at the continuing high number of executions. The December 2017 protests had led to at least 22 deaths and thousands had been arrested. The persistent pattern of intimidation, arrest and prosecution of human rights defenders was of deep concern. There had been encouraging developments relating to the employment of women and girls but the prevalence of child marriage had remained. The Secretary-General welcomed the improved cooperation between the Government and the treaty bodies.
Moving to the written update on progress in promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka between March 2017 and January 2018, Ms. Gilmore said the Governments constructive engagement with the Office of the High Commissioner and the human rights mechanisms was welcomed. Accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was noted. However, slow progress was noted in establishing transitional justice mechanisms and it was doubtful that the transitional justice agenda would be implemented before the Councils next report in March 2019. The commissioners of the Office of Missing Persons were appointed 20 months after the adoption of the legislation and there was insufficient progress in returning land occupied by the military and no demonstrated willingness to address impunity. Multiple incidents of inter-communal violence and attacks against minorities had been observed last year.
Ms. Gilomore concluded by noting that over several years now, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, had engaged closely with Sri Lanka. As he would soon conclude his mandate, the Council would now benefit from his insights.
Statement by the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence:
Pablo De Greiff, Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, said that since early 2015 he had had a continuous and thorough engagement with Sri Lanka in the form of four advisory visits, which had culminated at the end of 2017 with a fifth and fully-fledged country visit. He stressed the urgency of the matter in light of the most recent attacks against members of the Muslim community. In 2015, he had highlighted the following issues as needing immediate attention: clarifying the fate of the disappeared and missing persons; addressing land issues; refraining from arbitrary detentions, particularly on the basis of outdated anti-terrorist legislation followed by protracted trials lasting years; and putting an end to continuing forms of harassment, violence and unjustified surveillance of civil society and victims. In 2015, Mr. de Grieff said he had also argued and advocated for the planning and adoption of a comprehensive transitional justice policy, including its four main pillars, namely truth, criminal justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence. The appointment of the Commissioners for the Office of Missing Persons was a sign of hope. Mr. de Grieff called on all actors to invest in the Office of Missing Persons, and allow it to work in an effective and independent manner, with sufficient financial and human resources, the participation of victims and civil society, and with effective protection systems and support services for victims and witnesses.
However, the Office of Missing Persons was only the beginning. Sri Lanka was a country in which all communities had victims, generated by cycles of violence that recurred approximately every 10 years, confirming that violations that had not been redressed significantly increased the likelihood of repeated violence. In a country in which transitional justice had become politicized, it was important to recall that there were many examples of intra-communal violence, such as the insurrection of 1971, the 1987-89 violence, and LTTE violence against members of the Tamil community. All those victims had a right to truth, justice and reparations, and the whole society had a right to non-recurrence, for which an effective end to impunity was necessary. Sri Lanka needed decisive and courageous action. It needed a constitution which made everyone feel that their equal rights were acknowledged, and that found a way to express their fundamental values and interests. History did not need to be fate; the cycles of violence could indeed be broken.

Politicians involved in NWP coconut land fragmentation
Some top-level politicians are involved in the fragmentation of coconut lands in the North Western Province (NWP). The blocking out and sale of such lands is currently making rapid progress and they have directly influenced the existing shortage of coconuts in the country, All Island Farmers' Federation Chairman and Provincial Councillor Namal Karunarathna said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the Dambulla Yapagama Siyapatha Hotel complex on Wednesday (21).
The country's coconut cultivation is currently declining due to the said issue, which has become a lucrative business at present. However, President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to ban the blocking out and sale of coconut lands.
Karunaratna added that the extent of the country's coconut lands has reduced by 5.4 percent from 1982 to 2002. Hence, if it were to continue further, Sri Lanka's entire coconut cultivation would be lost within the next decade.
"Previously, coconuts were one of our major exporting crops. But at present, we are the ones importing coconuts. We have named coconut trees kapruka, yet we eagerly fell them," he stated.

SAHAYAM SPECIALS were a brand name in rugby
Trinity College, Kandy has not only a rich history in producing academics who have reached the top echelons, but also sportsmen who glittered like gems, especially in rugby and cricket and hit the top. They brought great honour to the school and country.
It is said that many are called, but few are chosen be it in sport or any other field or endeavor. Two of the most outstanding sportsmen who stood like beacons in the light were MOHAN SAHAYAM in rugby and KUMAR SANGAKKARA in cricket.
This week SPORTS LEGENDS shines its spotlight on a ruggerite who made from a special mold the likes of which are rarely seen---not at least in the half century this writer has been penning. He had natural skills to take the schools, club and countrys scene not like a storm but like a tsunami and that tsunami was MOHAN SAHAYAM.
Rise to fame
During his rise to fame there were many other ruggerites in the school who were good and threatening, but SAHAYAM kicked them all to touch and sliced through the defence of schools and clubs and even international opponents like a lion in attack during his career.
In school he was a natural when playing in his pet position as fly half and then his natural ability turned majestic as his career unwound and there was no rugby player or fan who did not savor his fantastic and amazing play when the oval ball was in his possession. Even today rugby fans who watched SAHAYAM work magic with the ball still talk in awe of his play.
SAHAYAM was not only a amazing ruggerite having won the coveted Lion at Trinity , but also showcased his prowess in cricket and athletics. And there was also the special charm he brought to the clubhouses with his effervescent sense of humor. But it was the rugby Gods who had a special place for him.
He was a legend
As a try scorer he was a legend. Try scoring which helped his sides to victory came like a river in spate with his clever body swerve that sent his opponents on the wrong lane as he sliced through to plant the ball under the posts or within the scoring area while the opponents watched in amazement.
Spectators would be drawn to the venues like moths to a flame. Such was the drawing power he commanded. And those who came to watch seldom left disappointed, but speaking in glowing terms on their way to their vehicles or buses to get home.
At the time I oversaw the Sports Desk of the Times of Ceylon, when it was known that SAHAYAM would be in action we would send the best of reporters to write back in time for the Sunday edition. In the era that SAHAYAM excelled every newspaper would flag headlines about his clever play and strategy he employed to fool the defence and plant the try ball by that signaled victory. Effusive copy written by rugby experts such as Eustace Rulach a former Trinity cricket captain, Percy Beling, M.B.Marjan, M.V. Muhsin, Austin Daniel, T.M.K. Samat, N.Thangaraja and free lance writer Sham de Alwis decorated the pages.
Widely read Sunday column
Also Subbiah Muttiah, Editor of the Sunday Times a knowledgeable and keen sport fan -- what he didnt known of sports was not worth knowing ---would take special delight in describing SAHAYAMS magic play in his widely read column CORNER FLAG.
After his school career SAHAYAM took wing to CR and FC and many were the matches and trophies he won for the club assisting his team mates and showing and inspiring them to victory. SAHAYAN had been in losing teams but that was few and far between.
True victory was not the thing, but everything. But to SAHAYAM the game was the thing. He would play the game, yet hard, take career threatening tackles and give back and after the grueling game, camaraderie and bonhomie was what he also excelled in over a mug that cheers with his opponents. He was also a fine raconteur to boot.
Aladdins lamp is rubbed
Here a gem from M.V. Muhsin, a school mate of SAHAYAM, from the popular column PAVILION PARADE he wrote for the SUNDAY OBSERVER.  Zaruk slings out a long pass to SAHAYAM. Aladdins lamp is rubbed and then the magic unfolds: SAHAYAM collects the ball, pretends to toss it in the air, then fakes a pass, and appears to recapture it. Times winged chariot seems to be at his back as he changes direction and in a compelling move makes the lightening field look so plodgy. It is so fast and flash as he darts his way through 35 yards.
The players seem frozen. It is so fast and slick that the crowds cheers suddenly choke off. It is so fast and elegant that the sound of marvel, for a moment, dies in their throats. And then the reality dawns: that the instantly classic signature of the SAHAYAM SPECIAL has been delivered. The crowd bursts into a deafening roar.
They were great buddies
Heres more. SAHAYAM and Keith Paul were great buddies although SAHAYAM came from Trinity and Paul from Royal. Muhsin writes  SAHAYAM had dash and dazzle and Paul had art and craft.
They would at times borrow these attribute from each other. Yet SAHAYAM was flashy and outgoing while Paul was reserved and introspective. Their divine call and gift was common: rugby. Their goal was to win. But their credo was to do so with an absolute gentlemanly flavor and fervor.
Their friendship continued and when they met when SAHAYAM visited Toronto at a felicitation at the residence of Trinity Lion Sam Canagasabey and wife Ranjini in the company of over 50 guests. It was Keith Paul who sprang the special this time. He gifted the rugger ball used in the 1964 Bradby with the name of the players inscribed on it to his buddy SAHAYAM who was emotionally overwhelmed by the gesture of goodwill and graciousness
Like selling wadays
Heres what Sharm de Alwis who can be described as the walking, talking Trinity WISDEN wrote about SAHAYAM. Mohan sold dummies like he was selling waday. He would smile whilst drawing a sale and on a few occasions he sold dummies even to spectators which were bought by the dumbfounded aggressor, as Mohan planted the try and held the upright as he laughed into the wind. He was the smiling assassin who was also known as the Golden Boy of the countrys rugby.
Mohans portrait is in the HUNDED YEARS OF RUGBY FOOTBALL IN SRI LANKA. The book states, In 1964, there appeared in the club ranks, whom writers described as one of the most brilliant players for many years.
MOHAN SAHAYAM who captained Trinity that year, turned out for CR&FC in the Clifford Cup tournament received the highest praise for his brilliant play as a fly-half. The descriptions were superlatives, matching the praise given to A.Blair 40 years earlier.
In that era the Havelocks- CR&FC game was the derby of rugby. It attracted young beauties in their numbers and it was at one such socials that SAHAYAM planted the SAHAYAM EXTRA SPECIAL under the post and converted it himself in PENNY and they are still pairing off well.

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had not yet made a decision regarding the no-confidence motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; the central committee of the party would decide the suitable cause of action, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a tree-planting programme that was organised to coincide with International Day of Forests and held in Crow Island, Mattakkuliya, yesterday. The event was organised by the Mahaweli Development Authority, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
As Mahaweli Development Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena had been instrumental in initiating programmes to increase the country's forest coverage up to 39 percent, the minister said.
There have been significant weather pattern changes during the recent past. Two of the country's main harvest seasons, the Yala and Maha seasons, face difficulties due to these changes. We should investigate the reasons behind these changes and understand how they occur, he added.
Minister Amaraweera said the main reason behind this would most likely be deforestation.

87-year-old creates awe-inspiring MS paint art
Some grandmas spend their time in the garden, some knit, but 87-year-old Concha Garcia Zaera enjoys a hobby thats rather unusually among her friends. She draws using only MS Paint. She discovered the program after her children gave her a computer, and she hasnt looked back ever since.
My husband fell ill and I had to take care of him, so I couldnt go out very often, Zaera told El Mundo. I began painting little things: first, a house, the next day Id add a mountain Step by step, I was adding details, and in the end, the result was a very pretty thing.
I have no imagination at all, so I get inspiration from the postcards that my husband used to send me or drawings that I find and like.
According to Vanguardia, Zaera spends about two weeks on one piece and focuses intensely on the details.
Zaera used to post her masterpieces on Facebook, but one of her granddaughters suggested that she should use Instagram instead. On March 9, she had about 300 followers. As of this post, more than 108,000 people are following the humble artist. I do not understand very well why my drawings draw so much attention, I think they are very simple things, she said.

Army presence in Kandy scaled down
Army troops, on duty in the Kandy District, would continue to assist the Police, although they withdrew from emergency duties with the lifting of the Emergency Regulations. They will conduct joint guard points patrols and roadblocks while providing all assistance to the people, said Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
Lieutenant General Senanayake was one of the few firsts to visit Kandy after violence broke out. After increasing the presence of Army personnel at the request of civil leaders, the Commander liaised with civil administrators for the implementation of several relief programmes.
As of Tuesday evening, Army troops continued combined mobile and foot patrols at the request of the Police and monitored surveillance and vigilance round the clock. At Muslim community leaders' behest, Army troops continue to man several guard points jointly with Police personnel in the Poojapitiya, Akurana and Digana areas. On the directions of the Army Commander, Army authorities in the past 72 hours held several meetings in affected areas for them to learn more about the needs of affected civilians and the status-quo as regards security and peace in their areas.
Major General Rukmal Dias, Commander, Security Forces - Central (SF-Cen) and Major General Nissanka Ranawana, General Officer Commanding, 11 Division pay special attention to the renovation of the damaged property and the restoration of peace. "He [Army Commander] wanted us to personally be in touch with the affected communities and be a part of the problem, attending to their urgent and necessary requirements," Major General Rukmal Dias said.
Army troops collected debris and paraphernalia in worst-affected areas. Representatives of the District Secretariat, meanwhile, began dishing out the first installment of compensation to the victims a few days ago after the Treasury released Rs. 100,000 per family as the first installment of compensation. So far, over 150 households were provided compensation while officials conducted parallel damage assessment surveys for more allocations.
Troops who were summoned from Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and elsewhere have now been resent to their original places after retaining a few battalions with the 11 Division Headquarters. As confidence-building measures and credibility are progressing, the remaining battalions are also due to return to their camps on the directions of the Commander soon after normalcy is fully restored.
Over 250 troops of the Army, Navy and Air Force, currently engage in clean-up work. They use Army machinery. Out of the earmarked prioritized area along the Digana - Kengalla road patch, troops, by Tuesday (20) evening, cleaned up a distance of about 2 km patch out of 5 km.
The Commander assured that rebuilding of damaged properties will be completed before Vesak Poya Day with the assistance of other authorities.

Bates Strategic Alliance celebrates 25 years
Bates Strategic Alliance celebrates 25 years as the pioneering Integrated Marketing Communications Agency. In IMC, PR, campaigns of national importance, and industry leadership.
It was the first broad-based PR and IMC Agency to come into play in 1993 when PR was hardly a known practice. The PR practice was pioneered by Founder Nimal Gunewardena and PR Head Ann Tradigo and by 1996 the agency brought the first multinational PR tie-up to Sri Lanka with its affiliation with Rowland Communications Worldwide, then a part of the Saatchi & Saatchi Group.
Having worked on a wide range of PR disciplines such as issues, crisis and change management, advocacy, internal communications, launches and events and specializing in marketing and tech practices and doing many a public awareness campaign of national importance, the agency had established a strong industry leadership profile when, in 2008, it aligned itself with one of the biggest global PR networks, Burson-Marsteller founded by the PR legend Harold Burson.
The Agency developed the PR module for one of the first industry courses, the SLFIs Diploma in Journalism and Communications and taught for several years, graduating many students who have gone on to do great deeds in the field of journalism and communications. Even in recent years, Gunewardena has continued to teach the PR subject for the SLPI course in Public Relations and Communications.
While establishing a strong creative reputation over the years, it prided itself in another area that was complementary to creativity and its capability in integration. That was a vital strategic focus in everything the agency did, which rang true to the name Strategic Alliance the founder had chosen.
Strategy-orientation meant not only sound strategic counsel to PR clients in dealing with contentious issues or crises, but also a focused route that preceded any creative work that the agency did. The agencys strategic approach was highlighted in the very last Chillies Awards that was held, when the Agency won Campaign of the Year and several other awards for its campaign for Hutch.
It has established a reputation as a Learning Organization where its staff are constantly exposed not only to internal training but also to external participation in relevant local courses and creative festivals overseas, where many of their creative and client liaison people have been to festivals such as Ad Fest, Ad Asia, Spikes and Cannes Lions and attended network training and conferences.
The Agency proudly records that several of its alumni have eventually proceeded to head other PR, media and creative agencies in the field.
Not least, the agency proudly boasts about its standing as a gender-balanced and female powered agency. Female inclusion, leadership, and recognition and female strengths of listening, team-building and getting a job done come together strongly to form an integral part of the Strategic Alliance family fabric, and this has been so since the Agencys room-above-the-garage inception 25 years ago.
Todays Strategic Alliance family is, in many ways, the proud evolution of that early one. This includes its present 50% composition of female professionals. It is also worth noting that the company has had women playing lead roles over the years and even now its Chief Operating Officer (Sheron Jayasundara) and Heads of HR (Nishi de Alwis), Finance (Chamika Colonne), Digital (Ravini Jinadasa) and Research & Strategy (Dhishna Bastiansz) are women. In the office, women are beyond present  they are at the helm.
They know the vision and values of the founder and the company, with which they find their individual alignment. From there, they forge ahead in an empowered and independent manner taking initiative, ownership for decisions and responsibility for results.
In terms of industry leadership, Nimal Gunewardena painstakingly re-drafted the Four As constitution in 1999 and was persuaded to lead become the Founder President and lead the industry body for its two initial years. Following in his example, his Deputy at Bates Sheron Jayasundara has earned the confidence of her peers in the industry and has steered the Four As over the last 3 years.

The government has spent nearly Rs. 1,400 million for the renovation of the airport after its operations and maintenance were vested with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) from May 31, 2016. The airport was used for military operations for the past 25 years, during the war.
The airport has been renovated with an extended 1,066-metre re-built runway and passenger terminal.
Several private airlines have already expressed their willingness to operate domestic flights between Ratmalana and Batticaloa.

Blessings For A New Car..!
We were standing next to the sea, an old priest and I, when his cell rang. I watched curiously as he listened intently and then replied he would be with the caller within an hour.
Emergency I asked curiously.
Yes, he replied a little hesitantly.
Somebody dying
Somebody buying a new car! he said.
So wheres the emergency I asked.
He wants me to bless it before he drives, said the priest.
May I come along I asked the priest.
Sure, he said and then as an afterthought asked, why
So I can hear what kind of blessing you give a car. I said.
I pray, said the priest, that the car will take him safely everywhere. That he and his family never meet with an accident in it.
That it wont ever break down or have punctures on highways, I added.
Yes, yes, I must include that in my blessing, said the priest happily.
And till he gets you to give all these blessings, he wont drive I asked.
I guess it makes sense, said the priest. He wants the car to be safe before getting behind the wheel.
What about him I asked.
What about whom asked the priest.
The man whos buying the car, isnt he the fellow who should be prayed for I asked. That he may drive this new car of his without being under the influence of liquor..
I dont know said the priest uncomfortably.
That he obeys all traffic rules; doesnt try to bribe policeman when he gets caught I continued. that those on the road outside will know from his driving that a good man is sitting at the wheel.
This is a blessing for the car not the driver, said the priest sharply, looking at his watch.
Sure, I said, would you bless my shoes
Your shoes asked the priest surprised.
That these shoes will not lead me to wrong places, that they will always take me down the paths of right living and not into the broadways of wickedness
It all depends where you go, said the priest simply. I could pray that God leads you into the right ways of life!
Maybe the new owner of the car you are going to bless needs the same prayer, I said
That he will drive along the path of goodness and wont be found with an arm around his secretary or girl friend. That he will be able to fill the car with the laughter and happy voices of his family, including the barking of his pet dog in the rear seat..
Youve got a point, said the priest looking down at my shoes, but
But what I asked.
I wouldnt want you to come along!
Why not I asked pained. I just want to see you bless a car.
Your kind of blessing Bob, said the priest as he hurried away, would run me out of business..!

Capital punishment should be a must for child rape
Another brutal case of rape and murder of a little boy named Sujith Nirmal was reported from the Chilaw district recently. In the post-mortem it was revealed that he was strangled to death after being sexually molested. Oh! what a cruel death it was! What pain would have he undergone during strangulation!
So would have been for the so many other raped and brutally murdered victims, specially of small children. In the recent past, after protests, criticism and condemnation by the civil society, the wheels of the law were moving fast for such cases and damnation given for a few convicts. But sadly not the capital punishment.
But capital punishment should be given at least for those who rape and kill, specially the children.
I think somebody of those who oppose capital punishment should become a victim of rape and get killed and only then they will realize the painful truth. Though I do not wish at all for such a thing to happen to anybody, my intense feelings towards such cases compel me to write it. The tears of the parents, brothers and sisters of the victim and the sadness of the people too is a contribution to it. All victims are from village areas and as such they easily fall prey to such killings. But as the children of those who oppose capital punishment are in Colombo they do not feel it. How can one be punished without sending him or her to the gallows for depriving the rights of living of another person
We still remember Seya who was raped and brutally murdered. Her killer is in jail now until his death with no harm being done. By this letter I stress the President to implement capital punishment at least to the molester who murders his victim.
True, every living being has the right of living, yet for human consumption hundreds of cattle and lakhs of fowl are being killed daily. So should not a rapist who kills his victim, specially a child, be killed

The magisterial inquiry into former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 12 million of public funds allocated to the Negombo Lagoon Development Project, was yesterday terminated by the Colombo Chief Magistrate since the Attorney General has already filed indictments against them in the High Court.

In this case, the CID had named six individuals, including Gunaratne, as suspects following the instructions of the Attorney General. The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney Generals advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial fraud.
Senior Counsel Lal Kularatne with Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the accused.

The arrest was made after a complaint had been lodged by the owner of the cow to the Giribawa Police.While investigations were being carried out, the Police were able to trace the cow to the backyard of a house, completely covered by black paint allegedly sprayed by the suspect, so that the cow could not be identified.

Cummins blitz transforms third Test despite Elgar heroics
CAPE TOWN, Thursday - Australian fast bowler Pat Cummins transformed the first day of the third Test against South Africa with a devastating four-wicket spell at Newlands on Thursday.
Despite an unbeaten 121 from Dean Elgar, South Africa were on a shaky 266 for eight at the close in a pivotal match in the bad-tempered four-Test series. The teams are locked at 1-1.
The hosts looked in command when they reached 220 for two, with Elgar and AB de Villiers scoring at better than four runs an over in a third wicket stand of 128.
It all changed when Cummins came back into the attack in the 63rd over and with his fifth delivery induced a false shot from De Villiers, who drove him to mid-off after scoring 64.
It was the start of a superb spell in which Cummins took four wickets for 12 runs in eight overs to finish the day with four for 64.
Mitchell Marsh and Mitchell Starc followed up with two late wickets. When Keshav Maharaj drove Starc to cover, South Africa had lost six wickets for 37 runs - and lost control of the match on the best batting pitch of any of the Tests South Africa have hosted against India and Australia this season. Opening batsman Elgar had scored 106 when De Villiers was dismissed and batted with more fluency than usual.
He reached his century off 178 balls with 16 fours and a six but opted to go back on the defensive as wickets fell around him. By the close he had faced another 75 balls after reaching his hundred and only added one more boundary.
It was Elgars 11th Test century and his second against Australia. On 61 he reached 3,000 runs in Tests.
Elgar and Hashim Amla (31) stabilised the innings with a second wicket partnership of 86 off 174 balls after Josh Hazlewood had Aiden Markram caught at second slip by Australian captain Steve Smith for nought. Hazlewood struck again when Amla was caught at fine leg soon after lunch. He also had Elgar dropped at backward point by Nathan Lyon when the batsman was on 53 and four runs later hit Elgar on the helmet during a sustained spell of fast, short-pitched bowling.
De Villiers, the leading batsman in the series, looked comfortable from the start and made his 64 runs off 95 balls with ten fours.
Cummins then had both Faf du Plessis and Temba Bavuma caught at second slip by Smith for five and one respectively before Quinton de Kock got a bottom edge to an attempted pull and was caught behind for three.
Vernon Philander was caught behind off Mitchell Marsh before Maharaj fell to Starc. - AFP

Digital gold sellers hope  trickle will become a rush
A digital revolution is reshaping Indias $34-billion gold market, with smartphones, e-wallets and flexible investment schemes drawing new buyers into a business dominated by traditional, face-to-face transactions.
Digital payment systems have ballooned in popularity in India since the government scrapped large-value bank notes in 2016.
Among these offerings are applications that enable smartphone users to buy, sell or store gold  even in small amounts  kept in secured vaults operated by MMTC-PAMP India Pvt Ltd.
Although online gold purchases have been growing globally for years, they are a relatively recent phenomenon in India, where jewellery and bars of the precious metal tend to be kept in hand and given as gifts.
In India, the action is really starting now. The digitisation of the economy will certainly lead to digitisation of gold, said Somasundaram PR, Managing Director of World Gold Councils (WGC) India operations. It is poised for significant growth, possibly in the next 12-24 months. The WGC estimated total Indian gold demand at 727 tonnes in 2017, and could be up to 800 tonnes in 2018. In China, the top consumer, 2017 demand was 953.3 tonnes.
It is difficult to gauge how many new buyers are entering the market because of online access. The digital payments firm Paytm said that in the first six months after it began offering digital gold last April, it facilitated about $18.4 million worth of sales  a tiny fraction of the Indian gold market.
Besides convenience, Indian consumers are attracted to competitive pricing and ability to make purchases in tiny increments.
Gold-based financial offerings, including Gold Accumulation Plans (GAPs), allow users to buy and store gold in fractions as small as 0.1 grams  an amount that would be an uneconomical to trade physically because of the associated handling costs. These accumulation plans, along with gold-backed bonds and websites selling coins and jewellery that can be shipped for free or cheaply within India, are especially appealing to young Indians.
Joe Jacob, a 29-year-old entrepreneur in Bengaluru, recently bought 5 worth of digital gold as a trial investment.
Physical gold is a hassle in terms of storage, and I dont wear gold, but understand it is an asset to hold. Digital gold is better than storing the actual metal at home, worrying about its safety, he said.
Security experts said that because the gold, guaranteed to physically exist in an MMTC PAMP vault, was insured, there was little risk of fraudulent sales. And digital wallet providers expect interest to grow.
Paytm leads the crowded e-wallet space in India and announced two new gold gift and savings plans this month after launching its first digital gold product in April 2017. The company, backed by Japans SoftBank Group and Chinas Alibaba, sources its 24-carat gold from MMTC PAMP.
There is no season for this product; it is running twenty-four seven. Sitting in their offices, homes or wherever they want, they can easily access, buy sell or redeem, said Gaurav Singh, Deputy General Manager-Marketing, MMTC PAMP.
Gold trading traditionally peaks around festival and wedding seasons, experts say. But Singh added that because digital gold lowers the minimum price needed to buy gold and boosts market transparency via live pricing, there has been a rise in the frequency of gold purchases at other times of the year.
Nitin Misra, senior vice president at Paytm confirmed a similar trend, noting about 40 per cent of sales happen during the off-season for buying gold in India.
For Bangalore-based P Vinoth, a logistics consultant who still prefers buying ornaments and jewellery from retail stores, e-wallets now offer an alternative.
For long term, I previously invested in exchange-traded funds. Now I am using Paytm gold, he said. (Business Line)
