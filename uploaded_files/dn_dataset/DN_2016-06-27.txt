Chaminda Dharmawardena first ever Sri Lankan: Judo representation in Olympics for the first time

Sri Lanka, for the first time in the 120-year-old history of the modern Olympic Games, has been granted a rare opportunity of fielding a judoka at the forthcoming summer Olympiad in Brazil.
Secretary General of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka (NOC), Maxwell de Silva told the Daily News that Sri Lanka has been offered a wildcard entry for the judo competition of the Rio 2016 Games. Accordingly, South Asian Championship gold medallist Chaminda Dharmawardena will become the first ever Sri Lankan judoka to compete in Olympic Games history.
Airman Dharmawardena, who has excelled in several international competitions, has been a key member of the Sri Lanka Air Force judo team which has proved its class at National Championship and the Defence Services Championship. Dharmawardena won the silver medal in his pet event of mens 73kg category at the last South Asian Games held in Guwahati this year. He was beaten by Indias Manjeet Nadal in the final.
Identifying the talents of the emerging Lankan judoka, the NOC arranged an international Olympic solidarity scholarship for Dharmawardena with the assistance of the Ministry of Sports.
He is currently training in Slovenia under the month-long IOC solidarity scholarship. Unfortunately, he could not make the full use of the IOC solidarity scholarship as he did not get the clearance from the Air Force to begin his scheduled program from June 1.
The NOC and the Director General of Sports appealed to the Sri Lanka Air Force to release Dharmawardena for intensive training under world renowned coach Marjan Fabjan in Slovenia for a period of one month.
Unfortunately, the Air Force did not release him for the full period insisting that he should represent his services team at the national championship. He was only granted permission to leave after the meet on June 14, the NOC Secretary General said.
Dharmawardena is currently training under Slovenian national champion turned coach Fabjan who had won national titles between 1977 and 1992 in under 78kg weight category. A multiple champion of Slovenia, Yugoslavia and Austria, the 58-year-old world class coach has produced many international stars, including Olympic champion Urska Zolnir and European champion Rok Draksic.
It was due to De Silvas good relations with the International Judo Federation and the IOC that the NOC of Sri Lanka was able to secure passage for a Lankan judoka for Rio Olympic Games under the guidance of NOC President Hemasiri Fernando.
The NOC Secretary said that Sri Lanka has also been assured of a wildcard entry in weightlifting. The slot will be decided between Sudesh Peiris and Indu Dissanayake.
According to De Silva, there is a strong possibility of another wildcard entry for Sri Lanka in wrestling, making it a total of ten competitors in the Lankan contingent for the Olympiad which is due to commence on July 5.
Already, three Lankan athletes - Anuradha Indrajith Cooray (mens marathon), Geethani Rajasekera (womens marathon), Sumedha Ranasinghe (mens javelin throw), have gained Olympic qualifying standards. The trio will be joined by swimmers Mathew Abeysinghe (mens), Kimiko Raheem (womens), national badminton champion Niluka Karunaratne (mens singles) and rifle shooter Mangala Samarakoon (mens).
Cooray will be competing in his third Olympic Games while Karunaratne and Samarakoon will be making their way to second successive Olympics.
Meanwhile, Secretary of the Air Force Sports Council, Group Captain Padman de Costa said that they have requested to reschedule the training program of the judoka in Slovenia.
It was a fair request from the Air Force which has looked after the sportsman for ten years.
Our intention was not to block him but to get his IOC training rescheduled so that he could represent Air Force at the Defence Services Games judo competition, he said.
He added that even in case of a rescheduling of the one-month training stint in Slovenia, the judoka could finish it more than two weeks before the commencement of the Olympic Games.
We will continue to provide him every possible assistance, including financial assistance, Group Captain De Costa said.

Milo inter-schools A Division knockout rugby: Underdogs Wesley face  formidable Royal

All roads will lead to the Royal Sports Complex this evening as rugby fans prepare for a bruising battle of attrition between two evenly matched schools the resurgent Wesley College and Royal who were placed third in the league in their Milo Inter- schools A Division knockout rugby tournament quarterfinal match. Kick-off is at 4:30pm.
Both schools have proud histories of their rugby prowess and clashes between them have always provided fans with thrilling fare.
They have proved worthy quarterfinalist with a consistent display of quality rugby against all their opponents in the league tournament and appear to have peaked at just the right time to provide a grand finale to the ongoing schools rugby season.
The game will be a battle between Wesleys speedy three quarters and Royals mobile forwards.
Wesley had a fairly lean first couple of matches compared to their own high standards but improved their game as the season progressed and despite ending in sixth place in the league have picked up their game with four wins over D.S. Senanayake, St. Joseph's, Dharmaraja Kandy and Kingswood Kandy but suffered a surprise loss to St. Anthonys Kandy in their final league match in Kandy.
For Wesley last years skipper and full back Omar Kuthubdeen has been a tower of strength and has led from the front and emerged as one of the leading points scorers for them. Avishka Lee, Avantha Lee, Mursheed Doray and Avantha Hashan have bonded into a powerful unit.
Meanwhile high riding Royal also had emphatic wins in the league on their way to the knockout. They recorded victories over D.S.Senanayake, St. Peters, Trinity, Wesey, St. Anthonys Kandy and Science whom they beat with ease last week. Hooker Azmir Fajudeen, Hisham Barrie, prop forward Ayesh Maduranga and their versatile skipper cum number eight Nikila Gunadeera will be the men to watch. Fajudeen is arguably the player of the season and the Wesley defence will have their work cut out to keep this talented player shackled.
Scrum half and vice-captain Ashok Wijeykumar is a bundle of energy and a good reader of the game. He is well supported in the back division by fly half Lenox Calyanaratne, centres Janindu Dilshan, Thulaib Hassan and wingers Mahima Gamage and Nikil George. Fullback Ovin Askey has been a revelation in his ability to join the line and his speed has brought him rich rewards.
Royal who have swept apart many competitive schools before them this season must be firm favourites but they know that they are up against a strong side and a loss to Wesley will not only prevent them achieving a top spot in this knockout championship but will also take away some of the gloss of their grand performances for the season. - (WAI)

Rain has final say  as Hales goes  from hero to zero

Bristol, Sunday: England were left 1-0 up with two to play after rain meant the third one-day international in their five-match series against Sri Lanka ended in a no result at Bristol on Sunday.
Chasing a target of 249 for victory, England were 16 for one off four overs when rain stopped play. A minimum of 20 overs needed to be bowled in the second innings for a result to be declared under the Duckworth/Lewis method for rain-affected matches.
But the players were still off the field when the umpires abandoned the match at 5:30pm local time (1630 GMT).
On Friday, Sri Lanka had 34.1 overs in the field without any success as England won the second ODI at Edgbaston by 10 wickets to go 1-0 up in the five-match series after Tuesdays tie at Trent Bridge.
At Edgbaston, England openers Jason Roy (112 not out) and Alex Hales (133 not out) both posted their ODI best scores in an unbroken stand of 256. It was a very different story for Hales at the County Ground on Sunday when he fell for nought off the first ball he faced when caught behind chasing a wide delivery from Suranga Lakmal.
Earlier, Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett both took three wickets apiece as Sri Lanka were held to 248 for nine after England captain Eoin Morgan won the toss.

All-rounder Woakes had fine figures of three for 34 in his maximum 10 overs, including two wickets with his last two balls, after fast bowler Plunkett made early inroads on his way to three for 46. Three Sri Lanka batsmen -- Dinesh Chandimal (62), captain Angelo Mathews (56) and Kusal Mendis (53) -- all made fifties.But the trio all fell going for big legside shots, with Sri Lankas total looking well below par. England had a wicket just five balls into Sundays match when Danushka Gunathilaka played on to left-arm quick David Willey when trying to leave the ball. Kusal Perera fell for nine when he got a top edge off Plunkett and wicket-keeper Jos Buttler held a skyer. First-change Plunkett had now taken a wicket with his second ball on Sunday after striking with this third delivery on Friday.
Mendis pulled all-rounder Chris Jordan, recalled in place of off-spinner Moeen Ali, for four and six off successive deliveries.
But Mendis was out for his ODI best score when he holed out off Plunkett to Hales at deep mid-wicket. Mathews, like Chandimal troubled by a hamstring problem, drove Plunkett down the ground for six.
Chandimal completed a 65-ball fifty but then, trying to hit Woakes legside, got a thick edge straight to Jordan at third man.
That was the end of a fourth-wicket stand of 80 with Mathews, who later skyed a pull off Jordan to Buttler. Woakes ended his spell by having Farveez Maharoof caught in the deep and next ball bowling Upul Tharanga (40) middle stump. The series continues with a day/night match at The Oval in south London on Wednesday. AFP

"In the locker room after the game I thought the national team is over for me, this is not for me, he is reported as having said. "I missed a very important penalty. I'm done."
Messi missed from the spot in the shootout and cut a dejected figure after the result was delivered.
Teammates however said they were not convinced Messi would actually retire from the national team, despite the bad spell.
