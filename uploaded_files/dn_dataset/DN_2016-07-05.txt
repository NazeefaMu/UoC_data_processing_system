Ananda and Nalanda  two production lines for many great cricketers
In the month of March we will eagerly await to see the two leading Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka lock horns at their Big Match. While the cricket stars from Ananda and Nalanda take the field to match their skills in the Battle of the Maroons their annual encounter, the stars of yesteryear will be there to go down memory lane and reminisce, this gathering in the brothers tent. It will give them the opportunity to talk about the good old days when they strolled down the ground to create many memorable moments for their fans of the game in both the colleges. These past cricketers will become teenagers in spirit although their exteriors have withered.
These two leading Buddhist institutions have not only produced the highest number of international cricket stars for Sri Lanka, they have also gifted us with excellent cricket administrators, elite cricket umpires, respected match referees, leading sports media personnel and very importantly talented commentators with brilliant oratorical skills and talented cricket writers who were instrumental in spreading cricket awareness to every nook and cranny in Sri Lanka.
It has now become the best in schools cricket encounters more importantly due to the quality of the by product. The fellow-feeling displayed are also worth a mention and one incident stands out in my memory.
I happened to be the captain of the Ananda team in 1966, in the Big match played at the Oval, Anura de Silva the brilliant Nalandian batsman was thrashing our bowlers to all corners of the Oval and he ultimately reached the dreaded figure of 99.
To deny him the single and the century, I got all the fielders on the off side closer and I stood at wide mid-off. Anura tried to lift the ball over the covers bowled by G.C. Perera and he dollied a catch to me which I took with glee. In next to no time the spectators were swarming around me and Anura like bees and they shouldered both of us.
There was no ill feeling amongst them and it showed that the game was played in good faith and the brotherhood between the two schools was clearly evident.
After the din had died down I went after Anura to congratulate him and he muttered something out of the dictionary to me, and I quickly retreated to the safety of my team mates. This was only short lived and Anura made amends by hugging me and apologizing to me in the pavilion.
In conclusion I would like to mention briefly about the proudest products of both schools; Arjuna Ranatunga who lifted the World Cup for Sri Lanka and who is now a cabinet minister, Bandula Warnapura, the first Sri Lankan Test captain who is now connected to the ACC on an important assignment, Roshan Mahanama, a holder of 3 world records connected to his batting, Marvan Atapattu who captained and coached the Sri Lankan team, Kumar Dharmasena who was a member of the Sri Lankan World Cup winning team under Arjuna Ranatunga and an Elite Test Umpire who umpired the 2015 World Cup final, Sidath Wettimuny who scored the first Test century for Sri Lanka and at the Lords cricket ground, a glorious 190. The above gentlemen are the legends so to say among many more outstanding players.
Note: Tilak de Silva will be writing to Daily News every Tuesday. Tilak captained the Ananda College cricket team in 1966 and represented the Ceylon Schools cricket team captained by Anura Tennakoon in 1964 against the visiting Indian Schools team that included Eknath Solkar as a member. Tilak has watched and played cricket in England, Australia and Jamaica and has authored three books on cricket and written many articles on cricket to leading newspapers in Sri Lanka.

I wont suffer same fate as Djokovic, warns Serena
London Sunday: Serena Williams has warned her Wimbledon rivals she won't suffer the same humiliation as Novak Djokovic as the defending champion steps up her bid for a record-equalling 22nd major title.
Williams was as shocked as the rest of the tennis world by Djokovic's third round exit against Sam Querrey on Saturday, but she is using her fellow world number one's demise as a valuable lesson not to underestimate any opponent.
The 34-year-old put that plan into practice as she routed Germany's Annika Beck 6-3, 6-0 in 51 minutes on Centre Court on Sunday, winning 11 of the last 12 games to earn her 300th Grand Slam match victory.
Serena was so dominant that in the second set she lost only four points, and none on her serve, prompting former Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna to describe the American as absolutely flawless.
And Williams, who hasn't won a major since last year's Wimbledon, revealed fear of enduring a humbling loss like Djokovic is keeping her focused ahead of Monday's last 16 clash with Russian 13th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova.
Every time I step out on the court, if I don't win, it's major national news. But if I do win, it's just like a small tag in the corner, said Williams, who is hoping to tie Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22 Grand Slam triumphs.
I think there is only two people that you can say that about out of all the athletes.
He and I have both made extreme history. He's won four in a row. I won four in a row last year. I think that's historic in itself. I thought Novak would come back. I was surprised he didn't, actually.
It is what it is. I don't look at it as a burden. It's really awesome to be in that position.
After being forced to take a starring role in Wimbledon's first middle Sunday of play since 2004, Williams was relieved to make short work of Beck, giving her extra time to rest before attempting to secure a 10th victory in 13 meetings with her good friend Kuznetsova.
It gives me a lot of confidence. I know what it takes to win these tournaments. It's just about doing it now, the six-time Wimbledon champion said.
Kuznetsova shrugged off a controversial code violation for coaching to clinch a gruelling 6-7 (1/7), 6-2, 8-6 victory over Sloane Stephens.
Inspired by Querrey's heroics against Djokovic, the 31-year-old, who won the US Open in 2004 and the French Open in 2009, hopes to emulate her victory over Williams in Miami earlier this year.
We're all humans and it shows one more time that you can lose, you're not perfect, Kuznetsova said.

Federer, Murray look to pounce on Djokovic absence
London Sunday: Roger Federer and Andy Murray will attempt to make the most of Novak Djokovics shock Wimbledon exit and book their places in the quarter-finals on Monday.
Federer, the seven-time champion, had been seeded to face world number one Djokovic in the semi-finals having lost the 2014 and 2015 championship matches to the Serb at the All England Club.
Now, the 34-year-old is comfortably the favourite to reach his 11th final from the top half of the draw.
But first he must get past Steve Johnson, the world number 29 from the United States who has never before made the last 16 at a Grand Slam event.
Federer said it was unreasonable to expect Djokovic, who had held all four Slam titles, to keep on winning.
I always said it: the first week is tough. Margins are small. I know we get carried away, we think its impossible to beat him, all these things. Clearly hes beatable. Its not impossible, said the Swiss.
He cannot win straight 200 matches in tennis. Youre going to have your losses.
Johnson won on grass at Nottingham and was a quarter-finalist at Queens in the Wimbledon build-up. But he has never played Federer.
I think its going to be exciting. I have never played on Centre, said the 26-year-old.
Its going to be a great experience. Im going to go out there thinking Im going to be the winner. I have no fear out there.
Second seed Murray, the 2013 champion, has breezed into the fourth round without dropping a set. But he faces a tough task on Monday against Australian 15th seed Nick Kyrgios.
Murray has a 4-0 career lead over the Australian with three of those meetings having come in the four majors. AFP

Superstar Phelps veteran presence on fresh-faced US Olympic team
New york Sunday: Michael Phelps will bring down the curtain on his stellar Olympic career in Rio, heading a US swimming team packed with newcomers eager to stamp themselves the future of the sport.
Phelps and his gang of ageing warriors that includes Ryan Lochte, Nathan Adrian and Anthony Ervin have one thing in common with the 30 first timers: They all must swim faster than they did at the eight-day US trials if they want to dominate in the competition pool as they have in Games past.
US men's head coach Bob Bowman, who has guided Phelps throughout a career that spans four prior Olympics that yielded 22 medals, 18 of them gold, believes they can.
One of the things that we have always done well, better than anyone else, is improve from the trials to the Games, Bowman said. And I'm confident we're going to do that again.
And quite frankly we're going to have to do that if we want to have the kind of Olympics that we are expected to have and want to have.
The United States topped the swimming medals table in London 31 total, 16 gold.
While the trials that concluded on Sunday produced a string of tight races and the compelling drama that comes of knowing only the top two in each event will book Olympic berths, the times were not especially fast.
No world records were broken and just one American record was set by Josh Prenot in the 200m breaststroke.
Katie Ledecky, the surprise 800m gold medallist in London, underscored her freestyle dominance with victories in the 200m, 400m and 800m free while Maya DiRado won both women's medleys and the 200m backstroke to book three individual swims in her first Olympic Games.
Phelps was the only other swimmer to win three events at trials -- the 100m and 200m butterfly and 200m individual medley.
I thought his times this week were mediocre, Bowman admitted, but added he was crystal clear on what needed to be done in the weeks leading up to Rio to rectify that.AFP

Gatlin scorches to Rio, Felix powers home
Justin Gatlin clocked the fastest 100 meters of the year to book his ticket to Rio at the US Olympic trials here Sunday as Allyson Felix shrugged off her injury woes to power to victory in the 400m.
Gatlin won in a blistering 9.8 seconds at Hayward Field to edge out young pretender Trayvon Bromell who was second in 9.84sec with Marvin Bracy third in 9.98sec.
The win sends the 34-year-old 2004 Olympic champion to Rio as the biggest threat to reigning champion Usain Bolt.
Gatlin, twice banned for doping offences during his controversial career, had earlier signalled his readiness by setting a season-best 9.83sec in the semi-finals.
I was trying to get me a ticket on that boat going to Rio, a delighted Gatlin said afterwards.
My family has a ticket and that put pressure on me to punch my ticket, said Gatlin, who confirmed he will not race again before Rio after running in the 200m here this week.

Lanka looking for late cameo at tour end
SOUTHAMPTON: Its been a long, thankless tour of England for Sri Lanka. It began early in May with a practice game against Essex and has spanned nearly two months. During the course of its travels, Sri Lanka has managed just two wins, both coming in One-Day Internationals in Ireland.
England, its host for a majority of the tour, has comprehensively outplayed it in both Tests and ODIs so far, and in doing so, has claimed an unassailable lead in the new multi-format points system. So it is that when the two sides clash one final time in a Twenty20 International at the Rose Bowl in Southampton on Tuesday (July 5), Sri Lanka will be fighting to avoid a clean sweep across formats.
After a 0-2 loss in the Tests and a 0-3 reversal in the ODIs, Sri Lanka will find it a struggle to boost morale. After the final ODI  a comprehensive 122-run loss in Cardiff  Angelo Mathews, the captain, found himself fending off questions about his captaincy, saying: This is a tough time for me as a captain and for the whole unit. But you cant run away from it.
The hope was that the ODIs would help Sri Lanka emerge strong from its troubles in Tests, the hope stemming from the possibility of the shorter format narrowing the gap between the teams. However, England  a markedly different side in limited-overs internationals since Sri Lanka defeated it in the ICC World Cup 2015  proved too strong once again, and apart from the first ODI which ended in a tie, was comprehensive winner in the remaining three completed matches.
The problem for Sri Lanka has been that its departments have struggled to work in tandem. The batsmen posted 305 for 5 in the fourth ODI, but the bowlers struggled to restrict England to below that score. Then, when England set it 325 to win in the fifth, its batsmen were contained to 202.
Im pretty sure if we keep improving day by day, we can come out of this hole, said Mathews after the final ODI. For the past two months, weve been having the same problems, either batting, bowling or fielding has let us down in every single game.
Ahead of the final clash of what has been a tiresome series, Sri Lanka will hope to depart with its heads held high. A late cameo or a couple of miscues usually prove decisive in T20s, and Sri Lanka knows it has its best chance yet to put one over England. Recent form doesnt favour Sri Lanka in that respect either  England reached the final of the ICC World T20 2016, while the Sri Lankans failed to get out of their group.
England, meanwhile, is expected to blood a few youngsters in the one-off clash, including Tymal Mills, the paceman. He comes with a reputation for searing pace, something that gained momentum after he roughed up Chris Gayle during the NatWest T20 blast last month. Id love to see him play. I wont be the sole selector, but from my point of view, it would be great to see someone like that charge and give it everything, said Trevor Bayliss, the England coach.
Its good to see some batsmen ducking and weaving.
Eoin Morgan, the England captain, spoke before the ODIs of how much of a confidence booster it was for the side to reach the ICC World T20 2016 final, and warned of coping with bigger expectations. Those expectations would only have increased after its performances in the series so far.
Teams (from):
England: Eoin Morgan (capt), Sam Billings, Johnny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Liam Dawson, Chris Jordan, David Malan, Tymal Mills, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, James Vince, David Willey.
Sri Lanka: Angelo Mathews (capt), Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Upul Tharanga, Dhananjaya de Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Farveez Maharoof, Suraj Randiv, Seekkuge Prasanna.

Isipathana threaten pull out over venue
The Milo Presidents Trophy schools knockout rugby final between Isipathana College and Royal College was in the balance after Isipathana had requested for a venue change from the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA).
Isipathana fired a letter addressed to the secretary of SLSRFA yesterday requesting a change in venue for the final that is to be played on July 9. The letter was tabled at a meeting of the SLSRFA yesterday and Denzil Darling the SLSRFA Secretary said, Yes we have received the letter from Isipathana to change the venue of the final from Royal Sports Complex due to the unfair advantage their opponents Royal will have since its their home grounds. But after a long discussion the SLSRFA committee decided not to change the venue as it will be unfair to S.Thomas College ML who played their semi-final against Royal at the Royal Sports Complex on Sunday after making a protest for a change of venue.
We have invited the Isipathana rugby committee to come for a meeting on Wednesday to see how we can go forward from here, Darling said.
An Isipathana rugby committee media spokesman told the Daily News: We have clearly informed our dislike to play this final at Royal Sports Complex since its Royals home ground and they have an unfair advantage. If the SLSRFA decides to go forward and play at the Royal Sports Complex, then we have no option but to pull out of Saturdays final.

As Ushan Perera took over after the first pit stop he was able to extend the lead to overs 2 laps for the team, who were second after the first stint. He showed tremendous pace and was able to display some splendid over taking moves to increase that lead as he handed over to Kevin Perera. As he took over, he was able to hold his position, driving a great battle with Jason Caron of Thunderbolt racing as both of them displayed aggressive yet respectful driving and exchanged positions multiple times but Kevin Perera was eventually able to retain his position.
The race was action packed for the whole six hours as BKMS Racing were able to hold the lead throughout the race and clinched the win from Thundrebolt Racing with a lead of two laps over them. The race provided the fans with continuous wheel-to-wheel racing throughout the six hours and undoubtedly showed that there is real racing potential in Sri Lanka as all drivers displayed wonderful racing skills on the track.

Federer, the third seed, next takes on Croatias Marin Cilic for a place in the semi-finals.
Cilic, the ninth seeded Croatian, progressed to his third Wimbledon quarter-final when Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori pulled out of their last-16 clash with a rib injury in the second set.
Federer has a 6-1 record over Cilic but the big Croatian stunned the 17-time major champion in the US Open semi-finals in 2014 on his way to his maiden Grand Slam title.
Venus, the oldest in last-eight for 22 years

Williams will be making her 12th appearance in the last eight at Wimbledon, and her first since 2010, when she faces Kazakhstans Yaroslava Shvedova for a place in the semi-finals.
Venus, seeded eighth, was broken twice in the first three games of the first set, but recovered from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win it in a tie-break.
The American legend, who won the last of her seven Grand Slam titles at Wimbledon in 2008, needed just one break to win the second set.
