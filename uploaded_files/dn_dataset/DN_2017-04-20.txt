Maternity leave must be extended to keep women in work
Sri Lanka must soon look at offering more maternity leave for female office workers to encourage them to stay in their job, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Speaking at the Women in Management organised International Leadership Conference titled Thinking Out of the Gender Box Forum at Galadari Hotel he said that today the women labour force is very low in Sri Lanka. He said this is also seen in the Free Trade Zones where there are over 50,000 jobs that are yet to be filled by women. The Minister said one way to keep some of the existing female workers in office places is to offer them extended and flexible maternity leave so that they can stay in their current job after child birth.
The Deputy Minister also said that another area that needs attention is a safer and convenient public transport system which would allow women to travel even in late hours without any inconvenience.
For this, building highways is not the answer. Wickramatratne also said that he is also dreaming of a day where a 100% Sri Lankan womens crew would fly an aircraft like what was done by Air Indian team which flew to San Francisco making it a world record. (SS)

Sri Lanka needs to take more risks: Sanga

Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has said Sri Lanka needs to change the way it plays.
Ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy the cricketing great said Sri Lanka must change its mindset to stay on par with other countries, and also take more risks.
We have some of the more experienced players in Angelo Mathews, Chandimal. But there has to be development not just in the sense of ability but also in the sense of mindset.
There have quite a few change of attitudes around the world - if you take England, South Africa, even Australia, theyve changed the way they play their one-day cricket; consciously changed, become better.
I think for us, we have to do the same. Because at this moment, we are playing very traditional, a tried and tested formula. Thats not going to be enough for us to win.
We have the ability; we have the talent  for sure. But we need to change the way we play. To be able to take more risks, to change the pace of the game, to score your runs when its most advantageous, to build partnerships, but also be a lot more attacking with our fast bowlers and our spinners, the former Sri Lanka captain opined.
Kumar Sangakkara is set to make his commentary debut at the ICC Champions Trophy along with several other star players including Ricking Ponting and Saurav Ganguly.

ACCA expands footprint to Jaffna with K-Aims
The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) having established a strong presence in the Western Province, Central Province and Southern Province, now further expands its reach to the Northern Province by joining hands with their Gold accredited learning provider, K-Aims to bring their globally accredited qualification to the students of this region.
As a part of the many initiatives planned by ACCA in expanding its reach to all the key regions of Sri Lanka, including the North of the country, ACCA in collaboration with K-Aims will hold a series of workshops and events in the Jaffna region.
Seminars will be conducted for advance level students studying in the commerce stream to help them eventually transit on to the ACCA qualification effortlessly.The team conducting the program will consist of leading University lecturers who will deliver the workshops in an interactive teaching style that will promote an atmosphere of attention, participation and interest. The participants will also be guided to identify their strengths and areas of interest through the career guidance section which will be a part of the agenda of the workshop.
The My Learning Magazine that has a host of subject related articles, past paper questions and articles by prominent teachers will also be handed over to the participants free of charge.
Commenting on this venture, Head of ACCA Sri Lanka, Nilusha Ranasinghe said Finance Professionals are the driving force of any organization today.
They facie multiple demands as partners of business operations involved in financial management and analysis , governance, risk, control, strategic management accounting, corporate reporting, internal audit, tax advice and planning.The ACCA qualification has all of these competencies inbuilt into the qualification and is designed to suit to any employment sector coupled with a strong global footprint. It equips any aspiring finance professional with the expertise they require to become finance leaders in the industry."We at ACCA are keen to offer this opportunity to all the talented students of Jaffna. Ranasinghe said.
Kumanan Vettivel, founder of K-AIMS expressed that the resources required for students who wanted to study and enter into the field of finance was limited in Jaffna and felt that it was apt to join with ACCA to offer their diverse qualification to the students in this region, who although talented, lacked the right opportunities provided to them to make the best of their abilities.
We hope to utilize this workshop as a platform to provide the students in Jaffna the exposure and pathway that will lead towards gaining a globally accepted qualification such as ACCA he concluded.

Alarm bells at the Meethotamulla funeral melee
The hill of tears at the devastated vicinity of Meethotamulla rings alarming bells to the whole nation as most of the urban areas are in the making of similar Meethotamullas. Our empathy with them wont do much and sympathy could do nothing as a pragmatic approach to find a permanent solution is the crying need. The need of the hour is that all the bogus politicians should take their hands off and let the president and the prime minister handle the matter against all the odds that may come on their way. It was quiet evident to the general public that almost all the politicians wanted to make the garbage dump a goldmine to them and a path to enter the parliament. It is stinky. The stink of the garbage is lesser than that of the politicians.
Bloemendhal is waiting to burst. The roadside garbage dumps in urban areas are fattening day-by-day to reach the size of their city counterparts and the whole country is sitting on a volcano.
In other countries garbage is a source of national income, yet in our paradise island garbage is an effective raw material for gaining political power. If a pragmatic approach is made to exploit garbage for good use almost all the fallow lands could be made fertile with homemade compost without importing artificial fertilizer.
Long term plan
Some countries need more and more garbage. During the recent past, much needed foreign exchange was spent by our Provincial Councillors and Pradeshiya Sabha members to go abroad on study tours to find solutions for such environmental problems as Meethotamulla. The government could obtain their knowledge to find a workable solution to the calamity or recover the money spent on such tours. People expect such actions from the government.
The expert hands should be allowed to work freely to design a long term plan for the problem. The politicians foul mouths should be shut and tightly locked till they work out a plan. No parliamentary debates or fasts unto death be allowed for a sufficient period till the environmental scientists and foreign delegates completes their studies. If a parliamentary session is given the whole Diyawanna would smell foul. The people will have to bear the brunt.
It is a great solace that Peradeniya University has risen to the occasion to make a feasibility study going deeper into the subject to put forward the suggestions. As a developing country, we always have to rely on home- grown solutions for our nagging problems. The scientists of Peradeniya University have already proved their mettle by predicting and suggesting solutions to Meethotamulla environmental menace even though they have gone unheeded by the relevant authorities who now have come forward to offer relief measures.
The responsibility of this gravest tragedy in the recent past of our country should be shared by every government that who amassed garbage adjacent to their dwellings. Some of our armchair pundits might have obtained doctorates by going round the garbage heap and publishing them in international magazines. The public protests that emerged from the very hearts core of the bereaved families demand not only compensation but also a long lasting solution. Take care and beware, when innocent people are affected by vibrant anger unprecedented tragedies could take place. Several banners had been worded to pass that message to the bogus and opportunistic politicians not to come for begging their votes without genuinely taking pragmatic actions to bring them solace for them to sleep in peace.
Strict vigilance
It was reported in the national press that looting and thefts had raised its ugly head in the tragedy stricken Meethotamulla. Strict punishments ought to be meted out to them without any mitigation in the most deterrent manner. No political meddling should be allowed for mitigation of their punishment and strict vigilance has to be maintained to avoid further ugly happenings. Another vital aspect of our discussions should be community health. My authentic experience is that when I was passing this area one day on my way to a funeral an unbearable stink made me nearly fainted.
On my asking my friend Mr. Mayakaduwa reminded me that we were passing this garbage heap which could be virtually a tourist distraction or else they would make a good study of the miscellany of foul smells of the pearl in the Indian ocean or the Taprobane or the Serendib. It was my beyond my mundane imagination how the residents of this area would have lived on this hell on the paradise island.
The doctors and serious environmental scientists might have done in depths studies in to this perennial problem and they could be invited to come forward to submit their research findings for the benefit of the country. Even the farsighted politicians might have conducted research on how to win their seats in unhygienic conditions.
This tragedy that took over thirty valuable lives in a very few days could be taken as an eye opener. Yet, the solutions for the calamity should not be an eye-wash. The whole country is eagerly looking forward to a long lasting solution with utmost regard to the environmental and health aspects.
Dear president, BEAR THE CROSS AND HAVE FAITH.
Crystal clearly, you have had nearly fourteen hurdles to your credit.

Altair goes for Italian marble flooring, exceeding customer expectations
Colombos architectural Altair has announced that its 400 apartments will have floors finished in Italian Botticino marble, following a decision by the developer to upgrade from marble sourced from Central Asia or the Middle East, as originally proposed.
The upgrade at the developers own volition, represents a significant value addition at no extra cost to the buyers of the apartments, and demonstrates Altairs commitment to exceed customer expectations wherever possible, the company said.
Towards this end, Altair Directors Pradeep Sureka and Pradeep Moraes recently visited quarries and processing facilities in Vincenza, Verona, Brescia and Chiampo in Northern Italy, the home of the best Botticino Marble, to handpick suppliers for the project.
Botticino marble has very low porosity and ferrous content and is extremely hard and robust, making it ideal for installation in the humid conditions of Colombo.
Our commitment to customers was to provide marble from Central Asia or the Middle East, Moraes said on his return to Colombo. However, we are constantly looking at ways of improving our offering, because Altair is intended to be the benchmark in luxury living in Sri Lanka.
He said Altair has already pleasantly surprised buyers of its apartments by over-delivering on several promises by offering them numerous value additions including extensive home automation, chilled water air conditioning, double-glazed windows, Duravit sanitary ware from the Philippe Starck designer range, a concierge-serviced Reception with Quintessentially Lifestyle and free hot water.
Although about two thirds of the construction has been completed, it is our intention to continue to upgrade our offering wherever opportunities arise, Moraes added.
Now at its57thlevel on the vertical tower and the 53rdon the sloping tower, Altair will on completion comprise of a 63-storey tower which leans in to a taller, 68-storey tower. Acknowledged as a game changer in contemporary living in Sri Lanka, the Altair building has already brought a new dimension in aesthetics to Colombos skyline. It is intended to be a one-of-its-kind development in South Asia in terms of architectural design, structural engineering, and living experience.

Australia unveils major changes to citizenship process

Australia will make it more difficult to gain citizenship in a major overhaul of its migration process.
Aspiring citizens will undergo tougher tests on their English language skills and ability to demonstrate "Australian values", PM Malcolm Turnbull said.
Applicants must also have completed four years as a permanent resident - three years longer than at present.
The move comes two days after Australia unveiledstricter visa requirementsfor skilled workers from overseas.
Turnbull said the changes would ensure that migrants were better integrated into the community.
"It is important that they understand that they are making a commitment to our Australian values," he said.
What are the changes
In explaining what constituted "Australian values", Turnbull said migrants must demonstrate support for religious freedom and gender equality.
"Respect for women and children ... that is a key Australian value," he said, adding domestic violence would not be tolerated.
Other changes to the citizenship process include:
A more stringent English language test involving reading, writing, listening and speaking;
Providing evidence of integration into the community, such as employment history, school enrolment or membership of community organisations;
Having already been a permanent resident for at least four years;
Allowing applicants to apply only three times, and automatically failing anyone who cheats on a test.
When asked about reports that applicants would be quizzed on whether they supported forced child marriage or female genital mutilation, Turnbull said it was important to "reinforce our values".
"If we believe that respect for women and children [is an Australian value]... then why should that not be made a key part, a fundamental part, a very prominent part, of our process to be an Australian citizen"
Tightening rules
The requirements would apply to all new applications for citizenship, the government said.
On Tuesday, the government said it would replace a controversial visa scheme to make it harder for foreign nationals to work in Australia.
Turnbull said both announcements had been made in the national interest.
The opposition Labor Party accused Turnbull of making announcements for political gain.
"It seems a little odd to me that you would actually ask people whether or not they are going to obey the law when they already pledge to obey the law," said Labor senator Penny Wong.

Box-Up celebrates one year
BOX-UP, the personal shopping service, offering services to clients wishing to purchase groceries, clothing and various household essentials from any store in Australia celebrates its first anniversary this month with its 1000th customer, Mel Wijeguneratne
Based in Melbourne, BOX-UP was founded by two professionals, Poorni Fonseka and Vanessa Stevenson with the scope of creating a portal for Sri-Lankan residents to purchase affordable, quality products from Australia for themselves and their families independently.
BOX-UP is an online portal offering individuals and families a method of purchasing quality groceries, baby products, chocolates, beauty brands, vitamins and a wide variety of organic and sugar-free health food. It also offers personal shopping services for clothing, toys, electronics, designer brands and more from any store in Australia.
Using Box-up is simple. Customers can simply tell the boxers what they are looking for via the enquiry form on their site www.boxup.lk and your personal shopper will source, quote, shop and organise delivery to Sri-Lanka by sea or airfreight.
Sea freight is available from a set fee of $25 for up to 30kg of product and takes approximately six weeks to arrive in Sri-Lanka. Air-freight and express shipping are available on request and rates vary according to shipping location and weight of product.
BOX-UP was in the making for around twelve months. We knew that there was interest from people in Sri-Lanka wanting a service of personal shopping from Australia. However since it had not been done before, we had to brainstorm ways to make BOX-UP accessible, safe and easy for most people.
With accessibility, we are currently working on how the online only store can operate to assist customers who are not confident with credit card payments or might not be internet savvy.
The main challenge with online stores is trust from customers, which is why a PCI Level 1 approved system called Stripe is relied upon process credit card payments.
This is the most stringent program available at the moment, said founders Poorni Fonseka and Vanessa Stevenson.
My experience with Box-Up was a totally satisfying one.The entire concept is just awesome! From the easy-to-order online product list to the reasonable prices and the prompt delivery, everything was handled very professionally and flawlessly. I am one happy customer who will be returning again and again, says a regular customer Anne-Marie Kellar.
In celebration of this milestone and after much demand from their customers, this innovative duo Vanessa and Poorni are currently in Colombo to meet and greet their regulars.
This is the perfect opportunity for customers to meet the girls behind the brand and try the Australian products first hand.
To mark its first year celebration, BOX-UP also announced its one-day pop-up shop, at The Sooriya Village, Skelton Road, Colombo 4 on April 22, from 10 am  3 pm, showcasing their best sellers to the public.
The products include a wide range of chocolates, goods for Mum and baby, juices, beauty products, sugar-free food, cheese and more, alongside special offers and a chance to win prizes.

Cabinet paper banning sale of loose cigarettes near schools
Cabinet papers had been presented in connection with banning the sale of single cigarettes and banning selling cigarettes within a radius of 500 metres from a school, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne had also stated that attention has been paid to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes which will allow the manufacturers to display their brand only. At the moment 80 percent of the cigarette packet is covered by the pictorial warning. The tax on tobacco had been increased up to 90 percent.
The Government receives an annual income of Rs. 100 Billion from the tobacco company but the Government is compelled to spend over Rs. 72 Billion annually to treat patients who fall sick due to smoking and related issues. annually 25,000 Sri Lankans die from health issues caused by smoking. The tobacco company says their profit has gone down to one percent with the new tax, the Minister stated. There is no truth whatsoever in the statement issued by the Government Medical Officers Association in connection with permitting a new tobacco company to commence operations in Sri Lanka. They kept mum when the previous regime reduced the pictorial warning on cigarette packets from 80 percent to 60 percent, he said.

CMCS NEGLECT OF DEBRIS DUMB
It is shocking to hear that Meethotumulla has suffered the landslide of debris dump that has caused the tragedy of destruction in life and properties. Nearly forty lives have been lost in the garbage landslide and hundreds of men, women and children have been buried alive. What a great loss! Who is responsible for this unpleasant sudden incident
In the opinion of right thinking observers and critics, it is beyond doubt that the CMC administration and management should be answerable for this unfortunate plight. It is only after the result of the excessive debris dump that every responsible Authority talks of the previous mistake of dumping of mountainous debris in the vicinity of Meetotamulla.
I personally feel that the Mayor of the CMC should have taken preventive action against the unthoughtful dumping of debris to such a maximum level in neighbourhood of Meethotumulla area. Why did the members of CMC not raise any objection to such careless work of debris dumpers and jointly involved workers who are paid salaries with the taxes from the members of the public
Further, the Health officers too have to be generally blamed for neglecting inspection of the debris site having considered its adverse effects on health. Above all, the Minister and Central government should have kept an eye on the aggravated condition of Meetotamulla and should have issued a special order to CMC to clear the dumped debris that caused the catastrophe at last.

Clients world!
Today Archt. Vajira Wickramasingha speaks to Archworld about the importance of seeing the world through the eyes of the client before deciding on architectural plans.
In my view architecture is a way of life. Architect has to understand the clients lifestyle completely before attempting the design. Once it is understood, the architect has to imagine himself as the client and live in the building while designing the spaces, said Wickramasingha. We are indeed blessed with sunshine and wind. But while designing we have to be mindful that western sun is not always a blessing.
If we provide glass facades or very large windows exposed to the western sun in order to get sunlight in, it will bring in unbearable amount of heat as well. My view is that sunlight should be taken into a building very carefully without disturbing the comfort level of its inhabitants, pointed out Wickramasingha. Providing cross ventilation by taking the wind in could make a building very comfortable in a tropical country.

But we have to be mindful again of the monsoon rain. While wind can make the building very comfortable during the dry season, rain water can beat in during rainy season wetting the entire space. If we use sunlight and wind with due care in our designs, we can create beautiful and comfortable spaces, stated Wickramasingha.
Colours
Colours can have an amazing effect on anything.
House inDutugemunuStreet Kohuwala
In a tropical country as ours we can draw into the building from the outside by creating openings and visually connecting the spaces. This can bring in all the colors created by mother-nature into the building with the beautiful sounds of the birds together with sunshine and wind.
I prefer to hide or blend my buildings in the natural environment. However using color depends on how I understand the client. If it is a retail shop I may use vibrant colors. If it is a home for a client who has had a very busy day, I may go for calm and soothing colors, explained Wickramasingha
Plant, flowers and fruits can be beautiful things but still one must take precautions.
This again could be another dream of all architects. The decision depends again on how practical it is. If the plot is very small the roots can damage the foundation. Even in a small site if it is a valuable and beautiful tree, precautions can be taken to preserve it, if client can afford to spend an additional cost on the foundation, cautioned Wickramasingha
Possibilities
Truly the possibilities of architecture are mind boggling!
I have realized that playing with light and shade, solids and voids, makes a building interesting and exiting, said Wickramasingha
The architect and client must see eye to eye. The architect must see the client clearly. I advice my students always to understand the life style of the client. Understand his problems, likes and dislikes etc .We are only designers. The client will have to live in the space that we create for him. Imagine yourself as the client. Imagine yourself living in that created space. Discuss with your client about the created spaces. Final design outcome should make your client happy and comfortable, informed Wickramasingha
Buildings can also create a sense of nostalgia. Houses, factories, hotels and other buildings are all part of history in many ways.
Decaying of buildings with time is inevitable. Some buildings are worth restoring. Some are not. The issue has to be addressed case by case. When old buildings are renovated I believe that we should not make any changes in facades. Material used should belong to the same era. Thereby the future generation too will be able to read the era of these buildings. It should take the form of restoration rather than renovation, elucidated Wickramasingha
Imagination matters
As mentioned earlier, it is all about imagination - seeing through the eyes of the client by picturing oneself in the buildings.
I remain a shadow and the character of my client becomes prominent in my buildings. Architecture will always relate with time. Once the character of the client is understood and a building is designed accordingly it will be a joy for the client to live in that building. While designing, the architect will imagine living in the building. He will foresee all the problems that will arise. Solutions are given in the design itself, thus the building becomes practical and logical. Regulations are made for the benefit of the people and therefore, a good designer will not violate them, explained Wickramasingha
Green building concept is the solution to environmental and climatic crisis.
House in Gemunupura, Kottawa
Urban crisis and financial crisis, in an architectural point of view is based on a social problem. People who seek employment in cities increase the density of the population. This population is basically divided according to their income level - low income, middle income and high income groups.
The increased population will demand for facilities such as education, health, residencies according to their income level. Thus the need of buildings will arise. With the scarcity of land, final outcome will be an increased number of high rises and shanties. Location of industries in rural areas is the long-term solution for this issue, pointed out Wickramasingha
Spiritual architecture derives with devotion and faith. People need such spaces to get relieved of stress.
Taking time off to speak to god, to worship the Buddha or to meditate will help people calm their emotions. Therefore it is an essential social need to create such buildings or spaces. My very first building was a shrine room (Budhu Medura) for Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya Colombo 7. Second experience was improvements to Bo-Maluwe at my alma mater -Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo 4, summed up Wickramasingha

First big break for many cricketing legends
Top former Sri Lanka cricketers such as Ranjan Madugalle, Arjuna Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan, Marvan Atapattu, Kumar Dharmasena and Thilan Samaraweera, to name a few, and even present vice captain of the national team Dinesh Chandimal, had stepped into the international arena through one common platform  the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest.
For almost four decades, the contest has been a household name in elevating outstanding schoolboy cricketers from school level to international arena. The world class cricketers who had emerged through the contest have not only played and captained Sri Lanka with distinction but have even gone beyond that by turning out to be ICC Match Referees, ICC Elite Panel Umpires, the Chief ICC Match Referee and even Cabinet Ministers.
The first ever recipient of the prestigious award Ranjan Madugalle, the then Royal College captain, set a classic example for others to follow. He not only went on to lead Royal and NCC with distinction but also captained Sri Lanka.
He scored the second half century for Sri Lanka in Test in the first innings of Sri Lankas inaugural Test against England at Sara Stadium, minutes after Arjuna Ranatunga, who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title after Madugalle, became the first to do so.
Having retired from international cricket, Madugalle was elevated as an ICC Match Referee and was promoted later as the Chief ICC Match Referee, a post which he hold to date.
Sri Lankas first and the oldest school cricket awards ceremony has today become a dream event for schoolboy cricketers in the country. It not only motivates and encourages them to reach their sporting targets at the highest level but also showcases their achievements in a way that no other off-field event could ever dream of. While enabling the outstanding schoolboy cricketers to fulfill their dreams of making it to the big league through the unique platform, Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel, the principal sponsor of the mega show has been lavishly rewarding the outstanding players.
Even their coaches and masters in charge who play a silent role behind the scene too have been rewarded at the mega event. All this have been made possible with the financial backing of the sponsor of the mega event. It is heartening to see Sri Lankas national mobile service provider  the SLT Mobitel, giving the highest priority to boost school cricket by sponsoring the Observer-Mibitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest for the tenth consecutive year.
Thanks to the untiring efforts of the CEO of SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera, the show has gone from strength to strength. SLT Mobitels association with the show has been a great strength to the hosts  the Lake House. It all began way back in 1979 in an era when there had not been a single awards show for schoolboy cricketers or an organized inter-school Under-19 two-day tournament structure.
Our sister paper the Sunday Observer understood the need to inspire the countrys budding cricketers, giving birth to the countrys first-ever and the biggest school cricket awards show.
It is heartening to see that several others following the Sunday Observers initiative by hold similar awards shows to reward schoolboy cricketers after every season. But the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year remains the Mother of all Shows.
Needless to say how important it is for a schoolboy cricketer to win an award as recognition to their commendable achievements after a strenuous season.
It is not just appreciating their achievements but also a big inspiration for them to step into the big league.
All past winners of this prestigious title have repeatedly said what a big inspiration the award had been to their cricket careers. Since its humble beginnings at Nawaragahala in 1979, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has gone from strength to strengthen.
Schoolboys and their supporters young and old, still have a few more weeks left to vote for your favourite schoolboy cricketer and hail their achievements during the recently concluded inter-school first X1 season.
Voting coupons for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continue to appear in ANCL newspapers, including the Daily News.

Galewela farmers up in arms against paddy land reclamation permit issue
Farmers in Galewela are up in arms against the alleged issuing of six permits to reclaim paddy lands in the area contravening the accepted procedure. Reclamation work started on two plots of paddy lands has been suspended on the orders of Divisional Secretary M. U. Nishantha, they said.
Farmers allege that those involved in reclamation work had obtained the permits from the Agrarian Services Commissioner General.
Kudawewa Gemunu Farmers Association President T. D. A. Appuhamy said illegal reclamation work started in a paddy field in Kudawewa by an individual was halted on the orders of the Divisional Secretary.
The prevention of such illegal reclamation work is vested in a range of officials from the level of agricultural research and production assistants to the District Development Committee. Allowing illegal reclamation of paddy lands was a bad precedent. They hoped to petition the President about it, they said.
The other paddy field subjected to reclamation comes under the wing of the Ranketha Farmers Association. Its secretary said this reclamation was illegal as no application had been made to his association in this regard.
The Galewela Divisional Secretary said a report on the reclamation of these paddy lands had been submitted to the Agrarian Services Commissioner General and other authorities. He said he will request a CID investigation into the matter.
Matale Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services P. G. Somaratne said he had sent a fax message to the Agrarian Services Director General requesting him to cancel the six permits issued by a former Commissioner.

Tonnes of rotting garbage have piled up at several areas in Colombo, following the collapse of the main garbage dump in Meetotamulla last Friday,resulting in the deaths of over 30 people. Residents in the alternative areas chosen for garbage dumping including Karadiyana and Dompe staged protests hampering the waste disposal efforts of the authorities. Following the collapse of Meetotamulla garbage dump the government decided that garbage from Colombo would be disposed of at several sites including Karadiyana and Dompe.

Gone, Gone, Gone to waste
The Sinhala and Tamil New Year traditionally brings with it new hopes and aspirations. Had the government hoped for a politically more tranquil New Year, it must have been most disappointed.
Literally hours after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year dawned last Friday, a mountain of garbage at Meetotamulla collapsed, taking with it dozens of houses and at least thirty-one lives. Many more are still reported as missing and the death toll from the disaster is expected to climb.
This is not a natural disaster. It is a tragedy due to a combination of factors: political expediency, inefficient government and even more inept local government. Right now though, it has evolved into a political dog fight with the government and the opposition- mostly the Joint Opposition (JO) - trading charges as to who is responsible for the disaster.
Initially, the extent of the disaster was understated. This was partly because the country was still in holiday mode and media coverage centred mostly on New Year celebrations. First reports only suggested that one child had died in the tragedy. As hours passed however, the full scale of the disaster unfolded.
To be fair, the government did respond with alacrity. President Maithripala Sirisena ordered officials of the Disaster Management Centre to conduct an immediate assessment. He also ordered the Police and the armed forces personnel to assist in relief operations. Those affected were to be housed in temporary accommodation, for which three warehouses were released. Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka visited the site of the tragedy.
Compensation to the victims
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was on the last leg of an official visit to Japan and Vietnam, cut short his visit and returned to the country. Wickremesinghe had also arranged for disaster management experts from Japan to visit Sri Lanka to assist in the relief operation. They are said to be very experienced in managing such disasters as Japan is a nation frequently affected by earthquakes.
The government also ordered the immediate release of compensation to the families of the victims. In addition, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa announced payments of 2.5 million rupees for those whose properties were damaged and Rs.100, 000 on behalf of the deceased as insurance payments. Despite these measures, there was some consternation, even within government ranks. United National Party (UNP) parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar went public saying that the government should shoulder some of the responsibility for the disaster because he had been urging that the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla be stopped but his pleas had fallen on deaf ears.
Indeed, as recently as in late March this year, a fire had erupted at the dump in Meetotamulla. It was thought that the dry weather and flammable material in the garbage dump had combined to produce the fire. On that occasion, Marikkar made a public appeal to stop the dumping of garbage which had accrued to about three million tonnes, rising 180 feet high.
I told the leaders of this country that no more garbage can be dumped in this place. Nobody understands the gravity of the situation Marikkar said then and stated that he is ready to sacrifice his parliamentary seat on behalf of the people of Kolonnawa. Marrikars words turned out to be unfortunately prophetic.
While Marikkar was lamenting his plight, he and his fellow UNP parliamentarian from Kolonnawa, Hirunika Premachandra, came under fire from the JO. The JO alleged that the duo had canvassed preference votes at the last general election in August 2015, promising the people of Kolonnawa that they would halt the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla.
Premachandra in particular came under fire from a television stationed owned by the family of her political bete-noire, Duminda Silva.
This is when the disaster assumed a different dimension. Government politicians were quick to respond to these allegations, noting that the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla was the brainchild of former Defence Secretary and head of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Colombos garbage
Rajapaksa had won many plaudits for his pet project of beautifying Colombo city, in the years after the end of the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). As part of this project, he ordered the relocation of the massive garbage dump at Bloemendhal road in Kotahena and decreed that no more garbage be dumped there.
A top Malaysian renewable energy company was contracted to remove the garbage at Bloemendhal road and set up a renewable energy plant on a 20-acre land at Kahatamedawelayaya, Muthurajawela, in the Gampaha District, using tonnes and tonnes of the Bloemendhal garbage.
This was after the Supreme Court had ordered that no more garbage be dumped at Bloemendhal road. While the dump at Bloemendhal road was cleared, the alternative site chosen was Meetotamulla.
With the government pointing the finger of blame at Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the JO countered these claims, stating that Rajapaksa had a plan to transport Colombos garbage to Puttlam by train. This plan, the JO argued, never became a reality because the Rajapaksa government was swept out of power in January 2010. Since then, the JO argued, the government had done little to redress the grievances of the residents of Meetotamulla.
Soon, the war of words escalated. Even former president Mahinda Rajapaksa entered the fray, declaring that the government ought to take responsibility for the disaster. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila, never one to lose an opportunity to take a swipe at the government and at his former colleague, Minister Champika Ranawaka, said that the government should immediately implement Gotabhaya Rajapaksas plan, instead of worrying about who gets credit for that.
Meanwhile, the government had to call in the Police and the armed forces to maintain peace at Meetotamulla. The public in the area were becoming restive as more and more bodies were unearthed as the clearing of debris progressed at a slow pace. Given the nature of the clearing work, it was not a task which could have been carried out at a frantic pace, experts say.
Sentiments ran high in Meetotamulla and the surrounding areas as mass funerals were held for some of the victims. The public, perhaps more measured in their assessment of who was to blame for the disaster, were accusing all politicians of all colours of playing with their lives and were giving vent to their feelings. In that emotionally charged atmosphere, there was plenty of room for mischief makers to thrive and the government was keen to avoid such a situation which would only compound the crisis even further.
Recyclable waste generating energy
Key questions, however, still remain. The main consideration is where Colombos garbage would be dumped in the future or whether it should be dumped anywhere at all. The concept of recyclable waste generating energy is not new and has been adopted by many countries on a large scale.
This appears to be the solution to Colombos garbage crisis but the issue is how soon such a project could get off the ground- and what could be done in the interim.
As a make-shift arrangement, the government sought and obtained a court order to dump Colombos garbage at an alternative site, Karadiyana in Piliyandala but this is essentially a stop-gap measure.
In the meantime, however, the political blame game will continue to be played out in the media. Meetotamulla will remain in the headlines for weeks to come, but finding a solution to the crisis it generated will take a Herculean effort- an effort that will be as great, if not greater than what is required to clear the massive mountain of garbage that mars the Meetotamulla skyline.

The Gota project
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila after lying in hibernation during the last few days has risen in defence of the Rajapaksa government vis a vis the Meethotamulla tragedy. Not showing himself at the scene, even though he must have received a substantial number of preference votes from the Meethotamulla residents, Gammanpila has sought to clear the Rajapaksa government from any sort of blame, albeit indirectly. This perhaps is an afterthought on the part of Gammanpila in order to offset the deafening silence maintained by the big guns of the Joint Opposition in the aftermath of the tragedy.
Addressing a media briefing on Tuesday, a full five days after the tragedy, the Colombo District MP took pains to explain that had the solution to the Meethotamulla garbage problem devised by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being implemented the residents would certainly have been spared the tragedy that befell them. The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader has certainly got wise after the event. One cannot recall the diminutive politician making any mention of this Gota project since the ouster of the Rajapaksa in January 2015. Surely as a parliamentarian representing the Colombo District he could not have been be unaware of the periodic protests made by the Meethotamulla residents. Or was the subject of garbage an unsavoury topic to the MP who is always clad in spotless white
According to Gammanpila, Rajapaksa had suggested that the garbage collected daily within the Colombo Municipal Council limits and that which had already been piled up at Meethotamulla and Bloemendhal be transported by train to the Aruwakkalu limestone quarry in Puttalam.
Why pray was this brainchild of the all powerful former Defence Secretary kept on the back burner while the garbage was continued to be dumped at Meethotamulla even after a Supreme Court ruling banning garbage dumping at the site, in 2009, when the Rajapaksa power was at its peak after the defeat of terrorism. Surely, funds could not have been a problem as vanity projects like the Cricket stadium at Sooriyawea, Mattala, Hambantota Port, a lavish Commonwealth summit the Nelum Pokuna theatre etc, all running into several billions of rupees, came about around this time. Or was it that people living amidst garbage was not a priority for the Rajapaksas, like for instance night races
Gammanpila, after keeping a low profile all these days following the tragedy, has now suddenly returned to his former bellicose self and seeks to palm the blame for the Meethotamulla catastrophe on the Yahapalnaya government. He goes onto say that a sum of Rs. 2 billion was set aside in the 2015 budget for the Puttalam project conceived by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa but a change of regime put paid to this. Why pray, did the Rajapaksa government wait until 2015 to get the project going when the garbage was climbing sky high in Meethotamulla from as far back as 2007 Were there other priority projects that brought in fat commissions and Meethotamulla had to wait Surely Rs. 2 billion would have been chicken feed given the colossal amounts that went into deals at the time. And who was it that got the police to baton charge residents of Meethotamulla in 2011 when they protested against the dumping of garbage in their environs Why wasn't the Puttalam project conceived then and executed before things got out of hand
True, the present government should be blamed for not tackling the Meethotamulla garbage problem as a priority issue. But by no stretch of the imagination can the Rajapaksa government absolve itself of blame. It is the cumulative sins of both governments that had visited upon the residents of Meethotamulla. By calling on the government to implement Gota's Puttalam project without considering who gets the credit, Gammanpila is shamelessly using the Meethotamulla tragedy for political gain in typical fashion. Perhaps, this could also be part of the campaign, now in full swing, to promote Gota as the next Presidential candidate.
It is time that Gammanpila and his ilk realise that people cannot be fooled by empty words. Had the Rajapaksas acted in time, instead of waiting till 2015, this tragedy could well have been averted. That much he has to concede. Asking the present government to implement a project that had been relegated to backstage all those years was unacceptable. Understandably, the elements in the Joint Opposition were relatively mute during the past few days, perhaps taking cognizance of the fact that their leaders indeed had been culpable. It is only now that they keep coming out, like termites from the woodwork, to find fault with the government for not implementing Gota's project. There is bound to be more attacks on the government and the promotion of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in the days ahead, what with Provincial Council elections round the corner. The likes of Gammanpila are bound to seize on the Meethotamulla tragedy to hoodwink the people and absolve their own leaders. Hence the government ought to be prepared with a counter strategy and expose the commissions and omissions of the Rajapaksa regime vis-a-vis Meethotamulla, that finally led to the tragedy.

Government to prioritize eradication of social ills

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said today the Yahapalana government will give priority to rescuing the people from the evils of tobacco, alcohol and drugs.
What the previous government did under the Mathata Thitha was to grant liquor licenses to their cronies, he said.
Then when these cronies ventured out for various other illegal businesses connected to the liquor trade, the political leadership even threatened the Police to secure their release, he said.
He was addressing a ceremony at a new service center in Muwanwewa, Lunugamwehera.
Lots of narcotics were brought to the country by containers during the former regime. Today our government is nabbing such a narcotic containers.
The Customs is also rendering a yeoman service islandwide to tackle the narcotics, the Minister said.
We have stopped the practice of giving liquor licenses through politicians. The responsibility of the politicians is not giving liquor licenses but rather to serve the villagers. We can see large crowd of people in front of the liquor stores every evening. They spent lots of money on alcohol, which has destroyed their families and relationships. Therefore, we all have to get-together to make a drug and alcohol free Sri Lanka. Then, we can make our country prosperous, he further said.

Government should pay at least Rs.3 million compensation: Tissa Vitharana

The Government should pay at least two or three million rupees as compensation per person killed under Meetotamulla Garbage Mountain, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said today.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo he said that during the last two months the Government has printed money worth Rs. 9100 million and the Government is pushing people and the country towards a huge crisis.
According to Prof. Vitharana, now the Government has added fuel to the burning fire by offering Trincomalee harbour to US, which is about to commence a war with North Korea.
Sri Lanka will be sandwiched in the middle of the war.
The Government is now selling even huge private lands of 5,000 acres.
Chinese Government has already offered us a loan of US $ 1,000 million but the Government is going after the International Monetary Fund and selling the country under its directions in order to take 500 million or US $, he added.

Harrys terrible August !
Harry was just 12 years old on that terrible August day his mother died  the same age my own son is now.
And I know from experience what a tender, vulnerable age it can be for a boy; a time of great change and turmoil even in the most stable of families.
No longer a child but not yet a man, there are seismic physical and mental changes under way. One minute theyre asking for cuddles, the next theyre telling you to wait two streets away, and preferably in disguise, so the other children dont see you picking them up from school.
Boys this age (far more, in my experience, than girls) need the reassurance of a watchful maternal eye as they negotiate the complex and emotionally fraught passage into adulthood.
Poor Harry was deprived of his beloved mother 20 years ago at this pivotal moment in his development, and whatever faults Diana may have had, she was, by all accounts, the most wonderful and intuitive parent.
Instead of her love and encouragement, Harry suddenly found himself without the most important person in his life, and in the bleakest of circumstances.
To make matters worse, he was forced to endure his grief in full view of the world. I will never forget watching in horror as those two boys processed down The Mall behind their mothers coffin.
Even though I had no children of my own at that time, I thought it was unforgivable to submit them to such an ordeal  exposing them to all those millions of prying eyes at the precise moment when they should have been protected.
No one who truly loved them would ever have allowed them to be paraded in public like that. Unless, of course, they happened to subscribe to an especially strict doctrine of stiff upper lip.
Perhaps that is why William added to his brothers revelations this week by calling for an end to that culture of repressed emotions. He and his younger brother have clearly suffered a great deal of pain because of it.
No wonder William said he and Kate were determined to bring up George and Charlotte in a way that encourages them to speak openly about their emotions.
To some this might seem like wishy-washy therapy-speak. Its certainly not the sort of thing my parents generation would have a lot of time for.
But while there is undoubtedly such a thing as emotional over-indulgence, Afghan veteran Harry is a long way from being the over-sensitive snowflake so many other young people seem to be today.
Of course, status, wealth and a fine education have helped cushion the blows that life has thrown at him. But Im sure Harry would have given up all his privilege in a heartbeat to bring his mother back.
And that is the real joy of the Harry we have seen this week. Because, in a funny kind of way, he has brought her back. The conversation he has engaged in with the nation is the same one that Diana first began when she spoke honestly about her own struggles with bulimia.
And today, we find her still blowing the cobwebs off that most arcane of organisations, the British Royal Family.
It is this ability to engage with the public at the most human level that will prove Dianas legacy.
And Harry, with all his energy and empathy, may turn out to be her greatest achievement of all.

I banish conservative thinking to serve society: Wedaarachchi
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said he goes out of the box thinking to serve the society.
The minister was addressing a meeting with senior government officials in Tangalle recently.
Minister Wedaarachchi said: I am willing to go beyond new and old models of think tanks to deliver productive results to the society.
It is high time to think of a new model for Think Tank, one that takes full advantage of managing resources and some of the best practices from more established think tanks across the world, Wedaarachchi said.
He said he is planning to set up a think tank on blue economy concept with a constructive policy, targeting a boomin the fisheries industry, by using the expertise of other ministries, institutes, freelance researchers, fisheries community and the public. The State Minister sketched up a roadmap for a sustained and ambitious urge from the government perspective towards reaping the benefits presented through the marine resources surrounding the island.
He is of the view that embracing the Blue Economy concept via policy making in respective fields is key towards such an endeavour.
He emphasized the importance of a holistic approach towards such initiatives involving all stakeholders. This will not at all override the concept of Green Economy. The word Blue is new to the arena of economy, but nothing other than the colour of the Ocean packed with enormous resources, just as same as the formation of the blue colour by collection of various shades of colours, he said.
The minister said Sri Lanka is surrounded by sea which is 8 times larger than the land. However, we have to reconsider how much this great resource with high production capacity has been optimised to the economic development of the country, he said.

Dogs with a sweet tooth can finally satisfy their ice cream cravings - at the Don Paletto parlor in Mexico City.Owners can satisfy their pets sweet cravings at the shop in the Mexican capital, which offers a variety of frozen cone and lollipop treats especially made for the animals.
Made of natural yogurt and lactobacilli bacteria, it can help digestion while normal ice cream can cause pain and diarrhea in dogs, according to shop owner Mauricio Montoya, who said the food is also safe for humans.
Flavors such as Gentleman and Lucky Lucky are advertised on the shops board, where the pets lick the treats off a stick, a cone or out of a bowl

IMF says pace of global economic growth is picking up
The world economy seems to be gaining momentum, according the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
Writing in the IMFs new World Economic Outlook, Maurice Obstfeldt said we could be at a turning point.The report forecasts global growth this year of 3.5%, up from 3.1% predicted in 2016.
The UKs economy is forecast to expand by 2% this year, stronger growth than any of the major developed economies apart from the US.The prediction for Britain this year is now only marginally below what the IMF predicted a year ago, its last full forecast before the Brexit referendum.
The figure then was 2.2%. The revised forecast reinforces the picture of the British economys performance being little affected by the aftermath of the referendum, contrary to the expectations of the IMF and many independent economists. The IMF does, however, expect the longer term impact on Britain to be adverse.
The IMF also warns of headwinds that could weaken its global projections. The organisation highlights the possibility of protectionism and what the report calls trade warfare.
However, the dominant tone of the report is rather sunnier than it has been for some time. For much of the period since the financial crisis of 2008 the IMF has worried that the recovery was failing to generate momentum. The forecast for this year would be a marked improvement on last years 3.1%.
Its striking that in the forecast for the larger economies, there are none predicted to suffer a decline in economic activity this year or next.Even Brazil and Russia, two countries that have suffered from the fallout of international and domestic political difficulties, are forecast to see growth this year, although its not particularly strong.
Inevitably, the IMF identifies possible risks that could weaken its main forecasts. In particular, the report refers to increasing pressures for inward looking policies in the advanced economies.
The report notes the loss of what it calls middle-skilled jobs in advanced economies as a result of technological change since the early 1990s. There is controversy about to what extent increased global trade might have contributed to those losses.

Important five days for players to showcase their form
Deadline for final selection of 15 for Champions Trophy is April 25:
Sri Lanka Crickets Super provincial limited-over tournament which is being used as a pre-cursor to selections for the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June will resume after an eight-day break for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year with Kandy taking on Colombo at the NCC grounds and Galle meeting Dambulla at the Dambulla Stadium today.
The matches from today followed by ones scheduled for April 22 and 24 will be crucial to the players participating in the tournament to showcase their current form ahead of the final selection of 15 players which every participating country in the Champions Trophy has to name before the ICC deadline of April 25.
The matches from April 22 onwards will all be played under lights right upto the final on April 30.
Dasun Shanaka and Dinesh Chandimal
Kandy led by the enigmatic Chamara Kapugedera have been the dominant team in the tournament so far running up totals in excess of 300 in each of their two matches and winning them. In the first match they chased down 348 against Galle and won by a whisker (one wicket) with three balls to spare and, the second match against Dambulla also proved to be a heart-stopping affair with Kandy running out winners by 19 runs.
What is heartening to note is the frequency with which teams like Kandy, Galle and Dambulla have topped the 300-run mark which in todays context of ODI cricket is the benchmark total. Colombo who lie bottom of the table with no wins are the only team that has not reached that figure so far.
With the present prevailing hot weather conditions whatever tracks that are prepared for the matches have turned out to be flat and the parched outfields have led to a spate of boundaries being scored. Although the batsmen are enjoying a good time out in the middle it is the bowlers who find themselves at the receiving end with some of them struggling even to bowl four-over spells because of the intense heat and humidity that is sapping their energies.
The conditions under which these matches are being played is a far cry from what the team will experience in England with the ball wobbling around in temperatures less than 70 degrees.
SLC however announced that the selected squad will spend time in high altitude training in Kandy and Diyatalawa to simulate the conditions the players will play under when they are in England and also that the team would leave for England eight days ahead to play two warm-up matches in Scotland to enable them to acclimatize to English weather conditions.
So far the Super Provincial tournament has witnessed some exceptional batting performances from Dasun Shanaka, Lahiru Madushanka, Chamara Kapugedera, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Dinesh Chandimal, and from Harsha Cooray, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lahiru Milantha, Hashan Dumindu, Malindu Hasaranga and Ramith Rambukwella.
The bowlers on the other hand have taken a beating except on a couple of occasions when they were able to gain the upperhand especially with fast bowler Lahiru Gamage taking 4/46 in Kandys win over Dambulla and left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara of Galle returning the best bowling of the tournament so far with 5/29 against Colombo who were dismissed for the lowest total 114.

JO wants adequate compensation for Meethotamulla victims
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said the government should give adequate compensation to the victims of the Meethotamulla disaster. MP Dinesh Gunawardena speaking to the media in Colombo questioned whether the announced Rs.100000 was the full compensation offered and if it is so the government should be ashamed about it.
Gunewardene went on to say that the government could not consider this as a natural disaster and thus the victims should be compensated to the fullest possible manner.
Gunawardena also found fault with the Colombo Municipal Council which he said had not acted in accordance with established garbage collecting procedures.
If proper procedures had been adopted with regards to garbage collection, the calamity could have been avoided he added. The parliamentarian said a letter has been sent to the Speaker requesting him to hold an emergency parliamentary debate on the tragedy.

Kandy sports pride of the nation
Sports in Kandy play a significant part in the lives of the folks living in the hill country. Over here in Kandy it is represented by all races of the island, Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers and Malays. Whatever said and done rugby is the most popular sport in the central hills at school and club level. In the early days football, cricket and hockey were very active at club level. But it is not so today. Some of the other popular sports were netball, badminton, athletics, basketball, tennis, cue sport, volleyball, table tennis, elle, golf, swimming and baseball. Credit should go to schools for regularly organizing sports events at top level. This is largely due to the efforts of principals and the past pupils. As a result, Kandy has produced many national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, football and hockey. Today most of the state schools lack funds to equip themselves and also no proper playing fields.
Rugby is the most popular sport and crowd-pulling game. This is because Kandy SC is the one and only club out of Colombo playing the game at the highest level. They are the reigning club rugby league and knockout champions. Football, however, is the common mans sport. This sport still continues with limited resources and facilities. But it is sad to say that in the last eight years, football in Kandy has taken a back seat. Hockey at school level is a happy story, with most of the schools, especially girls schools, dominating the game. Cue games, billiards and snooker, however, have also taken a nosedive with hardly any activity, today billiard rooms are used as stores in clubs, Only Mahnuwara YMBA is the active club in Billiard and Snooker.
Basketball has returned to its former position. Table tennis and badminton too are in good shape with participation at every level being more than satisfactory. Volleyball is at low ebb. In recent times, Kandy has produced some impressive athletes, but the eye-opener has been swimming where Kandy has produced some top notch swimmers, especially at school level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest level. Kandy is urgently in need of proper ground facilities for football, cricket, hockey and athletics.
The sporting fraternity of Kandy wants to appeal to the Sports Minister to look into the shortcomings of Kandy sports. Malik Samarawickrema now a minister has supported rugby for many years, it was he who helped Kandy SC to win the first trophy. If not for him Kandy SC will be nowhere in rugby. The Chief Minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake who was a onetime president of the Basketball Federation, and present president of Central Province Cricket is a keen follower of all sports and gives a big hand.
Shanthini Kongage gives support for Netball. What Kandy needs today is good knowledgeable administrators at District level and good coaches. The majority of coaches at present dont have the proper knowledge to develop talent that is at club level, at schools they must have MICs who know the game and keen in sports, most of them does not know the captains name.
All sportsmen and women in Kandy hope that their immediate needs be met by the present authorities in the near future.

Karadiyana bound garbage tractors turned back by angry crowds
Scores of tractors filled to the brim with garbage from Colombo on their way to the Karadiyana Waste Management Facility were turned back by angry protesters at Karadiyana yesterday as mobs stormed the tractors, crying, Stop Karadiyana from turning into another Meethotamulla and Dont ruin our city.
We have been protesting since 8am today (19), we dont want Colombos garbage here. The situation here is bad as it is, said Mahesh Wickramasinghe, a protester from Werahera.
Deepika and Samanthie, residents of Karadiyana stressed that they were fine with their own garbage from Kesbewa and Boralesgamuwa being taken to Karadiyana but would oppose any garbage from outside,
It stinks here. We have a mosquito problem, flies were everywhere and our children are often sick . We cannot even cut a vegetable without flies coming on to it. We just dont want it to become worse with garbage from Colombo being dumped here too, said Deepika.
Wickramasinghe hoped to get people from the Ratmalana area to join their protest, despite them having turned away garbage trucks from Ratmalana that very morning. The protesting residents in the area have also given very little thought to their own garbage as the protests have stopped collection in the area. Bags of garbage line the streets all the way to Karadiyana, uncollected, and increasing in size.
Rohitha Nelson from the Piliyandala Municipal Council area has been protesting against the Karadiyana garbage site since 1998, We always protest as there is no consultation here, he said disappointed that the government authorities had not consulted them before they decided to send the garbage from Colombo to their own locality.
We have no proper government policy on how to deal with this long term. Garbage can be an important resource which we can turn into fuel. But no one has come to do anything about it so far. This used to be a beautiful place before the garbage came in, said Nelson.
Police officers stationed at regular intervals on the road to the waste management facility however said they could not disperse the crowd and that they were only ensuring that there was no hindrance to traffic in the area.
The court has ordered that only 350 metric tons of garbage can be sent but there is no way for us to know how much that is. We are simply controlling traffic now, said a police officer.
By 12pm however the protesters dispersed to the temple nearby where former SLFP Mayor of Boralesgamuwa, Anura Priyashantha addressed the crowd, asking them to convene later that evening to discuss their strategy and how they would proceed in future,
If we continue to protest here, they will send in the STF and tear gas us. We will not get anywhere. We also practically cannot go on like this for long. We need a proper plan, he told the crowds gathered around him.
Since morning, a significant number of protesters had dispersed, returning home as the hours wore on.
At the Waste Management Facility, Karadiyana Waste Management Project, Project Manager, Dhanuka Wijerathna was receiving calls from around Colombo, one from Parliament ,asking why their garbage had not been collected,
Since the public petitions in court, the courts have only allowed us to collect garbage from seven local government authorities. But the CMC was able to get a magistrate court order to send garbage here. But we informed courts that we could only take 350 metric tons a day and that too only from 17-28 April. On 17 evening we started getting garbage and on 18th we received 348 metric tons, explained Wijerathna.
The facility has been turning away garbage trucks after the daily quota has been filled. Wijerathna stressed that they could only handle a total of 5000 metric tons of extra garbage with no additional harm. This is in addition to the 550 metric tons of garbage a day they receive from the areas of Dehiwela-Mt Lavinia, Moratuwa, Kesbewa, Boralesgamuwa, Kotte and Piliyandala.
We have informed the public of this. They were there when we informed the court of our requirements, he said.
With regard to the complaints of odour and pollution, Wijerathna explained; This was being used as a private landfill since the 80s. The best option would be to have a sanitary landfill site which minimizes odour, etc.. but when we took over in the 90s, that could not be done as it was already being used as an open dump site, he said.
According to Wijerathna a trained staff together with researchers from universities study and maintain the site and thus far has had no incidents of fire or landslides.
At the end of the day, this is a landfill and it will stink. We can only say that we are trying to minimize harm, he said.
As a long term solution to the garbage problem , Karadiyana will sign an agreement with Fairway Holdings within the next two weeks to start on the garbage to electricity project. They are expected to start construction in six months time and the project would take up to two years to bear fruit. As of August 2016, Karadiyana has been churning out compost of 60-80 metric tons a day, People who protest against us, also come to purchase our compost, said Wijerathna.
The seven local government authorities we handle dont have their own dump sites. They have no option but to send their garbage here,he said.

Kualar Lampur court dismisses bid to transfer Sri Lankan envoy's assault case

The prosecution's application to transfer a case involving Sri Lanka's High Commissioner from the Sepang Sessions Court to Kuala Lumpur was dismissed by the Kuala Lumpur High Court today The Star reported.
The application was reportedly made because High Commissioner Ibrahim Sahib Ansar, one of the prosecution witnesses, feared for his safety if he had to testify in Sepang.
Three men have been charged with rioting and causing injury to Ibrahim.
Justice Nordin Hassan rejected the application on the grounds that there was no valid reason to grant the request.
"Even if the court allows the application, the crowd can still come here," he said.
"If he (Ibrahim) is not happy, he can always lodge a complaint with the enforcement unit or the police or the judge at the Sepang Sessions Court," he added.
A. Kalaimughilan, 26, V. Balamurugan, 33, and V. Ragunathan, 38, claimed trial at the Sepang court last year to the alleged incident at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Sept 4, 2016.
In his affidavit, Ibrahim said he was still traumatised by the attack.
On Friday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Suhaimi Ibrahim had argued that the envoy was concerned for his safety if he had to attend the trial.
DPP Suhaimi said Ibrahim should be given a chance to appear and give evidence without fearing for his safety. Ibrahim had affirmed an affidavit to support the application.
Counsel M. Manoharan, who acted for the accused, rebutted that it would set a dangerous precedent if the court were to allow the application.
He argued that the Sepang court, like any other Malaysian court, was a secure place to hear the trial, and no evidence was adduced by the prosecution to imply otherwise.
It was reported that Ibrahim was assaulted after sending off Sri Lankan Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, who was in Malaysia for the International Conference of Asian Political Parties.

Leadership thoughts
Everything has changed except our thinking, a very rightful quote by the great Albert Einstein.
A new wave is rolling in, shaking up the old school of thought. Only a few extraordinary Leaders could hold on to take the ebbs and the tides of this changing environments and be ahead with the power of open mindedness and adaptation.
With many changes in social and cultural spheres taking place rapidly, there was concern among a few that interest and enthusiasm in the study and engagement of looking for extraordinary human faculties, would decline. Research and study in this area are evidently and surprisingly vibrant and socially salient.
We are, perhaps obsessed and blinded by a too closer look on traditional and conventional methods of Leadership and Business Management .......and shutting ourselves from possibilities of discovering new potentialities. When we are called to explore we recoil in fear that we may jeopardize our professions and reputation as Gurus of Leadership & management. We feel secure been glued to our comfort zones......been simple practical logical..... makes a great day. Our progression in leadership & management teachings is like furnishing the floor that we occupy day after day.....it looks better and better each day....but lacks the sparkle of an Innovative face-lift.
Visionary Leadership  in its real true sense is a mental creation of your intended destination for your Organization and your people. And the principles applied to realize these visions is the capability and the will of a leader and his people to build an indomitable mechanism to get there.
There are the visibilities and the invisibilities of facts and other dynamics around a given situation. The visibilities are seeing by everybody...but the invisibilities..thats probably the most crucial information thats required for adaptive decision making can only be perceived by True Visionary Leaders
Visionary Leadership is religious.....in the sense that Businesses and people are dependent on your power to foresee opportunities, that can be recognized and engaged . Your people trust in your directing, decision making,.... on your loyalty, integrity morality and real truthfulness in protecting the organization and its people from adversities in every way. Self -centered Ego-centric individuals dont make real Visionary Leaders
Visionary Leadership should be extraordinary......not only confined to been knowledgeable about leadership theories and strategies.....but having the ability to see and perceive facts and situations beyond its visible facts....been at a level of consciousness, been meta-cognitonal innovational transformational and act beyond the capacities of an ordinary mind..... possessing intelligences and abilities to demonstrate an understanding and mastery of all aspects of life body to mind soul to spirit.
There is no easy way to be a great leader.........there is no easy way to shift your intelligence and competence to a new dimension ....to new heights..... this may not be the best way to talk about great leadership.....but it is certainly the most bold and truthful way to start it.
If what you are trying to accomplish as a leader ...is by following a few simple and practical rules...and within everyones reach...you will not make a great visionary leader.
Visionary leaders sparkles and energizes their environments like a new dawn. They are bold and daring in their imaginations, and insight. They work with the power of intentionality and alignment with a higher purpose. Their eyes are on the horizon, looking at possibilities of exploring new horizons day after day. They are social innovators and change agents, seeing the big picture and thinking strategically. There is a profound interconnectedness between the leader and the whole, and true visionary leaders serve the good of the whole.
They recognize that there is some truth on both sides of most polarized issues in our society today. They search for solutions that transcend the usual adversarial approaches and address the causal level of problems. They find a higher synthesis of the best of both sides of an issue and address the systemic root causes of problems to create real breakthroughs.
True Visionary Leadership ,needs something more than knowledge and education, skills and competencies, talents or physical advantages. It requires the Will to Pioneer..Originate, and Explore ....This Greatness needs a Creator.....needs the liberty for hypothesis , for extrapolations ..in the absence of facts.
You can read listen and watch a hundred or more stories and facts that are inspirational....but just as the great Thomas Edison tells us....Genius is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.
Visionary leadership is based on a balanced expression of the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical dimensions. It requires core values, clear vision, empowering relationships, and innovative action. When one or more of these dimensions are missing, leadership cannot manifest a vision.
Visionary leadership is the ability to direct your Organization and your people into the future with foresightedness Organizational and personal consciousness and a higher level of logics and understandings about the dynamics surrounding your business environment.

Meethotamulla catastrophe trashing the trash
The longstanding issue of garbage in Colombo came to a head last week when a section of the Meethotamulla garbage mount collapsed, entombing many innocent lives. The public outrage at the political authority was palpable in the wake of Meethotamulla disaster.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, speaking to the Daily News in the aftermath of disaster, said, some solid actions are the need of the hour to tackle the garbage issue in the capital city. The minister, who also held the Environment Ministry portfolio in the previous administration, however, contended that many plans to deal with the garbage issue could not be materialized due to public protests.
Excerpts follow:
Q: People in Meethotamulla bemoan that they repeatedly told the authorities that this disaster would befall, but such calls fell on deaf ears. comment.
A: Yes, agree. They have repeatedly said that, and we have also repeatedly tried to find a solution. Then again, repeatedly, we have failed. Now, it is time to find a permanent solution once and for all. Agree beyond question.
Q:Can you give an overview of the post-disaster coordination work in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla tragedy
A: The army is still continuing search operations, and they have found 32 bodies as of Tuesday. As they say, about 8 persons are still missing. The displaced people are provided temporary shelter at Terrance de Silva College in Kolonnawa, and we are providing them with food, clothes, and other needs. Search operations in an area of about 180m x 75m were being carried out with the support of over 1,000 tri-force personnel and Police. We hope to complete the search operations in another day or two. Excavations had to be carried out deep into about 30-40 feet in some areas of the collapsed garbage mound.
At the same time, we are renovating an old paddy market board stores now. Once we complete renovations, we can send the evacuated families to that building. The Government decided that the cost of all funeral arrangements would be borne by the Government. People who have lost their houses will be given new houses through the Urban Development Authority. Part of that money will be paid by the Colombo Municipal Council, and the rest will be borne by the Government.
We also carried out a scientific analysis to find out whether there is a possibility of another landslide at the garbage dump. The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) has earmarked a dangerous zone in the vicinity of the dump and the people in that area have also been evacuated. We are also awaiting the arrival of an expert group from Japan to carry out further study.
In the meantime, the Colombo Municipal Council will not dump anymore garbage to Meethotamulla, and the ultimate aim of the Government is to clear the site. We will have to find a good alternative for the disposal of garbage collected in the Colombo city.
Q: Do you accept that this is a man-made disaster that could have been averted
A: These types of occurrences have happened elsewhere in the world too, not only in Sri Lanka. The garbage problem is related to the growth in urban population. The expansion of urban population results in more garbage. When the garbage becomes an issue, we have to find a scientific solution. Waste management problem is common to many countries, even including Panama, Mexico, America, and India, to name a few. The Colombo city and adjoining cities are rapidly expanding every year. The more the country is becoming urbanized, the more the people produce garbage. This is a non-ending process. You cannot blame anyone here.
Disaster Management MinisterAnura Priyadarshana Yapa
We shouldnt accuse each other. It has been a problem throughout despite who was/is in the ruling camp. Whenever we found a suitable place for garbage disposal, the local politicians always objected. Starting from the 1997 World Bank funded project in Meepe, in the Padukka area, hardly any plan in this regard could be materialized because of the protests. There were many problems when it comes to the construction of the sanitary landfill site in Dompe, but somehow, we managed to complete the project. Recently, when a proposal to use a land in Ekala for the purpose of garbage disposal came up, some politicians and clergy were against it. Likewise, this has been a non-ending process for the last few years.
In the aftermath of this catastrophic incident, we need to act more resolutely. It is now time for us to find a place, stick to that, start the project, and finish it off once and for all. We have to find a durable solution to the garbage problem. The possibilities for waste to energy projects are also being looked at. Shouting and berating would be of little help to solve the problem.
Q: The expert group from Peradeniya University and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) that inspected the site, pointed out that early signs of the disaster such as cracks, bad odour, vibrations, and seepage of water had appeared in the area, but not paid proper attention to. comment.
A: Actually, this tragedy occurred at a most unexpected time when all were celebrating Avurudu. Many people, including officials, had gone on holiday and others were in their houses. Everything happened within three to four hours, and we hardly got any time to do anything.
Even the residents might not have taken those changes in the environs seriously, or they might not have had enough time to pay attention to them. What happened had already happened. We have to prevent it from happening again and find a durable solution.
Q: What kind of proposals were considered to tackle the garbage problem during your stint as the Environment Minister from April, 2010 - January, 2013
A: At that time, the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) supported to start sanitary landfills. They built one in Maligawatte, Dompe, as a grant. They proposed to build another five around the city, but after I left the Ministry, there had been certain problems with regard to those places. Therefore, the initial plans have been changed and new project sites have been chosen. Four more sanitary landfills are to be constructed in Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Hikkaduwa, and Polonnaruwa.
Even at that time, we tried to find a solution for the garbage problem in Colombo. A number of proposals came up, and we tried to materialize them, but unfortunately, nobody came forward.
Q:There were contradictory statements on the compensation payment for the lives lost and properties damaged due to the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse. Has the Government decided on compensation
A: The initial announcement on compensation which said the Government will pay Rs. 100,000 for each death and up to Rs 2.5 million for property damage, is wrong. We have not yet decided the amounts of compensation as the post-disaster situation is still being assessed.
The property damages assessment started on Monday, and the President ordered it to be completed within five days. All relevant Government Agencies are working together for this purpose now.
At the next Cabinet meeting, the Meethotamulla disaster will be taken up, and probably, I will move a cabinet paper on the expenditure on that day.
In addition, the Disaster Management Committee on Meethotamulla also meets every three days to discuss the latest situation and take necessary decisions collectively.
Q:Despite the promises of compensation and new houses in the immediate aftermath of disasters, the people complain the Government is slow to deliver them. The people affected by the Aranayake landslide and Salawa Army Camp explosion which occurred mid last year are yet to receive money and/or new houses. How do you respond
A: Compensating the property damages due to Salawa explosion is nearing completion. Few more families are yet to receive compensation because they were not satisfied with the initial valuation done.
They are awaiting the final valuation report. Once it is ready, we will proceed to pay them too. All the others have been given money. Most of the damaged houses have already been repaired by the Army, and we have paid the Army for their work. In Aranayake, of course, there was a problem of finding suitable land to resettle the affected families.
However, we managed to find land in some areas, and the construction of houses has begun. In some areas, where we could not find land, we are giving money to the families to buy land and build their houses.

Meethotamulla disaster: Lessons to learn
As the government works to stabilise the Meethotamulla dump and the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) conducts studies to determine exactly how the garbage slide occurred, solid waste management experts are lamenting both, the tragedy itself and the lack of progress the country has made in fixing its ever-mounting garbage problem.
Despite various proposals for waste management solutions, little action has been taken over the years, and the result of this deadlock was last weeks disaster.
Government officials are working to formulate a permanent solution to the garbage issue, but they have not come up with a course of action as of yet.
Prof. Mahesh Jayaweera, a Civil Engineer at the University of Moratuwa, who also works with the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, noted that the authorities are looking into several options, but that nothing has been settled on as of yet.
Since garbage is no longer being deposited at Meethotamulla, authorities are sending garbage to a landfill in Dompe and an open dump in Karadiyana. These are not permanent solutions, but merely stopgap measures.
Other experts, however, contend that the Meethotamulla disaster should be a wake-up call for government officials to modernize and advance garbage disposal techniques to protect both, citizens and the environment.
Except for the landfill at Dompe, the rest of the garbage disposal sites are open dumps, or plots of land on which solid waste is dumped. This method of waste disposal is, obviously, environmentally disastrous.
When you take a piece of land and dump millions of kilograms of garbage on it, you are creating major environmental issues. Firstly, you are going to have leeching and seepage into groundwater, and secondly, rainwater that comes into contact with garbage will contaminate surface water. The runoff naturally gets into various water bodies, be they lakes or rivers, and can contaminate them, said former Director General of the Wildlife Department and a solid waste management expert Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya.
The land that the Meethotamulla open dump is situated on was a wetland from which a network of streams emanated, and officials are worried that the surface and groundwater contamination from the dump is severe. Furthermore, several houses situated near the dump draw water from wells, raising concerns about the quality of water the inhabitants drink.
Along with fouling water, dumps emit a large amount of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas closely linked to global warming. While those living around dumps must contend with the stench, methane release poses a problem for humankind.
Experts also pointed to the fact that hazardous waste routinely find their way into the dump.
We dont generally segregate hazardous waste from normal household waste, so tube lights, mercury bulbs, and batteries are being deposited in Colombos dumps, and the consequences of this are severe, said Professor Ajith de Alwis, a chemical engineer at the University of Moratuwa and a waste management expert.
Though Colombo started a waste segregation program that was meant to enhance recycling, the results so far have reportedly been mixed. Many people do not separate their plastic and glass from paper and metal, and much plastic is still ending up in the Meethotamulla dump.
Officials have called for improvements to be made to the current system, but others are calling for a complete re-imaginating and redesigning of Colombos solid waste disposal strategies.
The Way Forward
The obvious place to start when trying to limit trash output is to promote the reuse of materials that would otherwise end up in open dumps. Reuse limits the buildup of trash, but it is only one part of an integrated waste management programme.
In an integrated solid waste management project, the last point is a landfill. But before waste reaches that point, you recycle everything you possibly can, compost organic matter, and go for waste-to-energy projects, said Pilapitiya.
Indeed, many developed countries have invested heavily in waste-to-energy technologies, many of which incinerate garbage to create electricity. Sweden, for example, incinerates about 50 percent of its solid waste to generate power. Critics of the procedure, however, note that the process releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
I am personally totally against incinerating garbage, even for waste-to-energy projects. Its not the way forward, since you will spend more energy and effort trying to control the air pollution that the process produces, said de Alwis.
There are, conversely, other waste-to-energy methods that do not depend on incinerating trash, and de Alwis noted that he would support those. But for him, the best path for the country would be a system that uses waste as the raw material for manufacturing.
Some waste that comes from manufacturing processes has become quite complex, and it can be valuable. This waste should enter into a manufacturing environment and then be processed into useful materials. It then can be coupled back into the economy, said de Alwis.
He added that several developed countries are doing similar projects. Sweden, for example, uses waste to create biogas, and 50 percent of this material is used in the transport sector to power trains and buses.
Vast swaths of the economy could be transformed through waste management innovations, as the country could benefit economically from environmentally sustainable waste processing measures. It would take significant investment to commence projects like the above, but de Alwis believes it is necessary to adopt the idea.
While advanced recycling and waste-to-energy projects are the golden standard in integrated waste management, it is still necessary to invest in and build engineered sanitary landfills.
These landfills differ from open dumps in that they have liners underneath that collect toxic leakage and seepage that can then be treated and disposed of, according to Pilapitiya. Furthermore, waste is often compacted and covered with soil, if not lightly treated to remove some toxicity. Methane is funneled to vents and then burnt.
If you properly engineer and operate the landfills, the pollution potential coming out of the them is not that significant. I wouldnt say there is no pollution, since theres never zero pollution, but the pollution potential is very low, said Pilapitiya.
Landfills are not perfect solutions, but they are significantly better and safer than open dumps.
These landfills, if properly organized and maintained, can later act as resource extraction points later on, once recycling is expanded in the country, said to de Alwis.
He noted that, if you have a bunch of old tires, you could store them in a landfill and then recycle them later on.
Pilapitiya noted that engineered sanitary landfills are safe for people to live near, and he argued that the country should not bring politics into the waste management discussion.
For over two decades, Colombo has been trying to solve its garbage problem.
And successive governments have not been able to do that because there is public protest against having a landfill in their neighborhood or backyard. But putting a landfill in suburb of Colombo is not as bad as people think it is.
Waste is going to get generated, and it must be collected and disposed of. If we as public generate waste, we have a role to play in solving the problem. We have no choice whatsoever but to locate landfills for the waste in Colombo, and we should put the politics aside to solve the issue, Pilapitiya added.
De Alwis offered a similar stance, and noted that it was important that the country learn from the Meethotamulla disaster in order to better its waste management system.
Meethotamulla is a sad story, but we have to learn lessons from it. In Sri Lanka, we never learn lessons from the past. The incident was unfortunate, people paid with their lives, but that is a reason for us to look and learn lessons to ensure that they didnt die in vain, he said.

Another part of the Meethotamulla garbage dump may collapse in case of rain. The people residing at risky areas will be directed to safe locations, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said.
Addressing the media at the Disaster Management Ministry Auditorium yesterday, he said the death toll from the Meethotamulla dump site collapse had risen to 32. Eight persons were reported missing. About 1,059 persons from 246 families were affected by the garbage dump collapse, the minister said.
He said the present administration is not prepared to blame others or shy away from its responsibilities on the Meethotamulla garbage dump problem although the issue has been a long standing one under successive governments.
He said the government will provide a sustainable solution to the garbage issue.
Minister Yapa said: Terrance N. de Silva Maha Vidyalaya provides temporary shelter for the victims until the school reopens. The victims will be evacuated to the two paddy warehouses in Kolonnawa.
The minister said waste at the Meethotamulla dump site would be recycled to cease inconvenience to the people. Measures would be taken to relocate the dump site in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam, he said.
Categorising waste will be made mandatory within the Colombo city. Priority will be given to implement a proper waste disposal mechanism, the minister said.
He said financial assistance would be received from the Korean government to establish five sanitary landfills islandwide.
Techniques such as waste to energy would be adopted to find a solution to the garbage crisis, he said.
The minister said discussions would be held once every three days regarding the dump site collapse under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Modi confirms Vesak attendance
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has confirmed his participation at the 14th United Nations Day of Vesak Celebration 2017 which is to be held in Sri Lanka from May 12 to 14.
The event is scheduled to be held in Colombo and Kandy.
Indian Prime Minister Modi will take part as the Chief Guest at the first day of the event at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
Nepalese President Bidhya Devi Bhandari who also has confirmed participation at the event would be the cheif guest at the closing ceremony that would be held at the Maha Maluwa of the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy on May 14.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that participation of the top delegates have been confirmed by now by 72 countries. He added that 85 countries in which Buddhism had been practised as a religion have been invited and there is ample time for them to make their confirmation.
He also added that countries such as Thailand, China, Japan, UK, US, Australia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Russia, etc have confirmed their participation.
This is the first time that we have been able to host this international Vesak Celebration, Minister Rajapakshe said.
As far back in 1950 there had been a suggestion at the World Buddhist Forum in Sri Lanka by the late Professor Malalasekara to have a resolution before the United Nations to recognise the Vesak Day and celebrate it globally. It was passed but was presented before the United Nations in 1999 by the then Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgarmar and was adopted in 2001. Since then the event had been held 11 times in Thailand and twice in Vietnam, the Minister said.
He added that he convinced those present at the last United Nations Day of Vesak Celebrations in 2016 that Sri Lanka had been able to preserve the teachings of the Buddha in Sri Lanka.
If not for the efforts of Sri Lankan Buddhist Monks in preserving The Buddhas teachings-the Thriptaka Canons at the Matale Aluviharaya, the present day Lankans would not know what the buddhism is, Rajapakshe asserted.
Mahayana Buddhism had translated those Pali Thripitaka of Sri Lankan Buddhists into Sanskrit, he added.
The Minister also said that the theme of this years Celebration is Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace.
He added that this International celebration will be organised under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

It knocked Kendall Jenner's image of her lying down with her hair made into heart formations off the top spot, which got a respectable 3.7 million likes.
Now there's a new image whipping up a storm of approval and admiration.
While it's not quite in the same league as Beyonc's and Kendall's offerings, it's still pretty impressive.
When Indonesian bride, Intan Azzahra married Zendhy Zaen, her dress apparently became the "most liked wedding dress on Instagram of all time" according to Allure .
You need a big dress to live up to such a bold claim, but we think Intan's gown lives up to the hype. The dress is long-sleeve ivory and pink with a sweetheart neckline over a sheer bodice decorated with thousands of pearls. The pearls and lustrous beads gather into scallops, continuing down to a ballgown skirt complete with train. The incredible creation was the handiwork of designer Ivan Gunawan and was a big factor in the wedding being liked over 167,000 times.The whole wedding had a definite 'Disney fairytale' feel about it, with the groom looking smart in a Prince Charming diamond-encrusted uniform and pink sash.
That's not where the haute couture ended though. For the reception, Intan changed into a custom Hengki Kawilarang gown in bright crimson, which somehow managed to be even more elaborate than her wedding dress.

Muralitharan to be inducted during ICC Champions Trophy
Spin legend first Sri Lankan in ICC Hall of Fame:
Former off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan who becomes the first Sri Lankan to be voted into the ICC Hall of Fame will be formally inducted during the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
It gives us immense sense of pride that Murali is receiving this highest honour. We are proud of him and the glory he has brought to cricket in Sri Lanka. His illustrious career demonstrates that he belongs to this highly prestigious group, said CEO Sri Lanka Cricket Ashley de Silva.
The CEO elaborating further on the induction noted that Muralitharan was offered the choice of being inducted during the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka, the India tour or the ICC Champions Trophy. He opted for the Champions Trophy which is to be held in England and Wales in June this year.
Accordingly he will be inducted during Sri Lankas second match, which is against India at the Oval. Muralitharan will be joined by former Australia captain Karen Rolton, Arthur Morris of Don Bradman's 'Invincibles' and George Lohmann, the 19th century fast bowler who took 100 wickets in just 16 Tests.
They will be presented with commemorative caps honouring their contribution to the game, with family members representing Lohmann and Morris at the presentations.
ICC chief executive David Richardson congratulated the four, saying: "The ICC Cricket Hall of Fame recognises some of the truly great players from cricket's long and illustrious history, and this year's inductees thoroughly deserve to be in this highly prestigious group. Muralitharan has been one of the greats of the modern era. His guile and consistency over the years helped Sri Lanka develop as a very competitive side in both Tests and ODI cricket.
Muralitharan, whose last international fixture was the World Cup final in 2011, finished his career with 800 wickets in Tests, 534 in ODIs and 13 wickets in 12 T20Is. He was also a big part in Sri Lanka's ODI successes from 1993 to 2011 and was a member of the squads that won the World Cup in 1996 and shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with India.

NBRO warns: come next rains, more trash slides
Meethotamulla garbage mountain collapse:
Come next rains there will be more garbage landslides around 91-meter-high Meethotamulla mountain of trash in Kolonnawa, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) cautioned yesterday.
Even a minor flood can trigger a massive damage to lives and property in the region because of clogged drains, said NBRO Landslides Research and Disaster Management Director R.M.S.Bandara.
The collapse of the Meethotamulla rubbish mountain last Friday has killed at least three dozen lives and buried 145 houses. The official death toll stood at 32 at the time this story went to press.
The region has been marked as disaster prone with tones of garbage still threatening to devour lives and property at its foot.
NBRO director Bandara said they identified two zones vulnerable to garbage landlslides in the Meethoptamulla region.
We have identified the vulnerable zones and marked them with posts, he said.
We marked the zones with the help of satellite images. We have submitted a report of the same to the Disaster Management Minister, he said.
There are about 169 houses which are vulnerable to garbage landslides should rains hit the region as with blocked drains, he said.
The clogged drains are presently being cleared by divisional authorities. The Army has been of great help in the clearance work, he said.
The number of houses vulnerable to garbage landslides around the garbage dump could be more in the ground. We have identified houses in the vulnerable zones based on our satellite images, he said.
Asked if they have any idea about damages on property caused by the disaster, Bandara said it is being studied by the Valuation Department.
Asked in what way their satellite image-based paper on the vulnerable zone could serve, he said, it will serve as a paper for the determination of carrying out necessary evacuation measures.

Nearly 20,000 graduates to the public service this year
Steps will be taken to absorb around 20,000 graduates to the public service this year, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
According to rough estimates, it has been identified that there are around 20,000 vacancies available at the public service by now, he said. However, a systematic survey is being carried out at institutional level to calculate the actual number of vacancies in each State institution.
All vacancies identified in the survey will be filled this year. The approval and consent of the President and Prime Minister are sought for this programme, the minister added.
Parallel to the graduate recruitment programme, a graduate recruitment structure will also be implemented. The structure will give priority to the most suitable and capable graduates to enter the public service, he said. The minister noted that unlike in earlier occasions of graduate recruitment, shortcomings will be minimized.
Secretary of Nidahas Upadidari Sangamaya of Sri Lanka Freedom Party Manula Perera, there are around 46,000 unemployed graduates, who obtained degrees after March 31, 2012. He added that 50,000 graduates each were recruited to the public service on two occasions in 2004 and 2012.

New houses for Meethotamulla affected by May, June: PM
Steps are underway to provide new houses to the people affected by the Meethotamulla Garbage dump tragedy by May, June and July this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The houses to be allotted to them have already been identified in association with the UDA. Until then the affected people would be provided temporary accommodation and all other required facilities.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said this when he visited the Rahula Vidyalaya premises in Meethotamulla to look into the welfare of the affected people yesterday morning.
The Prime Minister who said that valuation was now underway to assess the damage caused by this tragedy said he hoped to obtain the final valuation report by Friday. The Prime Minister who emphasised the need for all institutions to join hands and make a collective endeavour towards the relief effort added that two teams would arrive from Japan and the World Bank to assist the process.
The people present on the occasion briefed the Prime Minister about their problems and the PM said all affected families would be provided with alternative houses and those who opted to find homes on their own would be given a special allowance.
He said until then they would be provided temporary accommodation in a PMB building. The Premier said there was a possibility to provide houses from the Angulana area. The government had taken necessary measures to provide all infrastructure facilities to the affected people until they are given new houses.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake and IGP Pujith Jayasundera were also present.

No.1 coal power generation machine breaks down for 37th time: Minister
Norochcholai Coal Power Plan:
The frequent number of failures at the number one coal power generation machine of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is something that cannot be accepted, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He added that coal power generation machine baring number one, has broken down on 37 occasions due to various technical reasons since the installation.
This situation cannot be considered as normal, he said.
However he noted that this is the first ever coal power generation machine installed in the country and therefore, there is a room for having several shortcomings due to the lack of experience in the coal power generation.
He added that this particular machine, which has broken down again for the 37th time, will be back in operation within next two days. Besides,the number three coal power generation machine, which is being serviced at present is expected to be back in operation today. This machine was shut down during the New Year period for servicing purposes,the Minister said.

Photographic exhibition marking Australia - Sri Lanka relations
A free photographic exhibition showcasing the history of cooperation between Sri Lanka and Australia will be held from April 21 to 23 at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, Colombo. The exhibition marks 70 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
The exhibition was launched by the Australian Minister for International Development and the Pacific Fierravanti-Wells.
Its a chance to learn about the history of our development partnership and the amazing Sri Lankan men and women that we have worked with, as Sri Lanka has changed and grown. Many of our new development programs are focused on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more quality jobs for all Sri Lankans, said Minister Fierravanti-Wells.
Some of the newest partnerships are featured in the exhibition such as the project that provides economic opportunities for war widows in Vavuniya, a release from the Australian High Commission stated.
There are now over 200 women growing export grade papaya in their home gardens, which they pack in a processing factory they own before shipping to Dubai.
Other photographs highlight the Australia-Sri Lanka partnership through sport, education, infrastructure, de-mining and agriculture, the release added.
Over the last 70 years, Australia and Sri Lanka have built a strong friendship across many fields. Australia has been a consistent and reliable partner in support of Sri Lankas development. From sending relief supplies during the floods of the 1950s to, recovery from the tsunami and conflict, and recent investments in public education that have touched the lives of thousands of students, Australia has been a key partner in Sri Lankas development, the release stated.

Piling machines take centrestage at Capitol Twin Peaks
The construction of Capitol Twin Peaks, the 470 apartment twin tower project developed by Capitol Developers Limited at 24, Staple Street, Colombo 2 is progressing rapidly.
Within a short period since its ground-breaking ceremony on November 12, 2016, progress has been achieved at the project site. Capitol Developers has presently deployed five piling machines to accelerate construction to meet scheduled completion dates of the project by 2020.
One of these pilling machines,the Bauer BG 30, is the largest piling machine of its kind in Sri Lanka. Deploying this piling machine and four others at one project site is a rare occurrence, as it requires advanced technical skill and a strong investment commitment from the developer.
Capitol Developer's ability to make this happen is directly related to the fact that it is part of the Sanken Group and that the group company Sanken Construction is the design and build partner for Capitol TwinPeaks. Having 360-degree access for all its project needs in-house ensures that Capitol developers does not have to outsource functions such as piling work, thereby maintaining full control over every aspect of the construction.
These strong group synergies lend the Capitol Developers and the Capitol TwinPeaks project a unique advantage which it will leverage on to make this project the most coveted real estate marvel in the city.
On time and in full delivery is important to Capitol Developers, Sanken Construction and the Sanken Group as evidenced by the success of their previous projects. As creators of most of Colombo's skyline, timeliness and maintaining their credibility are top priorities that customers of Capitol TwinPeaks can expect.
Capitol Developers,a member of the Sanken Group has completed Capitol Residencies, HR Residencies, Tulasi Mahal Apartments in Jaffna; the business city hotel, Cinnamon Red, Capitol 7 on Rosmead Place and Capitol Elite on Horton Place.
Sanken Construction has delivered Trillium Residencies, Empire City, Emperor, OnThree20, 7th sense on Gregory's Road and many other high-rises in the city.

Political reasons fuelling India-Lanka fisheries tiff: Scientist
Politics, rather than science, is playing an important role in marine fisheries governance especially in South Asian countries, said Maarten Bavinck, a Dutch scientist, whose research projects include providing space for small scale fishers of India and Sri Lanka.
The dispute between India and Sri Lanka over the fishing activities in the Palk Bay remain unsolved mainly due to political reasons, he said while delivering a lecture on Tropical Marine Fisheries Governance: The Way Forward, organised by the Marine Biological Association of India (MBAI) at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Tuesday.
Bavinck, a professor at the University of Amsterdam in Netherlands said the Tamil Nadu Government should initiate steps to reduce its fishing fleets in the Palk Bay to resolve the conflict in the region.
Trawling needs to be contained in the Palk Bay, where fishing activities across the international boundary line have been causing social and economic hardship for around 25,000 small scale fishermen and their families in Northern Sri Lanka. This has led to political tensions between the neighbours, he said.
Interacting with the CMFRI scientists, Bavinck said science-based guidelines are needed to ease the tension in the region. For this, Indias CMFRI and Sri Lankas National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) should conduct joint studies and make coordinated efforts to find a science-based solution, he said.
The Dutch scientist said solid ecological and marine biological studies were required to estimate the damage caused to the rich resources in the Palk Bay due to intensive trawling.
Fisheries administrators should prioritise employment and the distribution of income among the fishing community as the sector is an important livelihood option in India.
According to him, the number of fishermen is still growing in India because they are unable to find alternative employment.
Economic development in India is centred around the cities and the IT sector, he said.
With marine resources largely concentrated on the continental shelf, there is no reason to go for larger scale operations in the country, said Bavinck. Indian Express

President announces speedy solutions to SAITM and Meetotamulla issues

President Maithripala Sirisena said that the controversial private medical college, South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue will be solved by broad-basing its management, which is now a single ownership and open it to the stock market by listing it with the Securities Exchange Commission.
He said the medical college will be governed by a council of professional administrators.
Addressing the editors and media heads at the Presidents House in Colombo today (April 20), he said that the government has taken this decision after a series of discussions with all the parties concerned, including SAITM management, GMOA, education authorities, medical students, medical doctors associations, SAITM students and their parents.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said once a proper guidelines have been establish to administer SAITM, it would also be applicable to two other private medical colleges proposed to be set up by the Monash University in Australia and Manipal University in India.
The President pointed out that 75,000 to 85,000 Sri Lankan students go abroad annually for higher education and if there are private institutions in Sri Lanka, it would be a great relief to them as the cost would be much less.
Referring to the tragic landslide at the Meetotamulla garbage site, the President said within two days 98 houses will be given to the families whose houses were completely destroyed.
Along with this speedy programme, the steps would be taken to resettle all the families evacuated from the area.
The garbage dump will be gradually removed from the area by utilizing garbage for power generation, production of organic fertilizer or for land fill, without affecting the environment or the residents in any place, he assured.
The President also announced that it was decided to provide Rs.250,000 to each of the familiesto purchase furniture for their houses.
The Army and the Engineering Unit of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) will take steps to move the Meetotamulla garbage dump systematically within nine months.
Furthermore, the Valuation Department and other relevant agencies have been instructed to conclude the damage assessment from the disaster during this week and hand over a damage assessment report. All funds for compensation will be released immediately after this is completed.
The President announced that a retired judge will be appointed to investigate those responsible for the garbage dump issue and report within one month.
President Sirisena assured media heads that the country is heading positively towards economic stability.He added that the countrys foreign reserves have already exceeded $5 billion and expected to improve further in the coming months.
He said that the international market prices of tea, rubber and coconut have increased, thus there is a positive trend in foreign exchange earnings from these traditional exports.
The economy is very sound and there is no possibility at all about an economic collapse, he said with confidence.
The President said that there will be changes in the government activities within the next two weeks, including changes in heads of state institutions. Asked if there is a cabinet reshuffle and changes of heads of state institutions, he replied that everybody would be able to see the changes before Vesak (May 13-14).
Replying to a question on the proposed new constitution, the President said the first rough draft would be presented by the Constitutional Committee within 2 or 3 weeks and thereafter it would be studied before the final draft could be prepared.

Ranjan Madugalle -an Intl legend
He created an unique record as player and international administrator in cricket. Deeply respected in all cricket fora. He is the former Royal College, Nondescripts Cricket Club and Sri Lanka captain. And to cap it all he is ICCs Chief of Match Referees, And he is that batsman DESHABANDU SENERATH RANJAN MADUGALLE who has done Sri Lanka proud. MADUGALLE had his early education at Trinity College, Kandy before coming down to Colombo and joining Royal College, where he laid the foundation for stardom, by not only excelling in studies, but turning out to be an excellent captain, brilliant right hand batsman in the classical mould. He was also a tantalizing off spin bowler. But for reasons best known to him he quit bowling and concentrated only on batting. He represented his school and had the distinction of captaining the school in the famous 100th Battle of the Blues against S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia which would have been one of his cricketing dreams.
A batsman of the highest class
On leaving school he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where he scored an avalanche of runs. National honours were not long in coming. He made his international debut in the inaugural Test match against England at the Colombo Oval in 1982 and had a memorable beginning by knocking up a half century 65 to be exact. But unfortunately Sri Lanka had to swallow the bitter pill of defeat due to poor batting, unable to counter the tantalizing spin of offie John Emburey.
In that Test MADUGALLE countered the pace of Ian Botham, Bob Willis and Paul Allot and the spin of Derek Underwood and Emburey in style, with good footwork, and great timing. It was a wonderful debut and the connoisseurs watching him bat predicted a great future for the young man.
However MADUGALLEs most unforgettable game would have been playing in the countrys Test team that recorded its first ever Test victory against India in the Second Test played at the historic Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium from September 6 to 10, 1985 by 149 runs. He made stylish 54 in the first innings and did not bat in the second innings.
The scores were  Sri Lanka 385 and 206 for 3 dec. India 244 and 198. That historic Sri Lanka team was captained by Duleep Mendis and India by Kapil Dev. That unique SRI LANKA team needs mentioning.  Sidath Wettimuny, Amal Silva, Ranjan Madugalle, Roy Dias, Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Asantha de Mel, Rumesh Ratnayake, Sanjeewa Weerasighe and Saliya Ahangama.
INDIA  Lal Rajput, Kris Srikanth, Mohomed Azharuddin, Dilip Vengaskar, Lakshman Sivaramakrishnan, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amaranth, Ravi Shastri, Kapil Dev, Sadanand Vishwanath and Chetan Sharma  umpires S. Ponnaduri and S. Vithanagamage.
It was nice to see and hear Ravi Shastri, Sunil Gavaskar and Sivaramakrishnan the threesome of that Indian team that lost to Sri Lanka doing TV commentary in the recently concluded Test series between India and Australia in India won 2-1 by India.
President J.R. Jayewardene who was himself a cricketer and who was soaking in the action declared a national holiday to mark the historic occasion. President of the Cricket Board was Gamini Dissanayake and the man who fashioned it all was former Sri Lanka off spinning all rounder Abu Fuard who was also known as the power behind the throne.
After this success MADUGALLE went on to captain Sri Lanka in Two Test matches and 13 one-day internationals. He played in 21 Tests scoring 1029 runs with one century and 7 fifties and in the 63 ODIs scored 950 runs with 3 half centuries. He also played in the 1979 World Cup in England.
MADUGALLE was a batsman of the highest class. He would not bash the ball but caress it to whatever nook and corner on the field or over it with good footwork, sweet timing and always by providing the full face of the bat to the ball. The ugly looking horizontal or the reverse sweep was not in his repertoire.
That he gave up the game at the early age of 29 was inexplicable. That is the age when batsmen reach the pinnacle in their career. His early quitting was a loss to the game, but it was the gain of the International Cricket Conference who embraced him as a match referee when he was nominated by the local board.
The merciless killing
That was the stepping stone to this easy going and like able guy who performed his job to the best of his ability which impressed the ICC. It was not long when the establishment appointed him chief of match referees over many other contestants.
In this responsible job he has had a good rapport with captains and players because he handled them with honesty and was easy going. They respected him and today he holds the record of having officiated in over 300 Test matches and 300 One day Internationals. A legendary achievement.
Incidentally Ranjans father Lionel was the secretary to arguably the best Sports Minister the country had K.B.Ratnayake. Together they formed a powerful two man team and steered sport in the country to great heights. That was the time when there was a lot of infighting in sports bodies on trivial matters.
Lionel who fronted up a straight bat, like his son did, together with KBR used their sporting backgrounds which came in handy, to solve all problems to the satisfaction of all and also for the betterment of the game. They were indeed a fine pair and were always available to the media and cultivated good rapport.
Lionel was par excellence in his job and can arguably be said that he too was one if not the best secretary that the Ministry of Sports was fortunate to have at that time. Secretaries of Lionels caliber will not come and will not be easy to find. He ruled and advised KBR on sports matters with no fear or favour. That was the era when there were two stormy petrels in cricket Abu Fuard and J.S.N. Anandaraja in football.
Lionel used to tell me that the two were headaches. But he had the soothing balm to cure those headaches and sport was tickety boo. All sportsmen and women admired the good work done by Lionel and KBR. Lionel also served under Vincent Perera who was one time Minister of Sport.
I am eternally indebted to Lionel for making my first ever tour abroad possible to the Munich Olympics in 1972 and it was an unforgettable one because that was the Games where the merciless killing of some Israeli athletes took place by a terror group calling itself Black September.
Lionel served as chairman in the committee appointed by me when I was Sports Editor of the Times of Ceylon
in the 1970s and 80s to select the Schoolboy cricketer of the year and other award winners and together with the other members of that committee made their picks strictly on merit and there was no query in or challenging from any quarter about the selections.
Lionel is still batting and we wish him many more happy years at the crease. His son RANJAN is no doubt a LEGEND.
Wijesinha passes away
it is with great sadness that i pen these few lines on the passing away of R.B. Wijesinha, my cricketing guru who i featured in my previous column SPORTS LEGENDS captioned - Wjesinha - legend of legends-.
A few days after my previous column appeared, my team mate at SBC Ranjit Fernando informed me that Wijesinha who had been admitted to Sri Jayewardene Hospital after falling ill and he was lingering. The perennial hymn - Why should we linger when Jesus is calling - would have been on his lips when the call came from his creator.
Indeed as in the sport he loved so much, he responded to the call of the Eternal Umpire, whos ruling we all need to respond with a clear conscience as Wijesinha did, thankful that he was allowed to grace our midst for his near 97 years ,three short of the century.
May the turf that he strode like a colossus with great love, respect and success lie softly on him.

Rebuilding a divided nation
An open letter to (former) President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga:
 The next round of democratic, political and economic reforms mandatory:
 President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Chairperson Office of National Unity and Reconciliation Office of the Former President Colombo.
Dear Madam,
Fulfilling the promise of a new Sri Lanka
I thought I must write to you regarding the current political situation, as the government deals with the unenviable task of rebuilding and stabilizing an economy dragged down by the predecessor Rajapaksa Administration through a combination of corruption, mismanagement, declining government revenue and excessively large doses of external debt utilized on mostly white elephant projects of dubious utility value, including the failed Mihin Lanka, the worlds most expensive express ways per kilo meter, an unused airport in the middle of nowhere and a grossly underutilized port.
The mandates of 2015 My reason to address this letter to you is due to the fact, that a little over two years ago, you were instrumental in doing what was then thought to be impossible, that of uniting a divided and fractious opposition into a common political front, the rainbow coalition that brought President Sirisena to power on a promise of good governance and state reforms. At that time, the Rajapaksa Administration was deeply entrenched in power and many political analysts, especially those aligned with the Rajapaksas dismissed the possibility of good governance and democratic reforms as a mass mobilizing factor. However, the elections of January and indeed August 2015, was to prove otherwise. It should be a cause of some satisfaction that a majority of Sri Lankans opted for a democratic and compassionate (inclusive, tolerant and pluralistic) state, rather than a populist and authoritarian one. It is in that context rather puzzling how some in the Joint Opposition claim rather disingenuously that there was no mandate for a national government, when it is clear that there are twin mandates of January and August 2015 concurrently in force and that both of these are for a politically united approach to state reforms, both economic and political. It is imperative that these reforms be implemented in the interest of a new Sri Lanka, which moves away from the social conflict and economic malaise from which we have suffered for much of our recent history.
A disunited Rajapaksa Joint Opposition It is a matter of some regret, that the Joint Opposition backing defeated President Rajapaksa seems intent on obstructing every single attempt at reform, from economic reforms, reconciliation and the constitutional reform process. However, it should be noted that the same fault lines which brought an unexpected and unlamented early end to the Rajapaksa Administration, still continue to persist and encircle the Rajapaksa come back project. First among them is the raging internal debate as to which Rajapaksa, should succeed Mahinda, Basil, Gotabhaya or even the young man in a hurry, Namal, poor Chamal and Sashindra, not really ever either aspirants or contenders for being brother number one (pun entirely unintended). It is eminently clear from the close supporters of both Gotabhaya and Basil that neither is willing to play second fiddle to the other, in the event of next time around. Sri Lankas tortured pre-colonial monarchial history is dominated by royal families which lost power due to an inability to sort out internally and within themselves their succession battles and one observes that the attempted Rajapaksa dynasty suffers from the same fatal flaw.
This internal familial contest for power also extends to political tactics and approaches, where Basil Rajapaksa has adopted a decidedly confrontational approach, launching a new political party, trying to organize rallies, protest marches and public shows of political muscle while the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa approach is decidedly different, using interlocutors and intermediaries to try and bring about a political alliance between the defeated Rajapaksas and the incumbent Sirisena presidency, rather incredibly to try and overturn the peoples mandate through a political alliance, the logic and rationale for which has never quite been made clear or politically articulated.
A premature focus on 2020 Dear Madam, you hold the respected post of SLFP Patron and unlike the SLFPs other former president, retired from office gracefully due to democratic term limits and with plenty of political capital at your disposal, which was on rather evident and public display in the formation and victory of the Yahapalanaya administration in 2015. With the honeymoon period of the government decidedly now over, the hard work of the mid-term period beckons. In that context, it is crucial that the SLFP as the party founded and led in the past by your late esteemed father and mother and indeed by you, now under the leadership of President Sirisena, effectively contributes to implementing the much needs reforms, including the reconciliation process, entrusted to your leadership.
It was renowned political scientist John Paul Lederach, who wrote and articulated the concept of the moral imagination, the ability of political actors and formations, to see positive possibilities, opportunities and outcomes through change and reform. I am a little concerned that some leading lights of the SLFP, who mostly backed the wrong horse in January 2015, are failing to seize this historic window of opportunity for Sri Lanka to effect reforms which will ensure that the Sri Lankan state reflects the full diversity of our society. That we eliminate what LTTE suicide bombing victim late Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam so succinctly described as the anomaly of having imposed a mono ethnic state on a multi ethnic polity. Some sections of the SLFP going by their public statements, seem already quite focused on the next elections due in 2020. In the alternate I would respectfully submit that it is more important, at least to the sovereign people of Sri Lanka, what is actually delivered and achieved from 2015 to 2020, rather than the contours of the next election due only about three years hence.
The Rajapaksa regime was ended because a section of the SLFP and the UNP together with others came together. They must now work together. JHU leader and articulate Rajapaksa critic, Minister Champika Ranawaka recently made an interesting observation, that the SLFP and the UNP can contest separately but then govern together, in a nation building exercise. JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the context of the SAITM debate stated that toppling a government was no option, when there is no viable, attractive or acceptable alternative. The best response to political extremists in both the North and the South, is for the National Unity administration to work together to deliver the next round of the democratic, political and economic reforms which the people mandated two years ago.
Yours sincerely, Harim Peiris

Renew your vows in front of cats
A California couple celebrated 15 years of marriage by renewing their vows while surrounded by their favorite animals: cats.
Jay and Charity Jones chose to renew their vows at The Cat House on the Kings, a cage-free cat sanctuary and adoption center in Parlier.
Video from the ceremony, which was officiated by sanctuary owner Lynea Lattanzio, shows the couple reaffirming their marriage while dozens of felines act as witnesses.
The couple said they decided after getting married in 2002 that they wouldn't have children, choosing instead to devote their lives to rescuing cats.Lattanzio said the ceremony was the first-ever vow renewal at the shelter, but it previously played host to a wedding for two cat lovers last year.

RIGHT OF REPLY: Post thoughts on 1977-2017: A Political Revue
I refer to the above article written by Sarath de Alwis and published on your newspaper on its issue of 18.4.17. In his article, the author refers to the book, Ranil Wickremesinghe - A Political Biography, which was published recently.
He claims that the books reference (without giving the source) that J.R. Jayewardene was denied the premiership after D.S. Senanayakes death in 1952 was fiction and also, what the book said, that S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was elected to power on the Sinhala-Buddhist race card, too was just fiction.
De Alwis said that after D.S. death the premiership should have gone to Sir John Kotalawala, the Leader of the House at that time. On the basis of de Alwis argument, then, on September 26, 1959, after S.W.R.D. was fatally shot, the premiership should have had gone to C.P. de Silva, the then Leader of the House. But that didnt happen. Instead, the premiership was given to W. Dahanayake.
De Alwis said that the books reference to S.W.R.D. playing the race card and thereby winning the 1956 parliamentary polls was also false. But one of S.W.R.D.s clarion calls to woo at least the majoritarian Sinhala voter, if not the majoritarian Sinhala-Buddhist voter, was to make Sinhala the official language of the country within 24 hours if elected to power. A promise which he kept, no sooner he was elected to power in 1956.
On de Alwis claim that J.R., once he assumed power made Ranil a deputy minister because he owed his father Esmond a favour, sources close to J.R. said that Esmond had approached J.R.to discuss possible candidates for the 1977 election, which poll subsequently saw J.R. being swept into power. J.R. refused a specific request from Esmond, but said that he would instead give nominations to his son Ranil who was by then actively involved in the U.N.P. LawyersAssociation.
De Alwis also says that Ranil deserves a more balanced biography, despite he himself, making several contradictory statements in the article. The book was totally a private project of Dineshs who has worked with Ranil for over 25 years and was not an attempt to boost the image of Ranil, but rather to pay a tribute to a senior political leader who still remains an enigma to those who do not know him well and the sole purpose of the book was to bring out his unseen side through a personal account. Therefore, de Alwis comments are typical of an ostrich who has buried his head in the sand.
To correct possible misconceptions that may arise in the minds of your readers after reading the above, I shall therefore thank you to also consider giving adequate publicity to this letter of mine on the pages of your newspaper.

## Title: Roads in Sri Lanka deadlier by the year

## Date: Thursday, April 20, 2017 - 01:00
Roads in Sri Lanka deadlier by the year
Statistics reveal 3,003 road deaths last year - A road death every three hours:
Statistics compiled by the Police reveal that our roads are becoming deadlier by the year. Last year road deaths reached a startling total of 3,003, when compared to 2,816 deaths in the previous year. The year 2014 reported a death toll of 2,440. During the last decade or so there has been a tremendous increase in mobility and motorisation in the country. This scenario has also brought about a rapid influx of unsafe modes of travel on to our roads along with heavy pedestrian movements. Consequently we pay the price for our steadily increasing mobility, for not everyone who sets out on these daily trips return home again or safely.
For every person who dies, several thousands are injured and some with permanent injuries for life. The socio economic cost to the nation according to sources from the Moratuwa University is approximately in the range of Rs.25 billion. It is therefore imperative that the State gives a very high priority for safer roads by introducing a comprehensive traffic & transport policy to reduce the risks of road accidents drastically, or else we will be moving towards a fearful future on our highways and byways with road congestion also costing the country a whopping Rs. 30 to 35 billion.
The invention of the motor car initially referred to by many in the 1890s as a Horseless Carriage changed the pattern of road travel dramatically. The dangers faced by road travellers in the years gone by were from external sources like attacks by predatory beasts or bandits en-route on a journey. The road user had to be constantly vigilant scanning the surrounding trees and hills and be prepared or anticipate attacks from beasts or bandits who could attack or way lay them en-route. This situation has radically and dramatically changed with the modern means of road travel. Today the greatest danger to life and limb of a road user is posed or created by the road users themselves or by the road features itself. Today the mortal danger on roads is by motor vehicles rushing at speed in opposite and in the same direction to get to their destination and in the melee we find pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists desperately moving their way through with varying success and sometimes with tragic consequences. Compared to road deaths in the pre 1970s, the risk of road deaths on our roads has presently trebled. There is a dire need for road authorities and the State to bring about an overall improvement to the network of roads with added safety features and minimising conflicts among users, and this to be backed-up with greater road discipline and tougher law enforcement.
Since lack of safety features on our road network is to a greater extent attributed to a man-made engineering outcome, then there is nothing intrinsically inevitable about it. The road authorities, planners and engineers need to redesign and re-structure the road system to reduce the probability of risks in accidents drastically by eliminating or minimising some of the existing conflicts on roads. Can we reach this beautiful vision, at what costs and will it succeed Perhaps we should move away from a traditional road safety approach and adopt more dynamic innovative policies and strategies with state intervention to target 50 percent lesser fatalities and 40 percent fewer hospital admissions.
It is imperative at least at this late stage for the state and relevant road authorities to step in and introduce a much safer road traffic system by implementing a new policy vision for a systematic reduction of road hazards and conflicts on our roads.
To a great extent these fearful consequences also could be attributed to the phenomenal increase in the number and variety of motor vehicles of each and every description moving on our roads. The existing road scenario has made our road network to be congested and unsafe. This is the inevitable result of rapid urbanisation, enhanced vehicle ownership for business and personal travel with increased incomes and opportunities, shift from safer modes of travel perhaps more due to inadequacies in public transport and the availability of a variety of speedier modes of travel have all complicated and compounded to the hazardous road scene.
Another foremost underlying factor is the awful lack of road discipline and respect for road rules and consideration for others.
This to a considerable extent could be attributed to the absence of a systematic law enforcement policy at national and regional level backed by high-tech traffic management solutions. Effective law enforcement strategies had been made ineffective in recent years to an extent with the available man power of the traffic police being fully utilised to regulate traffic at intersections and at critical locations in areas to meet peak hour conflicts and demands. This has hindered and hampered the primary duty of law enforcement and the prosecution of offenders. More dynamic enforcement strategies should be the order of the day with the police engaging unmarked police vehicles and plain clothes police observers at critical locations to apprehend errant drivers. Such measurers should be backed by Hi-Tech Enforcement solutions and linked to deterrent penalties.
Class of road users killedMotor cyclists - most vulnerable:
Riders of motor cycles and pillion riders comprise the largest segment killed in road deaths. Similar trends are observed in the Asian Pacific region as well. Last year motor cyclists accounted for 1,157 deaths, which is approximately 38 percent of road deaths in the country. This trend of motor cyclists remaining at high altitude in fatalities had been the norm in the last decade or so for obvious reasons. Firstly, the motor cycle category forms the largest fleet of registered vehicles in the country (3,699,630). Their growing popularity is probably due to its affordability, glamour and elegance of the machine. Motor cyclists will continue to be vulnerable since the machine provides no body protection in a collision and is often exposed to serious body or head injury in a crash. Another inherent danger is that motor cyclists are generally not conspicuous both by day and night to other users of the road. Use of headlights or wearing reflective jackets by day could enhance their safety to an extent.
Motor cyclists are faced with other inherent dangers such as wearing sub-standard crash helmets, not wearing them securely and using helmets which are beyond the usage period. Inadequacies in training and testing standards for their competency are also factors to reckon with. Their turning and overtaking manoeuvres are most unpredictable, incomprehensible and unconventional, thus placing other users at great risk. It is timely that leading insurers, dealers of motor cycles and companies employing staff riding motor cycles conduct re-training classes as a corporate responsibility.
The next vulnerable category of road users are pedestrians with 877 deaths. In 2015 the death toll was 803 and the year before 728 were victims of road fatalities. Since the 1950s to 2005 pedestrians remained the most vulnerable category in road fatalities. Whilst pedestrian road behaviour remains very much the same, the rapid usage of motorcycles and mopeds in the last decade has lowered them in the risk category.
Three wheelers form the next dangerous category causing 405 deaths. A year before, their involvement in road deaths remained at 378 in 328 fatalities and in the year 2014 they accounted for 274 deaths. Since this category now form a large segment of motorised vehicle fleet (1,115987). A greater emphasis to curb their road behaviour should receive top priority by those responsible for enforcement and regulating them. Their road behaviour is most incomprehensible. Authorities should introduce and enforce rigid regulations to curb their happy go lucky and risky driving manoeuvres which endangers all road users besides those travelling in them. Safety aspects of three wheelers should also receive the attention of the authorities, a specific colour code for three wheelers should also be looked at. Similar laws prevailing in New Delhi on trishaws including a ban on hailing for trishaws should be enforced in Colombo and in other capital cities. Picking passengers should be confined to trishaw stands only or to a pick up destination of the passenger. A proper dress code to drivers of trishaws is also considered most appropriate and timely to upgrade their status.
In the Western province you are more at risk
The Western Province leads in road deaths with 804 deaths and could be classified as the most vulnerable province for road travel. This is inevitable since this region has the highest population being the hub of commercial activity, as well as having the largest vehicle fleet of every description circulating on a daily basis. Furthermore, most of the A Class road traverse through this region take a heavy load of commuter and commercial traffic. The Nugegoda Police Division recorded the highest number killed with 146 deaths, Gampaha Division recorded 139 and Kelaniya Division 137 deaths.
North Western Province which covers the Police Divisions of Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya, Nikaweratiya, Puttalam and Chilaw altogether recorded 488 road deaths. This region has a large fleet of commercial vehicles, motor cycles and three wheelers compared to other regions. Besides, most through traffic to other provinces traverse through the roads in this province, hence this could be a contributory factor. Roads in this region needs special focus of the police and the road authorities by way of enhanced enforcement measures and a more comprehensive road engineering improvements and modifications to enhance safety.
The Southern Province recorded 421 deaths while most of them were reported on the A 2 Road. This province also has a sizeable number of motor cycles, three wheelers and commercial vehicles which has a bearing on high fatality rate in the region. There is a greater need for law enforcement strategies to be directed on this A 2 road with traffic to and from Kataragama, Yala and resort areas forming a heavy volume of traffic.
Weekends, drive with care
Last decade or so signifies a high rate of fatalities during weekends. These fatalities had occurred on our main trunk roads which carries mixed traffic. The increasing trend on weekends perhaps due to increased travel demand for special events or festivals, leisure travel to holiday destinations and rapid urbanization promoting business opportunities. Fridays has recorded the highest death toll with 448 killed, Saturday the next highest with 425 killed and Sundays reporting the 3rd highest with 420 killed. The death rate on other days of the week reveals no significant difference to weekends.
Factors that could be commonly attributed to such fatalities are excessive speeding, overtaking in haste, driver fatigue, driving under the influence of alcohol, blatant disregard for the rights of other road users, over estimating ones skills/abilities and scant respect for road rules. To minimise fatalities need more and more targeted enforcement strategies by the police on stretches deemed as vulnerable, road widening and reducing speed limits.
This enormous threat to life and limb on our roads needs to be given a very high priority in the Political agenda of the government as well as successive governments. All socially concerned professionals of all disciplines must take cognizance of the deteriorating state of safety and security on our roads which has reached epic proportions. The issue also needs to become part of the civil rights discourse in the country and together galvanize the government in to action. Our vision in road safety should be that no longer we would want to handover a road traffic system which is extremely hazardous and risky to our next generation.
For this we need to move away from traditional methods of dealing with road safety and adopt innovative measures in road engineering to minimise existing road dangers and conflicts. There is an absolute need to promote a better driving culture among road users. For this a more dynamic approach to law enforcement in a uniform manner island-wide is absolutely vital, backed by Hi-tech enforcement strategies structured with deterrent penalties irrespective of who breaks the law.

In the thick of things and by far the most popular attraction was the Royal Turf Club, home of one of the most picturesque racecourses in the world. You wouldnt be far off the mark in thinking that virtually all roads seemed to be converging on Little England as Nuwara Eliya is popularly called. But what you could say with total conviction was that on the morning of Sunday 16 th April, every road inside Nuwara Eliya seemed drawn into the Royal Turf Club and the Racecourse was like a magnet attracting hordes never seen before.

Gracing the days proceedings as Chief Guest was Sujeewa Senasinghe  the Minister for International Trade. The guest of of honour was Sport Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
It wasnt just the equine breed that had the adrenaline pumping. Misty the ever popular band had the crowd grooving and on their feet, while Deepthika Jayakodys sensational fascinators featured as part of an incredible fashion show that was the cynosure of all eyes.
A Pony Raffle was also held the proceeds of which are to be used partially for developing the infrastructure of racing as well as helping a series of charities and proved to be hugely popular, with the crowds contributing generously.
RTCs Magic Million saw an exciting close finish at the wire where both the top contenders Alcazaba and Mehran fought it out hammer and tongs till the winning post.
But of course Mehran had to win it again in the Stewards Room as jockey Aneel the rider of Alcazaba placed second by the judge lodged an Objection against jockey Imran Khan the rider of Meheran and was therefore placed first by the judge. The objection was filed on the grounds.
The objection lodged by jockey Aneel rider of Alcazaba against jockey Imran Khan rider of Meheran claimed that jockey Aneels mount Alcazaba was hit on the face by jockey A. Imran Khan, rider of Meheran, on top of the straight which cost him the race.
After viewing the cctv footage the Stipendiary Stewards at no stage felt that jockey A. Imran Khan had hit Alcazaba on the face, hence the objection was overruled.
The Stipendiary Stewards on receiving the objection immediately asked the senior Vet Dr. J. Thangaraj to examine the mare Acazaba for any injuries on the face.
He examined the Mare and declared that there were no evident mark or marks on Alcazabas face.
The Stipendiary Stewards then interviewed both the jockeys Aneel and Imran Khan. After taking into account their respective submissions and viewing the video footage which was made available it was decided to overrule the objection. The decision to overrule the objection was unanimous.

SDB bank partners with National Enterprise Development Authority
SDB bank (SANASA Development Bank PLC), a pioneering financial institution founded on supporting the grassroots levels of Sri Lanka recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA) to further extend its support to the Micro, small and medium entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka.
The MoU primarily aims to encourage and guide prospective entrepreneurs in the rural communities while further uplifting existing business players in the Micro, small and medium enterprises.
National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), an institution established under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce currently serves the MSME sector with 235 development officers attached to the Divisional secretariats, to elevate Sri Lankan Enterprises to be an integral part of the economy.
Commenting on the MOU signed with SANASA Development Bank PLC, Omar Kamil  Chairman of NEDA said, This new partnership will certainly add value to the work being carried out by NEDA currently as we now stand as a consolidated business development service provider to the prospective entrepreneurs in the country.
We selected SDB as our partner in this instance as we identified them as an entity that spoke the same language as us. Being a financial institution extremely receptive to the needs of the grass roots of our country, their goals aptly complement our vision. Moreover, as we both intend to widen the scope of the SME sector in the country, it was easy to venture into this business partnership and lay out our objectives.
NEDA has been conducting a graduate entrepreneurship program since year 2014, where 100 second year students are selected every year and granted the necessary financial support and guidance to execute their business idea.

Serena Williams expecting a baby this fall, won't play again in 2017

It's another love game forSerena Williams: She is pregnant; and based on the timeline she offered, she already was when she won the Australian Open, the ESPN reported.
A spokeswoman for Williams, Kelly Bush Novak, told ESPN and other media yesterday: "I'm happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall."
The 23-time major champion will not play again in 2017 due to her pregnancy and plans to return in 2018.
Williams posted a photo of herself standing sideways with the caption "20 weeks" on Snapchat earlier Wednesday, then deleted it.
Williams, 35, did not comment beyond the photo and two-word caption.
She announced in late December that she was engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
Williams hasn't played since winning the Australian Open in January -- a little less than 12 weeks ago. She pulled out of her next two scheduled events -- Indian Wells and Miami -- citing a left knee injury. Her only other tournament this year was in Auckland, New Zealand, where she lost in the round of 16.
Tennis' next major tournament is the French Open, which starts May 28. Wimbledon begins in early July. And the US Open is in late August. If Williams is 20 weeks pregnant, she would be due in early September.
There is recent precedent for tennis players to return to action after becoming mothers.Kim Clijstersretired briefly to start a family, then came back to play tennis and won three Grand Slam titles. Another former No. 1 and major champion,Victoria Azarenka, has announced she'll be getting back on tour after having a baby last year.
Williams' 23 Grand Slam singles titles are a record for the Open era, which began in 1968. She broke a tie with Steffi Graf after winning the Australian Open. Only one woman has won more: Margaret Smith Court, who claimed some of her 24 titles during the amateur era.

Shot in the arm for Lankas economy
Sri Lankas economy will receive a shot in the arm following its programme with IMF and will perform well this year with good results, IMF Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department Maurice Obstfeld told journalists at the launch of the Global Economic Outlook on April 18 in Washington.
The Global Economic Outlook is the flagship presentation of the Fund on the global economic forecast released twice a year at the Spring and annual meetings in the world. Sri Lanka entered into an agreement through an Extended Fund Facility to support its ambitious economic growth plan to boost balance of payment and maintain financial stability.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka early this year predicted economic growth to reach around 5.5 percent by the end of this year given the optimism of economic growth in the US and China and with the drought in the country having an early end.
However, economists at the launch of the outlook noted that geo-political tensions in the Asian region could have spillovers resulting in downside effects on the regional economies.
Asia will do well this year and a large share of the growth in the region would come from China, Japan and India which launched its demonitisation program last year, Obstfeld said expressing optimism that turbulence in the region will abate and not intensify.
Obstfeld was confident that the region will do well this year with China to record a satisfactory growth.
The IMF also raised the global economic growth forecast this year to 3.5 percent this year up from 3.1 percent last year and 3.6 percent in 2008.
Momentum in the global economy has been building since the middle of last year, allowing us to reaffirm our earlier forecasts of higher global growth this year and next. We project the world economy to grow at a pace of 3.5 percent in 2017, up from 3.1 percent last year, and 3.6 percent in 2018, IMFs chief economist said.
The IMF said acceleration will be broad based across advanced, emerging, and low-income economies, building on gains we have seen in both manufacturing and trade.
Obstfeld said the Funds new projection for 2017 is marginally higher than what it expected in its last update. This improvement comes primarily from good economic news for Europe and Asia, and within Asia, notably for China and Japan.
However, the IMF noted that protectionist policies from advanced countries could slower the pace of growth.
Avoiding the damage from potential protectionist measures will require a renewed multilateral commitment to support trade, paired with national initiatives that can help workers adversely effected by a range of structural economic transformations including those due to trade, Obstfeld said.
The Fund noted that despite these signs of strength, many other countries will continue to struggle this year with growth rates significantly below past readings. Commodity prices have firmed since early 2016, but at low levels, and many commodity exporters remain challenged  notably in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.
At the same time, a combination of adverse weather conditions and civil unrest threaten several low-income countries with mass starvation. In Sub-Saharan Africa, income growth could fall slightly short of population growth, but not by nearly as much as last year.
Whether the current momentum will be sustained remains a question mark. There are clearly upside possibilities. Consumer and business confidence in advanced economies could rise further  though confidence indicators are already at relatively elevated levels. On the other hand, the world economy still faces headwinds, economist at the panel noted.
 For one thing, trend productivity growth remains subdued across the world economy, for complex reasons that we have explored in a recent paper, and that seem likely to persist for some time. In addition, several prominent downside risks threaten our baseline forecast, Obstfeld said.
The Fund also noted that one set of uncertainties stems from macroeconomic policies in the two largest economies. The U.S. Federal Reserve has embarked on monetary normalization and may soon begin to scale back the size of its balance sheet. Given the faster U.S. recovery, the Fed is ahead of the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, for which interest-rate hikes are not yet imminent. At the same time, however, U.S. fiscal policy still seems likely to turn more expansionary over the next couple of years.
Obstfeld said the Fund Will be monitoring the policies of the US administration under President Trump and will come up with a review of the global economy by arounf July this year.
However he said if the degree of remaining slack in the U.S. economy is small, the result could be inflation and a faster than expected pace of interest-rate rises, sparking sharp dollar appreciation and possible difficulties for emerging and some developing economies especially those with dollar pegs or extensive dollar-denominated liabilities. Chinas desirable rebalancing process continues, as seen in a declining current account surplus and an increased GDP share of services, yet growth has remained reliant on domestic credit growth so rapid that it may cause financial stability problems down the road. These problems could, in turn, spill over to other countries.
The IMF said though the world economy may be gaining momentum there is no certainty that the world wild be ou of the woods.
How can countries safeguard and nurture the global recovery There is no universal policy prescription for diverse economies at different conjunctural stages. Deflationary pressures have generally receded, but monetary accommodation should continue where inflation remains stubbornly below target levels. Growth-friendly fiscal measures, especially where there is fiscal space, can support demand where that is still needed and contribute to expanding supply and reducing external imbalances, Obstfeld said.
He said all countries have opportunities for structural reforms that can raise potential output as well as resilience to shocks, although specific reform priorities differ across economies.
Trade has been an engine of growth, promoting impressive per capita income gains and declines in poverty throughout the world, especially in poorer countries. But its benefits have not always been equally shared within countries, and political support for trade will continue to erode unless governments step up to invest in their workforces and aid the adjustment to dislocations.

Shudders as the second round looms
The new Singer schools season has had its fair share of thrills and spills ..taking games all down to the wire and more intense rugby in the middle for a thumping 2nd round steps up next weekend.
Many questions between the schools remain ...and will probably blow their horn loudly till the sunsets on this season, with the answer to the questions still unanswered
Will Patana be stronger to stay a contender, is Royal a realistic threat to upset the top...or is that great escape in Kandy v Dharmarajah (last min Askey drop goal) a sign of things to come Can Josephs take more than courage from their win against Peters ...and become contenders Thomas, Peters and their backroom staff have their work cut out to pull things around and finally can Trinity hold on thru the next round, stamp consistency and change Sri schools rugby history 8 weeks from now .....
I believe in the basics ..and the work required ... teams are most vulnerable when nursing injuries and trying to get their 1st choice back on the park.
The concept of final round rugby is always a tough place to live and predict success from, especially for our resident experts and self appointed pundits
Teams that find themselves fighting relegation have different priorities in comparison to the top 3 contenders ..one is about survival, the other all about stamping your class, skills and domination with the title in sight.
The art of management and styles already under pressure and tested to the hilt. Its a grand pace and better oxygen for those who have lived there before
Kandy showed us the value of sensible investments and long term business planning, specifically targetting a number of Sri Lanka rep players to bolster up their firepower.
Schools have long been marking players in smaller suburban stables for transfer once they hit their O level turbulance - some of these players are very fortunate to have the skills to upgrade and get on the online radar. I understand they get invited to play for the bigger stables plus customary incentives. Varying schools of thought on the topic ...with passionate arguments for both seats of learning.
Trinity deserve all they get , especially with the level of performance week after week ...its all down to the team in the middle ..under pressure, after months of planning and now half a dozen starts way from the 2017 Singer League champions.
What a fantastic place to find yourself ...the months of pre season now justified and the mind ready to hit hard and go beyond all expectations. Round 1 was kinder to Patana and Royal, a little less for Wesley, Thomas, Peters and Josephs...who find themselves with a degree of pressure to absorb on the way.
Maximum stats and bragging rights to the Trinity Lions for skills and commitment, thru the full 80 mins all round 1 matches - their fans believe this is their year and it is theirs for the taking. The icing on that cake (with a cherry) will be winning the Bradby Shield back and the league title in the same stride...the hills would come alive should a Raikebula inspired 15 do just that over the next 2 months.
Planning needs to be at its efficient best ...with facilities and understanding for player wellness their maximum focus - injuries need to be top priority and carefully sorted as these are young gladiators just starting their careers ..some will shine and graduate for their national duty ..either way all will learn the art of team, trust pain and pride for sure ...but the best lesson of all, the mind to accept both victory and defeat, hopefully in the same stride.
I cannot emphasize more concern about the abundant use of supplements and proteins to boost muscle weight and enhance performance as part of the standard methods of match conditioning .
The fashion option to grab a jar, and more priority for that chemical powder to ingest ..than agility and rugby intel conditioning for the player to sharpen his ability and thinking under pressure.
But lets leave this swelling concept for a dedicated expert to dissect and analyze in specific detail..its too critical to dismiss...I am positive that there are child and parental rights that must be considered here and absolutely sure that schools and management cannot insist as a player, you must eat the team supplement
We hear all sorts of horrid stories from fellow players how they had no choice ...and the post match reaction to the chemicals that may last days ...alas the technology of progress needs proper scientific and legal proof, so its as simple and legal as getting a B12 shot to boost energy for a percentage better performance on the day, in the middle.
Sri Lanka Anti doping have a task to detect and deter all who knowingly aim to bend the law or use players by clouding their judgement with winners medal syndrome!
Sevens is our pressing national rugby priority for the next 5 months with the Asian series and windows of opportunity which demand high performance from management and players all round.
Our trip to the Hongkong 7s world series qualifier ..put us under the microscope a bit and really shed light on what is required of players and teams to meet the world class cut off... head on. Skipper Ranjan would need to work and think hard what muscle they need for the Asian series and how efficient we need to be at the breakdowns. Possession is the fundamental key to life in the middle ..very little scope if we are defending for a bigger percent of the 15mins and little petrol to finish once we do get decent ball.
Looking forward to better news for both men and women on our Asian quest for upper rankings ..men as no. 2...and women in the top 4 to challenge Japan, Hongkong, China, Kazakstan and Thailand for a top 4 slot. Blessings to all who wear the national shirt with pride.
Cheers islanders and pure rugby hearts ...bula bula SRI!

SLFP May Day rally to focus on programme to uplift working class
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said yesterday that all arrangements have been finalised to hold the SLFP May Day rally at Gatambe in Kandy on a grand scale. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, he said that the rally will be held in a manner that minimizes any inconveniences to motorists and commuters who travel via Kandy on May 1.
This will be the third May Day rally after President Maithripala Sirisena became President.Therefore, the President has advised us to hold this year's SLFP May Day rally not an an image building exercise for the party, but a real programme to uplift the working class.
Our fight is not with the UNP but with the JO. But, looking at the previous May Day rallies held in Galle and Colombo, it was proved that the real peoples power is with President Maithripala Sirisena. There are reports that the JO will plan to provoke the people and get seek Police intervention in order to put the try and embarass the government during its May Day rally scheduled to be held at Galle Face, Devapriya said.
But,the May Day rally should not be held for political purposes, but as a cerebration of the rights of the working class, he said.
Commenting on the Colombo's Garbage Problems,the Western Province Chief Minister said that the CMC had identified several places in Colombo for garbage disposal since permission has been granted to dump garbage in Karadiyana only for a few days.The Proposed Karadiyana Waste Management Centre will be implemented as a large scale project.The entire Karadiyana area will be turned into an attractive destination under this programme.
In addition to the Karadiyana project, several waste management programmes will initiated in Kalutara and Muthurajawela. Therefore, there will be no garbage problem in Colombo in the future,he said.
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry will handover the report detailing how the Meethotamulla garbage mound can be removed in less than six months. We early offered Rs.15,000 monthly to each house holder for six months to find alternative houses. But they did not move from this area. We have already constructed 60 houses in Salamulla which will be given to beneficiaries soon. We will also work out a compensation formula for destroyed multi storied houses.

SLIM launches Certificate in Digital Marketing
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), unveiled its certificate course in digital marketing (CDM) on March 11 at the Kingsbury hotel.
Digital marketing or data driven marketing plays a leading role in today's challenging global marketing arena. SLIM has designed this digital marketing certificate course (CDM) to suit marketers and non-marketers.
The CDM is the newest innovative product in SLIM's product portfolio. The three-month program consists of three modules.
At the inauguration, the new batch of students were made aware of the CDM curricular and the value it could bestow on persons engaged in marketing products and brands. Participants who graced the occasion represented a cross section of young employees, marketing practitioners, corporate and public sector middle managers, non-marketers, entrepreneurs and SLIM students.
Intakes for the SLIM - CDM program are now open and students will follow the course at the SLIM Business Schools in Colombo and Kandy.
Digital marketing,which promotes products or brands via digital medium differs from traditional marketing as it involves the use of channels and methods which enable an organization to analyze marketing campaigns and understand what is working and what isn't,typically in real time.
Digital marketing facilitates customer relationships across all channels; both digital and traditional, and thus is an integrated approach towards marketing.
The CDM is a preliminary course designed by SLIM to help students understand the fundamentals of various aspects of digital marketing and the online communication ecosystem. SLIM assumes candidates without preliminary marketing knowledge who are keen to gain digital marketing knowledge by following the CDM course.
The SLIM - CDM bestows on students,skills essential in planning, organizing, leading, controlling, and decision-making within the framework of digital marketing. The CDM program will be done with a blended focus on academic and professional orientation. While fifty percent of the content will emphasize on theoretical concepts,the remaining will focus on professional practices with project-based learning opportunities.

Spaghetti  pies
A new, progressive type of doughnut has arrived on the scene. Good news, right Doughnuts are soft and lovely, so a new one is surely welcome
Well. These doughnuts are made of something very different to the usual doughy happiness. They're made of spaghetti. Yes. Pasta. They're pasta.
A US restaurant is behind the invention. It combines a classic Neapolitan dish known as spaghetti pie with the very American circular snack.
Pop Pasta, in Brooklyn, New York, released the spaghetti doughnuts late last year, and they're selling well. In the last week, they've taken off on social media.
Creators Luigi Fiorentino and wife Emy Gargiulo say on their website: In the Neapolitan tradition the spaghetti pie is a dish prepared with pasta leftovers combined with eggs and cheese and then fried.
The pair say the dish is the perfect food to bring to picnics or to the beach, and it isnt messy like pizza!
Each pasta doughnut is baked, and flavours include the aglio e olio, with olive oil and garlic, a carbonara version with pancetta, and the bolognese, made with ground beef.

Sri Lanka is fast gaining recognition as one of the top four destinations for investments in the real estate sector for both Chinese and Japanese investors, Horton Square project CEO Paul Kelly said.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said the foreign investors know this trend and are investing in large condominium projects in Sri Lanka. However I am not sure if Sri Lankans know about this plus factor.
Kelly said that for Chinese and Japanese their best investment destinations are Australia, USA and Singapore. However today, all these three destinations (including India) are more expensive than Sri Lanka.
He said stamp duties in these countries when buying apartments too are very expensive than Sri Lanka and this is a major plus point for Sri Lanka. In addition building costs per square meter, along with land prices in Sri Lanka too are attractive for foreign investors than in the other countries. This too is another advantage for Sri Lanka.
He said that for Chinese, Sri Lanka is the closest location when it comes to flying time as well. Kelly said the Chinese also know about the development of the Port City project handled by Chinese consortiums and this has influenced Chinese investors to look at buying condominiums.
In addition the budget proposals which relaxed foreign ownership rules to buy apartments too is another major plus factor for foreign investors.
Commenting on theHorton Square project he said that clearing of land and construction will start from next week and the 75 floor twin tower complex will open by 2020.
The construction of the project is handled by Zhongtian Construction of China and is the largest private sector infrastructure development company in China. The local Architects for the project is Archedium Pvt Ltd.
It will offer 150 rooms in 15 floors for the St Regis apartments and a further 515 apartments for the St Regis Hotels. The bottom 26 floors would be offered for commercial spaces. The total investment he said will move up to around US$ 300 million as they will invest in high quality materials. The total employment generation of this project will be over 1,200. This is not just another building but a symbol of renewed investor confidence both in the future of Sri Lanka, its growth potential, as well as, the aspirations of her people.
St. Regis is the luxury brand of Starwood Hotels & Resorts and offers some of the best locations, views, and amenities the world over.
Horton Square will represent a symbol of confidence in Sri Lanka and other international investors will surely follow.

Sri Lanka Automobile Service Provider's Association formed
The Sri Lanka Automobile Service Provider's Association (SLASPA) was inaugurated by entrepreneurs representing the industry for progress of the automobile repair business.
With a history spanning over 100 years, the automobile repair industry plays a pivotal role as a fundamentally important cog in the overall economic scenario.The formation of the new body of industry stakeholders provided a window of opportunity to collectively address and resolve longstanding common issues confronting the trade.
The chief guest at the inauguration in Colombo held recently was German Technical Institute Killinochchi Principal Erwin Shulz, while Sri Lanka Boat Builder's Association Secretary-General, Gamini Herath was a guest-of-honour, along with Hemantha Dambadeniya, an insurance industry engineer.
The vision of the new Association is to offer a service on par with international standards to customers in the automobile repair sector, clear obstacles that hinder the forward-march of the industry, provide a training on an international level to professionals in the industry to improve their skills and update their knowledge, attract modern global technology to this industry in Sri Lanka, in addition to many other objectives to take this key segment to greater heights.
SLASPA President Rajitha Gomes said the Association is a longstanding need for the whole automobile repair industry, including service stations, mechanical repairers, body shops and auto a/c repairers to express their views and also voice concerns on diverse issues pertaining to their business activities in providing automobile related services.
The Association will endeavour to ensure an efficient, courteous and expeditious service to clients of the members, whilst improving the standards and quality of their workshops. The Association will negotiate with government establishments, regulatory bodies and insurance companies on behalf of the members, and will address the need for skilled and trained staff to face the challenges in repairing modern motor vehicles, he stressed.
Shulz said that the formation of an Association to represent the interests of the automobile repair industry is essential as there was not a single body to set out the skills needed by young person's entering this industry in Sri Lanka. He invited SLASPA members to visit the German Technical Institute in Kilinochchi to acquaint themselves with the training facilities and see for them the young community receiving training in the area so that they could be employed as apprentices among SLASPA member establishments
SLASPA Secretary Amal Piyatilake said the Association will help stakeholders in the automobile service industry to improve their capacity and quality of services provided, while building networking opportunities. We will liaise with all relevant institutions as a group to safeguard the automobile service industry, he emphasised.

Sri Lanka ropes in Coop Economy for 2030 National SDGs
Sri Lanka says its enlisting its massive cooperative sector for a speedier realisation of it 2030 national Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) plan.
We can achieve our national Sustainable Development Goals easily if the government and the cooperative movement work together. Sri Lankas cooperatives are active many sectors, and it can support SDGs as a community based movement, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said in Hanoi,Vietnam yesterday. Minister Bathiudeen, who is leading Sri Lankas cooperative sector delegation to the International Cooperative Ministers Conference 2017 at Melia Hotel, Hanoi, Vietnam was addressing the 19 April session of the event.
This event, opened on April 18, is themed Sustainable Development Goals and Promoting Stronger Partnerships between Government and Co-operative stakeholders.
This conference is looking forward to the 2030 targets. We can achieve our national Sustainable Development Goals if the government and the cooperative movement work together paying attention to relevant factors such as gender and youth. At present a main topic of the development discussion in the South Asian Countries is the gender issue.
We can formulate and implement women empowerment programs in collaboration with the cooperative movement so that we leverage it towards the success of an SDG. Currently among the leaders and top management level officers women representation is notably very poor. Since Sri Lankas cooperatives are active in agricultural, consumers, production, health services, industries, financial, women and youth sectors, it can support SDGs as a community based movement.
My Ministry with the support of International Labour Organisation is striving to finalise Sri Lankas first national cooperatives policy to serve the more than 14,500 cooperatives across the country. We believe that once our policy formulation work is completed Sri Lankas cooperative movement can support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals even faster and better. Another reason that we believe that the cooperative movement of Sri Lanka could be used towards SDGs is that the strength of the movement. Sri Lankas total population is around 21 million. Of this almost 8 million Sri Lankans are a member of some form of a cooperative active in the country. Therefore I do not have any doubts that the lessons we take home from todays event here would become valuable inputs to the future of Sri Lankas co-operatives.

Strategic thinking!
I won many medals, certificates and I even got opportunities to go to foreign countries to play international chess tournaments. Meantime I could also become the first in the section in every term test. So there was no barrier about taking up chess. Playing chess improves ones mental concentration and thinking ability too. This is contributes to our studies
Ranking as the All Island number three in the G C E Ordinary Level Examination 2016 is no mean feat. But Dimuth Oshadhee Mirissage has not only excelled in academics but also as a sportsman. He is an internationally rated chess player who has earned titles like becoming the Under 08 All Island Champion in National Youth Chess Championship in 2008, and Under 14 All Island Champion in National Youth Chess Championship in 2014, and had represented Sri Lanka at the international tournaments in countries like Iran, Vietnam, South Africa and India. A student of Rahula College, Matara, Dimuth has captained the schools Under 10,12,15 Chess Teams in 2007, 2011,2015 and 2016. He also has a passion for Science and has taken part in science related activities and quizzes, excelling in those factors as well.
Winning the Silver Medal in the 7th Asian Schools Chess Championship 2011 held in New Delhi,India
Becoming the All Island third in the G C E Ordinary Level examination 2016 a great achievement in my life. It was a hard earned victory which was a result of hard work and dedication. My parents Chandana Mirissage and Pamoda Malawararachchi, brother Chamith Thisaranga Mirissage, family members, our school principal Mr Francis Welege, and all my teachers inspired me. The Provincial Education Director of the Southern province Nimal Dissanayake who was the schools former principal too was very supportive. I believe that my determination and commitment helped me to succeed, Dimuth said.
He had gotten to know about his results at around about 5 am on March 28 but I heard about his island rank about an hour later. An uncle of his who lives in Galle related the news to his father.
I was delighted with the news. It was one of the happiest moments in my life! I was anticipating an all island rank among top 10 but wasnt anticipating this! Dimuth added with a smile.
Dimuth notes that if you work hard according to a plan with determination and commitment you can get good results in exams.
I believe that we should have a plan in our mind about what we should do in a day. It will make our work easy and help to lessen the workload, he opined.
He had started playing chess from grade one. He noted that it was a passion which he had cultivated from childhood.
Good combination
I won many medals, certificates and I even got opportunities to go to foreign countries to play international chess tournaments. Meantime I could also become the first in the section in every term test. So there was no barrier about taking up chess. Playing chess improves ones mental concentration and thinking ability too. This is contributes to our studies, he said.
He had taken part in his first chess tournament when he was in grade two. That was a District Under-10 Chess Tournament. He won three rounds out of five in the tournament and had gotten selected to the all island level.
My first international chess tournament was the 3rd Asian Schools Chess Championship which was held in January, 2008 in Kandy. I played as the Under-08 official Chess player of the Sri Lankan National Chess Team. I could win a gold medal and a silver medal in that tournament. I could get many valuable experiences from this tournament for my chess career and life, Dimuth mused.
He notes that one should have a good concentration and imaginative power to become a good chess player.
As chess players we have to play well in all three stages of the game which are named as opening, middle game and end game. So we have to practise both tactical and strategical thinking styles in all stages of the game. A good combination of these things make a good chess player, he said.
Dimuth had been selected for the Maths Olympiad Provincial Pool in 2011.Organized by the National Mathematical and Science Olympiad SectionDimuth had been selected to the provincial pool after qualifying from the District competition. The selected provincial pool was practised in SangamittaCollege, Galle. About 15 students from the Southern Province who got high marks from the district test had been present in the provincial pool.
This was a great experience for all of us. We could learn many new things and mathematical methods at there. I made many new friends and we enjoyed the time we spent together, he recalled.
Dimuth had also captained the Rahula College team at the Sirasa Pentathlon Competition. The school won second place at the event.
Determination and commitment
We had to face many tough situations throughout the event.We experienced the toughest out of them in the second round of the competition. Before the last round, our opponents were 52 points ahead of us but we could lessen that lead to two points just before the last question. Unfortunately, the presenter gave the chance to answer the last question to our opponents because they pressed buzzer before the question was asked. The presenter broke the rules of the competition but then he attempted to justify his action. As a result of this unfortunate incident we lost that game. That was a very tough moment for me and my teammates but we kept our mentality strong and faced the event, he expressed.
Leading his team in the Sirasa Pentathlon Competition
Dimuth notes that his parents are his heroes in life. This is because of the remarkable manner in which manage everything wonderfully.
They have faced many problems in the life but they are not weakened by them. So I try to learn something from them every day. I believe that those things will be really important for my life and made me the individual that I am today, he pointed out.
Playing chess in the internet is his favourite pasttime. He enjoys especially because he can play with many foreign players. Collecting stamps and watch TV are his other hobbies. He also gathers important news and facts every day that are useful for him to excel in life. He says that he likes to engage in something useful while enjoying it.
Playing chess at the 7th Asian Schools Chess Championship 2011
My ambition is to become a Consultant Doctor. So my first target is to get a high rank in G C E Advanced Level Examination and be selected to the Medical Faculty. After completing that degree I hope to do other exams which are need to become a consultant doctor. Living in my country and serving my people is what drives me in my life, Dimuth said.
He advises other youth to take up sports while engaging in academics.
Both of them contribute to making our life a success. We should take up both with determination and commitment but we should not let sports to become a hinderence for our studies. If you work hard according to a plan with dedication and determination, you can excel in both sectors, Dimuth advised.

T-rex was a  sensitive lover
He may have been the most terrifying carnivore ever to have walked the Earth but the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex was apparently also a sensitive lover. Experts say the 20ft T-rex had an extremely sensitive snout, which could mean that males and females enjoyed rubbing their faces together while mating.
Writing in the Scientific Reports journal, US researchers wrote: "In courtship, tyrannosaurids might have rubbed their sensitive faces together as a vital part of pre-copulatory play."
It comes following the discovery of an earlier relative of the T-rex - the Daspletosaurus horneri (Horner's frightful lizard), which lived 74 million years ago - in the US state of Montana.
Scientists were able to examine several well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons, and said the face of the D-horneri gave the most important clues about the Tyrannosaurus anatomy.
It is believed that T-rex had large, flat scales on its face, with areas of tough protective skin around the snout and jaws.
But the hard surface around the nose was penetrated by small nerve openings, which would have allowed hundreds of branches of the trigeminal nerve - responsible for sensation in the face - to run through to the surface of the dinosaur's nose.
This would effectively have turned the T-rex's face into a kind of third "hand", as sensitive to touch as a human finger tip.
Other animals also have this sensitivity nerve - cats through their whiskers and crocodiles in their snouts to sense touch and vibrations in the water. Migrating birds also use it to detect magnetic fields.
Scientists said the T-rex may well have used it to explore its environment and to pick up fragile eggs, but it was possible it also provided an enjoyable sensation when mating.

Thambilikanda residents to receive title deeds
The 29 year wait by 33 families resident at Thambilikanda in Kahagala South Grama Seva Division of Kamburupitya, for title deeds to the lands they live on will end soon. We should be able to hand over the title deeds by August this year, said Divisional Secretary of Kamburupitiya, Nilmini Herath in reply to a query made in this regard on Tuesday.
These people were allotted land in 1988 by President Ranasinghe Premadasa but the authorities were unable to hand over the title deeds as documentary evidence as to which government institution owned the lands would be determined. The Land Reform Commission had even charged rentals for a period of time but could not come up with documentary evidence of the land being vested with them.
The people had been sent from pillar to post for years and staged many protests until they decided to appeal to the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, Sagala Rathnayake as well as the Chief of Staff of the Prime Ministers Office and Member of Parliament for the Matara District two years ago. Minister Rathnayake had detailed Assistant Social Secretary at the Prime Ministers Office, Vasantha Kuruppu the task of resolving the issue.
Documentary evidence to the ownership of the land known as Thambilikanda was finally traced and we have done all the preliminary work and will be in a position to hand over the title deeds before
August this year, the Divisional Secretary affirmed.
The plight of theses people who had been deed less for 28 years was revealed in the Daily news of April 7 2016.

Transition of a  Scientist /  Educationist  to a Poet
The first book of poems by Dr Paramita Mukherjee Mullick is simply called  Life A Collection of Poems. There are 60 poems at various length in this little book of 92 pages published by Virgin Leaf Books in Mumbai and priced at Indian Rs.95/-.
The poems are neatly grouped together under the titles Relations, Reflections, Inspirations, Journeys and The Light. It shows her progress from something closer to her to something sublime.
To understand her poems we should know something about the poet. Although I had a brief encounter with her at Udaipur Literary Festival in India last year, which was impressive. Watching her at close quarters of her performance reading her poems and her unassuming and affable nature, I felt that Indian writers and poets should be noticed by us Lankans for the variety of talents flourishing there.
Paramita born in Bangla (West Bengal) now lives in Mumbai with her academic lawyer husband and upcoming young poet, her daughter. She is a scientist with a Ph.D. in Genetic Toxicology from the University of Calcutta.
A note on her ads: she is now heling in the quality management of schools and junior colleges More than 15 scientific papers in international and national journals
As a rule I do not give an opinion on the content of a book of poetry because the poet has the right to say what he or she wants to say. Instead I pick up some lines in ones poetry which I think are fresh and somewhat original in expression.
Here are some:
e What else, but you to vent out my anger when I am angry on the world, emotions to unfurl
e In this world of stone and grime, its nice to know that we each other could find
e In love, thoughts count. The joy of life encompassed in love, has no end. Life ends, but love never ends.
e Were the clouds made up of gold There was a streak of fire across the sky. The mesmerizing beauty made me sigh. The red sun was throwing its light on the clouds. The silhouette of the dark clouds behind, a greater beauty I am yet to find.
e The blending of colours, the cobalt blue, the golden and then the red. The ground was a dark bed. I loved flying up and up high. With the kites and eagles upon high. With no cares of the world. The mind was not in a swirl.
e Have you ever seen a dormant volcano Fretting and fuming within but calm outside. Have you ever felt the pain of a dormant volcano Full of molten lava inside, but calm outside. The red hot lava wants to be released. The bubbling liquid wants to come out. It knows not why it is trapped. It knows not why it is enwrapped. (Please read the rest of the lines in this poem)
e Being happy with little things is no vice
Finally I wish to quote in full the last poem in the book as it borders on the sublime realization
The golden rays of the Sun fell on the ground.
Sheets of gold spreading from the clouds.
A ring like radiance around your head was found.
Was it You that I saw coming out of the clouds
A circling light in the sky.
A halo of light in the sky.
Was it You I found
I was awestruck and looked around.
The white clouds floating by.
The golden lined clouds in the sky.
I looked and looked in surprise.
Wait You in disguise

Warm welcome to champion rider Aaron
The champion rider Aaron was warmly welcomed by the Sports Ministry and Sri Lanka Automobile Sports officials as well as friends and family on his arrival at the Bandaranike International Airport after Sri Lanka secured another Asian victory in the premier event ARRC. Initially it was the Daniel Brothers from Hellibees Racing team who represented Sri Lanka at the Asian rounds and thereafter the 600cc rider Mohamed Basith and Jaden Gunawardena gave it a go for a podium finish. However, who would have ever imagined a 13-year-old school boy would out do everyone and bring glory back home. The Gunawardena duo has made our country proud in many Asian events, but it is the first time a Sri Lankan has ever got on to a Podium of an Asian Road Racing Championship event.
Aaron had a rough start with a wrong selection of gearing in race 1 at the Chang International circuit in Thailand on April 14. However, race 2 on the following day was somewhat different. Aaron went on an incredible winning run leading throughout the last 3 laps to finish in second place behind the Japanese rider Fujita.
All eyes were on the Lankan who was on a decisive course to determine this years Championship. Aaron knew he had to extract every point he could to put the pressure on the five Nations behind him on the points table.
Currently Aaron is battling it out alone for his country with other countries like the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia having 3 riders each and India has 2 representing their country. Currently the young Lankan has got his country on the 4th slot of the rankings and a head of 12 riders from 6 Nations.
Round 3 in Suzuka Japan will be crucial, as taller and heavier riders like Aaron would have it tough. The Japanese rider Fujita who is currently the smallest and lightest rider among the selected team would be the one to watch out, as besides Suzuka been his home track, he would have an advantage with his weight too.

Why is SLC in public relations overdrive
Sri Lankas public certainly hasnt been fooled by Sumathipalas overtures:
Five men stand in front of the sponsors' backdrop at the presentation that follows Sri Lanka's T20 win over Bangladesh.
Four of them are holding cheques; the man who holds nothing is Thilanga Sumathipala, SLC president and unelected deputy speaker of the House. He stands closest to the presenter, and his presence seems gratuitous at first.
When proceedings begin, however, it becomes clear that the camera is smitten with Sumathipala and that he is smitten with it. When Kusal Perera comes up to be interviewed about his Player-of-the-Match performance, there Sumathipala is, looking paternally over the player's shoulder with a benevolent grin. While other awards are being handed out, the camera may stray, but as if bound by fate, it always has a way of finding its way back to Sumathipala. It captures his coy smirks and his firm handshakes.
It is tempting to wonder if Sumathipala is just presentation eye candy, because he is the fifth man and there are only four awards to be handed out. Is he like the placard-wielding model at a boxing match Is he the sex scene in an episode of Game of Thrones
But no, it seems - he does, in fact, have a purpose here. To him goes the honour of bringing the presentation to its climax. When it comes time for Sri Lanka's captain to receive his winners' cheque, an unusual announcement is made by the presenter: "You can collect the $2000 cheque from Mr Sumathipala, who will receive it from Mr Arosha Athukorala."
If Athukorala feels miffed here, he can at least take some satisfaction in having broken new ground: in the fabled history of South Asian cricket presentations, no man, perhaps, has previously stood at a presentation merely to present a winners' cheque to the eventual presenter of the cheque.
The whole shenanigan was peak Sumathipala. This had been a fortnight in which SLC was endlessly besieged, following the Test loss to Bangladesh, and a tied ODI series. So why not seize on the chance to have your face beamed across the nation immediately after a clinical win Why not milk this winning performance from Perera - a player Sumathipala had played a substantial role in rescuing from doping allegations last year
In fact, in 16 months in office so far, Sumathipala has pursued publicity with unmitigated desperation - fronting up to every camera in his vicinity, schmoozing every journalist who has made his acquaintance. A relentless carousel of PR stunts has been his term: if there is a media dinner this month, there will be a pre-series song-and-dance tamasha the next; if there is a high-flying hour-long press conference this week, a charity dinner or a grandiose tournament announcement is perpetually around the corner.
All that effort, and yet, for what What does Sumathipala think he is achieving Sri Lanka's public certainly hasn't been fooled by his overtures. When Sumathipala took on Mahela Jayawardene over his consulting position with England ahead of last year's World T20, for example, fans flocked almost unanimously to Jayawardene's side. "[He knows] the team's strengths when [he is] inside the team," Sumathipala had said. "England didn't hire me to give information on the Sri Lankan team - they have analysts and coaches to do that," Jayawardene responded. Sumathipala found it difficult to argue with that.
Later that year, mounting a similar campaign against Muthiah Muralitharan, who took a temporary position with the visiting Australia team, Sumathipala deployed the Sinhala word apeykama - literally: "ourness" - in a brazen appeal to Sri Lankan nationalism. He attempted to play to the gallery, and found the gallery was not having it. Fans rallied around Murali, who was ordained into the ICC's Hall of Fame later that week. "Sri Lanka didn't want me, and Australia wanted me," Murali spat. "How could I be a traitor to this country [] my foundation has built 1000 houses."
At the ICC last month, Sumathipala suffered his greatest humiliation of all. In jockeying for the position of chairman, he galvanised the other ICC directors into convincing sitting chairman Shashank Manohar to reverse his resignation from the post. "What we did not want was to have a whole load of toxic electioneering, which Sumathipala exemplified," one director had said at the time. "His conduct actually brought the board very fast together."
It is a shame Sumathipala seeks public validation, because by one measure, he has been as impressive an SLC president as there ever has been. For the special-interest group that is Sri Lanka's clubs, there have been large financial grants and increased security and status - where last year only 14 first-class clubs existed, this season there were 23. And it is the clubs, of course, that really matter: their votes have put Sumathipala in his current position.
So why bother with this endless pursuit of positive press If you have the clubs in your pocket and next year's election all sewn up, why pretend to care about a provincial first-class tournament that has failed to materialise in your two seasons in charge Why continue to attempt points-scoring decisions that almost never end up scoring any actual points
The public seems to understand a Sumathipala presidency is the product of SLC's broken constitution, which grants board votes to an array of clubs and vestigial cricketing institutions. Many, perhaps, have guessed he is attempting to use SLC as a political tool, with which he might regain the favour of the public, who voted him out of parliament in the most recent election (though he was later appointed to parliament through the national list).
Eventually, if the lackeys he has surrounded himself with ever stop flattering him, Sumathipala may realise his PR blitzes have backfired spectacularly. He has sold and sold and sold himself as SLC president. Not many seem to be buying.
