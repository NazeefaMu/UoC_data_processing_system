Vocational, technological skills vital  to curb unemployment - Dr Amunugama
The government has a big responsibility towards the youth of the country who are facing an acute problem of employment said Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony held last Friday at Higurakgoda for laying the foundation stone for a building complex for a new National Vocational Training Institute and the inauguration of the Nipuni Job Bank, by President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said that the only solution to this problem is through the acquisition of vocational and technological skills required by the modern work place. For this reason the minister said that he has directed all the vocational and technological training institutions under his ministry to double their intake of students from next year. He said that he has also directed them to upgrade their courses of training to international level so that a person who has qualified at any of these institutions will be able to find employment not only locally but anywhere in the world. Dr Amunugama said that the objective of the government is to secure for the youth not just any job, but good jobs based on advanced technology.
Referring to the web based Nipuni Job Bank inaugurated by the President at this event, the Minister said that it will contain full and regularly updated information about all NVQ qualified persons in the country, from Level 2 to Level 7, so that prospective employers will be able to select and recruit the personnel they need without any hassle. He said that he is aware that already some big time employers like John Keells and Mobitel are looking out for NVQ qualified persons.

TAMIL UNION REUNION AT UPALIS:
When agony followed ecstasy!
S. SKANDAKUMAR, a former Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka and skipper of the Tamil Union Cricket Club recounts their key game against Bloomfield and how Tamil Union won it and ultimately lost it on re-scrutiny.
The need for financial sponsorship resulted in the prestigious P Sara Trophy giving way to the Lakspray Trophy tournament in the season 1982/83. As winners of the former Trophy in its inaugural year in 1950, the Tamil Union team was understandably enthusiastic about repeating that achievement in the first year of the Lakspray Trophy Tournament as well, for the club.
The final round matches were of three days duration and were played on a League basis amongst eight qualifying teams, commencing January 1983. The points system applicable to the final round to the best of my recollection, was as follows: Eight points for a first innings win and 12 points for an outright win.
In addition the following bonus points also applied: 0.1 bonus point for every 20 runs scored; 0.1 wickets bonus point for every wicket taken.
Further there were additional bonus points awarded for the following achievements: (a) A total score of 300 (applicable to the 1st inning only) -1.0 batting bonus point; (b) Bowling the opponents out for less than 150 runs (applicable to the 1st inning only) - 1.0 bowling bonus points.
In an effort to discourage slow over rates, there was also a penalty system that applied to each over under bowled on a stipulated minimum average of 16 overs per hour in a completed inning. For this purpose the total duration of an innings was divided by the total number of overs bowled to ascertain the shortfall, if any.
The Boards Hony Recorder then was that very amiable and evergreen Archibald Perera (since called to rest by the Almighty) who released the table of points officially at the conclusion of each weekends matches.
According to that table, at the end of the penultimate weekend of the final round, Bloomfield, who had completed their engagements by then, had a clear lead of 17.675 points over their nearest rival, the Tamil Union, who were to play the Police at the Park on the final weekend. The sports journalists, in their Friday columns on the morning of the match, were unanimous that our task was a truly formidable one, as we had to achieve the following targets to dislodge Bloomfield at the top.
(1) Score a minimum of 350 runs in the first inning. (This would give us 1.0 batting bonus point plus 1.75 runs bonus points at 0.1 point per 20 runs scored making a total of 2.75 points)
(2) Bowl Police out for less than 150 in the 1st innings. (This would have given us 1.0 bowling bonus point and 1.0 wickets bonus points at 0.1 point per wicket taken, making a total of 2.0 points)
(3) Enforce the follow on and bowl Police out a second time. (This would have given us a further 1.0 wickets bonus point)
(4) Win outright to secure 12 additional points, making a total of 17.75 points
The run of play
We batted first and at lunch were a dismal 82 for 5 wickets!
Understandably there were many anxious faces in the dressing room during the break, but a strong comeback by the lower order saw us through to 300 by stumps.
On the 2nd day, Police held out for 221 which meant that we had forfeited the all important bonus point for bowling a side out for less than 150 in the 1st innings. Our strategy had therefore to be reassessed and necessitated our having to bat a second time to score a minimum of 200 to compensate for the bowling bonus point of 1.0 that we had forfeited in consequence. We declared our second innings in the morning session of the 3rd day at 250 for 9 wickets, hoping to give ourselves sufficient time to bowl Police out to secure the much needed outright win. They put up a great fight with stiff resistance coming from Nimal Senasinghe, Jayantha Paranathala, and G.S Ratnayake in particular, all of whom had a good season that year. However assisted by some brilliant fielding and hostile bowling, we came into tea with Police 7 wickets down.
On checking the scorebook on a hunch at the tea break, I realized that we were in serious danger of incurring penalty points for not maintaining the overall average of 16 overs to the hour. (the pacemen had operated for a major part of that innings). That penalty would then have swung the fine balance back to Bloomfield even if we had won outright! So, when play resumed after tea, much to the confusion of the large crowd witnessing the game, Anura Samarasekera the left-arm spinner and I, wheeled down a rapid 10 overs between us in less than 30 minutes, to ensure that our over rate average was raised to 16 to the hour. We changed quickly between overs and bowled an outside the off stump line.
As the batsmen were battling to save the game, they were content to let these harmless deliveries pass. It was clearly understood by the team that NO catches would be taken in this period, even if offered, nor any appeal made for a possible wicket, as we needed the batsman to stay on till we restored our average over rate per hour to 16. Once that was achieved we went back on the offensive, and in the next few overs, some remarkable pieces of fielding sealed the fate of the game, much to the delight of the players and a large number of supporters. In fact, by the time we reached the dressing room, two bottles of champagne had already been delivered with the courtesy of a genial and popular ex- Josephian philanthropist! The celebrations that followed that night at the club went well into the morning hours.
The following days headlines summed it all up.DAILY NEWS - Tamil Unions finest hour; achieve near impossible; DAILY MIRROR - Tamils kings of cricket; SUN - Tamil Unions mathematical magic; ISLAND - Tamils do the incredible.
A week later, in view of the narrowness of the margin of victory, officials of Bloomfield decided to call for a re-scrutiny of the score books. When this was done, it was found that in the very first match of the Premier League Tournament, between Tamil Union and Colts played in January, at the Oval, there had been a scoring error whereby we had not been penalized as we should have been, for a breach of the minimum number of overs that had to be bowled per hour. Marginal though the penalty was, it nevertheless had a decisive effect on the eventual outcome of the tournament.
In addition to my role as captain of the Tamil Union, I was then the Asst Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka and also the Chairman of the Tournament Committee, to whom quite rightly, Bloomfields appeal was addressed. To avoid any conflict of interest, I requested the other members of the tournament committee comprising Ranjit Samarasekera, M.F.A. Khaffar, Vernon Caldera and S.E.G. Perera to look into the matter independently and advise me of their findings.
The position as claimed was confirmed, and on the recalculations, Bloomfield went ahead of the Tamil Union by 0.15 of a point! The tournament committee thereafter forwarded a note to the Board, signed by us all explaining that on a re-scrutiny of the score sheets Bloomfield retained their position at the top of the table by a margin of 0.15 of a point and were therefore the rightful winners of the Lakspray trophy in its inaugural year!
It wasnt an easy pill for the team to swallow considering all the planning that went into the whole tournament and particularly the final match. The margin of 0.15 points in effect represented 30 runs in bonus points and the thought did cross our minds that it may well have been bridged, had we known earlier! It was a very young team that I was privileged to lead that year, and they learnt a crucial lesson through that experience viz it is not always that you get what you feel you deserve, in life.
The disappointment did not prevent us from congratulating Bloomfield on their success. In the final analysis, the noble game, as always, reigned supreme.
The gentlemen who represented the club in that season were:
S Skandakumar (Royal, captain), Indrajith Coomaraswamy (Royal and Harrow vice captain), Lakshman Aloysius, Dushan Soza, Ashley de Silva, Wayne Jansz and Nirmalal Perera (all St. Josephs), Upul Sumathipala, AJ Samarasekera and Athula Samarasekera (all Mahinda), Walter Fernando (St. Peters), S. Shivaraj (Isipathana), Channe Wijemanne (D.S Senanayake), Sudath Munaweera (Prince of Wales), Shantha Jayasekera (S. Thomas, Mt Lavinia), Upul Gunasena and Sujeeva Rajapakse (both Thurstan).

Bali's Deaf Village
Where silence is golden
Those who visit Bali tend to rely on English, which many locals can speak. Fewer visitors have mastered Indonesian, the official language.
Balinese is hardly spoken among those who aren't natives. But up in the jungle of northern Bali, there's an even more elusive, geographically-consolidated language, foreign to even the native Balinese: kata kolok, a language that's never even been spoken.
Kata kolok, known as "the talk of the deaf," is a unique, rural sign language, independent of international or Indonesian sign language. It's been the primary mode of communication in the northern Bali jungle village of Bengkala for generations, where a high percentage of residents are deaf. In Balinese, Bengkala is sometimes called "Desa Kolok"- the deaf village. Bengkala has had a higher than normal deaf-since-birth population for over seven generations. Today, 42 of Bengkala's almost-3,000 villagers have been deaf since birth. By comparison, about two or three births per 1,000 in the United States produce a deaf or hard of hearing child. The high percentage of deafness is caused by a geographically-centric recessive gene, called DFNB3, which has been present in the village for over seven generations. For years, villagers believed the deafness was the result of a curse.
"The famous story is that two people with magic powers fought each other and then cursed each other to be deaf," said Ida Mardana, the mayor of Bengkala village, who speaks Balinese, Indonesian, and English, in addition to signing kata kolok. "The meaning of Bengkala is 'a place for someone to hide.'" Rather than ostracizing deaf residents, villagers in Bengkala have adapted to a deaf lifestyle. Throughout the village, people speak with their hands. Hearing villagers teach their children kata kolok in the home as a second or third language, planting seeds of equality that grow through adulthood - an adulthood that could consist of raising a deaf child of one's own, since almost 10 percent of hearing people in the village carry the recessive deafness gene. "Deaf students learn together with hearing students here," Mardana told me. "The teacher uses speaking and sign language at the same time." As a result, nearly everyone knows kata kolok; the deaf and mute population can communicate with ease. As one writer put it, in a book called Invisible People, "Being deaf [in Bengkala] is not something that is carried by the kolok alone. It's something that belongs to the entire community."
The differences between the deaf and the hearing are smaller here than almost anywhere in the world. "I feel equal like everyone else," signs 72-year-old village elder, Wayan Sandi, pressing his index fingers together to stress the word equal.
"We are one in the community here."
But if communication has become a non-issue for those within the village, it still poses problems outside, where deaf villagers have trouble selling goods at local markets and can't communicate with those who don't know their unique form of sign language. The majority of Bengkala's villagers, like Sandi, are poor farmers who grow bananas, mangoes, guava, and elephant grass, and care for a handful of cows and pigs and a few hundred chickens. At the local market, they have to use weighted stones and hand gestures to sell the fruits of their labor. "Sometimes [the deaf villagers] face a little difficulty communicating," said Kadek Sami, a hearing woman who has two hearing children with a deaf husband.
"But they overcome with simple signing."
The younger generation of deaf in Bengkala have started to embrace new forms of communication - smart phones, social media, and international sign language. In recent years, more deaf teenagers have enrolled in a nearby deaf boarding school in Jimbaran, where they can learn Indonesian Sign Language and integrate with a broader community of deaf people in the country.
Still, only five deaf villagers in Bengkala are literate. For Mardana, who has been the mayor since 2010, that's not good enough. The village is poor and the level of education is low - both problems that are even worse among the deaf villagers who can't communicate with the outside world.
"The kolok [deaf villagers] want to be better people," Mardana said.
"I want them to start getting involved with the community, so they can help themselves and get a better income."
Through Mardana's efforts, the Indonesian government and Indonesian energy giant Pertamina have recently supplied the village with farming infrastructure, new buildings, and programs to provide training in new skills, like weaving, to the kolok. On an international level, scientists, sociologists, and deaf tourists have all trickled into the village to study or simply witness the little-known, genetically-forged society. Few, however, stay long enough to make a lasting impact.
Instead, the most empowering initiative to date has been the introduction and development of janger kolok, or "the dance of the deaf." The specific style of dance, created with Bengkala's deaf population in mind, and has been the pride of Bengkala and the village's most creative outlet for three decades. The Deaf Dancers of Bengkala take the stage roughly three times a month. The group is made up of 16 deaf villagers, ages 16 to 72, who perform synchronized dance routines. While some performances take place in the village and at a local university, their highest profile performances are held at Bali Krishna, a modern exhibition hall in northern Bali. Sandi, the group leader, hopes they will one day become "the number one dance group in all of Indonesia."
The magic, of course, is in the synchronization. Without music, it's difficult to keep rhythm, and yet the Deaf Dancers of Bengkala step perfectly in time with each other, using visual cues to keep the beat.
"I saw the performance once, and they were so enthusiastic that I wanted to help them with their movements," said local singer and volunteer Putu Gedeasnawa. "We are working on synchronizing at the moment. The power of the dance is in the eyes."
All profits from janger kolok in Bengkala go to the dancers, which Mardana hopes will help create a more consistent performance schedule and boost tourism to Bengkala.
The village wants to increase the income of the deaf population, but they also want to increase tourism to the village, to expose others to the "oneness" between deaf and hearing people in Bengkala.
"Outside the village, I assume they think normal is better," signs the 72-year-old Sandi.
"I feel the same as everyone else here in Bengkala."

Where the U.S. went wrong on North Korea
U.S. President Donald Trump came to office clearly determined to reverse his predecessors policy toward North Korea, one that he saw as stagnant and ineffective. The era of strategic patience is over, Trump declared in 2017. Other Republican voices echoed this promise to chart a new path. When Trumps first approach, rooted in threats and bellicosity, offered little reason for optimism, the president shifted to diplomatic engagement.
What harm, many asked, could come from negotiations I dont believe this is a situation where the president has anything to lose, explained former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert. In most cases, such confidence would be justified. What harm could possibly come from diplomatic engagement North Korea, however, is not most cases, and the harm to American interests that appears to be emerging as a direct result of the Singapore talks may prove to be quite significant indeed.
Over the past few months, the American position on the Korean Peninsula has declined in three significant ways that stem directly from Singapore. First, the meetings themselves and the accompanying media coverage gave North Korea a tool to reshape world opinion and drive a wedge into the alliance against it. Trumps decision to engage with this aberrant regime in a traditional head of state format, especially in conjunction with the Norths charm offensive during the Winter Olympic games, helped transmit to the world an image of North Korea as a conventional state, one that might be worth doing business with after all. Shortly after Singapore, public opinion of Kim Jong Un, a mass-murdering tyrant who oversees arguably the worst system of prison camps since World War II, improved dramatically, making it much more difficult to rally the world for action against him, especially as the United States own image as world leader plummets.
Singapore agreement
Consider the U.S.-led sanctions efforts against North Korea. Trump deserves credit for implementing a strict regime when he came to power, but his own policies have now undermined them by normalizing the target. Can anyone imagine China, which was hinting at ending sanctions before the ink was dry on the Singapore agreement and is now engaged in an emerging trade war with the United States, cooperating in future efforts What leverage does the United States have over Russia, whose own interests and recent history will likely drive it to continue developing trade relations with North Korea Even U.S. allies like Canada and the EU states are moving away from the U.S.-led alliance system that dominated the world for much of the last half-century, and are creating their own trade networks and connections that will further diminish American influence. Putting together a large diplomatic coalition is difficult under even the most ideal circumstances; by normalizing North Korea at the same time that Trump was alienating many U.S. partners, the administration has essentially made a difficult task almost impossible.
Second, the potential failure of the diplomatic path is troubling because of the likelihood that it will empower the more hawkish elements within Trumps foreign policy circles. Most notable here is National Security Advisor John Bolton, whose desire for action against North Korea is well chronicled. Given the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute, Bolton wrote in the Wall Street Journal shortly before he assumed office. It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current necessity posed by North Koreas nuclear weapons by striking first. Less bellicose but still troubling statements have come from other administration hawks, including newly appointed South Korean Ambassador Harry Harris, and former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. Other steps  including the leaked bloody nose strategy and the withdrawal of the nomination of Victor Cha as ambassador because of allegations that he might oppose military action  have also sent the message that more aggressive options may be under serious consideration if diplomacy fails.
Military action in Korea may indeed be necessary at some point. But the incredibly disastrous consequences that would likely follow a U.S. first strike means that such a path should only be explored under the most dire circumstances and in the context of a clear and present danger to the United States. A diplomatic effort that fails (as now appears likely) might just provide extra resonance to those potentially calamitous calls for action from the hawks, especially for a politically unpopular president with a tendency to personalize foreign policy and a need to rally a political base.
Arguably the biggest ramification for the United States, however, appears to be in its relations with Seoul. South Korea has been one of Washingtons best allies since its official creation in 1948, and it stands today as a bulwark of U.S. influence in East Asia. Trumps election, however, has thrown this relationship into disarray. The president attacked South Korea on the campaign trail for exploiting its relationship with the United States, castigating them (inaccurately) for providing practically nothing to the costs of U.S. troops stationed there. Subsequent actions, ranging from delaying the appointment of an ambassador to demanding the renegotiation of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and an increased South Korean payment for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system, to overlooking many of the basic diplomatic courtesies that traditionally cemented the alliance, contributed to the weakening of this traditional relationship.

Modern internationally accepted definitions and associated units (SI system), together with chemical formulae for simple compounds and the one two-letter codes for the elements have been introduced. Finally, the abbreviations section has been expanded to cope with the diverse range of acronyms commonly used, especially for international organizations.
After an interval of six years in the year 2000 at the eve of the millennium the Dictionary was completely revised as the fourth edition, was expanded and updated with a board comprised of Prof A J Gunawardena, Prof Chandrasiri Palliyaguru, Piyadasa Hettihewa, Athula Manchanayaka and Percy Jayamanna functioning as the coordinating editor. This edition of the Malalasekara English-Sinhala Dictionary was a landmark as it marked the Golden Jubilee year of the Dictionary which coincided with the birth centenary of Prof G P Malalasekara.

Writ petition seeking national policy for elephant protection
The Centre for Environmental Justice and an Environmental Scientist yesterday filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking an order directing the Wildlife Minister and the Wildlife Department Director General to formulate a National Policy to protect elephants.
The petitioners further sought an order in the nature of writs of certiorari quashing Wildlife Ministers decision to translocate the pair of elephants remaining in the Sinharaja area.
The petitioners sought an order to formulate a National Policy on protection of elephants, including steps to minimise attacks on human beings, acting under and in terms of the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
Petitioner state that measures are being taken by Minister and Director General of Wildlife to translocate the pair of elephants roaming in the Sinharaja arears to a completely a different environment such as Horowpothana or a small plot of land near Kalawana without conducting any scientific study thus risking the lives of the elephants.
Petitioners state that Asian Elephants with scientific name Elephants Maximus living in Sri Lanka is a rare species of animals which is important as part of the biodiversity only lives in isolated populations in 13 states including Sri Lanka is a highly threatened species.
The elephant is a keystone species that the whole ecosystem depends on this single species.
The first national survey of Sri Lankas wild elephants held in 2011 says estimated elephant population is around 5,879 wild elephants including 122 tuskers and 1,107 calves. However, conservation experts question the survey methodology and states that this figure is an over exaggeration. According to the Wildlife Department around 250 elephants are being killed annually and several tuskers have been killed in the last few months.They were killed by gun shots, Hakka Patas, electrification and poisoning.
The petitioners state that Sinharaja is a World Heritage Site and UNESCO had informed and advised Sri Lankan authorities to not to remove any fauna or flora from the heritage site and maximum protection should be given to all fauna and flora lying in the area known as the Sinharaja Rain Forest.
They stated that any movement or translocation of the remaining pair of elephants would definitely violate the conditions laid down by UNESCO.
This petition was filed through Counsel Ravindranath Dabare and Nilmal Wickramasinghe.

TVRS provides greater exposure to global market
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that the Tourist VAT Refund Scheme (TVRS) will enable Sri Lankan goods to have greater exposure to the global market, bringing with it several positive economic spillovers.
He added that VAT is an end user of consumption tax and therefore should not be applied to goods and services that are consumed outside of Sri Lanka
By introducing such a TVRS,Sri Lanka will be aligning itself with international best practices, the minister added.
The Minister was speaking at the opening of the Tourist VAT Refund Scheme (TVRS) at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday.
Samaraweera added that neighbouring countries including Thailand and Singapore, have become regional shopping centres and utilizing VAT free shopping has been an impetus to this.
Year around, tourists would visit increasingly for the sole purpose of shopping and international retailers have as a result invested heavily in these countries.
The TVRS has a particular importance for enhancing the attraction of Colombo as a destination.Today most tourists tend to bypass Colombo for attractions outside of the capital city, the Minister said.
He added that there are already a number of shopping destinations with major global brands beginning to get established in Sri Lanka.This trend can only benefit and further expand with the tourist VAT refund mechanism.
Minister Samaraweera stressed that the government has made progress in tax collection and compliance which will help servicing outstanding debt repayments.
The government is equally concerned to ensure that the taxation is fair, convenient and as non distortive as possible, he added.

AGSEP to invest Euro 40 mn in apartment complex
The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.) which own and operate the 22 cabana Hotel property in Marawila will re invest on a large seven storeyed apartment complex.
Founder and Chief Executive Officer of A.G.S.E.P. Dietmar Doering said that this 200 apartment complex would be to attract long stay guests mainly from Germany. He said that they hope to invest around Euro 40 million projects along with two other German investors.
He said that in addition to sport exchange programs and hotels they are also involved in research. AGSEPs recently released research findings reveals key observations on the tourism industry and impediments which are hindering further growth and economic benefits.
Comparing other popular Asian tourist destinations, the report noted that Sri Lanka remains an underperforming destination. According to statistics of annual tourist arrivals among Asian countries, while Thailand and Malaysia enjoy over 35 million and 26 million respectively, Vietnam 10 million, Philippines 5 million and Laos 3 million, Sri Lanka is comparatively lower with approximately 2 million only.
Citing an example the report states that, Thailands Pattaya, through events and sports grew its visitors from 6.2 million arrivals in 2007 to 9.2 million in 2015. Similarly, through the development of reciprocal sports exchange programmes with Malaysias Langkawi Local Authority, Sri Lanka too can increase its visitor ratio.
Based on the findings, the 80% of the visitors experienced no negative effects as a result of the onset of monsoon season, while the deprived sectors as a result of these perceptions being Sri Lankas hospitality sector.
Overall, based on the results of the survey, visitors had a positive result of their stay. 96% of tourists had felt welcomes, 84% confirmed they could make contact with locals and 80% praised the friendly, helpful and open-minded Sri Lankans.
Results and impressions of countrys natural beauty are also promising among visitors. With over 90% of those polled cited the opinion as true being the variety of Sri Lankas nature as fascinating.

Dietmar Doering however said that when it comes to investments it takes a longer time due to uncalled for red tape. He also said that their hotel too had an issue where one of its parapet walls was broken down and despite several complains no action has been taken by the Marawila Police. We have now brought this matter up with Minister of Tourism John Amaratunge and even the Police Commission and hope some action would be taken.

Brazil prison break: 92 inmates escape
BRAZIL: Heavily armed men blew down the front gate of a maximum security prison in northeastern Brazil early Monday and with guns blazing enabled 92 inmates to escape while killing a policeman, authorities said.
Officials said the assault was carried out by about 20 men in four vehicles who fired on watchtowers and used explosives to destroy the front gate of the Romeu Goncalves Abrantes prison.
A policeman shot in the assault later died in hospital. There were no other reports of deaths or injuries.
The prison, a maximum security facility with 680 inmates, is located in Joao Pessoa, the capital of Paraiba state.
Heavily armed men knocked down the main gate after an exchange of fire with police and penitentiary agents, the states secretariat for prisons said. By midday, 41 of the 92 escaped prisoners had been recaptured as security forces locked down the state capital, closing schools and medical centers as a precaution. More than a thousand police officers were mobilized to take part in the search, authorities said.
State prisons secretariat head, Colonel Sergio Fonseca de Souza, said the aim of the assault was to free three suspects arrested a year ago for an armed assault using explosives.
Brazil has the worlds third largest prison population, with 726,712 inmates as of June 2016, according to official statistics.
The population is double the capacity of the nations prisons, which in 2016 was estimated to be 368,049 inmates.
The whole of Brazil is going through this situation, military police Colonel Euller Chaves told reporters.
Along with severe overcrowding, Brazils prisons are plagued by gang violence, and riots and breakout attempts are not uncommon. In April, a military-style battle erupted between guards and prisoners aided by outside associates, leaving 21 people dead at a prison in Belem, near the Amazon rainforest. The attackers in that case also were heavily armed and tried to blow up a wall to help the would-be escapees. One policeman was killed alongside 20 prisoners and their associates. In February, 18 people were taken hostage during a prison riot near Rio de Janeiro, although guards managed to retake control without anyone being killed.
A month earlier, though, another prison riot in the central state of Goias ended in a blaze that left nine people dead.
A year before that, Brazilian police had to launch a massive manhunt after 184 inmates escaped from two prisons in Amazonas state following a gruesome 17-hour bloodbath between rival gangs that left 56 prisoners dead, many beheaded. - AFP

Case against optimizing your life
Many people I know are on a quest to optimize their lives  some of my favorite people in the world will spend days trying to perfect a productivity system, get things automated, or find the perfect software for anything theyre doing. They are on a continual search for the perfect diet, the perfect work routine, the perfect travel setup.
Optimizing can take quite a bit of time and energy. What would happen if we let go of optimizing Who would we be without the idea that we should optimize everything
One idea is that if we decided not to optimize everything, wed stop caring, stop trying to make things better, and live suboptimal lives. But I know myself pretty well  I will always care, even if I am not trying to optimize. I will always do my best, which is different than optimizing  its taking care and giving love, even if things arent optimized. I believe most of you are this way, pouring your hearts into something with pure love, without needing to make everything perfect.
So why shouldnt we optimize And what would it be like if we didnt
I dont think people who optimize are idiots (many of the smartest people do it), nor is it a life-ruining thing to try to optimize. Ive done it many times.
But consider: The savings never get realized. When you try to optimize, you are spending some of your precious life moments trying to find the perfect setup. Sure, once youre done, things will theoretically be set up perfectly from then on, so over the long run you should save a lot of time and effort, right Well, first, lets acknowledge that theres a big cost to optimizing up front. And the savings would only be realized after running the optimal system or method for a good while. Unfortunately most people who optimize dont just set it up and forget it  they continue to try to optimize over and over. Its a never-ending quest, so the cost keeps adding up but the savings never catches up.
Optimizing is a trap of dissatisfaction. Optimizing is the quest for something as close to perfect as you can get it. But thats an unrealistic ideal. It doesnt really exist.

Ceylinco Life launches Guru Abhiman
An exclusive retirement plan designed specifically to enable teachers to save for their retirement has been launched by Ceylinco Life in recognition of the societal importance of this segment.
Branded Guru Abhiman as a tribute to the demographic, the plan provides a means for teachers to receive monthly payments or a lump sum within 10 years of commencement or at the time of their retirement.
Starting at just Rs 1,500 a month, the Guru Abhiman Retirement Plan offers teachers the option of saving monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annuallyfor an agreed period.
It offers tax-free returns unlike other savings plans in the market, and provides adequate savings to experience a comfortable and independent retirement in the midst of rising living costs. The plan also offers higher returns at maturity by calculating interest on the accumulated account balance on a monthly basis.
Commenting on the launch of this unique retirement plan, Ceylinco Life Director and Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said, The launch of Guru Abhiman aligns with our viewthat teaching is a valued profession and that it is important to uplift the lives of retired teachers financially, as a tribute to their dedicated service. We are aware of the problem of teachers having limited welfare facilities and social security despite the pivotal role they play shaping future generations. We hope this retirement plan will provide a safety net in their retirement.
According to the Census and Statistics survey of 2016, there are more than 230,000 teachers working in public or private sector schools and educational institutes in Sri Lanka. Most struggle with balancing their finances after they retire owing to the fact that the pensionssome of them receive are not adequate to cater to their needs unless they have additional financial support from family.
The Guru Abhiman plan takes into consideration that with life expectancy in Sri Lanka expected to rise to 78 years, retirement plans of this nature are needed to cater to periods of retirement of 18 years or more.
Ceylinco Life has created a range of Retirement Plans that offer a higher accumulation rate than the interest rates on most Fixed Deposit and savings accounts.
Sri Lankas life insurance market leader since 2004, Ceylinco life has close to a million lives covered by active policies. The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Very often people suffer from diarrhea after consuming food from these unhygienic restaurants.
Refrigerators where the hoteliers keep fish and meat are unclean. The kitchens of these places are not clean. Wash basins are dirty. Most of the hotel workers are not dressed properly. They are not trained to be clean and hygienic. There is CMC Public Health Department. They are not given enough power to control the hoteliers. They should be given more power. CMC has to do that.

The current expansion includes the new state-of-the-art workshop and museum in addition to the existing laboratory, auditorium and the near-real replica of the gem mine.
This resplendent outlet lays claim to Tieshs commitment towards enhancing the customer experience and feeling of being part of something more than the mere purchase of a dazzling piece of jewellery. It is an immersive journey into a culture, spawned centuries ago, in a land which continues to appeal to the heart of gems and jewellery connoisseurs from around the world, said its visionary Founder and Managing Director, Lasantha de Fonseka, adding that customers will be enthralled by Sri Lankas gemological story. The success of Tiesh as Sri Lankas leading gems and jewellery provider is also due to the dedication and passion of my family, staff, tour operators and loyal customers.
Over the years Tiesh has burgeoned into a brand of great repute. The 27,000sq foot Emporium features an exquisite array of authentic gems and handcrafted pieces of jewellery set in both precious and semi-precious gemstones, highlighting the world famed Sri Lankan Blue Sapphires and more.

This family-owned establishment which began on 05 September 1997, has, over the past three decades acquired great celebrity status in the local and international sphere. Spearheaded by its Founder / Managing Director Lasantha De Fonseka and his wife Bryony, Tiesh is joined by the equally hands-on next generation, with daughter Thiyasha and son Ayesh who are committed to providing an unparalleled expertise and a personal interest in each customer who steps into a world of brilliance.
The Tiesh Emporium is designed with the intention of sparking an appeal to delve into the milestones of the gem industry; from the history of the stones to the entire production, prior to becoming a gift of love, a family heirloom or an indulgence to the customer.
As one of Sri Lankas leading contemporary jewellers, Tiesh is not only a jewellery store with a reputation to match. It is also an engaging and hands-on learning experience. It inspires that ethereal feel of being ensconced in a world of ones own, in which gems and jewellery take precedence.

Deported Lankan  asylum seekers arrested
The CID had arrested nine Sri Lankan men yesterday when they arrived in the country having been deported from Australia. They were produced before the Negombo Magistrates Court yesterday.
The Police Media Spokesmans office told the Daily News that the nine men who had gone to Australia at various stages and had claimed refugee status had been deported by the Australian Government on a special charted flight yesterday. Upon their arrival, the CID had taken the men into custody. They are in the age group of 27, 29, 36 and 48 years and are residents of Munalama, Kochchikade, Udappuwa, Chillaw, Vavuniya, Batticaloa and Trincomalee, the police said.
According to the Guardian, the Sri Lankan asylum seekers had been forcibly deported back to Sri Lanka, having been put on a specially chartered jet that left Perth at 2am yesterday. Some of the men deported had been in detention for more than six years in Australia, while others still had challenges before Australian courts pending.
Guardian Australia has been provided with details of some of those returned but has chosen not to name them out of concern for their safety. Several had reported to Australian authorities they had previously been abducted and tortured by security forces in Sri Lanka.
The asylum seekers were transported from detention centres across Australia and taken to Perth, from where they were flown out on a charter flight run by Skytraders.

When the pressure is on and you have to perform you find the strength within you. Perfect Prefects features Head Boy of Lyceum Panadura Sanuda Ranawake and Head Girl of Lyceum Panadara Dinithi Perera who have been trained to be efficient leaders.
Perera believes that confidence and honesty can remove a ton of distress. When you are honest you do yourself a great duty and you also make it easy for others to work with you. When you are honest and self- confident you have that sense of well- being. You are fair to yourself and you are fair to others. You can accomplish your goals with clarity,
A proper role model should be kind, should care about everyone and should always try to do the right thing as much as possible. He or she should be honest, and his/her honesty should go hand in hand with his/her confidence. As an honest and confident leader, he/she should be able to handle pressure and work in whatever circumstances he or she is in.
Role model
Perera is a someone who takes up a challenge analytically. She approaches a problem in a very organized way.
When facing a challenge it could be best if you take it to step by step, just lay it all out and tackle every step as it comes along, said Perera.
Family and friendship is one reason why Perera is successful. Along with her confidence comes the support she has from her loved ones.
When talking about my secret to success as a Head Girl, my role model has been my sister. She was the former head girl of Lyceum Panadura as well. I have always admired her, and what she used to do and she has helped me a lot throughout this journey. I get help from my friends and family and I must say that I am confident and I can face the world, said Perera.
Perera points out that Lyceum instils excellent values in its students. The environment is very conducive for learning and the teachers are extremely helpful.
I have been to Lyceum Panadura since I started schooling and it has given me a lot of friends. We are always taught good values - being loving and caring and being honest. Our seniors have been very exemplary characters throughout the past and still are. Everyone is supportive and helps out, moulding us into being better characters, said Perera
Meaningful life
Perera has received so much from Lyceum, that she is equipped to help others in society. She feels that our values are what makes life meaningful and defines who we are as a human race.
I would like to pass on the values that we all have so that the new generation will have better qualities and retain our values, love their parents and take care of this earth will live in, said Perera.
Perera has an upbeat attitude and is ready to face lifes challenges and enjoy life. However, she has never forgotten her calling in life which is to help those who are experiencing a lot of distress in their minds. Too often we think that we are all alone. But there are so many out there with similar problems or even worse than ours.
One thing that concerns me is the psychological problems that kids have today. Young kids suffer from depression and being stressed and they have a whole lot of problems that are not addressed. I would like to do something regarding that. I want to help children understand that the world is not all bad. And if we have self- confidence we can overcome the negativity and reduce all of it and stop the suicidal rate, said Perera
Passion and challenge
I am thinking about doing a degree in biomedical sciences and once I complete, that I want to go wherever life takes me and face any challenge and find my passion from there on, Perera
Head Boy of Lyceum Panadura Sanuda Ranawake points out that having a Head Prefect is something that makes a difference in the lives of students in Sri Lanka. Because there is always someone that is there if you need to speak to someone other than your parents. Someone who has probably gone through what you are going through.
I think the main kind of role model any young people need is someone they can look up to. If I see Bill Gates, he is like a role model, because he has a lot of exemplary characteristics, so we too need to display those exemplary characteristics. One thing is we need to be honest with people. We should not lie or cheat. We need to take care of people really well. As prefects, we have a lot of experience. We should be very nice to people. If we dont do that we get into a lot of trouble with people. So that is what makes a really good role model, said Ranawake.
When facing a difficulty Ranawake, tries to understand if he has faced such a situation before. He also looks towards those who are wise enough to help him.
Any time I get a problem, one thing I look at is my past experiences. I try to see what happened in the past and then I try to solve the problem I am experiencing at the present. I even look at the people I know, the role models I have, and I try and get a solution from them. It could be my parents or teachers it could be any person I could learn something from, and solve that problem, said Ranawake
Leadership role
Ranawake too like Perera has a support system. A group of people who love him no matter what.
My secret to success is that I am an announcer in the school and that has given me self- confidence and even from my younger days announcing has helped me become a leader, and take leadership roles. The other thing is my parents. No matter what happens even if there is a huge problem they stick behind my back and they help me and they are the ones in the end who help me get through that, said Ranawake.
Like Perera, he too feels that values must be passed down to the younger generation. That is what we are like as a human race. We want to pass down something of ourselves to our children. So that who we are may never die.
One of the things I would like to do is to pass on my leadership characteristics onto the younger ones. That would be my ultimate goal. Also when it comes to my personal ambitions, from a very young age I wanted to become a computer programmer. Another goal I want to achieve is to become a journalist because I like to report on things and tell the truth, added Ranawake.
Cruelty is something that Ranawake is appalled by. He is greatly distressed and horrified by this cruelty.
War really hurts me. Even if I see something on the news because of war it really hurts me. It is really depressing and hard to look at. Another thing is getting people to use new technologies. Plans to give technology to all part of the world and Sri Lanka really get me excited. That is one of my main passions to get technology and reduce the war and the violence, explains Ranawake

President Maithripala Sirisena said the education syllabus must teach not only how to pass examinations but also show how to lead a contented life.
He was speaking at the Kotawaya Maha Vidyalaya in Hambantota where he vested the newly constructed two-storey building and the new technology laboratory with the students on Monday.
The President also undertook a visit of the school and spoke to the students.
President Sirisena said although free education created many scholars and intellectuals, the knowledge of how to lead a contented life is limited. He said intellectuals should lead a campaign to stop ragging in universities. Teachers and parents too must be vigilant of brutal ragging. Changes will be made in the education system to ensure that children learn how to succeed in life in addition to passing examinations.

Ford Donates US$10,000 to World Vision Lanka
Ford Motor Company and local distribution partner, Future Automobiles (Pvt) Limited, recently announced a US$ 10,000 grant to World Vision Lanka under the Ford Conservation and Environmental Grants initiative.

The US$ 10,000 grant from Ford Motor Company Fund  the philanthropic arm of Ford Motor Company  will be used to provide sustainable safe water sources for local residents in Uchchamunai islands. The facilities will help reduce the daily challenges that more than 40 families face in obtaining daily water supply as the available well water is not potable due to its high salinity.

Friendships like transactions
How are your friendship metricsgot lots of pals Would you rate them five stars or less Are they helping you live your best life
We can quantify everything nowfrom our steps on Fitbit to our literary consumption on Goodreads. As a result, we feel we must make everything and everyone count for something. Thats a phenomenon which is both distressing and depressing as it applies to friendship.
Scan the internet and youll see no end of posts advising you to toss toxic friends and surround yourself with people who make you feel good instead. The current cultural discourse suggests that friends are people who we use to improve ourselves, and get rid of when the going gets tough or if were not having enough fun. One BuzzFeed article goes so far as to suggest forgetting a birthday is a dump-worthy offense, while a Cosmopolitan article recommends tossing friends who binge-drink on a Saturday night.
The way we talk about friendship paints an ugly picture of the new notion of relatingone that seeks maximum return on minimal investment, and outlines an exit strategy anytime a friend doesnt fulfill our fantasies. These posts reveal more about the toxicity of our society than the negative people theyre describing. Its friendship as a capitalistic exchange, instead of relationships involving people who care about each other, hanging out, and helping each other through lifes ups and downs.
Its enough to make you want to cry into a beer with a confidanteyou know, a close friend of the kind thats going out of style.
Take, for example, a recent New York Times article about the power of positive people (paywall), which asks, Are your friendships giving you a boost or bringing you down In it, Tara Parker-Pope, just back from a wellness cruise filled with upbeat personalities, advises readers to be mindful of their relationships for the sake of a long life. Buoyed by the experience, I returned home with a renewed commitment not only to exercise and healthful living, but to simply step up my social life and spend more time hanging out with happy people, she writes.
Pity her pals. Lets hope none of them are struggling, sad, or in need of a friend, because it seems shell be preoccupied trying to find more positive people. While many of us focus primarily on diet and exercise to achieve better health, science suggests that our well-being also is influenced by the company we keep, she writes. The article advises choosing friends wisely for how they improve heath and directs readers to a quiz about optimizing friendships.
The Blue Zones quiza reference to blue zones of the world where people seem to live longermeasures your health and longevity and that of three close associates with questions about exercise, weight, diet, smoking, drinking, and mood, providing a numerical score (of course!) for you and your buddies. Research shows that friends can have a long-term impact on our health. In fact, if your best friends are obese, youre about twice as likely to be overweight, the site explains. Under the logic of the quiz, if your friends have a streak of bad days, smoke cigarettes, loathe jogging, or have a weakness for pastries, theyre actually dragging you down.
You can find advice on toxic friendships pretty much everywhere else on the internet, too. HuffPo warns that bad pals are smart, stubborn, fussy, harsh, and pessimistic, to name just a few of their negative traits. Presumably the takeaway is that a healthy friend is a stupid pushover with no standards who sees the glass (with a non-alcoholic beverage) as half-full, always, and wont acknowledge any feeling but optimism.
Business Insider says toxic people do inappropriate things, like show up at your house uninvited and unannounced. Theyre needy, make you feel responsible for them, and copy you. Instead, seek friends who find you uninspiring, never inconvenience you, follow strict social rules even in an emergency, and have no sense of protectiveness. - Quartz

Healthy food trick
Most parents tell their kids not to play with their food, but this talented mom has turned it into an art form!
When Laleh Mohmedi wanted to encourage her three-year-old son, Jacob, to eat more healthy foods, she decided to get creative.
I have always been a strong advocate in healthy organic eating for children, Mohmedi, who lives in Melbourne, Australia, told ABC News.
Last May, I decided to turn Jacobs spelt pancakes into a lion. He absolutely loved it and it progressed from there.
Mohmedi posted the lion on Facebook and was surprised by all the positive reactions she got on social media. She started an Instagram account to document her incredible food creations, and today she has more than 51,000 fans. Mohmedi doesnt have any formal artistic training, but she has gift for transforming raw ingredients like kale, avocado, potato and tortillas into incredible portraits of Disney characters and other cartoon favorites.
She made a portrait of Elsa from Disneys Frozen from garlic and spinach fettuccine with parsnip, potato and mashed beets. Her son, Jacob, has a lot of input into the characters she makes, Mohmedi told ABC News.
Jacob tells me which character he would like for me to make, be it from a book, a movie or something that has caught his eye that day.

HNB Walk-The-Talk  challenge
In a bid to reduce its carbon footprint, employees of Sri Lankas premier private sector bank, HNB PLC attached to HNB Head Office choosing eco- friendlier commuting options as part of the banks inaugural Walk-The-Talk challenge.
The carpark at HNBs Head Office in Colombo 10 was left vacant as every employee reaffirmed their commitment to HNBs Green Pledge, arriving at work taking public transport or carpooling, while many more cycled or walked to work, recently.
Upon their arrival, each employee was provided a glass of Kola Kanda (herbal energy drink). Staff enjoyed the company of each other on the footsteps of the Banks Head Office building, signifying the credo - Passion in everything we do.
As one of Sri Lankas largest and most successful banks, we feel that it is incumbent on us to always seek out methods of reducing our carbon foot print. In the fight against climate change, even small actions can add up to a major positive change. Walk The Talk is our way of helping to initiate change and inspire action, HNB Managing Director and CEO Jonathan Alles said.
In line with HNBs Green Pledge to instill environmental standards and consciousness into every employees daily work and office environment, the first ever Walk-The-Talk was a tremendous success, with over 150 vehicles that would normally have arrived at HNB not being utilized, saving over 600 litres of fuel consumption and resultant emissions.
With Walk The Talk, the HNB team is attempting to spark a positive change that will be sustained and grow exponentially over time. It is vital for the management to set a tone for sustainable initiatives. More important is employee engagement to ensure that an initiative is not only sustained but inculcated over time into the culture of our organization, and personal lifestyles of each of our employees.
We foster a culture that encourages employees to actively engage with environmental causes. We aim to be an example for our industry, the wider corporate sector and the nation as a whole, HNB, Deputy General Manager  HR/ Chief Human Resource Officer, Chiranthi Cooray said.
The Green Pledge has been the central platform from which HNBs sustainability initiatives have been launched. Moving forward, Cooray stated that Walk-The-Talk initiative will be gradually expanded in order to exponentially increase the effectiveness and impact of this initiative, each year.

CABINET APPROVES minister Swaminathans MEMORANDUM:
LAWS TO BAN ANIMAL SACRIFICE IN HINDU TEMPLES
Cabinet has approved a proposal to enact laws banning the ritualistic sacrifice of animals in Hindu temples yesterday.
A Cabinet memorandum in this regard submitted by Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan was approved.
Hindu Cultural Affairs Director Uma Maheswaran told the Daily News that the slaughter of animals such as goats and fowls in Hindu temples would be banned by this legislation. He said the Cabinet-approved draft legislation would be sent to the Legal Draftsmans Department for final consent. It will then be sent to the Attorney Generals Department and published in the gazette. He said the law would come into effect once passed by Parliament.
According to the Cabinet Memorandum, animal and bird sacrifices in Hindu Temples or its precincts will be prohibited.
One of the primitive methods of worship is animal and bird sacrifices, while the majority of Hindus do not accept the practice. Slaughtering of animals is carried out in public in open courtyard of the temple without considering health and mental harm of the devotees. Legislation to ban animal sacrifice in Hindu temples is operative in India. The members of Parliament representing the Hindu Community and Hindu Association in Sri Lanka are of unanimous view that sacrifices of any living being in the name of Hindu Religion should be banned and made a punishable offence, the Cabinet memorandum elaborated.
Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan, delivering a ruling in a case filed by the All Ceylon Hindu Maha Sabha against the killings of animals at the Kavunawatte Narasimmar Kovil festival in October last year, prohibited the slaughter of animals in Hindu kovils.
Fundamental characteristics of most of the religions are Ahimsa and non-cruelty towards all living being. Hindu Religion practiced by a substantial section of the Sri Lankan population is vigorously preaching this concept and declares it as sinful and advocates the prevention of killing of any living being, the Cabinet memorandum noted.
There is no institutionalised structure for the regulation of activities carried out in the name of Hindu Religion. Almost all Hindu temples and religious institutions in the country are managed by individuals or management committees elected by people. There is no regulatory mechanism to impose or guide line or instruction unified practice in these temples and left in the hands of these individuals or Management Committees, it added.

Microfinance lenders targeting poverty-striken women - UN expert
The UN independent expert on foreign debt and human rights, Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky yesterday said that microfinance lenders are targeting women in areas that are below the poverty line and affected by war and these institutions charge upto 220 per cent interest rates for their loans as compound interest.
Bohoslavsky added that some cases have been reported to him where women have been pressured by debt collectors to exchange sexual favours for outstanding instalments.
I have also learned of cases of borrowers who have tried to sell their kidneys for money to repay loans, Bohoslavsky added.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the end of his nine day official tour of Sri Lanka yesterday.
The mechanism has been designed to make huge profits for the lenders and put a very heavy burden on the shoulders of the largely poor female borrowers, he stressed
Bohoslavsky noted that human rights should be at the center of all efforts to create economic growth that would benefit everyone and have an equitable distribution of wealth.
He further said that the Sri Lankan Government should undertake an assessment of the human rights impact of both its economic reform policies and infrastructure projects. All international lenders and donors I met in Colombo expressed concerns for the environment and human rights implications of the projects they finance. However, ,none of them have in place a human rights impact assessment framework. Some mentioned social and gender impact evaluations conducted before taking the final decision on the project, but the legal standards against which the projects are assessed were not clear and the result of these evaluations are not publicly available. Therefore, I advise international finical partners to establish more robust frame works to assess the human rights implications of the projects, covering both substantive and procedural rights.
The strategy chosen by the Government, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), was to stabilize the economy by strengthening the fiscal and external sectors via international borrowing. It also included developing mega infrastructure projects, many of them launched during previous administrations, Bohoslavsky said.
Servicing this debt is now the countrys most important expenditure, and a significant amount of borrowing is being allocated for this purpose, he added.
However, social spending should not be cut in order to repay growing debts if less harmful policy options are available. There are other options to consider. These include boosting domestic demand through progressive tax reforms, expanding social benefits, increasing minimum wages and renegotiating the debt with creditors in order to generate revenues to ensure that no one is left behind, Bohoslavsky stressed.
This government has advanced strict measures to reduce fiscal deficit, aiming to reach the 3.5 percent target by 20202. Significant efforts have been deployed by the government to maintain macroeconomic stability and a range of reforms were adopted to serve that goal. Besides fiscal consolidation measures, there were also reforms on its social safety net programmes. Sri Lankas vision 2025 programe implemented by present government lays out a series of announced measures for 2025 including deregulatory reforms impacting on land and the labour market.
In my view, while maintaining macroeconomic stability is an important concern, this aim should not prevent human rights assessments of these planned reforms, in line with international human rights standards.
I also welcome the announced raise in expenditure on education and health in 2018 . Yet, it was brought to my attention that social spending has not always matched budget estimations in the past. Government has expressed its intention of engaging in public private partnerships in important social sectors such as health, education, etc. These efforts of public private partnerships should not replace the Governments primary obligation of ensuring the economic, social and cultural rights equally among everyone and its obligation in allocating maximum available resources.
There is a consensus that a greater mobilisation of resources is needed. It has been estimated that the majority of all illicit financial flows in the world are related to cross-border tax-related transactions. However, because tax evasion is not considered a predicate offence in the country, banks do not have a duty to report suspicious transactions of their clients in relation to tax evasion. I urge the Government to close this legal gap, the expert said.
The government has taken measures to broaden its tax base. Yet, high fiscal deficit remains and public finances are affected by limited reserves. I would like to highlight the adoption of the Inland Revenue Act in 2017, which contributes to simplify tax collection and expand the tax base. Similarly, I recognize efforts deployed by the Government to tackle existent discretion regarding tax exemptions. However, it is my view that further steps need to be taken in order to ensure that income and wealth taxes effectively and sufficiently generate public revenues while reducing economic and social inequality in the country.
Since the end of the war in 2009, large-scale infrastructure projects including the Colombo Outer Circular Expressway, power plants, the Hambantota Port and Hambantota Airport have been started across the country.

Milk of human suffering
Translations of books from one language to another, over the years, served as a vital role played in the understanding of various nuances in the cross cultural communication. When the celebrated poet, Robert graves, translated Greek myths and legends from the original sources into English, it happened to be a pioneering turning point in the study of two more cultures in comparison.
This too ushered in an era of the study of comparative literary phenomena. Today as we take literature in a broad perspective, the translations have entered into a new sphere of recognition. Those who have excelled in two or more languages have introduced the global nature of literary studies via the translation method employed by them. One good example comes from the pioneer translations on the part of David Magarshak in his function as a translator of Russian classics such as War and Peace and Crime and Punishment into English. This has paved the way to bring out quite a number of other original works. This two enabled those works to be translated into other world languages.
Better translations
As the translations abound the book purchasing scene in our countries, the publishers concerned stress the need for better translations, significantly from various, so far unintroduced cultures. One good example that I happened to encounter comes from Mexico. The original work in English is titled as The Burning Plain, a collection of short stories by Juan Fulfo translated into Sinhala by Satyapala Galketiya, a well known Sinhala translator. The Sinhala translation is titled as Devena Tenna (Graphico, 2018). To his credit, Galketiya had brought out several volumes of translations prior to the attempt. These include Gibran, Tagore, Hesse and several others of fame.
In this volume of translated short stories by Juan Rulfo (1917  1986) Galketiya gives a brief account of the original writer and his literary techniques enabling the reader to grasp the inherent ideologies linked to the original creative flux. Rulfo, it is recorded, has written only one only one novel titled as Pedro Paramo which was translated into Sinhala by the late cinematographer cum university lecturer Dharmasiri Pathiraja.
This collection of short stories, according to the translator Galketiya, is the only short story collection compiled by Rulfo. ON reading the short stories as translated into Sinhala, I found that they envelop various facets of human experiences that had led the people of Mexico live in poverty, disaster and at times in stress and disillusion. The translator makes the reader grip tightly into these experiences.
Religious nuances
As could be gauged via these translations, some short stories revolve round the much discussed literary topic of religious nuances such as truth-seeking, the concept of transience, the need for the perceiving of spirituality etc. The example could be drawn from stories such as Api Hari Duppath (We are Very Poor) and Minisa (The Man). It is the latent skill of the original writer who makes the reader feels that the unseen layer of human experiences ought to be perceived through a vision of fantasy and introspection.
As such, few stories embrace the expressive technique involved in the fantasy and magic realism, that is explored as the pioneer communicative form as laid down in the religious tales. The attempt on the part of the translator in the introduction of Rulfo to Sinhala readers is commendable. Firstly the human experiences embedded, though are age-old, they nevertheless are modern, and addressed the modern sensitivity. Davena Tenna (The Burning Plain) stories are symbolic of the pains and pleasures that are momentary in the living conditions of humans in struggle, poverty and death.
Perhaps a discerning reader may find that the conventional storytelling from has been grossly transcended or at times changed in order to narrate the human experiences. One such example is the translation of the story titled The Hill of the Comrades. Here the reader feels that protagonist narrator tells the nature f his struggle in twofold expressions: his own self as well as his inner soul. Thus, it is a narrative which is a real one as well as fantasy.
Human beings
The story titled Luvina is an episode from the life of a group of human beings torn between the spell of nature as well as individuals in search of new pastures. They are a team of people who go from one place to another in search of resting their bodies in order to relax. But it reminds of the dictum, wherever the man goes, he is bound by chains. Man perceives the bliss of the nature as well as disaster it causes in turn.
The story titled Ovun Ohu Tanikaradama Giya Rathriya (The Night They Left Him Alone) revolves round a tired and lonely old soldier who is beign abandoned by fellow mates. But the man relieves himself of his rifle stung on the shoulder that is found as bullet-free and throws off his tattered garments. Thus, he becomes free from not only the bodily burdens, but also from his mind targeted to fellow feelings and teamwork. Here is a portrait of a man getting freed from all his bonds and runs away to enjoy for the first time the bliss of nature. But will he find that, is the question raised inner layer of the narrative. I found the short and long narrative packed with the human feelings heeded for all times. Thus, once again, I feel that the process of good translations could enrich the literature in a multifaceted way.

NYMUN is the largest youth MUN platform in Sri Lanka, as youth pursuing all kinds of education and those engaging in professional careers participate on a single platform. This has opened opportunities to youth to join MUN and renew their passion for international relations, policy-planning and forming discussions on local and global issues.
While its conferences in 2016 and 2017 were highly successful in developing the understanding of foreign affairs and inculcating diplomacy skills among its participating delegates, the conference in 2018 hopes to instill a much wider scope of skill-sets for the optimal benefit of its delegates.
Given its overall vision, the conference is based on the theme of youth, peace and security with special emphasis on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2250. Since its inception in 2016, NYMUN has and will continue to encourage its delegates to channel their discussions through Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be in line with the global development agenda. With aspirations to expand the conference to eliminate the barrier of language, NYMUN 2018 looks to expand trilinguality through working towards Vision 2020.
Vision 2020 (V2020) is an initiative taken by NYMUN solely to tap into the full potential of youth across the island and give them an opportunity to voice their ideas and innovative solutions that would address root causes and bring about advanced systematic changes.
V2020 is focused on creating a national youth assembly to make sure the voice of youth is considered by relevant authorities to ensure greater fairness in political, legal and economic systems and safeguard fundamental rights.
There has never been a better opportunity to organise youth across Sri Lanka to tackle such issues and in fact, this will be the first-ever youth assembly to engage youth from all the nine provinces covering provincial youth clubs and societies, universities, other youth organisations and individual participants who are keen to bring tangible change for a better Sri Lanka.
This entails a three-phased programme spanning a timeline of three years. The first and most fundamental phase is to inform and expose youth of the country to the activities of a UN simulation.
Therefore, this year, in addition to the main conference to be held in Colombo, the NYMUN Secretariat seeks to organise eight provincial workshops which will focus on a simulation of the UN and its various bodies and include many other informative sessions, while providing a platform for youth to develop their public-speaking and conflict-resolution abilities.
The second phase, to happen in 2019, is to organise Provincial Model United Nations (MUN) including all nine provinces. This would incorporate three provinces into a single conference in which the best delegates from each province will participate. The Provincial MUNs allow the participants to discuss global topics at a local level in order to adopt international norms and principles to the local context.
The third and final phase would be executed in 2020, where the best delegates from all the nine provinces of Sri Lanka would participate in a bigger and better assembly and voice their opinions, ideas and beliefs to lead the way and bring revolutionary change for a better nation.
The Model United Nations is built on open minds and fresh ideas. On the two days of the conference, delegates will represent the United Nations, people from all countries coming together to find solutions through constructive debate and an exchange of ideas. This open-mindedness would encourage the essence of successful diplomacy  the ability to understand and analyse all positions, including those that one opposes.
NYMUN 2018 returns with the enactment of six different committees, out of which two would be trilingual. The committees are the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), The First Committee: Disarmament and International Security (DISEC), The Fourth Committee: Special Political and Decolonization (SPECPOL), United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development (CSTD), United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) .
A session during NYMUN 2017
NYMUN believes that a peaceful and inclusive society is the pre-condition for national integration and reconciliation. The youth play a pivotal role in the journey of achieving it. By engaging 1,500 youth across Sri Lanka, NYMUN looks to promote increased participation in terms of local discourse, thereby enabling the youth of this nation to recognise their potential and lead the country towards sustainable peace and development.
To quote Shakespeare, Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.
The Executive Committee expects nothing short of greatness for NYMUN 2018 and extends a warm welcome to all young leaders of Sri Lanka to join them for a conference that offers a dynamic experience, beyond just an award or a certificate.

NAVY NABS TRAWLER WITH 90
The Navy foiled an attempt by 90 Sri Lankans to sail to the Reunion Island yesterday.
Navy Spokesman Lt. Commander Dinesh Bandara said, personnel attached to a Fast Attack Craft belonging to the Western Naval Command, during their patrol to curb transnational crime in the territorial waters nabbed the 90 suspects on board a suspicious trawler plying in the Western seas off Sri Lanka.
Having spotted a suspicious trawler about 40 nautical miles west off Negombo, two Fast Attack Craft on patrol went to the location.
Naval personnel were able to detect 90 illegal Sri Lankan immigrants aboard who were heading to the Reunion Island. Among the suspects were 89 men and one woman. During the initial inquiry it was revealed that these persons were residents of Batticoloa, Thoduwawa, Udappuwa, Chilaw, Mannar, Ampara and Matale, he said.
The Navy had later brought the suspects to the Colombo harbour and administered them with first aid and other medical treatment.
The apprehended group was handed over to the Harbour Police, Colombo for further action.

## Title: NEW SOURCES OF NATURAL RUBBER
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, September 12, 2018 - 01:00
NEW SOURCES OF NATURAL RUBBER
As we know it, natural rubber, for all practical purposes, comes only from the Amazon forest tree called Hevea Braziliensis. This is a situation that is going to change very quickly  a change that could affect us economically.
Hevea Braziliensis was grown on a large scale in Brazil and Peru. In Brazil it was called Para Rubber and in Peru it was called rbol del caucho. With the discovery of the vulcanizing process in 1839, the demand for Hevea latex boomed bringing massive economic gains to the areas of cultivation in Brazil and Peru. However, this lasted only till about 1940 when a leaf blight caused by a fungus decimated the plantations. The leaf blight is still active strongly enough to prevent any development of Hevea plantations in South America.
Lack of awareness
In the meantime seeds were taken out by the British to try to raise plantations in their colonies to meet their industrial needs. Around 1873, 12 seeds were germinated at Kew Gardens in Britain and sent to India for propagation, but they died. Later some 70,000 seeds were smuggled out by a British officer. Close to 3,000 seeds germinated at Kew Gardens. Of these, 2,000 seedling were sent to Ceylon and 22 sent to the Botanical Gardens of Singapore. The plants got established in both countries and were extensively propagated in Ceylon, Indonesia and Malaya. The British brought Chinese workers to do field work in the plantations in Malaya.
At present Hevea rubber plantations are found only in South Asia and South East Asia. Though Sri Lanka counts rubber as a major industry, we are not a major producer.
World rubber production stands at around 12 million tons [2014]. A breakdown of production is given below. (See Table) Dr. C.S. Weeraratna gives a lower production figure of 83,000 MT for 2017.
Natural rubber is a strategic and indispensible industrial raw material. It is essential for imparting essential properties and characteristics to any synthetic rubber. Many industries in developed countries need it without any failure in supply due to plantation or other problems that affect supply or cost. High costs of Hevea rubber have been an irritant to international buyers. There is also the serious concern that the plantations to South Asia and South East Asia too will be devastated by the fungus that destroyed plantations in South America  because the plantations in Asia are of the same species as that grew in South America and therefore equally vulnerable to the fungus. In fact, a historian has predicted in 2011 that Southeast Asian rubber plantations will be ravaged by the blight in the not-too-distant future, thus creating a potential calamity for international industry. Fortunately, this has not happened so far.
Dr. C. S. Weeraratnas recent article titled The Ailing Rubber Sector paints a dismal picture of the status of the rubber industry in Sri Lanka as well as the failure of the programmes to develop it  not to mention the lack of awareness of global developments.
Alternative types of natural rubbers have been developed during the World Wars; however, since they did not match up to Hevea rubber, they were not developed purposefully because Hevea rubber became available soon enough after the wars for peacetime industries.
With ever increasing demand from industry, the need arose to seriously address the concerns about Asian Hevea rubber. Several natural latex sources have been studied very closely and developed during the past decade and now the developed countries have improved the quality and quantity of latex from two plants through hybridizing and possibly genetic engineering too.
These two latex types are claimed to be matching the yield and properties of Hevea latex.
The U.S.A. is already growing on a large scale a desert plant called Guayule. A company that specializes in the development of new breeds using gene sequencing techniques too to vastly improve latex yield and quality, is making rubber latex products that are free of allergy causing tendencies. They are for medical and general human use. This company is calling the new source of latex rubber The superplant that may finally topple the Asian rubber monopoly.
The worlds foremost tyre maker, Bridgestone is also getting vast extents of guayule grown under contracts with farmers. They too have a research laboratory to improve yield and quality.
A few years later another plant, regarded as a weed, the Russian species of the Dandelion, will also be grown on a large sale in the U.S.A. The European Union is planning to grow the Russian Dandelion on a large scale within the next three years or so.
In the U. S. A. Guayule is being grown by farmers under contract, assured of purchase. Desert lands have been opened out in thousands of acres for large scale machine cultivation, maintenance and harvesting. As a desert plant, irrigation needs too will be minimal and problems with pests could be almost non-existent.
In addition, with a lifetime of three years, partial harvesting can be done yearly or complete harvesting in three years.
Hevea rubber production
The latex is obtained by crushing the biomass, extracting with water and physical separation. The biomass residue is used as mulch, as bagasse to produce energy and fertilizer. The overall cost of production will be quite low compared to our Hevea rubber production. With a 5-7 year wait for maturing, manual tapping of each tree, tapping excluded during heavy rains, high wages for the fast diminishing community of tappers, manually collecting latex from each tree, use of chemicals to solidify latex, manually rolling out rubber sheets etc., Hevea rubber production cost is high. The good yield of latex per tree over a possible period of 25  30 years and the availability of timber for lumber and firewood are advantages of Hevea but they could get cancelled out. We will have the disadvantage of sea freight cost too.
Latex from Russian Dandelion must be a reality in the USA on a trial basis even now whereas in the EU large scale cultivations could start within three years. All species of dandelions are regarded as expendable weeds though they have many good uses as traditional medicines and food.
As a weed it grows under very tough conditions with long, deep growing carrot-like tubers. They are completely disease and pest resistant, propagate by themselves via dry seed broadcast by wind, require no fertilizer and mature in one year. The tuber-like roots can be dug up by machine and the land machine-prepared and planted or left to regeneration by nature.
In this case too, the tuber-like roots are crushed and the latex extracted and separated as done with Guayule. Rubber from this source could be cheaper than from Guayule.
Guayule could become a success in our dry zone. It grows better with a little rain off and on. It should do well in the planned 10,000 ha of new plantations in Ampara. Any presently unused highlands in the Mahaweli Systems too could be suitable.
The Russian dandelion is a plant that grows in the northern parts of Russia and Asia Minor. It might be possible to get it to adapt to grow in higher elevations in Sri Lanka, because the normal dandelion grew in Nuwara Eliya and higher elevations. There are many unused and virtually abandoned plantation lands under the LRC. It will do more good than harm to try out Russian Dandelion on a small scale on such land.
Both these plants do not need tappers  only operators of small machines such as two-wheeled tractors adapted for the purpose.

Nomura report  erroneous - CBSL
Several international media sites have quoted a new analysis by Nomura Holdings Inc., which shows that seven emerging economies are at risk of an exchange rate crisis.
According to these media sites, Nomuras analysis lists Sri Lanka as the country that is most vulnerable to an exchange rate crisis. The article that appeared on www.ft.com quotes Nomura analysts as saying Sri Lanka had the worst outlook, and with high short term external debt (US$ 160 billion), [Sri Lanka]s refinancing needs are large.
Given the fact that Sri Lankas short term external debt is nowhere near the US$ 160 billion figure that Nomura analysts have quoted, it appears that Nomura Holdings have made a serious computational error with regard to Sri Lankas external vulnerability.
As such an erroneous report could to trigger an unwarranted panic among investors, particularly in the context of current volatile global market conditions, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has already written to Nomura Holdings, and requested them to correct this error without any delay.

Feather, a greyhound rescue from Maryland, USA can jump 191.7cm (6ft 3in), which is only a few centimetres less than the British women's record set by Katrina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
Samantha Valle, 31, Feather's owner, says her talents became apparent when she saw her jump so high she hit their basement ceiling.
She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm 'effortlessly'.

Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame said that the Janabalaya was an utter failure and there were not more than 50,000 people taking part in the so called demonstration.
Subsequently, there was uproar among the Councillors. No one honoured the orders of the Chairman. Many of them were on their feet protesting in a boistrous manner. Tennekoon requested the members to take their seats. However, the upheaval continued with heated arguments and allegations becoming the order of the day.

Probe all frauds at SLC
The disclosure that a massive US $ 5.5 million that was due as sponsorship money to Sri Lanka Cricket had been rerouted to an offshore company by bogus means may come as no surprise to many who had been observing the passing scene at the cash rich sports body over the years. Nay, this may well be the tip of the iceberg, with many more such questionable transactions involving Cricket Board funds hidden in the subterranean layers at Maitland Place.
According to our main story yesterday the SLC had been able to successfully thwart a fraudulent attempt to transfer US$ 5.5 million of its Media Rights Sponsorship funds, which was due from an International Media Network, to an offshore account. The fraudulent act was discovered before it was executed through bogus means, it was reported. In the wake of the detection SLC has decided to call in the FCID and a full scale audit inquiry is also to be launched into all the financial transactions of SLC during the past year.
That SLC had been mired in financial scandals since the cash started flowing in torrents to the Board's coffers following Sri Lanka's World Cup victory in 1996, is putting things mildly. There was a mad scramble by all and sundry to share in the spoils, including those who had not held a cricket bat or actors with only a nodding acquaintance of the game. Cricket Board elections were fought on the lines of the now infamous Wayamba Provincial Council election with gun toting mobs brought to the scene. A far cry from the days when Cricket Board elections went unnoticed even among the close followers of the game and when the cricket administration was in the hands of gentlemen of the calibre of Robert Senanayake, Dr. N. M. Perera and Gamini Dissanayake et al.
As mentioned, the World Cup victory put paid to that culture and instead we had vultures hovering over Maitland Place only to leave the skeleton behind as financial losses kept mounting through mismanagement and arbitrary decisions.
Be that as it may, now that an audit is to be conducted into all financial transactions at SLC over the past year, there is bound to be more financial scandals that will be unravelled involving those holding top positions at SLC. Ideally, a full audit should be carried out going into the time when Sri Lanka was one of the countries which hosted World Cup matches when the tournament was staged in the sub-continent in 2011. No doubt, the massive financial frauds that were carried out in the construction of the Hambantota Cricket Stadium are bound to come to light in such an eventuality. True, those whose names transpired in this connection are today safely ensconced in foreign climes. But at least it could shed light on the political authority involved in masterminding the operations.
The probe should also extend to include the astronomical salaries paid to selected Cricket Board staff and payments made to non-performing staff about which there were detailed reports in certain print media. There were also other irregularities in the granting of sponsorship rights that should also be looked into.
The Sri Lanka Cricket Chief Executive issuing a statement on the fraud detection says that the revelation was highly damaging for an organisation of international repute such as the SLC.
Well, there are some things he could do to enhance the reputation of his organisation. One such course will be, with the assistance of the minister, to ensure that the upcoming Cricket Board elections will be a free and fair one and appear to be free and fair in the eyes of the cricket loving public, where no horse trading is suspected. For the first time ever in any part of the world where cricket is being played, the governing body of the gentleman's game in this country was mired in litigation due to the shenanigans of those at the helm of affairs. A repeat should be avoided at all costs if the reputation of SLC, so coveted by the CEO, is to remain intact.
Vitharana's invite to Viggy
Professor Tissa Vitharana, the veteran Samasamajist and nephew of LSSP stalwart the late Dr. N.M. Perera has invited Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran to join his party. This is following the rift that had developed between the Chief Minister and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that is now played out in the open. Addressing the media at the N.M. Perera Memorial Centre in Borella, Prof. Vitharana said if the TNA does not want a politician of Vigneswaran's calibre the LSSP would welcome him to its fold.
It is not clear what Viggy's response would be to the overture of the octogenarian politician. But there are reasons why the offer would be turned down. With the decimation of the LSSP, and, indeed, the entire Left in the 1977 UNP avalanche, the LSSP and the CP are today reduced to mere name boards. Vigneswaran, who, on the other hand, has tasted electoral success will not want to cast himself into the forgotten things of history which the LSSP has been consigned to today.

Record-breaker Anderson seals England's fifth Test win over India
LONDON tuesday: James Anderson became the most successful fast bowler in Test history when he sealed England's 118-run win over India at the Oval on Tuesday.
With just one wicket to fall, and Anderson needing one more to break the record of 563 he had shared with retired Australia great Glenn McGrath, the 36-year-old Lancashire paceman bowled Mohammed Shami to give England victory in the fifth Test and a 4-1 series win.
India, set a mammoth 464 to win, collapsed to two for three on Monday, with Anderson striking twice.
But a sixth-wicket partnership of 204 between KL Rahul (149) and Rishabh Pant (114) on Tuesday gave them hope of an unlikely victory.
Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, however, removed both century-makers in a burst of two wickets for three runs in two overs after tea to leave India struggling at 328 for seven.
The scale of India's task could be seen from the fact that no side have made more in the fourth innings to win a Test than the West Indies' 418 for seven against Australia at St John's, Antigua in 2002/03.
India resumed Tuesday on 58 for three. Rahul was 46 not out and Ajinkya Rahane unbeaten on 10.
All eyes were on Anderson as he bowled Tuesday's first over, with the overcast conditions seemingly in his favour.
Rahul though clipped his sixth delivery of the day legside for four to complete a fifty -- the first by an India opening batsman this series. But a stand of 118 ended when Rahane (37) miscued a sweep off Moeen Ali to Keaton Jennings at midwicket.
India's 120 for four was soon transformed into 121 for five when Ben Stokes had Test debutant Hanuma Vihari, who made 56 in India's first innings, caught behind for a duck. But Rahul slapped Stokes over extra-cover for six to go into the 90s in extraordinary fashion before his top-edged pull for four off the all-rounder took him to 97.
The 26-year-old Rahul then pulled the paceman through mid-off, another remarkable boundary, to complete his fifth hundred in 29 Tests off 118 balls including 16 fours and a six.
At lunch he was 108 not out in a total of 167 for five.
Left-hander Pant, who had hit off-spinner Ali for a one-handed six before lunch, gave Rahul superb support on an increasingly flat pitch as runs flowed freely.
Anderson came back on for a second spell but could not break through, with England captain Joe Root's occasional off-spin also failing to yield a wicket.
Wicket-keeper Pant, who hoisted Rashid for six to go into the 90s, went to his maiden Test hundred in just his third match at this level when he repeated the shot off the Yorkshireman, the ball soaring high over long-on.
The 20-year-old had then faced a mere 117 balls, including 14 fours and three sixes.
At tea, India were 298 for five, needing 166 more runs to win.
But Rashid, a peripheral figure for much of the series, then took centre stage.
He turned one sharply out of the rough outside Rahul's leg-stump to clip the top of the right-hander's off-stump.
And his next over saw Pant, going for another big hit, hole out to Ali at long-off. Anderson was denied the wicket he craved when diving wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow dropped a low left-handed chance to reprieve Ravindra Jadeja.
But Sam Curran struck twice with the new ball when the left-arm paceman had both Ishant Sharma and Jadeja caught behind to leave India on the brink of defeat at 345 for nine. Anderson then gave England the finish they wanted, bowling Shami middle stump. England started Tuesday in a commanding position after Alastair Cook, their all-time leading run-scorer, had marked his last Test before international retirement with 147 in a total of 423 for eight declared on Monday that also included Root's 125.

Dudley Senanayake Commemorative Oration on September 14:
Remembering a Great Son of Nation
Power has only one duty - to secure the social welfare of the People - Benjamin Disraeli
A combination of a Liberal Democrat and a Social Democrat, Dudley was a believer in democratic practices, respect for human rights, freedom of expression, and the independence of the Judiciary an upsurge in Domestic agriculture for the revival of the economy was one of his favourite ideas. Developing Agricultural Colonisation Schemes started by his father D.S. Senanayake was another task he undertook with much enthusiasm.
A political career spanning over five decades, and gaining experience, as a member of the State Council in 1936, he became the Minister of Agriculture. He succeeded his illustrious father in early 1950s as Prime Minister and subsequently as Leader of the Opposition, but it was a difficult and unpleasant political career. He loved his people and the country and the people loved him too. Regrettably, he had a struggle working with some powerful UNP leaders. At one stage some people whom he helped come up to positions filed legal action against the great man.
Father D S Senanayake was a man of restricted book education but of incredible sophisticated wisdom. His eldest son an illustrious product of S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia and blessed with an adorable personality, young Dudley Shelton, Shelley to close acquaints, showed little attention to marriage. The Senanayakes of Botale Walawwa in Sapitigama Korale were well enriched in politics by the second decade of 20th Century with Senanayake brothers FR and DS spearheading the Independence and temperance movements. The dealings in connection with the disturbances of 1915, during which time, under the orders of Governor Chalmers, 30- year-old D S Senanayake was unfairly and unjustly arrested along with his two brothers FR and DC and a host of leaders of temperance movement on a trumped up charge of involvement in riots. At Welikada jail they were served food in dirty tin plates that was pushed under the door.
Dudleys grandfather Don Spater belonged to the Ceylonese bourgeoisie of mercantile renters who later invested profits in graphite mining and plantations. They spend lavishly, at the turn of the century, in campaigning for anti-arrack movement. The three brothers FR, DS, and DC became dedicated members of Temperance movement initiated by their father along with contemporary National leaders at the very young age of twenties and earned the wrath of Colonial rulers as well as local Suddha clans of Seethawaka. Around this time father of SWRD Bandaranaike, Maha Mudaliyar Sir Soloman Dias, was the aide-de-camp for Governor Chalmers. They wined and dined the Britishers at Horagolla during the riots. SWRDs maternal uncle S C Obeysekara who was a Legislative Councillor in 1915, speaking at the debate on Riots, Obeysekara made a contemptuous comment when he referred to Senanayakes, he said,
the poor farmers and villages have been deluded into this trap for personal aggrandisement of a few who are nobodies, but hope to make somebodies of themselves by such disgraceful tactics- Hansard11, August 1915 Fo.442
Dudley, the young Barrister returning from London took oaths as an advocate of Supreme Court before commencing practice in the chambers of legal luminary H V Perera KC, who like Dudley gained a First Class for his degree at the London University and subsequently passed out as a Barrister. Dudley took a keen interest in his professional work as a lawyer but neglected the collection of fees from clients and invariably got reprimanded by his guru. Increasing pressure was brought to bear on him by the Sapitigama Korale people for Dudley to take up politics following fathers footsteps. He preferred an easy life, ignored such overtures by a host of relatives and friends as well. Dudleys early legal carrier was marred by a chronic stomach ailment. However, later the father used his skills in the art of persuasion was successful in putting the message across to the son. Dudley contested the Dedigama, adjoining his fathers Minuwangoda in 1936, under the Donoughmore Constitution at a time when Party politics were unknown. Dudley was only 24-years-old at the time he was elected with a majority of 8,299 votes [almost double the number of votes scored by his closest rival]. The result---

Father reprimands son
While father supported the Second World War effort in 1940, Dudley and his friend JR was indifferent; they thought that by extending our support to enemy we could obtain independence immediately. Both of them visited the Japanese Consul in Colombo and expressed their support to Japan. DS, The Head of State was furious over the high-handed act of the two young Ministers, and to their shock and surprise, they were thoroughly chastised by him. Further if not for the fathers influence and excellent relations with the Governor Calcott the British government would have arrested the young man. Apart from this incident the father never interfered in sons political activities.
Coronation of Queen
British government invited Dudley Senanayake to represent then Ceylon to participate at the Coronation of Queen as its head of state. The organisers ran short of a horse-carriage for one of the Heads of State and wanted our young Prime Minister from their LIPTONs Tea Estate to share the carriage with a female diplomat of a newly emerged African British Colony. Dudley vehemently opposed the idea; he not only declined the offer, but threatened to take the next flight home. The London Home office authorities replied, It is an insult to her Majesty if you do that for our leader to retort, Officer, your suggestion is an insult to my great nation. With an Our deepest regret note British authorities apologized before arranging a special carriage for the great manthe present generation of politicians need to study how Senanayakes ran this country.
JR  Dudley clash
Dudley stepped aside and allowed JR to accept the Leader of Opposition post after the 1970 defeat and leadership of UNP group in the House was entrusted to JR. The party rank and file however were pressurizing Dudley to return to active politics.
...... this larger struggle for reform of the Party was affected by, and in turn affected the deteriorating relationship between JR and Dudley Senanayake. After a wait of nearly 20 years JR was becoming impatient for the leadership. In the last quarter of 1970, the division between JR and the party leader indented because of sharp difference on tactics and strategy on opposition to the government.Profs. K M de Silva and Howard Higgins --JRJ Biography: pp- 225 -240.
The Biography further says how Dudley won the majority in the partys Working Committee as JR continued his theory, Constructive Accommodation with Sirimavo Bandaranaikes UF government. JR deliberately avoided public rallies held island-wide. JR even felt that if Sirimavo invited the UNP to join the government, that the party should do so and accept portfolios.
As the book narrates; As for the UNP, Dudley Senanayake moved swiftly to cut JR down to size and how M.D. Banda senior member moved a resolution to have JR expelled. JR Jayewardene took Dudley to courts though he had only A.C.S. Hameed on his side in the Working Committee: the other ally, V. A. Sugathadasa, was sick at the time. Failing in all his manoeuverings, plotting and scheming to disrupt the party progressing under the leadership of Dudley, finally, JR filed action in District Courts of Colombo challenging the authority of his leaderthe petition was supported by H W Jayewardene QC [JRs brother] and four other QCs.
After the intervention by moderate leaders like Paris Perera the case was withdrawn and the differences patched up.

Sacred body temple
The fascination of Bharatha Natyam lies in the uniqueness of its traditional repertoire. The repertoire of Bharatha Natyam recital was laid down in the 19th century by the Tanjore Quartet, namely Chinniah, Ponniah, Sivananda and Vadivelu. To this day, the exponents of Bharatha Natyam Arangetrams faithfully follow this tradition.
The Alarippu, Jetheeswaram, Sabtham, Varnam, Padam, Thillana and Slokas are the correct sequence in the practice of this art which is an artistic yoga revealing the spiritual through corporal, says Balasaraswathi the Queen of Bharatha Natyam. The Bharatha Natyam is totally based on Hinduism and Hindu philosophy. Nobody can deny this fact. Those who get involved in this art form must learn and understand the depth of the sacred Hindu philosophy. Bharatha Natyam originated in the temples as Sadir. With the passage of time, it was developed in and around the temple environs with a new dimension and vision as Bharatha Natyam which is totally a sacred dance form. Earlier it was originally practised and preserved by the temple Devadasi clan.
Temple structures
According to Hindu philosophy, the Hindu temple structure is based on the human body. The head is regarded as the Sanctorum (Garpagragam). The tall temple tower built over the Garpagragam is described as Vimanam which is adorned with beautiful sculptures. (This temple description starts from sanctum to the temple tower entrance).The following area in the human body is the neck, which is called or named as Artha Mandapam where the priests stand and engage themselves in the process of ritual activities for the Garpagragam (Sanctorum).
The chest area of the body is regarded as Maha Mandapam. The stomach area is regarded as Isathapa Mandapam. The sacrificial pit is constructed in the Isathapa Mandapam. During the period of Yagapoojas and Homapoojas sacred offerings are offered in the sacrificial pit. All the offerings mainly the Navathaniyam grains and Yagapooja offerings are poured into this constructed pit. At the end of the Isthampa Mandapam, Nanthi, Pali Peedamand the Kodi Isthampam are installed.
First entrance
The thighs of the body are regarded as Sabha Mandapam of the temple. Earlier the cultural activities were supposed to be performed at the Sabha Mandapam. The knee area of the body is regarded as the first entrance of the temple. Below the knee is regarded as Kalyana Mandapam which is also known as Utsava Mandapam where the Utsava moorthies are decorated and kept during the Utsavams. The feet and the toes of the human body are regarded as the main entrance of the temple with majestic Kopuram. But all these traditional temple features are still found in the present Hindu temple structure to a certain extent.
The great Bharatha Natya Queen Balasarawathi further said, The Bharatha Natyam recital is structured like a great Hindu temple.
Hence, from the above verses of the great Bharatha Natya maestro reveals the deep involvement of art with one of the greatest religion of the world. Therefore, those who want to learn or master this art form must know the basic Hindu link with this great dance form. If anybody tries to learn this great art without knowing the depth of it with the passage of time this sacred art would be dragged to a social level art. The link between Hinduism and Bharatha Natyam is inseparable.

Off season tourism  campaign to kick off
Sri Lanka will launch an island wide off season marketing campaign, targeting specific countries, Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs John Amaratunge said.
Speaking at the press conference yesterday he said that, This scheme was developed four months ago with the assistance of 18 airlines, 33 destination marketing companies, advertising agencies and local hotels.
The Minister said the first leg of this program would be launched from mid September to November and they have invested Rs 65 million for this campaign. Sri Lanka hopes to attract additional 200,000 tourists and revenue in the excess of US$ 30 million from this promotion. Amaratunge said that under the promotion airlines that fly to Colombo would be offering special discounted fares.
The Sri Lankan hoteliers would offer a special three night package starting from US$ 99 under this promotion titled, Island Escapes. According to industry sources these rates are a 40-50 per cent discount on current rates.
In addition participating airlines including SriLankan Airlines, Emirates and Qatar will be offering special rates on airfares as well.
We are launching this package to China, the Gulf and India and other counters where the flying time is less than five hours.
The success of this program would help Sri Lanka Tourism to launch their second stage from May to August next year.
This is the first time that a planned, comprehensive country promotion is being launched in the country with the active participation of industry stakeholders. Our target is to increase arrivals during the lean months from September to November and April to June. However, it must be cautioned that a steep increase in arrivals may not be forthcoming immediately.
The campaign strategy includes development of four micro-sites within the Sri Lanka Tourism portal in English, Hindi, Chinese and Arabic. The campaign will also include media buying where all platforms will be included such as social media, video blogs, booking engines, search engines, mobile app advertising, direct mail campaigns and print media.
night time viewing at Sigiriya
The Ministry of Tourism will negotiate with the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to keep Sigirya Fortress open in the night as well.
We have seen a huge demand from both local and foreign tourists in visiting the Sigirya rock and we are now looking at the possibility to extend the visiting hours until night which will minimize the congestion, the Minister said.
He also said that he will tell the travel agents and destination marketing companies to aggressively market other wildlife parks and give less prominence to Yala. We see too much of focus there which creates unwanted congestion .

It also welcomed the commencement of work by the Office of Missing Persons (OMP). We welcome the Governments continued engagement with the UN system and actions to implement its National Reconciliation Action Plan and Peace building Priority Plan.

We hope the Government will establish an Office for Reparations quickly.We also welcome the return of further private land in the north and commitments to return more military occupied land to civilian ownership.
The group however expressed reservations on the pace of progress stating that as time passes, the lack of progress in delivering key steps risks undermining the reconciliation efforts.The group pointed out specifically to the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and substituting it with an appropriate bill.
The core group is co-sponsors of the resolution 30/1, which recognises that national accountability mechanism are essential in the reconciliation process.
Our view remains that, with determined leadership and a clear time-bound action plan, this Government can make more progress towards delivering its Council commitments, and that doing so will better position Sri Lanka and its people to enjoy a more enduring reconciliation and prosperity.We urge Sri Lanka to prioritise and drive forward the implementation of resolutions 30/1 and 34/1, before the Council next considers Sri Lanka next March.

Condemning the incident of hooting in front of the SLFP Headquarters by the SLPP (Pohottuwa) supporters during the protest march held on September 5, SLFP General Secretary Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa said the behavior of these protestors is similar to the act of insulting ones own mother.
Considering the request by the group of UPFA and SLFP MPs, President Sirisena as the Party Chairman let them to sit in the opposition as an independent group.So there is no argument with their right to engage in a protest against the government since they represent the opposition. But they should not go beyond the ethics of politics.
We are now in the process of restructuring and reforming the SLFP according to the modern political culture, he said.
He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena firmly believes in the importance of holding intellectual discussions within the party, rather than holding individual-based discussions.
The restructuring and reforming process of the party is currently going on with the participation of intellectuals and professionals. Around 90 percent of the establishment of Balamandala had been completed. he added.

Stolen phone emerges from underwear
A stolen mobile phone was found when it unexpectedly rang in the undergarments of the person who had stolen it.
The incident occurred at the Wellawatta beach on Monday. According to the police, a couple who had spent some time in the beach had forgotten their phone when they left. Upon realizing this, they had rushed back and found that the phone had gone missing.
They had later seen a man moving away from the place and the couple had inquired whether he had seen a mobile phone lying on the sand. Although the man denied having seen a phone, it unexpectedly rang from within his undergarments, much to the amusement of the couple.
The man had been compelled to hand the phone over to the couple.
The man was not to be found in the vicinity soon after the incident.

So, you want to start-up and develop  a small business  Part 01
Think small - act big,  simple way to  reach your goal
So, you are finally decided to take the plunge. Congratulations! You are now getting into the entrepreneurial boots that have been waiting for you all this while. There is a thing or two that you need to know about the terrain you will soon be walking. It is rough than you can imagine and if you are not careful, you might just end up with injuries, minor or major.
This serialised set of articles is an attempt to help you ensure that the business or service you start (or already started) will transform into a profit-making venture. We will help you to take just the right steps in your walk, overcoming all the obstacles, like pitfalls and booby-traps, that come in your way and guide your path to reach your target.
Even if you do not have an idea of starting a small business today, who knows, one day you might. Or, a friend of yours, might invite you for a partnership. So, treat this series as a learning experience.
Small company
Owning and running a small business can be rewarding if you have what it takes to succeed. If you need to be sure whether youre making the right decision, there are few questions you could ask yourself regarding your skills, talents, and abilities. We will talk about them in coming weeks.
Todays instalment helps you understand the realities of starting and running a small business so that you can figure out how and why it may or may not work for you.
Defining small business
In my opinion, a small business is simply a small entity organized to generate a profit. Quite honestly, Anyone, who wants to start a business want to generate profit, keeping within the legal and ethical parameters. Size or complexity does not matter. The business may be a side hustle, self-employed two-person unit, or an organization of 50,000 people. The principle is same.
Unbelievable results can be achieved from any construct. Value is independent of size and complexity. One can make it big with a big idea One can make it big with several small ideas There is no difference.
When it comes to owning a small business, do you imagine owning a small specialty store in your town Do you imagine selling a product online Maybe you think of running a professional firm with 5 engineers that will soon grow to 50. The small business you create is there to generate income, help you fulfill your goals, and increase your freedom. Nothing more.
Creating a small business doesnt need to be daunting or overwhelming. In its most basic form, its exciting, achievable, and liberating. Its a machine designed to advance your personal agenda.
Commitment matters
The lingo of the business world - cash flow, profit and loss statements, accounts receivable, debt-to-equity ratio, and so on might make a prospective small-business owner like you jittery. Dont be fooled. Youre probably more acquainted with the basic concepts of doing business than you really think. If youve ever participated in a annual sale at your club or association or been paid for a musical performance, or operated a small tuition class or childrens pre-school service or home cleaning service, youve been involved in a small business.
Being a small-business owner doesnt mean that you have to work 70 hours a week, make a six-figure income, or offer a unique product or service. We know many successful small-business owners who work at their craft 40 hours a week or less and some who work part-time in addition to holding a regular job. The vast majority of small-business owners who provide products or services are like that.
Jeevas story
Here is a story of a young lady known to me. Let us call her  Jeeva. One fine morning, after doing her morning jog, a sudden thought came to Jeevas mind, Boy, I could sure go for a glass of kola kenda. Eureka! Jeeva got a business idea. With no kola kenda stand in 5-kilo radius, she began a simple research. She started by asking her neighbours and friends, if theyd like to drink kola kenda every morning. She quickly discovered that if the quality of product, service, and the location are good enough, such a business may attract a fair number of customers.
Technically, she has just conducted her first market research. She realised that her immediate community has a need for a kola kenda business.
Her first priority was to find a potential location. Although she could set up in front of her house, she decided that herby-road would not get enough traffic. To maximize sales, she decided to set up her stand on the corner down the road where there was reasonable parking capacity. That property was owned by and Dalpadadu, two retired school principals. Their children were out of the country and they lived alone.
Jeeva had a long discussion with the couple and convinced them to give her permission to set the stand up in front of their house for three hours in the morning, in exchange for two free glasses of daily kola kenda. Now, Jeeva had negotiated her first lease with good benefits.
With a tiny bit of creativity and ego, she decided the name of her business: Omega kola kenda (hygienically homemade)
Now, she has her kola kenda stand (her store), cash box, a table, two chairs and three pitchers (her furniture and fixtures), and the kola kenda (her inventory). Omega kola kenda (her brand) is now ready for business!
Similarities
As a matter of fact, the business challenges and issues that Jeevas kola kenda stand faces are the same that Levers, McDonalds, American Express, Boeing, Disney, and every other big company faces.
The basics of doing business are the same, no matter what size the business is:
Sales: Boeing manufactures and sells airplanes; Jeeva sells kola kenda. A sale is a sale no matter what the product or service is or how large or small the ticket price is.
Cost of goods: Boeing buys parts for its vendors and suppliers; Jeeva buys dark green leaves from outside suppliers: rice, coconut powder, salt and tall paper cups from the grocery store.
Expenses: Boeing has employee wages and pension plans (or employee benefits); Jeeva had an allowance paid to her assistant and a small margin of profits to the assistant happy (also a form of employee benefits).
Profit: Boeing subtracts the cost of its goods and expenses from its sales; the same is true for Jeevas kola kenda stand.
Not only are the concepts of Business -sales, cost of goods, expenses, and profit - the same for all businesses, regardless of size or product offering, but many associated financial basics are the same, too. Heres what we mean:
Accounts payable: Boeing owes money to its vendors who provide it with parts; Jeeva owes money to the outside suppliers and local grocery store for supplies. Accounts receivable: Boeing has money due from its customers (major airlines and governments) that buy the companys airplanes. Jeeva has money due to you from few credit customers who pay weekly.
Cash flow: Boeing has money coming in and going out through various transactions with customers and vendors (sometimes cash flows positively, sometimes negatively), and so does Jeeva.
Assets: Boeing has its manufacturing plants and equipment, inventory, office buildings, and the like; Jeeva has her stand, table, pitchers, two chairs and cash box. Liabilities: Boeing owes suppliers money; Jeeva owes money to her suppliers. (Net worth) Net worth is whats left over after Boeing subtracts what it owes (its liabilities) from what it owns (its assets). Ditto for Jeevas small business enterprise.
Differences
This comparison between Omega kola kenda Stand and Boeing could go much deeper and longer. After all, the basics of the two businesses are the same; the differences are primarily due to size. In business, size is a synonym for complexity.
So, you may be thinking, if business is so simple, why isnt everyone doing it - and succeeding at it The reason is that even though the basics of business are simple, the details are not. Consider the various ways in which you grant your customers credit, collect the resulting accounts receivable, and, unfortunately, sometimes write them off when youre not paid.
Think about all the money issues: How do you compile and make sense of your financial figures How much should you pay your vendors for their products And when you need money, should you consider taking in partners or should you borrow from the bank These are difficult questions to answer.
And, lest we forget, how should you deal with, amongst others, the Internal Revenue Service, the Municipality Heath Inspector service These are but two of the complex details that muddy the waters of business.
Role model
While working as CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch once said in a speech to his division managers, Think small. What General Electric is trying relentlessly to do is to get that small-company soul . . . and small-company speed . . . inside our big-company body. Think small
Whats happening here Why would the CEO of a gigantic company like GE want his employees to think small Because Jack Welch knew that small can be beautiful and because success and survival in the business arena always favour the agile over the cumbersome, the small over the big.
Thanks to this small is beautiful trend - and thanks to increasing technological advances - you no longer have to be big to do big things; you can be small and still compete in most of todays marketplaces.

Maithripala Sirisena, the President of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and with the participation of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen and a number of Ministers and Members of Parliament.
National Crafts Council was established under the provisions of the National Crafts Council and Allied Institutions Act, No. 35 of 1982 with the objective to preserve and foster Sri Lankan handicrafts and artisanal products which claim for a proud history of over thousand years and to uplift the economic and social status of the handicraftsmen.
Around 26,000 handicraftsmen from all parts of the island have been registered with the National Crafts Council which has undertaken a host of programmes to fine-tune the magnificent skills of these handicraftsmen and also to uplift their economic and social standings.
Among them, the implementation of training programmes, cultivation of raw materials and distribution of scarce raw materials, providing them with necessary equipment, development of Shilpa Gammana, promotion of both local and foreign markets, and development of enterprises are few to mention here.
There are nearly 112 handicraft training centres in operation all over the island under the National Crafts Council, and various handicraft training courses are conducted at these training centres.
The objective of the ShilpaAbhimani - 2018, Presidential Awards Handicrafts Competition & Exhibition is to enhance the artistic talents of handicraftsmen scattered all over the island, to conduct a competition to showcase the said talents of the handicraftsmen and thereby to create in them a national value and a pride.
ShilpaAbhimani - 2018 is not a mere competition but it is a development programme implemented in three phases. In the first phase of the event, training workshops to create awareness were conducted to cover all 25 districts of the island. These programmes are aimed at enhancing the creative talents of the craftsmen and improving the quality and finishing of the artefacts; and also to introduce new designs.
Senior lecturers of the University of Moratuwa, University of Visual and Performing Arts Colombo, and the University of Peradeniya are participating in these workshops as special lecturers.
Under the second phase, competitions and exhibitions are conducted at Provincial levels with a view to showcasing the talents of the handicraftsmen and these exhibitions are organized by the respective Provincial Ministry of Industries, Departments of Industrial Development and National Crafts Council.
It should be stated here with appreciations that 8115 creations from 4138 craftsmen have been presented for the Provincial competitions.
ShilpaAbhimani - 2018, Presidential Awards Handicrafts Competition & Exhibition is held in the third phase and 1418 creations which won awards at Provincial competitions will feature in this exhibition. These creations will be adjudicated under 57 streams by a National Judge Panel comprising Professors, Doctors and Lecturers from a number of Universities.
Two outstanding creations among these creations will be selected for Golden Award under the Traditional and Non-Traditional categories. Further, 21 other artefacts selected under each sector will be awarded Silver Awards and National First, Second, and Third and Merit Certificates.
Arrangements have also been made to present the two Golden Award winners with cash prizes worth Rs.500, 000/- each and cash prizes of Rs. 50,000/- will be awarded to Silver Award winners.
Action has also been made to implement special programmes in parallel with the ShilpaAbhimani - 2018, Exhibition.
Plans are underway to provide the handicraftsmen with 110 trade stalls with a view to facilitating them to sell their products direct to the customers in order to resolve the market issue faced by craftsmen in selling their products.
The said trade stalls will include stalls selling products such as Batik, Lace, Embroidery, Patchwork, Silver Jewellery, Brassware, Lacquer, Clay Ornamentals, Musical Instruments, Dumbara Designs, Reed and Grass Creations, Cane and Bamboo products, Masks, Handlooms, Wood Carvings and domestic food items.

A considerable number of youths entered the handicraft sector through the Shilpa Navoda - School Handicraft Competition conducted last year and the success of the said competition inspired us to conduct a special handicraft training workshop for school children alongside the ShilaAbhimani -2018 Exhibition.
A cultural pageant showcasing significant features of both local and foreign cultures entwined with artisanal creations which signify the cultural identity will also be held in the evenings of every day during the period of the exhibition from 12th September to 16th September for the viewing pleasure of the visitors.

Traffic noise makes birds age faster
The next time you continuously keep honking, stop, and think of the birds! Traffic noise may be associated with an increased rate of telomere loss in Zebra finches that have left the nest, according to a study.
Researchers investigated the effect of traffic noise on the telomere length of offspring Zebra finches. They found zebra finches that were exposed to traffic noise after they had left the nest had shorter telomeres at 120 days of age than Zebra finches that were exposed to noise until 18 days post-hatch (before they had left the nest) and whose parents were exposed to traffic noise during courtship, egg-laying, and nesting.
Corresponding author of the study, Dr Adriana Dorado-Correa, said, "Our study is a first step towards identifying the causal mechanisms that may account for differences in lifespan observed between birds living in urban or rural environments." "Cellular ageing as a result of urban stressors is something that may not have a very visible impact, but our study indicates that although birds may seem to be adapting to life in noisy cities, they may actually be ageing faster," said co-author Dr Sue Anne Zollinger.
The researchers evaluated the impact of traffic noise exposure on a total of 263 birds by comparing telomere lengths at 21 and 120 days post-hatch under three different conditions: birds that hatched to parents that were exposed to noise, with the offspring themselves exposed until 18 days after hatching; birds that hatched to non-noise exposed parents but which were themselves exposed to noise from day 18 to 120; and controls in which neither the parents nor the chicks were exposed to noise.
The traffic noise used in the study consisted of recordings of street traffic which mimicked typical urban noise patterns. The full findings are present in the journal Frontiers in Zoology.

Unique addition to Tamil literature
Lanka born Malini Mala is a German Tamil writer and poet. Last week she came to Lanka with her three kids to publish and launch three of her latest books. One of them titled Naan Enum NEE (meaning YOU are Me). have read and noticed her immense mastery of poetic Tamil and highly imaginative nuances in her poetic lines on her contributions in the Facebook. Before she left for Germany she presented the 3 books to me. My appreciation of the book appears in its pages. I thank her for that.
I shall attempt to transcreate some of the shorter love poems I enjoyed.
If you want to see me inside you, close your eyes tight and open your heart, there only me that would have bloomed as you are.
02. In some corner in the globe YOU and in opposite direction I might not have a chance to meet and yet to remain not to think about you, it is not possible not to think about you.
03. Not to wither away but to feel that I am blossoming. Dont dismantle, its you that will be shattered.
04. Whenever thinking of you, my affection extends to touch you, there spring hands for the wind.
05. Not only in person but even in thoughts you mustnt come, I said, but you are even robbing my dreams.
06. When my distant dreams and indelible actualities jointly travel and ends with tears, every drop of blood my heart bleeds pronounce only your name.
07. Rinsing my soul, the lines in my poetry I wrote for you- the moment you used it to tune the heart of another, the YOU in the inside of me remained dead.
08. When the mental sharing is compelled to be rejected, reminiscences become empty in actualities, unbearable the bridges of affection are shattered.
09. When my breathing is none but you, I dont probe the scent.
10. All the sayings I set up against you get d defeated by the pleadings of your look.
11. Im breathing even now only because of the sayings you send via the interspaces of the sky prompted by your soul
12. I lost you and you lost me, and I searched you all over the world exhausted and short of breath the soul within me smiled and uttered search in transferred places you will get it all right.
13. Realistically you in your own way, I on my path walk in opposite directions. The dream song of yours and mine that cannot be debilitated, sail on the waves of the stream moving dancing and making music.
14. I am blossoming all the time and you are at a distance unable to smell
15. Its not the chastity of Sita that was proved by her bathing in the fire, but the burnt out of her love for Rama.
16. Before the end of my withering days of flowers, my heartiest pleading is to see your vision at least once.
17. This is the breath of the bamboo forest wind. Do not hand it over to the uninitiated. They may use it to bow the furnace.
I shall stop here for want of space.
There are several longish and short poems in the 172-page volume attractively printed in a glossy paper by Evergreen Printers in Yaalpaanam. The book is priced at Rs 400/- only.
This is a book of unusual kind of poetry full of intense emotions but restrained. The mastery of the use of appropriate vocabulary is amazing. Congratulations to her. On her Visit to Lanka, Malini Mala has published two other works too, which need notice. Lets review them sometime later.
