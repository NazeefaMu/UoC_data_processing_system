Remember Anura Ranasinghe the great all-round cricketer: REMININSCING  WITH TILAK

Anura Ranasinghe was a fearless fighter to the core. His never say die attitude is what drew so many cricketers and friends around him.
Those who have seen and played with him did not describe him without doubt or hesitation, as the most talented batsmen to come out of the Nalanda Stables at the time. It was a tragic loss to cricket when he and a host of other highly talented cricketers including Bandula Warnapura were banned from all forms of cricket. This ban was for a considerable time for taking part in the rebel tour of South Africa. Anura passed away at a young age. He played 2 Tests and 9 ODIs and was a five-star all-rounder at the time. If the IPL was in existence then, he would easily have been hot property.
I saw Anura Ranasinghe only three or four times, when I came down on vacation from UK. He was a born cricketer and a leader. As a youngster at the tender age of 14, Anura was capable of walking into the Nalanda First Eleven team. On his debut he sparkled with an unbeaten innings of 115 against Maliyadeva College. He followed this up by leading the Nalanda College team, Sri Lanka under 19 team and Sri Lanka under 25 teams with success.
Anura Ranasinghe

In 1975 Anura leading Nalanda broke the Ananda-Nalanda bowling record of P.W. Perera which stood for over 30 years. Anura scored a swashbuckling 77 n.o. against India and lusty half centuries against England and Australia. These three gems of batting are still etched in the memories of his fans.
The turning point of Anuras life was axing him from the inaugural Test against England. This was even after scoring a fifty against the same opposition a few days earlier. A cricketer who put country before self, Anura was lost to Sri Lanka cricket due to the action administered behind the curtain.
Anura was the most feared all-rounder in school, club and international cricket. He gained everything from cricket and also lost everything because of cricket. Once Anura mentioned that, The first Test is over, but the scar in my heart can never be cured, and once a heart is broken it is shattered forever.
My observation of him was that he played late like all great batsmen, timed his strokes to perfection and picked the gaps with pin point accuracy. His left-arm medium pace bowling was sharp and he could swing the ball late both ways. He was also lithe and wiry which made him a brilliant fielder. The total package was devastating to the opposition.
Anura was 26 years old at his prime when the curtain came down on his career drastically. The Sri Lanka Cricket Boards 25-year ban imposed was too harsh. Cricket was his life. He was devastated and he passed away at the age of only 42. In my book, Anura Ranasinghe was the best All-Rounder produced by Sri Lanka up to thus far. They say the good die young.

Australia ropes in former Proteas pace ace for Lankan tour: Reverse swing key  to SL Tests: Donald

Mitchell Starcs ability to conjure reverse swing on the dry, flat pitches of Sri Lanka looms as the key to overcoming Australias recent Test match woes in sub-continental conditions according to the teams new bowling coach, Allan Donald.
Donald, the former South African pace ace, joined the Australian squad for the first time in Colombo yesterday as the players sweated through a punishing fitness and fielding session in stifling humidity ahead of the opening Test on July 26.
But Donald will be calling the shots at todays opening nets session of the tour where he will work closely with Australias pace bowling complement of Starc, Jackson Bird, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Mitchell Marsh, Moises Henriques and Josh Hazlewood.
With Hazlewoods involvement in that session dependent on him overcoming the illness that saw him sidelined during yesterdays session at P Sara Oval as the enervating post-monsoonal conditions took their toll.
Donald has been brought into Australias coaching set-up by Darren Lehmann as an interim replacement for Craig McDermott, and the man dubbed White Lightning at the height of his stellar playing career has an overriding priority for his two-month tenure.
To have Starc and his fellow quicks unlocking the mysteries of reverse swing that Donald believes are integral to teams having success on the sub-continent, and to have them perfect the art that has eluded Australian teams that have won a solitary Test in Asia over the past decade.
For me the ball has to swing - theres no excuses for that, Donald told cricket.com.au on his first day in the job having arrived in Colombo from the UK on Sunday night.
And it has to swing both ways, to keep the unpredictability level up. When I say both ways, that has to happen over the wicket and around the wicket.
I dont think you can come here (to Sri Lanka) in this heat, in this humidity and on these flat decks and be one-dimensional in the way the ball swings. It has to swing both ways.
You get these (batting) partnerships that can go on for hundreds of runs  you need to nip those in the bud as quickly as possible.
Its going to take creative thinking, a lot of courage, patience, but most of all a helluva lot of attitude to do that all day long if youre in the field for a long time. 
Donald, who took 330 wickets in his 72 Tests for South Africa from 1992-2002 and has more recently worked as bowling coach for the Proteas and in the Indian Premier League, knows from extensive first-hand experience that a pace bowlers greatest sin on sub-continental pitches is predictability.
The key to avoiding that pitfall is not only generating reverse swing, but an ability to keep batsmen guessing as to how and when the skill is imparted.
For me, the bloke that was the best at it was Wasim Akram because you didnt know what was coming, Donald said.
You were always guessing and I think thats where we need to go, thats where the skill needs to go. When you come here (to Sri Lanka) thats what it requires  to be unpredictable for a long time.
Donald has worked closely with Starc during the pairs recent stints with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and the South African is an unashamed fan of Australias left-arm quick.
Starcs the one, without a shadow of doubt, Donald said when asked who was best credentialled to deliver those telling spells needed to rattle the Sri Lankans who are expected to pose a far more potent threat on their home turf.
Hes a 150 (kilometre per hour) bowler, hes done it in the World Cup and in Twenty20 cricket. Ive seen him destroy top orders, middle orders, lower orders doing that same thing from both sides (of the wicket).
Thats where he is at, and thats why he is the leading fast bowler in the world right now. He leads that from the front, he just needs to be backed up by the rest of the group so theres a lot of hard work over the next couple of weeks.
Donald will also be stressing the importance of the new-ball pairing  likely to be Starc and Hazlewood  making early inroads into a Sri Lankan top-order that failed to fire during its recent winless tour to the UK.
Its massive, the new ball here in Sri Lanka is absolutely golden, Donald said about the need to strike early and regularly at the start of an innings.
Youve got to try and knock over two or three with the new ball. Its going to test all your skill over here. When you go to the sub-continent and play against Sri Lanka, they are very smart in their backyard.
They are clever here, they find a way, they grind the opposition down, especially when you bowl first and find yourself on the wrong end of the (coin) toss.

2nd u19  ODI at NCCFernando sets up series  leveler with 97

An excellent innings of 97 from skipper Avishka Fernando supported by sharp fielding and tight bowling saw Sri Lanka beat South Africa by 12 runs in the second under 19 ODI under the Duckworth Lewis rain rule to draw level one-all in the three-match series at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Sri Lanka defended their moderate total of 209 by reducing South Africa to 184-8 off 47.4 overs when rain ended the match. At that stage under the D/L method South Africa were 12 runs short of their target score.

Sri Lanka innings was held together by Fernando who hit 11 fours and two sixes in his 115-ball innings. No other batsmen made more than 26 as South Africa pinned down the Lankan batsmen with a mixture of pace and spin. South Africa lost three cheap wickets for 27 runs in their run chase and was always trailing behind. Two run outs at crucial stages of the innings didnt help their cause. With the exception of captain Wian Mulder (41) and Kenan Smith (46 n.o.) the rest of the batsmen struggled to find runs on a slow surface.
The run out of Jesse Christensen in the 35th over proved to be a vital loss for South Africa.
The third and final under 19 ODI will be played at the SSC on July 13.
