NCPA to introduce foster care system for orphans
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) is working on a proposal to revamp the current system of care rendered to orphaned children through a foster care system.
The NCPA stated that the foster care system will provide orphans with the opportunity of growing up in the care of a family rather than in an orphanage.
The system of servicing orphanages is outdated. It was initially introduced to Sri Lanka during the colonial period by the British. However, according to Child Protection Authority Chairperson Marini De Livera, that system is not currently prevailing in Britain now. She added that the NCPA has taken the initiative to find alternate methods of childcare. According to De Livera, the revamped system of childcare will be introduced in the near future to provide better and more holistic childcare to orphans.

Like never before
The controversy over the Central Bank bond sale continues to create ripples in political circles, even as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe created history this week by becoming the first sitting Prime Minister in this country to appear before a Commission of Inquiry.
What initially caught the imagination of the public was the public disclosure of telephone contacts between members of a Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) that probed the bond issue and Arjun Aloysius, the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and the person at the centre of the bond sale controversy.
Evidence led at the Commission of Inquiry indicated that Aloysius had telephone conversations with United National Party (UNP) parliamentarians Sujeewa Senasinghe, Ajith P. Perera, Harshana Rajakaruna and Hector Appuhamy and Sri Lanka Freedom Party parliamentarian, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera.
Senasinghe had 227 conversations with Aloysius while Rajakaruna had 176. Minister Jayasekera had 18 conversations while Appuhamy and Perera had nine and two telephone conversations respectively. Interestingly, it was also revealed that former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake has had 84 telephone conversations with Aloysius while his wife Mela Karunanayake had 320 conversations.
Another finding was that former Governor Mahendran had also had 27 telephone conversations with Kasun Palisena, the Chief Executive officer of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) which is the company at the centre of the bond sale controversy. Seven of these conversations were while Mahendran was serving as Central Bank Governor.
These disclosures led to a storm of protest both from the Joint Opposition (JO) as well as the parliamentarians concerned, who rushed to protest their innocence. Some parliamentarians complained to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that their parliamentary privileges have been violated. That issue has now been referred by Speaker Jayasuriya to the Privileges Committee of Parliament.
COPE meeting
Some parliamentarians have already taken the initiative to give their version of events. Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara stated that Aloysius met him to ask for his assistance in clearing his name after it was associated with the bond sale.
Jayasekara confirmed that Aloysius had in fact contacted him and met him at his office. He said Aloysius had tried to plead his innocence. He said he was innocent. He asked me to help establish his innocence before the parliamentary committee. I declined to do so. I told him that the allegations against him were serious and that I could not help him, Jayasekara said and argued that the minutes of the COPE meeting will vindicate his stance.
Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna told Parliament that his phone conversation with Aloysius was in January 2015, before he became a parliamentarian. He said that Aloysius was a family friend who he had known since childhood.
Rajakaruna said that as a COPE member, he had not discussed any matter pertaining to the investigations with Aloysius. You have to forget friendships when you are a member of the COPE. This is why we all signed the COPE report and agreed with the recommendations made in it, Rajakaruna said and claimed that there was a sinister move to sling mud at the COPE members.
It was State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe who was the target of the opposition in Parliament for his contacts with Aloysius. Senasinghe maintains that there was no improper conduct and returned a barrage of allegations directed at JO parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
On Tuesday, Senasinghe went a step further and questioned as to why there was a Commission of Inquiry only into the sale of Central Bank bonds, asking why there werent Commissions of Inquiry into other transactions undertaken during the previous regime.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera also wrote to the Commission of Inquiry. Perera denied having any conversation with Aloysius on the bond issue. In a letter to the Commission through his lawyer, the Deputy Minister has requested that, if there was evidence that there was improper phone contact, these be released to the public and that he be given an opportunity to cross examine the relevant investigating officers at the earliest opportunity.
It was against such a backdrop that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appeared before the Commission of Inquiry on Monday. Many UNP ministers were present when the Prime Minister attended, including the UNPs Deputy Leader, Sajith Premadasa. Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, himself a witness at the Commission some months ago, was conspicuous by his absence.
The Prime Minister was asked whether he was aware that Governor Mahendrans son-in-law Aloysius was a Chief Executive Officer of PTL. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he had asked Mahendran to ensure that his son-in-law did not get involved with the company and that he divests his shares. He said he had received repeated assurances from Governor Mahendran that his concerns would be addressed, but those promises hadnt materialised.
The commission also sought further clarification from the Prime Minister regarding a government decision to introduce a public auction for Central Bank bonds. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, while acknowledging that he had requested Mahendran to consider the issuance of bonds through auctions, said that he had expected the Governor to follow the due process.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also explained four telephone calls that had been received from Mahendran with regard to the issuance of Treasury bonds and some other matters. He quoted Governor Mahendran as assuring him that finances critical to the functioning of the government had been successfully raised.
If the JO or any other political group expected drama at the Commission of Inquiry of the kind it witnessed when Ravi Karunanayake gave evidence, they would not only have been disappointed- the move may have even backfired. The Premier was frank and forthright in his answers and generated the impression that he had acted in good faith. If at all, he could now claim the moral high ground for appearing before the Commission, a task not undertaken before by a sitting Prime Minister in this country.
opposing political parties
An endorsement of this came from none other than the Prime Ministers erstwhile political rival, former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. In a personal message, Kumaratunga noted: My unstinted support is with you in this most challenging task. You and I will remain till the end of our days in two opposing political parties, but there can be no disagreement when the vision is to build a better country for all Sri Lankans, a country where freedom, human decency and honest, pro people governance will reign supreme. Wish you much strength and courage.
Nevertheless, it is clear that there is resentment in the UNP that, while its members are being publicly vilified through the proceedings at the Commission of Inquiry, investigations into alleged misconduct during the previous regime are progressing only at snails pace. This is likely to continue to be an irritant to relations between the two parties, especially in the context of upcoming local government elections.
President Sirisena though faces an unenviable choice. He appointed a Commission of Inquiry due to pressure from within his own ranks of the SLFP. Now, some of them, such as Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera have been compelled to defend themselves. His partner in government, the UNP is annoyed that while they have to defend their conduct while in government, those who were in the government they ousted have not been subjected to the kind of interrogation that they have been through.
It will take more diplomacy, tact and understanding for the UNP and the SLFP to continue working together. However, stalwarts in both parties are confident this will happen, primarily because both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have a high level of understanding that transcends petty political squabbles. They will also know that, if the two mainstream parties dont work together, it will be the JO that runs away with the spoils of victory- an eventuality that both of them want to avoid at all cost.

A new era in Zimbabwe
Television screens worldwide were filled with scenes of jubilant Zimbabweans celebrating the resignation of 94-year-old President Robert Mugabe, the worlds oldest serving leader, on Tuesday after 37 long years in power. His resignation or more accurately, ouster came after the Zimbabwe Army led by General Constantino Chiwenga intervened with Operation Restore Legacy to thwart plans to name his second wife Grace Marafu Mugabe as his successor instead of former Vice-President Emmerson Crocodile Mnangagwa, who will now become President. Mugabe was also facing impeachment proceedings against him, which will now be nullified.
According to the Constitution his successor should be the current Vice-President, Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe but this will not go down well with the electorate fed up with the Mugabes. The ruling Zanu-PF party has thus taken the more popular option.
Independent Zimbabwe is still a young country, known as Rhodesia during the colonial period, named after colonial conquistador Cecil Rhodes. Having regained independence in 1979, landlocked Zimbabwe has known no other leader except for Mugabe, who became Prime Minister in 1980 before ascending to the Presidency. The stepping down of Mugabe, who once said only God could oust him from power, heralds a new era for Zimbabwe where the economy saw a tumultuous downturn under his reign to the point where its own Zimbabwe Dollar had to be more or less replaced by the US Dollar due to hyperinflation exceeding 231 million percent.
Mugabe polarized opinion domestically and internationally. Some saw him as a hero for ending white domination, while others saw him as a despot and villain who destroyed the social and economic fabric of Zimbabwe. Mugabe, who began his career as a teacher, made his mark as a guerilla fighter in Zimbabwes struggle for independence and became popular among Zimbabweans for his stand against colonialism and capitalism after being imprisoned by Rhodesias white rulers in 1964. However, he displayed the characteristic traits of many Third World despots after being elevated to the Presidency. His magic finally began to wear off when he began to blame the West for Zimbabwes economic troubles and for plotting to oust him.
His takeover of white-owned farms in 2000 saw a surge in his popularity among a segment of the population, but further isolated him internationally. He actually lost the 2008 election to Morgan Tsvangirai, but unleashed violence on the latters supporters to maintain his grip on power. In order to save the lives of his supporters, Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and although Mugabe was then forced to share power with his rival for four years, he remained President. Mugabe did not hesitate to use all the levers of state - the security forces, civil service and the state-owned media to further his own ends.
His one major achievement  the expansion of the education system saw literacy rates climb up to 90 percent, but ironically, this turned the tide against him as young, educated Zimbabweans saw through the web of deceit and corruption. Although once hailed as a king by some of his closest associates, the majority of Zimbabweans were aghast at the idea of a one-family rule. Hence the relief and jubilation on the streets of Harare and elsewhere.
The focus is now on the future of Zimbabwe after Mugabes divisive legacy. It will not be easy to dismantle the structures and systems that have been deeply ingrained in Zimbabwes political landscape for nearly 40 years and Mnangagwa himself has been part of that system. In essence, there should be a drastic change in the countrys political culture.
The new President as well as Opposition Leader Tsvangirai will have to work together to charter a new course for Zimbabwe, which will necessarily have to include free and fair elections. The Army has also shown that it will not stand idly in a critical situation and they will have to take that factor as well into account. South Africa, the giant neighbour to the South, has generally been supportive of Zimbabwe and the new leaders should strive to improve ties with the African Union as well as with the rest of the world.
There is unlikely to be any real change in the relationship between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe as a result of the new political developments in Harare. These ties were always excellent and cordial and most Sri Lankans still see Zimbabwe in terms of cricket, which is a passion the peoples of both countries share. We must remember that there was a time when both Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe were thought of as minnows in world cricket. When the established leading Test countries were reluctant to grant tours for Sri Lanka, it was Zimbabwe that came to our rescue apart from India and Pakistan. After Sri Lankas World Cup victory, Zimbabwe too has now come of age in cricket, having recorded an ODI series victory over Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka itself earlier this year. There is great scope for improving trade and tourism links between the two nations which both seek peace, development and reconciliation.

New fuel storage tank to hold buffer stock for 30 days
A fuel storage tank with a capacity of 15,000m3 and internal floating roof will be constructed at the Kolonnawa fuel storage tank to be able to hold a buffer stock for 30 days in the event of any emergency.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga received Cabinet approval for the above proposal.
The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals (CPSTL) which maintains 11 bulk depots and supplies to both the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Lanka Indian Oil Company will be in charge of the project.
They have estimated it to cost Rs 450 million. The Ministry noted that the annual fuel demand in the country had risen from four to five percent and thus it was necessary to upgrade the two main fuel storage tanks of Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela to store fuel for at least 30 days, in the event of an emergency. To have a smooth distribution of fuel around the country, it was also estimated that an additional storage capacity of 100,000 MT would be needed.
The Cabinet appointed Procurement Committee and Technical Evaluation Committee have called for tenders for the project on January 17, 2017 and have thereafter awarded the project to Indi East Engineering and Construction (Lanka) Pte Ltd.

Govt. calls for private sector salary increase: Kiriella
The Government yesterday, called on the private sector to increase the monthly salary of employees in par with the cost of living.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament, that the private sector employers are finding it difficult to fill in their respective vacancies due to low salaries.
The minister made these observations in response to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana. Todays youth prefer state sector employment compared to the private sector. The take home salary offered by the private sector should be increased at least to Rs 35,000. I know there are certain private companies paying Rs 15,000 to their employees, said the Minister, explaining the reasons for high unemployment as well as the increasing number of vacancies in private firms.
The minister observed that certain industries found it difficult to meet their production requirements due to the labour shortage. There are 100,000 vacancies at the Katunayake Free Trade Zone alone, but hardly anybody is interested, due to the simple reason that they receive an average salary of Rs 20,000. There is not enough money to save from this salary after paying boarding fees and meal expenses in Colombo, the Minister said.
I rented out private property to house Agriculture Ministry
Renting out a private property to house the Agriculture Ministry Office was done with the intentions of helping Parliament to improve its work, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday.
The minister who was speaking at the Committee Stage of Debate of Budget 2018, when the Finance Heads of his Ministry were taken up, said the office of the Agriculture Ministry had to be shifted to a new building as Parliament asked for its current premises to expand the work of the Parliamentary Oversight Committees.
We had to leave our current premises. We managed to find a building close by, but it had to be renovated to be able to house a Ministry office. Throughout this period, I had to take the blame in this regard. But I am happy to contribute to the benefit of country by offering our building to oversight committees of Parliament.
There had been one mistake on my side. I should have asked the Speaker to arrange an alternative place for our Ministry and make a move only after handing over the key to me. Then all the blame would not have come upon me, he said, responding to many allegations over the new Agriculture Ministry building in Rajagiriya.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at this point, said thathe did not ask for the building, but it was a proposal by Parliament.
SLFPs desire was holding LG polls at its earlist: UPFA Gen. Secy.
The SLFP is of the view that the Local Government polls should be held soon, UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said, refuting allegations that the SLFP and its leadership were trying to delay the elections.
Speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, the minister said both the SLFP and UPFA made submissions at Court requesting for the dismissal of the petition and pave the way to hold elections as early as possible.
Commenting on SLFP's links to the petitioners, the minister said, Those individuals who petition on a matter such as this, may have various political links. Despite their political views, they have the right to go before Court. The SLFP is of the view that this Court case must be expedited and concluded soon. We give our fullest support to it, which is also the stance of the President, he said.
The SLFP desire was holding LG elections before April, he said, adding that the SLFP was a party that upholds democracy and was committed to protect it.
The Minister said the SLFP strongly advocated for electoral reforms to re-introduce the First-Past-the-Post system sans preferential votes.
The SLFP was committed to end the election culture that heavily depends on money and which often leads to clashes within and between parties. The SLFP since its beginning, campaigned hard to hold the upcoming LG elections under the new electoral system, despite there being pressure to hold it under the old system, he said.
Commenting on arguments on tapping of phone calls, the minister stressed that neither the Government nor the President was involved in such acts, adding that calls tapping did not take place now.
Why cant mineral mining be handed to local entrepreneurs
The TNA in Parliament yesterday, questioned the preparations made to handover mineral deposits along the east coast to a foreign company.
TNA Digamadulla District MP Kaveendiran Kodeeswaran, speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018, asked as to why mining in these deposits could not be handed over to a local entrepreneur.
He said resources in one cubic metre of these deposits, were worth about Rs 2 billion. He said tests have been carried out from Oluwil to Arugambay in preparation to mine these deposits including ilmenite, without paying proper attention to environmental concerns. The MP also said that atomic power could be made from minerals found in the area.
Replying to this query, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage assured that the project would be carried out taking needful precautions to protect the environment. Even you are a good businessman. You will understand that Sri Lanka needs more investments in this area if we are to get out of the debt trap we are currently facing. If we could export minerals after value addition, the country could make a huge income. It would also produce more job opportunities for the people of the area, he noted.
Accusing Speaker of being biased:
I have no comments, says Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, observed that he need not inquire into statements by members of both the Government and the Opposition sides that he was partial.
The Speaker made this observation yesterday, in response to a point of order raised by Joint Opposition member Ranjith de Soyza, requesting permission to make a statement on a State Ministers statement that said the Speaker was partial.
Ranjith de Soyza said that the President had appointed a Presidential Commission.
The State Minister had said to the media that the commission is a conspiracy against the United National Party. He added the same State Minister told the Speaker was biased. We think you are impartial, said Ranjith de Soyza. So give your views on it.
The Speaker said that Opposition members too say that he was biased. You have said more than ten times that I am biased, the Speaker said. So I wont comment on it.
Join Opposition Member C B Rathnayake said that the Speakers in the House since Sir Francis Molamure had been impartial. He queried as to whose bliss befell upon the Opposition, when the Government side charged that the Speaker was biased.
JO MP accuses govt of putting country into chaos
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena accused the government of putting the country into a tangled mess having done a great damage by delaying elections, despite having many opportunities of holding local government elections over the past two years.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the committee stage debate on the financial heads of the Agriculture Ministry, Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry and the Primary Industries Ministry.
He accused the JVP of voting in favour of the amendment to the act which led to the current complicated mess. Had the JVP voted against it with the JO and defeated the government, we would not be facing this situation today. The fraudulent amendments to the act was brought to delay the elections of three local bodies. While the AG had determined that the government needed a 2/3 majority to go ahead with the amendments, it was the JVP who voted in favour and supported the government in obtaining the 2/3 majority.
He said that it was only the Joint Opposition that stood steadfastly on one stand that the elections should be held. The government has the ability to hold elections. There is no point in giving excuses. On one hand the government is stabbing democracy in the back by not holding LG election, while having created a wasteful administration in the over 330 local government institutions. Today the government has created a wasteful and controlling regime. This hinders the day-to-day services impacting on the development of the country, he said.

Pixar's lively 'Coco' hits the right notes

Pixar gets back to its roots with "Coco," which wraps two universal themes -- pursuing one's dreams, and how we remember loved ones -- in a colourful, culturally specific package. As the animation powerhouse has increasingly turned to the comfort of sequels, this look at the afterlife represents a lively original concept, one that powers through its flat patches with a whole lot of heart.
"Coco" uses the Mexican Day of the Dead (or Da de los Muertos) celebration as its narrative spine, with a young boy crossing over into the Land of the Dead, where he's surrounded by outlandish skeletal figures.
But the bones of the story are quite sturdy, tapping into a strong vein of emotion that recalls the cross-generational charms of movies like "Up" or "Inside Out."
Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) has grown up in a family that shuns music because his great-great-grandfather walked out on his wife to pursue his musical ambitions. The ban is vigorously enforced by the lad's multigenerational family, which includes his ancient great-grandma, Coco, whose mind is gradually being lost to dementia, a plot point handled with sensitivity and grace.
Alas, Miguel yearns to play the guitar, so much so that in his zeal to play, he rebelliously defies his family, stealing the guitar of the revered late singer Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), a legend in their small town.
That act has surprising, magical consequences: Miguel is cast into the colourful Land of the Dead, where his late relatives are assembled, even though (thanks to their skeletal construction) everyone seems to be literally falling apart.
There, Miguel encounters Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), who, like the other ghosts, wants to cross over to look in on the living, the twist being that these spectres cease to exist when nobody is left who remembers and honors their memory.
Directed by Lee Unkrich ("Finding Nemo") with Adrian Molina, a Pixar story artist making his directing debut, "Coco" is beautifully rendered, creating an alternate world that recalls the detail of "Monsters Inc."
The story, however, feels chaotic in stretches, and fleetingly hard to follow while laying down its elaborate rules after Miguel crosses over. Basically, he has to find an ancestor willing to provide his or her blessing and send him back to the living, only without imposing any conditions that would rob him of his dreams.
Yet if the movie at times labors during that midsection, it comes together beautifully at the end, exhibiting the sort of depth associated with Pixar's best efforts. Nor does it hurt that the film incorporates a moving song from "Frozen" composing team Robert Lopez and Kristin Anderson-Lopez. (As a further boost, Disney will affix the new short "Olaf's Frozen Adventure" to its release.)
Granted, Miguel's secret isn't as significant as Elsa's, but like many Disney protagonists, there's a commonality in his determination to be himself, even if that puts him at odds with his family. "One cannot deny what one is meant to be," he's told.
The genius of Pixar's virtually unparalleled run of early hits before a few recent misfires and modest disappointments, like "Cars 3" and "The Good Dinosaur" relied on its ability to create complex children's stories, tapping into concerns associated with childhood in a manner that's as appealing to adults as kids.
"Coco" doesn't fully scale the heights of its predecessors, but where it counts, the movie hits almost all the right notes.

Private sector encroaches wildlife reserve lands
A large extent of land in the Hambantota district allocated for wild elephant management reserves, have been encroached by the State and the private sector for various cultivations and setting up of houses.
The Malaara and Thammanawa Wewa reserves have also been encroached by these sectors. According to the wildlife officials, the residents of the vicinity said that illicit felling and poaching of wild animals, clearing of forest lands also go unabated. The residents of other parts of the Hambantota district said this situation has paved the way for wild elephants to arrive at villages close by and destroy houses and cultivations.
When queried, Southern Region Wildlife Director Prasantha Wimaladasa said that as a result of the clearing of forest reserves by the private sector at alarming proportions, lives of villagers are in danger and steps would be taken to nab the culprits who perform these unruly acts.

Programme to find biological parents
A programme is launched to assist Sri Lankan children adopted by foreign parents to find their biological parents, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne provided information of the programme during an interview with a television channel in the Netherlands, recently.

Proposed LRT line: MoU for feasibility study signed
The first stage towards the proposed Light Rail Transit (LRT) line was initiated yesterday with the signing of the MoU between Sen Young Company in Korea and the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry for consultancy services for the feasibility study in Colombo yesterday.
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe and SenYoung Company Vice President Kim Nam Siyol signed an MOU at the Ministry premises.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the LRT project is one of the most effective solutions for heavy traffic congestion prevailing in Colombo and the suburbs. Worsening traffic jams has had an impact on the countrys economic growth and the peoples lives.
We need to provide a sustainable solution for transport for the next 20 years at least by now. That is why, the Yahapalana Government has initiated an LRT (Light Rail Transit) project at a estimate cost of US$ 6 billion under the privatepublic partnership as the best viable option available for the traffic congestion and the most ideal transportation mode suitable for Colombo and its surburbs.
Under this project, we have aimed at strengthening the countrys public transport service to minimise the usage of private vehicles. The government will maintain such a consistent policy which would be crucial to provide an equitable, efficient, environmentally sustainable and safe mode of transport to all citizens,Minister Ranawaka added.
As evidenced by dynamic cities around the world, improvement and increased usage of public transport systems is the effective and sustainable solution to urban traffic congestion.
It is planned to establish seven LRT lines in order to ease traffic congestion in Colombo and the suburbs. They are from Kollupitiya to Maradana via Bambalapitiya, Boralla and Union Place (14.8km),from Colombo Fort to Peliyagoda via Maradana and Mattakkuliya (11.5km), from Dematagoda to Bambalapitiya via Borella, Kirulapana and from Havelock town (10km), from Malambe to Colombo Fort via Battaramulla and Borella (15.3km), from Malambe to Kottawa ( 9.6km), from Malambe to
Kaduwela (6km) and from Peliyagoda to Kadawatha (13km).
The construction work of the project will commence in December next year while it is planned to be completed by 2030.
The LRT will be a public-private partnership will help cater to the anticipated transport demand in the planned Western Province Megapolis region, covering Colombo and the suburbs. Light rail is a metropolitan electric railway system will be an elevated rail line ruining on roads.
Under the first stage, the approximately 25 km route through MalabeBattaramullaRajagiriyaBorellaUnion Place  Kollupitiya and Fort will be constructed under the concessionary loan scheme granted by JICA.
The final optimum route would be determined with special focus on environmental and social considerations, and inter-connectivity with other public transport modes,he said. We will implement the compensation process when the land acquisition takes place, he said.

Protest against shortcomings at school
Parents and past pupils of Chilaw St. Mary's Boys Vidyalaya conducted a protest campaign, blocking the Chilaw Zonal Education Office, yesterday morning, demanding quick solutions to problems and shortcomings confronting the school.
They assembled near the school premises and explained the reasons for the protest after religious observances. Thereafter, they went in procession and held the demonstration blocking the Zonal Education Office.
The protesters pointed out that the St. Mary's school currently had a shortage of 17 teachers as well as an acute shortage of buildings. Apart from this, a newly opened school building had cracks due to poor construction. The derelict old school building had not been demolished and removed, posing danger to students lives. The computer unit had not been equipped with a single computer and the newly built playground is threatened with destruction they pointed out to the Zonal Director of Education.
However, Zonal Director of Education Sadhamangala Subasinghe said he was unable to provide quick solutions since he too was in a helpless situation. He said when he executed teacher transfers, the transferred teachers got their transfers deferred through political patronage. When he requested new buildings for needy schools by giving them preference, politicians acted according to their whims and fancies by ignoring preference lists. He had no funds available with him to produce computers either, he said.
As the situation became restive with the Zonal Director and protectors exchanging heated worlds, another female employee of the Zonal Education office came to the scene and dragged the Director back into the office premises in an attempt to prevent him from divulging the true plight.
Then the protectors tried to forcibly enter the Zonal Director's office but they were prevented by the police.
Thereafter, the protectors visited the Chilaw Bishop's House and participated in a discussion.

Real cruise into last 16,  Liverpool blow three-goal lead
Paris: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as holders Real Madrid thrashed APOEL 6-0 in Cyprus to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, while Liverpool blew a three-goal lead in a thriller at Sevilla.
Zinedine Zidane's Real bounced back from their 3-1 loss at Tottenham Hotspur last time out by crushing APOEL, with four of the goals coming before half-time.
"It was a very good evening for us," said Zidane.
"We're on the right track. We're doing things well and we're building in strength. It's never easy but it was a complete display and we scored quickly."
The record 12-time winners had to wait until the 23rd minute to take the lead through Luka Modric, but a run of five goals in 15 minutes either side of half-time sent them through in style.
Karim Benzema put worries about his recent form to bed with a double either side of a Nacho effort, before Ronaldo got in on the act after the break.
The Portuguese climbed highest to power a header into the corner from an inviting Marcelo cross.
And the 32-year-old, who has only scored once in eight La Liga appearances this season, scored his eighth Champions League goal this term with an excellent left-footed finish from a tight angle.
Tottenham sealed top spot in Group H with a come-from-behind 2-1 victory at Borussia Dortmund.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the hosts ahead, but with Real's thumping win sending Dortmund out, Spurs levelled through Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min curled in a 76th-minute winner.
Liverpool collapse
Five-time champions Liverpool threw away a last-16 spot as Sevilla roared back from three goals down at half-time to draw 3-3.
Liverpool looked to be cruising into the knockout stage for the first time since 2008/09 when Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane both scored from flicked-on corners.
A rout similar to the 7-0 thrashing of Maribor in Slovenia earlier in the group phase looked on the cards when Firmino tapped in number three, but Sevilla staged a stirring second-half comeback.Wissam Ben Yedder beat Alberto Moreno to nod in a free-kick, before slotting in a penalty. And Argentinian Guido Pizarro struck in the third minute of injury-time to complete the fightback and leave Jurgen Klopp's visitors deflated.
"Fantastic first half and in the second half we made the mistake that we didn't continue playing football," said Klopp."We have to control the game with the ball and we didn't play football."
Elsewhere in Group E, Russian champions Spartak Moscow saw their chances hit by an injury-time equaliser in a 1-1 home draw with Maribor.
Sevilla will book a last-16 spot for the second straight season if they can win in Maribor on the final matchday in two weeks' time, while Liverpool have to avoid defeat at home to Spartak. AFP

From real to reel
There is a strong buzz around Karan Johars production house that Sridevi is likely to make a cameo appearance in her darling daughter Janhvis debut film Dhadak. The first look of the film was released by Karan Johar recently.
Says a source close to the development, The role of the girls mother in this film is brief but very important. And the woman must look graceful, dignified and be able to express her love for her rebellious daughter and be able to stand up for her against the father, who is vehemently opposed to her daughter marrying a boy from a socio-economically backward section. Srideviji will add a completely new dimension to the plot.
While the actress yes is awaited, we can safely say that Karan Johars take on Manjul Nagrajs Sairat will be very different from the original.
Says a source in the know, Karan Johar has selected Shashank Khaitan to direct Dhadak because Khaitan understands small town romances. He has done it in Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya and Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya. Karan wants the rich-poor romance to remain. And the small town setting would remain as well. However, the look of the film would be upscaled drastically. The original Marathi film had two working class newcomers who played youngsters from villagers. Sridevis daughter cant be launched like Rinku Rajguru in Sairat. Sridevi and Boney Kapoor wanted a glamorous, lavish launch for their daughter. They were very clear on that.

Reduce corruption to boost FDI - EU Ambassador
Sri Lanka should try to reduce red tape and minimize corruption to bring in more foreign direct investments to the country, said Ambassador of the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Tung Lai-Margue.
He was speaking at a seminar on the current of state of affairs in terms of EU policy on Government of Sri Lankas commitment to comply with international conventions.
He said that corruption too has to be eliminated and the business community can play a major role by not offering bribes to get their matters attended to.
One of the most important things that can be done to eliminate corruption is to severely punish wrongdoers which would be an example for others to refrain from doing so.
He said that in addition foreigners must be allowed to purchase land in Sri Lanka for their investment.
Sri Lanka should also look at offering long-term visas to investors and also charge less income tax from them at least in the initial stage of the investment. Foreign entrepreneurs investing in Sri Lanka should be given tax holidays for at least three years after starting their businesses.
The EU Ambassador also said that some of the recent steps and targets set and taken by the government are very encouraging. This includes the Vision 2025, National Export Strategy, new Inland Revenue Act and the proposals for a new constitution.
There have been positive accomplishments such as the passing of the Right to Information Act, establishment of the Office of Missing Persons, and commencing a process of constitutional reforms. However, reports from various UN agencies and national and international civil society committed to supporting reforms indicate that the reforms have not progressed as expected and desired. He said that after the lifting of the fisheries ban, exports to EU has been increasing and similarly apparel exports too are increasing.
Meanwhile Deputy Minister Policy Planning and Economic Development Dr. Harsha De Silva said that the regaining of GSP Plus and the lifting of the fisheries ban have resulted in an upturn in order books for the European markets.
He said that world labour laws and working conditions are changing and in Sri Lanka too this is happening especially with extended working hours and also flexi hours which has already started in Battaramulla. We observe that Sri Lankan women workforce of 35% is one of the lowest in Asia and we hope that new labour laws would help to increase this figure.

Rose prepares for battle as European Tour tees off in Hong Kong
Hong Kong: Golfs world number six Justin Rose said ice baths and a team of fitness experts helped him keep up his energy last season, as he eyes a fast start to the new European Tour in Hong Kong.
Rose takes his place among Europes top golfers at the Hong Kong Open Thursday just days after the 2017 circuit finished.
His unflagging energy saw him win tournaments in China and Turkey in the space of a month before narrowly missing out at the seasonal finale in Dubai last weekend.
Today is my off-season! joked a bleary-eyed Justin Rose on Tuesday, hours after flying in from the Middle East.
I take the day off today and then we get going again tomorrow.
Ill definitely do [ice baths], a lot of contrast -- hot-cold stuff. Ill do that pre-round, post-round sometimes.
I track my heart rate variability every day to get a bit of a snapshot of how my body is coping with time changes, and jet lag. If I need to focus on recovery I will. If I need to focus on fitness I will.
It is a punishing schedule for todays golfers, who jet back and forth across time zones for tournaments while keeping their bodies in a peak athletic condition that has become essential in the modern game.
And as events such as the Asian Tours historic Hong Kong Open are added to the European Tours winter schedule as jointly sanctioned competitions, the seasons start has shifted earlier and earlier. The Englishmans next stop is the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas next Thursday, a tournament run by the Tiger Woods Foundation which is expected to see the hotly-anticipated return of its namesake golfing superstar.
The sooner you can win in a tour season the better, Rose told AFP.
The way I look at it, it counts for the 2018 season but also calendar-year wise it affords you the opportunity to go into Christmas and the New Year with some momentum.

Seattle on brink of MLS final as Houston crash
0Los Angeles: Defending champions Seattle Sounders put one foot in the final of the MLS Cup on Tuesday after outclassing Houston Dynamo 2-0 in the first leg of their Western Conference Championship game.
First half goals from Gustav Svensson and Will Bruin sealed a clinical win for the Sounders as Houstons raucous home crowd was silenced.
A deserved win for Seattle could have been even more emphatic had it not been for a missed penalty from playmaker Nicolas Lodeiro on the half hour mark.
Houston were also forced to play most of the match with only 10 men after Jalil Anibaba was dismissed for hauling down Joevin Jones with the Seattle player bearing down on goal.
Seattle took the lead after only 11 minutes, with Swedish midfielder Svensson leaping high to meet Lodeiros corner from the left.
Houston got a reprieve when Lodeiro saw his spot-kick turned away by Dynamo goalkeeper Joe Willis, but Seattle remained on top.
Three minutes before half-time, Jones found space on the left and swung in a pinpoint cross that Bruin met with a header that wrongfooted Willis to make it 2-0.
Seattle substitute Victor Rodriguez might have killed off the tie but his injury-time shot rattled the crossbar.
The result leaves Houston needing a miraculous turnaround in next weeks second leg in Seattle if they are to deny the Sounders a second straight appearance in the MLS Cup championships game.
The winner from the Western Conference will play either Toronto FC or Columbus Crew in the final. Toronto and Columbus played out a 0-0 draw in their first leg in Ohio on Tuesday.
Toronto arrived in Ohio with strikers Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco both suspended.
The lack of an attacking outlet saw Toronto content to sit back for much of the contest with Columbus goalkeeper Zack Steffen not required to make a single save all night.
At the other end, Toronto goalkeeper Alexander Bono rescued his team five minutes from time, denying a close-range effort from Harrison Afful with a superb reflex save.
Crew had also threatened early in the second half, when Pedro Santos went down after dribbling around Bono.
Ola Kamara latched onto the loose ball and shot at goal, but his effort was blocked by Toronto defender Drew Moor.
Santos -- who had appealed for a penalty after Bono raced off his line to dive at the strikers feet -- was booked for diving.

Shakib Al Hasan loses temper and fined
Former Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who is captaining Dhaka Dynamites in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), landed in a major controversy for his behaviour during a match after the umpire rejected the LBW appeal.
The incident happened against Comilla Victorians on Monday when the latter needed 74 runs off 68 balls to win the game. Imrul Kayes was on strike when the veteran Bangladesh all-rounder appealed for the decision but the umpire turned it down and it didnt go down well on him. Disappointed with umpires decision, he got furious and even uttered few cuss words.
For his indecent behaviour, the Bangladesh Cricket Board decided to impose a 50 percent match fees fine. Shakib was found to have breached Article 2.2.4 of the BCB Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to Using language or gesture(s) that is seriously obscene, seriously offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee or any other third person during a Match. In addition, three (03) demerit points have been added to Shakibs disciplinary record, the BCB release stated.
Pursuant to Article 7.5 of the Code, if a player reaches four or more demerit points in the tournament, the points will be converted into suspension points. Four demerit points would lead to a ban of one match.
Shakib is the leading wicket-taker for Dynamites this year. In the match against Rangapur Riders, he grabbed five wickets and joined the elite list of bowlers with 3 or more five-wicket hauls in the Twenty20 format.

Overcoming delays in corruption cases:
Special unit under AGs dept
A special unit is to be set up under the Attorney Generals Department to take immediate action regarding corruption cases held up in the Department due to a shortage of attorneys-at-law to handle them, the Department Sources said. As a first step in this direction, a request has been made to assign a new batch of 50 attorneys-at-law to the Department, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC said.
After recruiting this new batch of attorneys, they will be entrusted with the task of taking quick action regarding them after study, the Attorney General said.
This would help overcome the problem regarding the delay in handling corruption cases and serving indictments on them, he added.

Spotlight falls on Smith, Root on Ashes stage
London: Two of the worlds best batsmen will be in opposition when Australias Steve Smith and Englands Joe Root both lead their countries for the first time in an Ashes Test at Brisbane on Thursday.
Smith may be an unorthodox run-scorer but he is currently top of the Test batting rankings and Root, a more classical stylist, is second in that table.
Shoring up a fallible top order is something both Smith, with assistance from David Warner, and Root, backed up by a left-handed opener of his own in Alastair Cook, have got used to in recent months.
If either star batsman struggles for runs, it is liable to damage their teams prospects and add to the pressure that confronts most captains in an Ashes series.
At 28, Smith is two years older than Root and the more experienced captain, having led Australia in 26 Tests, whereas Root has just come off his first home season as skipper. After series wins over South Africa and the West Indies, the Ashes is the Yorkshiremans first overseas tour at the helm.
Neither of the two captains is known for especially unusual tactics, while theyve each shown it is possible to play aggressive cricket without resorting to over-the-top sledging, verbal abuse.
When Smith was recalled to the Australia side during the 2010-2011 Ashes series, he said: Ive been told that Ive got to come into the side and be fun.
That led to mocking taunts of Tell us a joke, Smithy from England when he came out to bat.
He was dropped soon afterwards but fought his way back into the Australia side during the 2013-2014 Ashes.
At this stage, Smith had only gone beyond 50 six times in 28 Test innings, and averaged 33. But the third Test at Perth saw Smith compile his maiden Test hundred and he has not looked back since, with his ability to improvise shots on the legside now a familiar sight.
It took Smith just 99 innings to score 20 Test hundreds, an achievement all the more impressive given he needed 23 knocks to get his first ton.
I probably didnt look back and reflect on much until my 50th Test match at the SCG (Sydney Cricket Ground) (this January against Pakistan) and after that game the team doctor, Peter Brukner, said I am one of three players to have played 50 Tests and averaged 60, Smith told Wisden Cricket Monthly magazine.
Now with 20 hundreds, and hopefully a lot more cricket in front of me, it would be nice to get up there.
Root once had a reputation for being cheeky, but that doesnt mean he has larked around as skipper.
In August, his declaration left the West Indies needing to score 322 runs in just over a day to win the second Test at Roots Headingley home ground. Thanks to a brilliant unbeaten century by Shai Hope, the West Indies pulled off a remarkable win. If Root proved too reliant on James Anderson and Stuart Broad come the last day, there was hardly any criticism of his declaration when he made it.
Since then occasional off-spinner Root has had to deal with losing vice-captain Ben Stokes after the all-rounder remained in England following a late night fracas outside a Bristol nightclub.
Root has scored 1,059 runs in 10 Tests this year ahead of the Ashes, including three hundreds.
He has arrived in Australia desperate to atone for a poor first tour Down Under in 2013-2014, when England were thrashed 5-0 and Root was dropped for the final Test.
I think one thing for me (this time) will be making sure the game is played at my pace, trying to be nice and calm and collected out in the middle -- and feel really ready for that aspect of Test cricket, which you do experience here in Australia, said Root.

Squads for the first Ashes test:
England - Joe Root (capt), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Jake Ball, Stuart Broad, Alastair Cook, Dawid Malan, Mark Stoneman, James Vince, Chris Woakes

Sri Lanka to send first nano satellite into space in 2020
The Moratuwa Arthur C. Clarke Institute has now opened the doors for Sri Lanka to gain satellite technology know how by entering into an MOU with the Russian Federation Government through the good offices of the Sri Lankan government.
Director General of the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for New Technology Sanath Panawennage said following the MOU, the Samara Aeronautics University of Russia has agreed to provide Nano Satellite Technology and help Sri Lanka to station such satellites in space.
As the first step in this direction, a workshop was held in Sri Lanka by a team of Russian satellite scientists.
As the second stage, a selected 17-member group of Sri Lankan engineers visited Russia and gained first hand knowledge and information regarding Nano Satellite Technology. Accordingly, Sri Lanka would step into produce its first ever nano satellite in 2018. Thereafter, Sri Lanka will enter the satellite technology era by sending its first nano technology satellite into space in 2020.
Research scientist Samantha Pushpakumara of the Nano Satellite Project's Junior Group Leader said a nano satellite is a tiny electronic system about one to 10 kilogrammes in weight revolving round the earth in an attitude of about 400 to 500 kilometres. A nano satellite will have one to twelve units.
It can be used for communication photography, obtaining climatic data, as well as data needed in agricultural cultivation, tsunami warnings and receiving data on ship and boat positions. Nano satellites also cover areas inaccessible to bigger satellites.
The main units in a nano satellite includes, an electronic power supply subsystem, on board computer subsystem, a micro controller, an altitude determination and control subsystem, communication sub system (with UHF and VHF communication equipment) and a payload subsystem.

Sri Sathya Sai Baba  - The God Man
Late Sai Babas birthday falls today and celebrations will be held by way of blood donations, other social service acts and Bajan singing all over the world through thousands of Sai centres.
A boy born in the poor remote village Puttaparthy in Andra Predesh in India on November 23, 1926 was named Sathya Narayan Raju by his parents, Eashwaraamma and Pedavenkaram Raju Ratnakara. His siblings included an elder brother Selsha Raju, sisters Venkanna, Parvathamma and younger brother Janakirammiah.
He became famous in the village from his birth, for some mysterious things happened at the time he was born. His father was a music lover and it is said that his music instruments made music when he was born and a cobra appeared on the bed. He was different as a small child. Parents found that he was fed by some divine force. He displayed special intelligence. Began materialising things like food and objects like pens and pencils and erasers at the school going age for his friends and was charitable. He was a happy boy with extra intelligence where he knew things beyond the teachers. He was known as the miracle child in the school.
Thinking he was possessed by a demon spirit he was Reincarnation of the Shirdi Sai Baba that lived in Maharasthra and died eight years ago. As a boy of fourteen years he walked out of the house saying that he had a divine mission to perform and no longer belongs to the family. He performed enormous miracles to the people around him and soon people began to gather around him and worshiping him as their Guru. Famous people including politicians began to come to him and by 1944, a mandir was erected in Puttaparthy for him which was named by him as Prasanthi Nilayam. He said that there will be a time that people will have to use binoculars to see him. He proclaimed that the World will come to Puttaparthy and thousands of sick who came to him and were healed.
In 1954, Sathya Sai Baba established the first social service project, a small free general hospital in the Puttaparty. It was in 1963 that Sai Baba predicted that he will reincarnate after his death as Prema Sai.
Words of Sathya Sai explain his mission. I have come to light the lamp of love in your heart. I have not come here on behalf of some exclusive religion. I have not come on a mission of publicity for a sect, a creed or cast. Nor have I come to collect followers for a doctrine. I have no plan to attract disciples into my fold or any fold. I have come to tell you of the unitary faith and spiritual principle, this path of love, this virtue of love, this duty of love and this obligation of love.
His mission embraced the entire India. Every Prime Minister and President went for his blessings. He established universities, hospitals, super speciality hospitals that did kidney and heart transplants and the best of doctors worked free. Average of over 25,000 people arrived in Puttaparthy every day. Buildings began to rise all over Puttaparthy. Foreign devotees form all over the world built huge buildings with hundreds of units.
True to the prediction of Sathya Sai Baba the small remote village became a place of world focus. An airport was established. The west came to Puttaparty to celebrate Christmas. All Buddhist countries jointly celebrated Vesak in Puttparthy. Hindus flocked for all Hindu festivals. Millions came to celebrate Sai Babas birthday.
Though he never had a recognised school education, he established universities, served as the chancellor of them guiding the professors and students, he guided the engineers in construction work, and he made key note addresses to medical professionals. He was a great speaker when his speeches were translated to English language he corrected the translator. He proved his omni presence to the devotees beyond doubt. I have experienced it myself. Hundreds of books have been written on him.
Sai Baba in 1995 commenced a drinking water project to the Anathapur District, through love to end the suffering of 1.2 million people without water. The Sai world flocked to help him with the funds required and it was accomplished within a short period of four years.
He continued his mission on education and established several schools and universities. The disciplines of these institutes remain unmatched. Sai baba lovingly addressed as Swami by his devotees collected letters from his devotees. Many posted him letters. There cannot be anyone in the world who received so many letters. On April 24, 2011 having lived for 84 years he passed away. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Cricketers including Sachin Tendulkar and devotees from more than 100 countries attended the funeral together with more than five hundred thousand people. His mission and the Sathya Sai trust continues the good work initiated by Sai Baba and for the devotees making them feel that Swami is with them as before.

Trash talk only putting Aussies under pressure, says Root
Brisbane: England captain Joe Root said Australia were only putting pressure on themselves with some outspoken comments before the Ashes series, as he calmly dismissed provocative remarks by spinner Nathan Lyon.
Root, who said England were about due their first Test win in Brisbane in 31 years, said Lyons remarks were out of character after the bowler boasted that Australia hoped to end some of the tourists careers.
Thats not how Id want my players to go about things... its slightly out of character, Root told reporters in Brisbane, before the first Test starts on Thursday.
Whether its maybe a team strategy or hes just taken it upon himself to do that  who knows The more guys talk going into a series, the more they put pressure on themselves.
Lyon tore into Englands 2013-2014 touring team, which lost 5-0, accusing wicketkeeper Matt Prior of being scared. Opener David Warner also said playing England was like war.
On Wednesday Australia skipper Steve Smith joined the chorus of players warning that the pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins would reproduce the fireworks of Mitchell Johnson, who took 37 wickets in the 2013-2014 series.
But Root said Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins would be feeling the heat as they play their first home Ashes series bearing a heavy weight of expectation.
The three are very talented cricketers and theyve done some good stuff for Australia in the past, Root said.
But for all three of them its their first Ashes series in Australia and Im sure they will be feeling the heat.
Theres been a lot of noise and comparisons made about them and theyve got to go and try and replicate that.
A lot of the guys have played these blokes before and know what they bring to the table and are very well prepared as to what to expect from them.
Weve just got to trust our games, trust all the work weve done and give them as little as possible.
Australia are banking on making a big statement at Brisbanes Gabba ground, where they have not lost a Test match since 1988. But Root said England hoped to seize a surprise initiative in the first Test.
I think were about due, arent we he said.
Its the reason why Australia play the first Test of a series here all the time, theyve got such a good record playing here.
But if we can go one-up in the series here then it really upsets the apple cart and it could give us a lot of momentum going into the rest of the Tests.
Root, 26, who is lining up for only his eighth Test as England captain and first in an Ashes Test, exuded a zen-like calmness on the eve of the Gabba showdown.
Im actually surprised how calm I am, he said. I am sure tomorrow morning there will be a few little nerves flying about, but thats natural going into any series, especially an Ashes series.
The best thing is that I feel ready, I feel really prepared. I have full confidence in this group of players and thats why I feel so relaxed going into it.
We have to read the situation quickly out in the middle and play the surface and control our emotions, if we do that then well give ourselves a really good chance.

Udayangas FR against FCID officer re-fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Russian Ambassador Udayanga Weeratunga seeking an Interim Order to recall the warrant issued for his arrest by Colombo Fort Magistrate was yesterday re-fixed for support on December 5.
The matter was not taken up for support on the basis that bench was not properly constituted.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This is over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
Weeratunga had filed this petition through his mother-in-law Latha Indrani, his power of attorney holder.
In his petition, Weeratunga stated that he is currently residing in Mekhanizatoriv Street Kiev, Ukraine and sought an Interim Order restraining the Central Bank's Financial Intelligence Unit Director from suspending his bank accounts and continuing to suspend his bank accounts.
The petitioner stated that the seventh respondent, an FCID Chief Inspector had moved Magistrates Court for a warrant for his arrest.
The petitioner sought a declaration from the Court that the Chief Inspector infringed the petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 11, 12(1) and 13 of the constitution. The petitioner further said the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank has infringed his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the constitution by the purported decision to suspend debit transactions of the bank accounts in contravention of the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price.
He told the police that these ground attack aircraft had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.
President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appeared for the Attorney General.

UNP back-benchers call for comprehensive probe
The UNP back-benchers yesterday urged a comprehensive investigation on the Bond market transactions that took place during the second term of the Rajapaksa regime.
Convening a press conference at the Parliament complex yesterday, they identified the controversial telephone records relating to former Perpetual Treasuries Director Arjun Aloysius and a few members of the COPE as the tip of an iceberg.
Probe with whom Arjun Aloysius has had contacts with since 2008. If Aloysius is wrong then the officers who helped him are also wrong. PTL is a third party. What did the Central Bank officials did till he robbed the CB said UNP MP Thushara Indunil.
He said not only the MPs telephone conversations but also the calls between the CB officers and the PTL should also come out to light to reach a fair judgement.
A bank account opened at the Bank of Ceylon in favour of CWG Hambantota 2018 (Pvt.) Ltd has received a total of Rs.200 million from state establishments and another Rs.700 million from private institutions. Perpetual Asset Management has credited Rs.15 million. What could have been the relationship the former Government had with Perpetual Asset Management to donate Rs.15 million Not only the transactions of the CB but the Siriliya operation, Greek Bonds, hedging, the gem bag of Daisy, SriLankan Airlines, killing of Thajudeen should also be given prominence and investigated, Indunil said. He requested reveal the names of all 41 MPs alleged to have communicated with Arjun Aloysius.
MP Indunil stated that the UNP established a new culture by two Ministers tendering resignation making way for the investigations to continue and the prime Ministers voluntary appearance before the Commission.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti now cries foul highlighting the telephone records. He had stated that those MPs are not fit to be in the COPE. However, it was Minister Rauff Hakeem who proposed Handunnetti as the COPE Chairman and Deputy Minister Ajith Perera seconded it. Hence, if he has any problem with them being in the Committee, he too has to resign from his post, he said.
UNP MPs Mujibar Rahuman and J.C.Alawathuwala also spoke.

AU welcomes Mugabe resignation
ETHIOPIA: The African Union (AU) has welcomed Robert Mugabes decision to step down as President of Zimbabwe, saying the people had expressed their will for a peaceful transfer of power.
AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat said he welcomes the decision by President Robert Mugabe to step down from his position as Head of State following a lifetime of service to the Zimbabwean nation.
President Mugabe will be remembered as a fearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter, and the father of the independent Zimbabwean nation, he said in astatement released late Tuesday.
After dominating nearly every aspect of Zimbabwean public life for decades, the 93-year-olds tenure on Tuesday ended in an announcement at a special joint session of parliament where MPs had convened to impeach Mugabe after the ruling party sacked him as their leader earlier this week.
Mugabe is likely to be replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he fired as his deputy earlier this month in a move that pushed infuriated army chiefs to seize power and force the presidents exit.
Despite the military intervention, the AU did not characterise Mugabes ouster as a coup, but rather a legitimate expression of the will of Zimbabweans.
The African Union recognises that the Zimbabwean people have expressed their will that there should be a peaceful transfer of power in a manner that secures the democratic future of their country, the statement said. - AFP

Ball wins England Ashes  pick after fitness battle
Brisbane: Jake Ball has won Englands fourth seamer spot for the Ashes Test series opener after being passed fit to play against Australia at the Gabba on Thursday.
Nottinghamshires Ball, 26, won the only contentious place ahead of fellow seamer Craig Overton in the England line-up after three warm-up games. It will be Balls fourth Test cap, but his first in an Ashes series, after his recovery from a sprained ankle suffered in Englands second warm-up match in Adelaide two weeks ago.
It wasnt an easy decision, skipper Joe Root the official England website on Wednesday.
Craigs come into the squad, and everything thats been asked of him hes done brilliantly well, but Jake has bowled well when hes had his opportunities on the tour.
Root said Balls adaptability to the Australian conditions had won him the nod.
I think the way he goes about things on these surfaces could be really challenging for the Australians, Root said.
He wouldnt be playing if not, Root added, when asked about Balls fitness. Hes worked really hard and done everything he can to make sure hes in top shape for this first Test.
Ball has bowled only 15.4 overs so far on the tour, while Overton, who has not played a Test, featured in all three of Englands tour games, taking eight wickets. England will finalise their batting order on the morning of the Test, with reports suggesting that all-rounder Moeen Ali is likely to move above wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow to bat at number six.

Budget 2018: ushers in new era
We are well on the way to establishing Sri Lanka as an Indian Ocean hub for trade, investment and for global talent. Exports increase our growth, our prosperity and our profits. They benefit us all in our island nation and they work hand in hand with the strategy we are focusing on as a government to build a strong economy. Our global competitiveness, our resilience and our credibility are rising. We are passionate about building a robust and successful Sri Lankan economy and look forward to a bright future.
Sri Lanka has truly come a long way from the dark days of Mahinda Rajapaksa  who governed only for himself, his family and cronies. The economy was in a mess and Sri Lankans lived in fear for their safety. Sometimes we forget how far we have progressed as a nation. Our country has enormous potential and we have strong recognition by international financial experts that the reforms we have taken are the right ones and we are assured that under our Government Sri Lankas international reputation is restored and strong.
Access to investment
Our government is working to fix the mistakes of the past and building a stronger economy for a better future for all Sri Lankans. So far we have created more than 400,000 jobs and helped over 200,000 families secure a home. This investment in these houses is only possible because of the measures our government has taken to build a strong economy. Some of those decisions have been hard and tough measures have been put in place. But let me assure you, decisions are always taken in the best interests of Sri Lanka and its people. We are working to fix the mistakes of the past and build a stronger economy for a better future of all Sri Lankans.
We have a proven record, a clear vision and the determination and strong leadership to build a better Sri Lanka for the future. In order to do so, the economy is central to everything we do.
Without a strong economy, we cannot afford to pay for schools, hospitals, jobs or wages. A strong economy and good infrastructure will bring foreign investment and increase wages for all Sri Lankans.
The Governments Budget promoted enterprise and prized development and trade. A prime objective of this is to assist the business community by offering them credit under more flexible terms as we set up a special Bank for Development Finance to assist the business community. We will strip away unnecessary bureaucracy and hurdles to receiving investment and make the process easier. This will mean access to credit for entrepreneurs at non punitive and affordable rates. Giving young people access to investment and creating wealth and jobs.
Rajapaksa regime
We are able to do this because we have effectively managed our nations debt. In the near future the Rs three trillion debt we inherited from the Rajapaksa regime will be settled. Then we will be an even stronger position to give a helping hand to business, to entrepreneurs and to our future. Investing billions to ensure our people get education, skills training and can find jobs.
So we are making sure investment reaches the right people and expanding schemes to help Sri Lankan business and entrepreneurs making sure those who deserve backing and support receive it.
Last week saw a Budget to build a stronger economy. It was a Budget for enterprise. Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest. Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future.

Budgetary challenges for 2018
Good economics is good politics goes the old adage and Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera, relatively new to his crucial portfolio of public finance has presented his maiden budget, styled a blue green budget, which in characteristic Mangala style, is optimistic, forward looking and environmentally friendly, highlighting the opportunities and the promise available to an economy emerging from nearly three decades of civil conflict. The budget debate, as it proceeds through Parliament, reflects many economic challenges ahead for the Finance Minister and economic Yahapalanaya.
That the National Unity Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe inherited an economy, which had been badly mismanaged together with significant corruption in the preceding term, is widely accepted not just in the commercial world, both local and international, but also among the general public. However, the public expectations from the Yahapalanaya Administration have been quite high, as the Rajapaksa corruption was largely blamed for Sri Lankas economic malaise.
The end of the Rajapaksas in 2015 raised public expectations, that a good governance dividend would be forthcoming. It is this good governance dividend which now, the leaders of Yahapalanaya have called upon Mangala Samaraweera to deliver. Mangala is no stranger to state sector reform. It is worth remembering that it was Mangala 20 years ago, who as the then Minister of Telecommunications and Media, who implemented the entire telecom sector liberalization, ending the state sector monopoly and privatizing Sri Lanka Telecom, resulting in Sri Lanka today having South Asias most advanced telecoms infrastructure and its highest mobile and internet penetration rates.
Outlook upgrade
A few days ago, the international credit rating agency, Standard and Poors revised upwards, Sri Lankas credit rating outlook from negative to stable. In practical terms, this should make Sri Lankas access to the international capital markets to refinance its maturing dollar loans easier and somewhat less costly. On a more policy recognition level, the outlook upgrade recognizes what the rating agency calls the improving reform momentum including the passage of the new Inland Revenue Act, the proposed Liability Management Act and the recent independence of the Central Bank.
However Standard and Poors also states that we continue to observe significant challenges to the policy making environment. Economically the Rajapaksa post war policy of foreign, largely Chinese, commercial borrowings spent on projects of dubious utility value, such as a little used port, airport and a loss-making budget airline together with the worlds most expensive highways was no longer fiscally possible.
Besides the astrological predictions, the other more rationale political reason for Mahinda Rajapaksa calling the presidential elections two years before his term was over, might well have been the advice of his economic gurus that the borrow and spend good times, just could not be sustained. The Yahapalanaya Administration though is faced with dealing with both the decades of economic reform stagnation, as the civil war sapped our national energy and more importantly the mismanagement of the immediate post war era. This mismanagement ballooned the national, especially foreign, debt, while making precious little contribution to sustainable economic growth. The challenges of a low productive agricultural sector, an education system which produces graduates for non-existent white-collar jobs, inflexibility in the labour market through archaic regulations, are all long overdue for reform. The immediate challenges of stagnant or declining expatriate worker remittances, undiversified exports and especially significantly below peer group average foreign direct investment and tourist arrivals, all remain to be addressed.
Poverty legacy
The Blue-Green Yahapalanaya budget 2018 addresses and deals with one of the key effects of the decades long civil war in the Northern and Eastern provinces. The recent survey by the Census and Statistic Department denotes that average median household incomes are considerably less in the North and East than they are in the rest of the country. The destruction of community infrastructure has resulted in serious livelihood and income generation challenges especially in the rural parts of the North and East. Amid the rural poverty, the food security, health and overall vulnerability of certain social sub groups, such as women-headed households and children in low income families are acute.
The budget also allocates funds for the implementation of the much delayed fifty thousand houses programme in the North and East. This time directly under the President in his capacity as Minister of Reconciliation. It is somewhat regretted that this flagship project, much awaited and anticipated in the North and East was delayed due to the controversy over the proposal to build the houses in steel rather than the common and culturally acceptable brick and mortar constructions.
In terms of reconciliation, while the Government works through the constitutional framework for political reform, it is also important to recognize and address the effects of the war, especially on the most vulnerable sectors of the population. It is expected that the fifty thousand houses programme if targeted correctly will make a significant contribution in that regard.
It is interesting to note that the Government enjoys a two third (2/3) majority in Parliament for its annual signature finance bill and that both the first and second readings of the budget has passed with greater than one hundred and fifty (150) votes, being a two third majority in the House. A Government which commands that much support in the legislature should not waste this majority on business as usual, but move towards effecting the economic, democratic and reconciliation reforms which Sri Lanka, so badly requires.

Citizens' Mail
Why oppose every good move
Talks these days are about Budget. A budget is essential to a country like pots and pans to a pantry. The yahapalana government, despite a few positive allegations levelled against it, has certainly focussed its attention towards the requirements of the pantry during their every budget. It is also a known fact that a government should find its revenue through Budget by introducing a new, or increasing the existing, taxes.
Normally, as we have experienced, the prices of all essential commodities that included the day-to-day requirements were increased pushing the ordinary man into financial difficulties. It should be specially mentioned about the fuel price increases that hit the whole nation during the past budgets.
But the government at its first budget itself reduced the prices of fuel, electricity and gas not only for the benefit of the masses but also to our amazement. Apart from it, the reduction of the prices of the drugs drastically is a great consolation to the patients. Budget this time too has decreased the prices of essential goods for the greater satisfaction of the housewives.
An Opposition is to oppose and it is a daily occurrence even if a good thing is done for the nation by a government. Therefore, the Joint Opposition and the JVP opposing the Budget need not be taken seriously. I am a little perturbed, however, over the remarks made by the JVP members. The party comprises an educated crowd. They know that finding ways and means for revenue is an important aspect of Budget.
Yet they opposed the increase of the charges for passport matters, identity cards, licences and the like which do not come under daily or monthly expenses. If there is an opposition for these too, how else can revenue be collected If not for taxes like this, how can the insurance of schoolchildren and university students be introduced and price consolation be given to the masses
Another question surfaces. With all this reduction to food items including electricity and gas last year, will the hotels serve food and tea at a reduced rate There should be an authority to monitor the hoteliers.

Court suspends delimitation gazette
The Court of Appeal yesterday issued an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification dated February 17, 2017 on the Delimitation Committee Report, until December 4.
The Court made this order consequent to a writ petition filed by six electors who challenged the legality of the Gazette Notification issued by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister on the Delimitation Committee Report with regard to the boundaries in respect of Local Authorities.
The Court of Appeals three - judge - Bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice Shiran Gunaratne observed that in promulgating the Gazette notification, the Local Government Minister has acted ultra vires the powers vested in him under section 3D of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The Court further held that if any electoral process commenced in terms of the concerned gazette notification, irreparable damage would be caused to the peoples franchise rights.
The Court also issued notices on the respondents to appear in Court on December 4.
Several parties including United National Party (UNP), Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and PAFFREL organization have sought Courts permission to intervene into the matter as intervenient petitioners.
Six electors representing several Local Government institutions have filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal challenging the legality of a Gazette Notification bearing No.2006/44 dated February 17, 2017 ammending the boundaries, number of members and the constituents in respect of Local Authorities.
On a previous occasion, Deputy Solicitor General Arjuna Obeysekere appearing on behalf of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha raised preliminary objections against the writ petition urging the Court to dismiss it in limine.
He argued that the subject matter of this petition cannot be heard in the Court of Appeal, owing to lack of jurisdiction and stated that this matter should be referred to the Supreme Court, acting in terms of Article 125 of the Constitution.
DSG Obeysekara further said the petitioners have challenged the franchise rights of the people delaying to hold the local government election.
This petition had been filed by six electors representing the Colombo Municipal Council, Kandy Municipal Council, Panduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha, Hali-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha and the Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary, as respondents.
The petitioners stated that a National Delimitation Committee has been established with a mandate to make recommendations to the Local Government Minister for the division of local authority areas to the wards and to determine the boundaries of each ward and assign a name and number of each such ward.
The petitioners stated that if any electoral process commenced in terms of the Gazette notification which has been promulgated by the Minister ultra vires the powers vested on him in terms of Section 3D of Local Authorities Election Ordinance, irreparable loss and damage would be caused to the petitioners. The petitioners stated that several wards in the Colombo Municipal Council which were designed as multi-member wards have been re-designed as wards which only elect one member to the council.
The petitioners stated that in promulgating the Gazette Notification, the Minister of Local Government has acted ultra vires the powers vested in him under section 3D of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.

DAYASIRI CALLS FOR FORENSIC AUDIT INTO BOND ISSUE
A forensic audit of the Bond issue was recommended by Co-cabinet spokesperson Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday in order to assess the true value of the loss it has had on the economy.
I stressed on the forensic audit repeatedly during the COPE committee meetings on the bond but it is yet to be done, Jayasekara said addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing.
A forensic audit is an examination and evaluation of a firms or individuals financial information and can be conducted in order to prosecute a party for fraud. This is also admissible as evidence in a court of law.
Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the findings of the Presidential Commission did not reflect the impact the bond issue had caused on the economy, but instead shed light into phone calls and penthouses.They should have got foreign experts who specialise in bonds to investigate into it. That report would have been useful, Senaratne said.
The Bond Commission however, is set to submit its final report on its findings on December 8 and Minister Jayasekara noted that thereafter some of its findings can be directly prosecuted in a High Court or directed to the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), once necessary amendments are made.
CIABOC has no legal authority now, to prosecute cases using evidence collected from a Presidential Commission, Jaysekara said. To rectify this issue, he noted that the President had submitted a Cabinet paper on November 7, to amend the laws governing CIABOC to grant it more powers to act.
We are in the process of amending the law. Once thats done, the CIABOC can take action regarding corruption and investigate into assets of individuals. This the same issue with cases investigated by PRECIFAC, Jayasekera said. The PRECIFAC which will wrap up on December 3, has completed investigations into 17 cases of serious fraud and corruption.
As journalists drew attention to members of the eighth Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) committee in 2016 having exchanged phone calls with Arjun Aloysius, Minister Senaratne stressed that it was natural for COPE members to call Aloysius who had a direct link to their investigations.
They would have called to clarify things, the minister said. Jaysekara however explained that he had only had two calls during the eighth COPE sessions with Aloysius and that he had met him once.
I informed him that I could not help him as he appears guilty in the case, he said.
He added that he did not feel a need to inform COPE of the meeting or place it on record.
What is important is that I did not favour Aloysius within COPE. I did not, nor did I ever intend to protect him from the investigations, Jayasekara said.

## Title: Diagnosis and management of thalassaemia
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, November 23, 2017 - 01:00
Diagnosis and management of thalassaemia
The term thalassaemia is derived from the Greek word 'thalassa', which means "the sea" referring to the Mediterranean, and 'emia', meaning related to blood. thalassaemias collectively known as haemoglobinopathies is a group of inherited blood disorders passed down through families characterized by anomalies in the synthesis of globin chains of haemoglobin resulting in variable phenotypes ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe anemia.
thalassaemia was first recognized by Thomas Cooley and Pearl Lee in 1925 as a form of severe anemia associated with splenomegaly and changes in bones among children.
Ragama Medical Facility, Prof. Anuja Premawardhana said that thalassaemia is one of the major health problems, which links to immense emotional, psychological and economic burden on millions of people around the world. Recent data indicates that around 5-7 per cent of the world's population is affected by this inherited disorder and approximately 70,000 children are born each year with the severe homozygous states; a severe form of thalassaemia.
He further said thalassaemias are autosomal recessive haemoglobinopathies characterized by defects in the production of globin polypeptide chains in the adult haemoglobin.
This inherited disorder is one of the commonest encountered monogenic diseases documented. Different types of thalassaemias have been identified to date. Out of these, two major types of thalassaemias, alpha and beta, which have been named according to the defects in their protein chains are commonly encountered.
There are two main types of beta thalassaemias; thalassaemia major and thalassaemia minor. When defective genes are inherited from one of the parents, it is named as thalassaemia minor (heterozygous). If defective genes are inherited from both parents, the disease is called thalassaemia major (homozygous), and affected individuals fail to maintain the required levels of haemoglobin.
Infections transmitted via frequent blood transfusions are well documented among thalassaemic patients. However, modernizations in blood transfusion methodologies and meticulous donor screening programmes have minimized the transfusion related infections to a great extent. Life-threatening non-transfusion related infections have been documented in beta thalassaemic patients in comparison to that of the healthy population. Infections rank the second most common cause of mortality and morbidity in beta thalassaemia major patients to date.
Many alterations in the body's immune system in beta thalassaemia major patients have been documented. Arguably, in the lack of evidence-based data on a direct relationship between defects in the immune system and the predisposition to severe infections in beta thalassaemia major patients, it is always a challenge for clinicians to arrive at an early definitive diagnosis and prevent further complications.
In the past, beta thalassaemia used to be a pediatric disease. Thanks to the implementation of upgraded management strategies for beta thalassaemic patients, the median age of this cohort of patients has been improved immensely. Improved life expectancy has not only been seen in European and Mediterranean countries, but such changes have been reported in most Asian countries as well. This is largely due to better management approaches, particularly wide usage of iron chelating therapy, genetic counseling, awareness, population screening, and the availability of prenatal diagnosis, most beta thalassaemic patients celebrate their 45-50th birthdays. Recent developments and the discovery of advanced treatment approaches, beta thalassaemia patients are seeing a better hope for future; notably through bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy.
After the successful elimination of the leading causes of deaths of beta thalassaemic patients over the last decade, patients have now confronted with a new fatal challenge; infections. For the last decade, other than the common microbial agents, uncommon infectious agents have also been identified in beta thalassaemic patients. It is estimated that infections are the second highest cause of death among beta thalassaemic patients. An improved life span of these patients by 2-3 decades has made this cohort of the patient further vulnerable to infections.
Since the identification of beta thalassaemia major, the medical and scientific communities have acquired a plethora of information on this autosomal recessive haemoglobinopathy over the next eight decades. It was initially thought that the disease was confined to the Mediterranean region. However, subsequent studies indicated that beta thalassaemia has been detected outside the Mediterranean basin particularly in tropical countries where malaria is endemic. But, due to mass population migrations and intermarriage between different ethnic groups, thalassaemia has been introduced to almost every country. As a result, beta thalassaemia is reported and documented in all parts of the world.
Ragama Medical faculty, Dr. Sachith Mettananda said in the 1950s anemia was the leading cause of death of beta thalassaemia major patients. However, the pendulum shifted and iron overload topped the list the causes of death over the next four decades, until the mid 1990s. The introductions of iron chelating agents revolutionised the management of beta thalassaemia and have successfully eliminated the risk of iron overload.
Recommendations of packed red cells have further reduced deaths that resulted in cardiac failure to considerable levels. Once the leading causes of death among beta thalassaemic major patients have been eliminated over the last decade, these patients are now confronted with a new fatal challenge; life threatening infections. For the last decade other than common microbial agents, an uncommon presentation of common infectious diseases, and more importantly novel infectious agents that have never been identified in beta thalassaemic patients were detected. To date, infections are ranked as the second most common cause of mortality and morbidity in beta thalassaemia major patients.
These developments have proved to be an intense challenge for clinicians arriving at an early and definitive diagnosis, and the prevention of complications following infectious, and has forced specialised clinicians to revise the management guidelines for thalassaemic major patients, giving more weight to the clinical management aspects on infections.
A number of anatomical and unique physiological defects have been identified among beta thalassaemic major patients, which unduly predispose this cohort of patients for infections. It was coined that beta thalassaemic major patients were immunocompromised. It is true that number of pathological changes have been detected among beta thalassaemic major patients, which predispose them for infections.
Update documented data reveal that all beta thalassaemic major patients are born without "recognisable" defects in the immune system. A number of predisposed factors that possibly predispose beta thalassaemics for life threatening infections have been identified; severe anemia, iron overload and splenectomy.
Advancement in molecular medicine has revolutionised the laboratory diagnostic approaches in the field infectious diseases. Different molecular diagnosis platforms such as PCR, gene sequence, MALDI-TOF, VITEK 2, array techniques and gene probes have allowed microbiologist to arrive at a definitive identification of infectious agents with high accuracy when compared to the past where most of the identifications were based either on phenotypical or biochaemical characters of the microorganisms, which had a number of limitations.
These technological advances have not only allowed biomedical scientists to detect the infectious agents promptly and more accurately Beta thalassaemic patients are at a greater risk of contracting non-transfusion dependent infections when compared to healthy individuals.
It is clear that splenectomy, iron overload and suppression of the immune system have predisposed beta thalassaemic major patients to non-transfusion dependent infections.
Apart from these multifactorial causes, it is believed that an improved life expectancy has predisposed them to life threatening infection. However, documented case reports suggest that other unidentified pathological changes might lead them to be susceptible to life-threatening infections.
This underscored importance of systematic approach to interdisciplinary research, increases usage of vaccines and the rational usage of antibiotics to combat life threatening infections which are essential to reduce mortality and morbidity of beta thalassaemic major patents, while implementation of genetic counseling, awareness, population screening, discouragement of consanguinity, and the availability of prenatal diagnosis reduces the number of beta thalassaemic major births.

Emirates uses 3D printing for aircraft parts
Emirates has used cutting-edge 3D printing technology to manufacture components for its aircraft cabins. The airline has reached a significant milestone in innovation by using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), a new and innovative 3D printing technique to produce video monitor shrouds. One of the other recent achievements has been the 3D printing, certification and installation of aircraft cabin air vent grills for onboard trials.
Emirates has worked with 3D Systems, a US based 3D printing equipment and material manufacturer and services provider, and with UUDS, a European aviation Engineering and Certification Office and Services Provider based in France, to successfully print the first batch of 3D printed video monitor shrouds using 3D Systems Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technology platform.
This technology uses lasers to bind together powdered plastic into the required shape defined by a 3D model and is different from the Fusion Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique normally used for printing aircraft 3D parts. The material used to print Emirates Video Monitor Shrouds is a new thermoplastic developed by 3D Systems - Duraform ProX FR1200 - with excellent flammability resistance properties and surface quality suitable for commercial aerospace business applications.
One of the major advantages of using the SLS technique is the reduced weight of printed components combined with optimisation of the strength of the parts produced. Video monitor shrouds that are 3D printed using the SLS technique can weigh between 9 and 13% lighter than components manufactured traditionally or through the FDM technique. This has the potential to lead to significant reductions in fuel emissions and costs when consolidated over the entire fleet of Emirates aircraft.
Emirates 3D printed video monitor shrouds have undergone a range of structural, durability, flammability and chemical tests and are also in the process of receiving EASA certification for airworthiness for aircraft interior cabin parts. On receiving EASA certification the video monitor shrouds will be installed on select aircraft in the Emirates fleet and will be tracked over the following months for data collection as part of tests for on board durability and wear and tear.

Exporters Association of Sri Lanka welcomes Budget 2018
Speaking on behalf of the Exporters Association of Sri Lanka (EASL), Harin de Silva (Chairman EASL) welcomesthe 2018 Budget under Vision 2025 and its proposals to revamp Sri Lankas trade policies to enable an export-driven economy.
Apart from being more realistic, the proposals are expected to achieve a 5% growth rate while maintaining inflation at 6% and reducing the budget deficit to 4.5% of GDP.
The new strategic brand of Enterprise Sri Lanka looks at doubling exports to US$20 billion by 2020 and improve Sri Lankas rating to the 70th position in the global Ease of Doing Business ranking.
The active promotion of the hub concept along with further liberalization and de-regulation will go a long way in assisting Sri Lanka enable Sri Lankas competitiveness in the global market through its value added re-exports.
The governments endorsement of the National Export Strategy (NES) which is based on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiative in an effort to steer Sri Lanka away from a middle-income trap is an encouragement to the export sector.
The proposal for an effective monitoring of the budget proposals in line with the Prime Ministers economic policy statement - Vision 2025 - is very welcomed.
Focus on development and growth of SMEs, together with facilitation of an Exim fund focus is critical for Sri Lanka to achieve the projected growth set out in this budget.
The EASL has continuously campaigned for these measures to be adopted at many forums.
Further it has articulated these points in its strategic recommendations to the government in the form of (NEDEVS) highlighting the following points: 1)
The limited basket of products which Sri Lanka has developed to match internationally accepted standards; 2) The lack of appropriate incentives being offered, especially for SMEs; 3) The disconnect between industry and educational institutions hampering innovation; 4) Inability to attract FDI which brings in not only valuable funds, but technology and access to markets; 5) Suboptimal use of FTAs currently in place between Sri Lanka and foreign states; 6) Frequent increases in the cost of production such as the cost of power, imposition of statutory charge accompanied by a wage structure that does not encourage the rewarding of employees on the basis of productivity which in turn affects competitiveness; 7) Inconsistent policy and the lack of a political will to develop the export sector of Sri Lanka; 8) A lack of clear political objective and duplication of ministerial functions; and 9) External global factors which have a direct impact on Sri Lanka.
The EASL welcomes the acceptance and inclusion of these points by the government in this years budget.

Ford, Mahindra open to teaming up on EVs in India
Ford Motor Co. and its Indian partner Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. could create their own electric car line in India to help battle pollution from the vehicles clogging the nation's roads, Chairman Anand Mahindra said.
Mahindra & Mahindra, which already sells the e2o micro electric car, would be open to creating a new electric vehicle line in India with Ford, Mahindra said following the opening of a factory in suburban Detroit to produce an off-road vehicle for the U.S. market. Ford said earlier this month it will create a new electric car line in China with its partner there, Anhui Zotye Automobile Co.
India could be the other location for doing that, Mahindra said Monday when asked if Ford's plan to create an EV lineup with its Chinese partner could be replicated in India. In India, it may just happen because of a crisis of congestion and pollution, which is why the government there said we want every car to be electric by 2030, which is outrageously ambitious.
Ford and Mahindra rekindled a partnership in September to work together on electric cars, connected vehicles and distribution in India, where the U.S. automaker struggles to make money. India is set to become the world's third-largest auto market and both companies have strengths in light trucks. As part of a three-year alliance, the two automakers are looking for ways to cut costs and boost profits by jointly purchasing parts and developing new models

Foreign investment in stock market hits all-time high in 2017
In what continues to be a promising year for foreign investor involvement in the stock market, 2017 has recorded an all-time high in foreign purchases during a year, with Rs. 105.1 billion (year-to-date) in foreign purchases this year passing the record of Rs. 104.7 billion set in 2014.
The development follows signs of renewed foreign interest in the stock market in mid-2017, during which foreign purchases recorded for the first half of 2016 doubled in 2017 and recorded an all-time high for foreign purchases in the first half of a calendar year.
Such foreign purchases have contributed to a net foreign purchase figure of Rs. 18.9 billion year-to-date, a figure that is substantial compared to foreign activity in 2015/16. Growing foreign interest in the market has also contributed to a 30% improvement in the Daily Average Turnover, where the figure has improved to Rs. 955 million (year-to-date) from Rs. 737 million in 2016.
The record continues to indicate that foreign investors have been quick to identify buying opportunities in Sri Lankan stocks. An attractive market valuation (P/E), encouraging performance among listed entities, dividend payments, and capital gains tax exemptions offered to share transactions are considered to be defining factors in attracting the level of foreign investor interest the market has witnessed in 2017.
Commenting on the development, Head of Market Development at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Niroshan Wijesundere stated that improving levels of foreign investor involvement has provided the CSE an opportunity to create awareness on the stock market across all investor segments.
He went on to add that in the midst of a number of positives so far this year, the market continues to trade at a discount compared to regional peers and offers further opportunities for investors - with a market P/E recorded at 10.72 as of today and a majority of listed companies trading below book value.
The macroeconomic outlook continuing to improve will also offer both foreign and local investors further confidence in the Sri Lankan stock market, Wijesundere added.
The CSE in association with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) resumed a concentrated effort to create awareness on the opportunities in the capital market in key foreign markets this year, through Invest Sri Lanka Forums in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and most recently in New York.
Foreign institutional investors and Sri Lankans living abroad present at these events indicated a sense of optimism on the investment opportunities surrounding progressive economic reforms presently being implemented in the country.
In a related development, foreign purchases in the stock market originating from Australia in a particular year recorded an all-time high in 2017, with a figure of Rs. 651 million by the week that ended November 17.
A strong community of individuals with a Sri Lankan origin eager to look at new Sri Lankan investment opportunities and the celebration of 70 years of diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Australia presented the CSE with a unique opportunity to promote the capital market in Australia this year.

This was disclosed at a press briefing by Ali Jawa, President of the Pakistan Endocrine Society.
He said that the endocrine experts from SAARC region would try to formulate a joint strategy to cope with the malfunction of endocrine glands as the region has similar culture and eating habits besides similar physical appearance.
He said the highlight of the conference would be the unveiling of the largest research study on prevalence of diabetes ever conducted in Pakistan on Saturday.
The study has been done by collecting data of more than 19,000 subjects from across the country, interior Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Fata.
He said the study was done by the Pakistan Endocrine Society in collaboration with the Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Hyatabad Medical Complex Peshawar, University of Manchester, University of Glasgow and Khyber Medical College University.
On the concluding day, he added, diabetes and pregnancy guidelines will be launched for guiding the doctors.
The guidelines have jointly been developed by the endocrine societies from all South Asian countries.
Dr Jawa said another feature of the conference is that an international diabetes excellence academy conference is being organised in collaboration with Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.
A postgraduate diabetes certification course will also be organised. It will be attended by more than 70 medical consultants from across the country. The course will be followed by pre-summit training workshops for doctors in osteoporosis, medical nutritional therapy (Carbs Counting/DAFNE), women health panacea, research methodology and medical writing, and value of wellbeing and goal setting in a doctors life.
The Pakistan Endocrine Society (PES) president said the PES is a non-profit organisation and has actively been involved in promoting educational and research activities in endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism by giving research and travel grants to young fellows to pursue their career in endocrinology since its formation in 2001.
PES, he added, is the only body of medical professionals in the country that has 495 members with specialised training in adult and paediatric endocrinology.
President, SAFES, Dr S Abbas Raza said: Our vision for SAFES is to keep our focus and support on region-specific issues to help elevate the care standards to the level of developed world. There is a dire need to accelerate the pace of our work because of rising prevalence, complexity and severity of diabetes and metabolic disorders.

The Police have thus far arrested 22 persons in relation to the clashes which occurred in Gintota last week.
They have been remanded until November 30 and all bail applications have to be directed through a High Court,
Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The Police Media Spokesperson addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing yesterday said that there were 127 incidents which had occurred in Gintota which were being separately investigated.
Answering questions with regard to a recent statement made by the IGP that the Police had failed in Gintota, SP Gunasekara said the IGP simply meant the Police hierarchy in the area, community Policing units and religious leaders in the area had not done enough to prevent the clashes from blowing up.
He also denied that there was any political involvement in the incidents and said it was led by a small group of extremists. This happened on November 16th night, and then we arrested three people and produced them before courts.
On November 17, the situation was calm and we had religious leaders and community Police groups dealing with the situation but by the night of November 17,things had flared up again. It was after that,that we arrested 19 more suspects, SP Gunasekara explained.
The Police Media Spokesperson added that the CID was investigating into persons who had published false or inflammatory reports on the incident and that they would be arrested for it.

Green pitches likely in Nagpur and Delhi too
India are likely to play the final two Tests of the Sri Lanka series on pitches helpful for fast bowlers as preparation for the forthcoming South Africa tour, which starts on January 5 in Cape Town.
The second Test of the Sri Lanka series will be played from November 24 in Nagpur, and the final Test in Delhi from December 2.
It is learnt that during the Australia ODI series in September, the Indian team management, led by coach Ravi Shastri, spoke to concerned officials in the BCCI and stated that the pitches for the Sri Lanka Tests should act as preparation for the South Africa tour. It is understood that Shastri emphasised that the pitches ought to be lively greentops, which are hard and bouncy.
It is also understood that the Nagpur pitch is covered evenly with grass and is expected to retain a greenish tinge when the second Test begins on Friday. According to concerned officials, the role of the spinners is likely to be negligible in the first half of the match, and more effective during the final two days.
Such a request from the team management is unusual only because India have fashioned Test victories at home against oppositions mostly on bald, turning tracks, which assist the spinners from the first day. Incidentally, India had played a Test on a rank turner, during Shastris time as team director, in 2015 against South Africa. The match ended in three days and was rated poor by the ICC match referee.
However, under Virat Kohli, India are keen to challenge themselves overseas and with Tests lined up in South Africa, England and Australia in the next 18 months, Indias players and coaches want to be prepared.
The greentop at Eden Gardens on the first morning of the first Test was a clear indication of the team managements thought process. Although Suranga Lakmal silenced the Indian top order in the first hour on a damp pitch, India, led by their new-ball pairing of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami, nearly stunned the visitors on the final day, taking seven wickets in a little over 26 overs.
After the first days play was truncated by rain in Kolkata, Indias batting coach Sanjay Bangar pointed out that India are now a team which doesnt really want to play in easy conditions.
He said players were open to playing on such challenging pitches as it only led to improvement.
On Monday, India opener KL Rahul admitted that such surfaces were a good test for the batsmen.
Its very clear that were preparing for the next two years that were going to travel abroad and play a lot of cricket overseas, and we are going to find wickets like this, and it is going to be challenging for all of us, so we wanted to prepare in that way.

Greenlight for teen voters
Amendments to the Registration of Electors Act No 44 of 1980 have been proposed.
This will allow all citizens to get themselves registered in the Electoral Register, when they attain 18 years.
President Maithripala Sirisena who submitted the above proposal to Cabinet received the green light this week to allow more youth to enter into the voting system.
At present, the Act specifies that a citizen who completes 18 and fulfils all required criteria would be registered on June 1 of every year.
This would mean that if an election is called prior to or after this date, a citizen who turns 18 after June 1, will not be registered to vote. This technical fault has resulted in many citizens not voting at 18, but over a year later, as they turn 19 years and three months.
The Election Commission has also informed the President that it now only takes six months to finalise the register instead of the previous time period of one year and thus registrations can be done faster.
Having taken these factors into consideration, the Cabinet paper submitted by the President proposed that: Those who complete 18 years of age after the certification of the register of electors and before the commencement of the next annual revision could be included in a supplement to the register of electors already certified and to include the said supplement list as a valid part of the certified register of electors to enable them to participate in polls and a four week period be declared to provide an opportunity for any person, if he or she wished to lodge objections before certification of the supplementary register prepares as proposed under the current law, to the names of the new electors who are eligible to make claims for inclusion of their names in the supplementary register of electors during the four weeks.
An adjournment motion moved in this regard on July 4, 2007 had the House reach general consensus on the matter. The President has asked that the amendments be sent to the Legal Draftsmans and thereafter be submitted to Parliament.

The Kelani-Saviya, CSR project was launched in 2007 between the University of Peradeniya, Engineering faculty and the MoU was signed by the then Kelani Cables PLC MD Hemantha Perera and Prof SBS Abeykone of the faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. Prof. Janaka Ekanayake and Jayantha Wijesinghe, then Asst. Marketing Manager, Kelani Cables PLC, were the co-initiators of this CSR Project.
This agreement was in force upto 2012. A fresh MoU was signed in 2014 and is in operation now.
We are extremely happy with the progress made so far judging from the letters of appreciation we receive from the trainees.
We are confident that this CSR project will yield excellent results in developing young electrical technicians from the Northern Peninsula and also help in winning the hearts and minds of the people of the North. 50 electrical Technicians have passed out since the first MoU was signed in 2014, Saranapala added.
Making the welcome address Dr T Thiruvaran, Course Director, Kelani Shakthi, said they had started the collaboration with Kelani Cables in June 2014 for the period of 3 years and today they had extended it for another 3 years.
He said 24 students from the first batch and 23 from the second batch have successfully completed their studies and the second batch will be presented with their certificates. Dr Thiruvaran said the demand for this course is always on the rise and the idea of the course is to enhance the knowledge of electrical technicians in Sri Lanka by teaching the technical background of the electrical wiring to them.
Dean Faculty of Engineering University of Jaffna Prof A Atputharajah said, the MoU signed was the very first by the faculty with the industry and they were pleased to extend the MoU with a internationally recognized company like Kelani Cables which recently recived the World Class Award (Highest) in the large manufacturing category at the Global Performance Excellence Awards 2017 held in Manila.
Prof Atputharajah said his relationship with Kelani Cables runs way back to 2007 when the Kelani Saviya was launched at the Peradeniya University in Sinhala medium. He said since he took over as the dean of Engineering University of Jaffna, CEO Kelani Cables Saranapala and Course Coordinator Jayantha Wijesinghe had continuosly requested him to start a similar course in Tamil medium.
This resulted in the launch of Kelani Shakthi in 2014, he said. Prof Atputharajah said the program would have not been a reality if not for the tireless perseverance and support of CEO Kelani Cables Saranapala in bringing Kelani Shakthi to Jaffna.
Prof Ratnam Vigneswaran, Vice Chancellor, University of Jaffna and Ralph Roshan,Sales Controller also addressed the gatering

The Kiralakele area off the Nilwala river in the Matara district will be developed as a tourist attraction.
According to members of the Nilwala Valley Farmers Organizations, this region has an extent of over 300 hectares. It has already been gazetted as a natural sanctuary by the government. The Ceylon Tourist Board has taken over project activities and the World Tourist Day has also been celebrated there on a grand scale.
Proposed development activities in the region include construction of agricultural dams in swampy and marshy lands, cultivation of various species of plants so as to improve and maintain mangroves already existing there; erection of a crocodile park, a holiday resort with spacious rest rooms for local and foreign tourists, and a hotel with indigenous food varieties such as organic vegetables and buffalo curd, cadjan thatched huts with stalls; putting up aquariums of inland fish with sale centres and ancient houses with agricultural and cultural identities, and employment generating projects as well. The main aim of all these endeavours would be to attract more tourists to the region and collect a better income for countrys coffers, project officials further added.

left fuming by Dickwellas antics
Virat Kohli and Team India were on a mission in the final session of the opening Test against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens on Monday. However, the visitors pulled out all the stops to try and derail Indias charge.
One such instance occurred when Niroshan Dickwella took the cue from some footballers and tried the dark art of time-wasting.
Kohli and pacer Mohammed Shami were having none of it and blasted Dickwella for his time-wasting antics.
Kohli was visibly furious and was seen angrily gesticulating at the umpires.
Nigel Llong finally got Dickwella and Kohli together, had a chat with the two and calmed things down before the situation could boil over. Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene took to Twitter to laud Dickwellas antics had words of praise for the Indian skipper as well and a certain Virat Kohli even replied to it.
Mahela [emailprotected]
Enjoyed @NiroshanDikka attitude and antics this afternoon. Good test match.. well played @imVkohli. Looking forward to the next one.

Virat Kohli @imVkohli
Replying to @MahelaJay @NiroshanDikka
Yes, test cricket at its best. Onto the next one now.
Kohli smashed a scintillating century, his 18th in Tests and 50th overall in international cricket, as India set Sri Lanka a 231-run target to win.
The visitors were left reeling as Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami took centre stage and destroyed the Sri Lankan batting order.
Sri Lanka were 62 for four when Dickwella took his time-wasting tactics too far and left Kohli fuming.
Sri Lanka only had a bit more than two hours to negotiate and they almost faltered. They huffed and puffed and somehow survived.
In the end, Sri Lanka were reduced to 75 for seven when bad light came to their rescue.

Commenting on the performance of the Group, Kapila Jayawardena, LOLC Group Managing Director/CEO stated, The Groups fine and consistent performance for the last six months is driven by the financial services companies, led by the four companies in Sri Lanka and our investments in Cambodia and Myanmar. All financial services companies are doing well with strong assets growth and steady profitability. Regional expansion to Myanmar and Cambodia has derived excellent results, with PRASAC and LOLC Cambodia contributing well to the bottom line.
The corresponding PAT increased by a robust 73% to end the quarter at Rs. 8.8 billion. The Groups total assets reached Rs. 748 billion, with an advances portfolio of Rs. 488 billion.
The Group balance sheet is further strengthened by investment securities held by the financial services sector companies of Rs. 86 billion mainly represented by government securities and bank deposits.
The lending portfolios of each company recorded steady growth, with LOFC portfolio reaching Rs. 94 billion, CLC portfolio reaching Rs.58 billion, LOMCs portfolio reaching Rs. 55 billion and BRAC portfolio reaching Rs. 12 billion over the last 12 months.

PRASAC Micro Finance Institution in Cambodia became a subsidiary of the Group at the beginning of the year, which positively contributed to the bottom line. LOLCs other two investments in Cambodia and Myanmar also joins in reporting strong financial performance.
The regional expansion of the Group is poised to deliver steady results diversifying and balancing the exposure LOLC has to the local market. The financial services sectors performance is remarkable given the external challenges faced by the industry including increasing interest rates putting pressure on net interest margins, strain on collection efforts due to rising interest rates and lower economic activity.
Other sectors in the Group delivered moderate results with the leisure sector still being in a stage of development with three of the Groups local properties being under construction. The properties in Kosgoda, Beruwala (Riverina) and the Maldives are progressing steadily in line with the project plans.
The trading sector consisting of the Browns Group and the plantation sector too recorded moderate results.
Equity accounted investees contributed lower profits compared with last year, mainly as PRASAC was moved to subsidiary category in the financials of the Group.

MAKING A CLEAN CUT
Cleanliness has become a buzzword today. Good personal hygiene is essential to promoting good health. Maintaining good personal hygiene, proper grooming and living in clean surroundings can help you ward off illnesses, feel good about yourself about life in general. Make these personal hygiene habits a part of your regular routine.
Washing your bath towels
Bath towels that are used once a day to dry off after a shower can be used up to three times before needing to be washed, assuming that you are hanging it somewhere dry so that it can air out. If there is odour coming from the towel it means that there are microbes growing. So it should be washed immediately. Wash bath towels separately from other clothing for sanitary reasons. Use detergent and vinegar to set colours using about half the recommended amount of detergent and half cup of white vinegar to wash water. The vinegar helps set colours and removes excess detergent residue.
Shower every other day or every day
Showering is all about hygiene. Since we live in tropical country and since the humidity is high, you need to shower twice a day. You can wash your hair every other day.
Using deodorants for underarms
Sweat is nearly odourless. The stench comes from bacteria that break down from one or two types of sweats on your skin. Deodorants contain some antibacterial power to stop the stink before it starts, while antiperspirants deal with sweat directly.
There can be many reasons for dark underarms like shaving and dead cells. Also, some people are just more prone to hyper-pigmentation from shaving, which can also cause the dark spots and marks to occur.
Cleaning your face
Wash your face with lukewarm water and a cream cleanser. Warm water helps lift the dirt out of your skin, but hot water can be too drying. Cream cleansers are more hydrating, but if you wear a lot of makeup, you might want to use a gel cleanser and/or a makeup remover instead. After washing, dab your face with a towel. Dont rub. It will stretch your skin and lead to wrinkles.
Cleaning your ears
Your ears usually do a good job cleaning themselves and dont need any extra care. To clean the ears, wash the external ear with a cloth, but do not insert anything into the ear canal. Clean your ears daily. Use ear swabs and clean the inner parts as well. Do not use water. Cleaning them every day will keep you away from ear infections. If it is not followed on a regular basis, you may have to deal with poor hearing problems as the dirt inside your ear will go on accumulating and hamper your hearing sense.
Sharing cosmetics
Sharingcosmetics, especially mascara, eye shadow and eyeliner, can lead to a bad eye infection. It is also bad to share lipstick as viruses can be spread.
You should never share anything that comes into direct contact with someones skin or mucus membranes. Also remember that the there are germs and bacteria growing in your make up brushes and applicators. So it is advisable not to share any make up as it can sometimes lead to the very unpleasant spreading of germs.
Get rid of feminine odour
Vaginal odour can be a signal that there might be a health issue at play. However you can control it by having, probiotics since they can help keep the gut healthy. However did you know that probiotics can do wonders for vaginal odour Probiotic yogurt, for example, is rich in lactobacillus bacteria, which helps fight candida infection, a common cause of vaginal odour. It also helps restore the normal vaginal pH level, which can remove vaginal ordour.
Tea tree contains strong antifungal properties as well as being a great antiseptic. These characteristics help get rid of bacteria that may contribute to the problem of vaginal odour and discomfort.
I cannot stress enough the importance of water and lots of it. Fresh, organic, whole fruits and vegetables are always the key to a healthy body. Wear cotton underwear.

Move to Euro IV in just over 50 days, impossible
The government in the recent budget announced the need for automobile sector compliance to Euro 4 standards at the minimum.
This is a good initiative as Sri Lanka had no standard at all so far for emission compliance automobile industry sources say.
What is Euro standard
Introduced in 2000, the Euro norms are emission control standards that are based on the European regulations (Euro norms). They set limits for release of air pollutants from equipment using internal combustion engines, including vehicles.
Typically, the higher the stage, the more stringent the norms. Is this a good thing Yes it is a good initiative to ensure that the air pollution is minimized by way of operating unfit equipment.
Euro IV standards stipulate lower levels of sulphur emissions compared with Euro III. Also, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide are lower under Euro IV.
Why is it important
While the initiative is a very good one, the method of implementation is of serious concern.
The sudden requirement of meeting a higher standard had come as a surprise to some auto companies purely due to the short time frame give for compliance. As far as we know nowhere in the world that there had been such a short time given for shifting to a higher emission standard.
Many such companies will have to start the homologation process with their principles which will take 6-8 months depending on the readiness of the manufacturer and the established manufacturers will not offer higher Euro compliant products without following the laid down procedure.
Besides this the cost of a high Euro standard vehicle will be much higher than the cost of a lower standard vehicle and the extra cost will have to be transferred to the ultimate customer at the point of sale or service.
Who Cares
Swanky vehicles are nice, but nicer and more important is clean air. In many countries by law clean air is a fundamental right. You can look forward to breathing in cleaner air as new vehicles will in the future have to be equipped with engines compliant with Euro IV or better standards. Upgraded emission norms could also mean higher fuel efficiency. However, the Euro IV compatible fuel will have to be made available across the country,beforeimplementation and a grace period given for adoption.
On top of this oil companies will have to spend large sums of capital outlays to ensure availability of the Euro IV standard fuel Island wide. So, fuel bills could also rise.
The fair basis,
The main requirement is a grace period given based on the implementation plan, have a dialog with all stakeholders and have a roadmap for implementation so that it sounds to be a professional approach and no one gets affected due to the sudden decisions and the cost factors are under control for all.
A period of 1 years grace is not going to make people develop breathing difficulties and the corporates involved in the business would better appreciate.
What is needed from the current government is to facilitate businesses, and be responsible in policy making that will force the established institutions to face difficulties.

Mumps hits New Zealand again, Savea isolated
Cardiff: New Zealand back-row forward Ardie Savea has been put into isolation at the All Blacks training base after contracting mumps, it was announced Tuesday.
There is a mumps epidemic in New Zealand right now with record numbers of cases in Auckland in their worst outbreak since 1994.
But New Zealand assistant coach Ian Foster said no other member of the tour squad is currently stricken with the highly-contagious viral disease ahead of Saturdays match against Wales at Cardiffs Principality Stadium.
Ardie has got a mild dose of the mumps, Foster told reporters in Cardiff on Tuesday. He is the only one. He is in his room and has been in isolation.
He was fully vaccinated as a kid, but he clearly has something. He has been in isolation for a few days and is recovering pretty quickly.
Foster said team medical officials believe Savea had caught mumps from New Zealand wing Rieko Ioane, who received treatment for the virus earlier on tour.
We are not worried about it (spreading), he added. We have taken every precaution, but Ardie must have been in pretty close proximity to Rieko at some point.
It has caught us on the hop a bit because it is not something you get a lot of.
It has come out of the blue, but we are satisfied with the way the doctor reacted really quickly with Rieko, and Ardie was susceptible even though he had done everything right in the past. It is something we are taking seriously.
Meanwhile Foster said All Blacks captain Kieran Read had been spared training on Tuesday following some gruelling recent Test appearances for the No 8.
Hes pretty battered after the last couple (of games), and we took him out of training today to give him an extra 24 hours, Foster explained. Hes pretty good. He gets through a lot of work, and at this stage of the year he is just a bit sore.
It was a management decision to pull him out today and give him a chance to walk around training and freshen up for later in the week.
New Zealand have arrived in the Welsh capital after being pushed hard by Scotland before coming through to win 22-17 at Murrayfield last weekend.
They have a formidable record of 29 successive wins against Wales, with their last defeat in the fixture back in 1953.
It is not a matter of pulling the whole (Scotland) game apart and trying to fix everything, but fixing the critical parts we need to sort out, Foster said.
This week we would like to start and finish a little bit better.
It will be a very physical game (against Wales), we know that. It is about the collision area when you play Wales and the physicality.

In the entertainment industry there are hundreds of productions coming each year. Many new faces enter the limelight and among those stars, there are some youth who are skillful at the job regardless of their age.
19 year old Daniella Perera landed the role of Eliza Doolittle when the Workshop Players brought Lerner and Loewes Broadway classic My Fair Lady before the Sri Lankan audience. Directed by Surein de S. Wijeratne and produced by Jerome L. de Silva, My Fair Lady ran for 10 days in which Daniella shared the lead role with Amarsha Tissera. Both girls were new entrants to the team but managed to pull off their performance with such skill and energy that they got thundering applause from the audience.

Daniella has portrayed roles in two musical productions before. Her first performance had been while she was schooling at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya. She had taken on the lead role in Youve Got it Pussy Cat, an adaptation of Puss in Boots, directed by Jith Peiris in 2014. She also played Alice in Ruvin de Silvas Alice in Wonderland presented by the Wendy Whatmore Academy in 2015.
I have always been into the dramatic side from my tender years. I started my stint with drama at the Wendy Whatmore Academy when I was about three and a half years and since then I have not turned back. I knew acting was in my blood and that is what I want in life. Music runs in my family. My father, Shobi Perera, is a musician. My mother, Dreen Perera, is a teacher at Wendy Whatmore Academy and has a lot of relatives who are engaged in music. My sister, Shenelle, too has a flair for singing though she did not really get into it, Daniella said.
She notes that she had always wanted to portray Eliza Doolittles character.
I do musical theater and have done bits and pieces of My Fair Lady. However I was a bit reluctant to take on the role at first because my G C E Advanced Level examination was approaching. It would be a challenge to handle both but my mother had faith in my abilities. She encouraged me to go for it, she enthused.
Denaiella has still been in two minds when she had gone for the audition but after auditioning for the role she knew that she wanted to be part of the musical no matter which role will be offered to her. Winning Elizas role was like the icing on the cake as she had been ecstatic to be a part of the play.
I was playing cards with my cousins when Suren called to tell me that I got the part. I just froze when I heard the news. I didnt think I would land the role because I thought that they would believe that I had commitment issues, she explained.
Recalling the period in which My Fair Lady was staged at the Lionel Wendt Daniella described the experience as nerve wrecking. However she was quick to add that though it was tiring, the whole experience has been magical and fun.
Compared to some of the other actors, I actually had a more easy time because I was just out of school. Therefore I could relax and go for the rehearsals when the others were juggling professional duties and other work with the rehearsals, she said.
Daniella says that rather than following Julie Andrews play she has mostly taken her cue from Audrey Hepburn in the movie. Her favourite episode in the production was the Ascot scene because this marked the bridge between the phrase when Eliza was a Cockney flower girl and a lady. It is also the most hilarious scene which Eliza is involved in.

And I also love the dress! she exclaimed with a smile.
She says that the most challenging thing about her role was to portray the transition from a lowly flower girl into something close to a lady.
It was a bit tough to show that development. You need to put a lot of effort into the vocal performance too in a musical. Keeping the energy going was demanding as well, she added. She says that the best part of the project was acting alongside Jerome.
He was simply a big name to us before we took part in the production but once you are in a production with him you realize that there is so much to learn from him. He added little bits to the play which made such a difference to it while he was portraying his role. This also helped the other actors to bring their characters out better."
She says that the main thing she learnt from My Fair Lady is about sharing a role.
That was a new experience for me. Amarsha and I worked really well together. It was not about who plays the better Eliza but making the production better. We would learn something from each other as we worked as a team. You also learn what goes on behind the scenes. The crew had a mammoth task in taking the production forward. They pulled everything off with winning colours, she said adding that they had a responsibility to match up to the veterans they were working with.
It was a big risk that Suren took in giving the lead role to two newcomers. However the feedback was overwhelming as the audience thought that the characters were well executed. It brought about a lot of fond memories to people who had watched the iconic movie, she mused.
She says that besides Elizas role she loves Alfred Dolittles character because he maintains his unrefined Cockney mannerism throughout the play. She notes that the director has given them ample space to build their characters rather than tell them how to play the role. She has learnt that little things matter in building up a character from Jerome. Queried on what kind of musical she would like to take on next and prompt comes the reply.
Chicago! I dont mind portraying either Velma Kelly or Roxie Hart. I would like to do Nala or the cheetahs role in The Lion King too, she added with a twinkle in her eyes.
