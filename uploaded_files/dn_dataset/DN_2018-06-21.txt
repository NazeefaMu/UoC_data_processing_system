Dumbo  takes flight  again
Youve read the books, watched the shows and now, its finally time to watch the live-action reboot on the adorable flying baby elephant, Dumbo.
Over seven decades after the original animated Disney film hit theatres in 1941, comes this all-new re-imagined version by Tim Burton, with the baby elephant with big blue eyes right at the centre of it. The film that is slated for a 2019 release, expands on the beloved classic story where differences are celebrated, family is cherished and dreams take flight.
Set in a circus, the story will follow the lives of a former performer (Colin Farrell) and his children, who are kept in charge for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock. However, things take a turn at the struggling circus when they discover that Dumbo can fly. The teaser gives us glimpses of a little of everything, from Dumbos big ears, to a heartbreaking scene of his mother being locked up, spectacular overview shots of the circus and even the elephant taking flight.
While keeping in tune with the values of the story, reports suggest that beneath the glittery facade, the film will also explore a darker side, in true Tim Burton style.
Dumbo stars Colin Farrell, Eva Green, Danny DeVito, Michael Keaton and child stars Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins.

## Title: Inland Revenue Act creates transparent tax regime

Inland Revenue Act creates transparent tax regime
Over the years, a lack of economic stability has been a major hindrance to doing business in Sri Lanka. As a result, economic growth in the post war years has been dominated by debt financed state investments. Such a model is unsustainable.
These sentiments were expressed by the Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera addressing the Ceylon Chamber organized Investor Conclave at Cinnamon Grand recently. With a growing debt stock the government finds it difficult to balance public investment and debt servicing. It is in this context that our government has shifted to a private sector, export, and FDI, led model of economic growth.
The state will play a key role in smart regulation, setting a robust institutional framework, and targeted interventions to ensure social justice and equity. The government was able to introduce several key reforms towards ensuring long term economic stabilization and in 2017 Sri Lanka achieved a primary budget surplus for the first time in many decades.
The Inland Revenue Act that came into force last April creates a transparent and predictable tax regime, shifting away from adhoc tax changes that hinder investment. Our objective is to establish a level playing field which will encourage competition and contestation which would be of benefit to consumers and a competitive economy.
In addition to the fiscal policy reforms, the Central Bank has been successful in bringing down inflation to 1.6% in April 2018, reserves reached a record high of US$ 9.5 billion, and credit growth has been managed to a sustainable level.
All of these developments have set the stage for a take-off in economic activity and growth.
A crucial element of the investment decision is ensuring a competitive business climate and several other steps are being addressed relating to ease of access to and registration of land, construction permits, and other elements relevant to the business climate.
Investment related incentives have also been reformed with open ended tax holidays being replaced by targeted capital allowances which directly reward the investment in capital. There are also benefits for investment in R&D and the IT sector, and for investments in the Northern Province. Sri Lanka is in the process of implementing comprehensive unilateral trade liberalization. The government has been working on bringing in key reforms during last two years.
It is clear that macro economic conditions have stabilized setting the stage for investment and economic growth.
Meanwhile Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade addressing the event said that global investors remain positive about Sri Lanka and at the recent sovereign dollar bond issue of US$ 2.5 billion it was nearly three times over-subscribed.
Our government is much focused on improving the investor climate and easing the burden for investors who are interested in locating here and have taken several meaningful steps in this regard, the Minister said.
The new Inland Revenue Act which came into effect from April this year was developed with technical advice from the IMF, is a modern, transparent and streamlined Act that is based on international income tax principles.
The top rate of corporate income tax is now lower than Bangladesh, India, Brazil, Mexico, and on par with South Africa. The top rate of personal income tax is now lower than all of these countries plus Thailand, Vietnam, and Turkey.
There is a popular misconception that the new Act has removed tax incentives. This is incorrect. Under the Act, an investor would receive capital allowances and accelerated depreciation based on the size of the investment, and you can set off your investment against future taxation. In effect, you dont have to start paying income tax until you recover your investment.
For every capital investment, there is an additional 100% capital allowance and for investments above US$ 100 million the capital allowance goes up to 150%.
Sri Lankas new incentives regime may not be blanket tax holidays, but it is effectively the same when it comes to your tax burden.
And even after that, if you are in an export-oriented industry you will only pay corporate income tax at the low rate of 14%. This targeted tax relief is attractive for genuine investors who believe in investing in the future of Sri Lanka.
We are also looking at further reducing the upfront costs of investment by cutting the various border taxes that you face. We are also looking at making the taxable period start only after commercial operations have commenced.
We are focusing on opening up our economy, learning from the lessons of Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and others in the region.

Lanka offers Asias lowest airfares
SriLankan Airlines is facing high competition and the best way to bail out the airline and make it viable is to call for a SAARC regional open sky policy, said SriLankan Airlines, CEO, Suren Ratwatte.
Speaking at the Logistics Leaders Evening 2018 at Kingsbury on Tuesday he said that today any airline can come to Colombo and they can also offer better fares than SriLankan as their pockets are too deep and they can afford to do so.
Today you can see several major airlines operating around three to four flights a day to Colombo exploiting Sri Lankas open sky policy. The national carrier also flies to these destinations but we are unable to compete with these low fares.
He explained that it was this factor that resulted in the airlines Chennai flight which was among their top five destinations falling to bottom five destinations. He also said due to tough completion the airline was also forced to reduce their seven European destinations to one.
The best way out of this is to have an open sky policy where SriLankan too would be allowed to fly some of the domestic routes in India and other regional countries as well.
In a somewhat surprise discourse he said that SriLankan offers the lowest airfares in Asia and is even cheaper than Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Malaysia and this too attributes to the bottom line of the national airline.
He also said that in addition the high fuel costs and other overheads too make the SriLankan turnaround initiative an uphill task. Fuel costs have gone up by 30% over the last four years but air fares have not gone up mainly due to the tough competition. Regional low cost airlines like Air Arabia, Fly Dubai Air Asia and even IndiGo in India (currently all of them have over 140 aircraft) are on a huge airline buying spree and have ordered over 200 aircraft for the next few years and competing with them with the current SriLankan fleet of around 20 aircraft was difficult.
The global aviation industry is monopolized by two manufactures, Boeing and Air Bus, five engine makers and five leasing companies and for a small player like SriLankan
have to dance to their terms.
Airlines make money only when plans are airborne but for SriLankan this is not possible as the Colombo Airport capacity is an issue and we are unable to turn around a flight in less than one hour.
However he said that the Asia Pacific region is among the highest growth regions for aviation and SriLankan can exploit this with new synergies.

Mattala airport built sans study
The Mattala international airport was built without a proper study of the future aviation requirements, said Executive Director, Airport Aviation, Johanne Jayaratne. He said that the Mattala 3.5 km airstrip which was opened in 2013 was designed to accommodate modern A380 aircraft. However today A380 is going out of style and this business is no longer a viable option.
He also said that though new airports are opened all of them do not succeed. Jayaratne who was with the AASl for nearly two decades said that when governments change managements too change and this is not good. Sri Lanka now urgently needs a clear aviation policy and also a master plan to develop the industry.

Always In A Hurry..!
Mr Smith never rested in peace As he was always in a hurry He bumped his car into a truck Mr Smith they had to bury!
Not a single day goes by without me hearing about some friend, relative or acquaintance having a heart attack, stroke, or some such stress related problem. For them and others on their way to the hospital do I write today:
A story goes that St John was stroking a tame partridge, when a famous hunter visited him. The hunter was carrying his bow and arrows with him. What are you doing he turned to the saint and said. Dont you have a lot of work to do with the people of this world, preaching to them and changing their lives Why do you waste your time with this bird
What is that you carry in your hand asked St John.
A bow, said the hunter.
Do you asked the saint, carry it always and everywhere bent, taut and at full stretch
No indeed, said the hunter, If I kept it at full stretch all the time, it would soon lose its elasticity; and the arrows would fly neither true nor straight nor fast.
The same with the human mind, said St John. Unless there are times when it is relaxed, a mind cannot follow its search for truth. The bow that is always bent will soon cease to shoot straight, and the mind which is always at full stretch will soon cease to be efficient.
The following Prayer for A Person in A Hurry is said to be popular among Glasgow businessmen:
Slow me down Lord! Ease the pounding of my heart
By the quietening of my mind. Steady my hurried pace with a vision
Of the eternal reach of time.
Teach me the art of taking one minute vacations;
To look at a flower, To chat with a friend, To pat a dog.
To read a few lines from a good book.
Remind me each day of the fable of the hare and the tortoise
That I may learn the race is not always to the swift
That there is more to life than increasing my speed
Let me look upward to the branches of the towering oak. And recall that it grew great and strong By growing slowly and well!
In my old car was a knob I pulled which increased the flow of petrol to the engine. I pulled it when there was a problem and the extra petrol, gave more power to the engine and pulled me through a crisis. But as soon as the problem was sorted out, I pushed the knob back, otherwise the car would either overheat or the engine jam with the additional load, for too long a time.
Does your stress knob need to be pushed back, your bow relaxed Slow down and grow slowly, strong, and well like the towering oak..!

Ashes to kick off new World  Test Championship
New Delhi, Wednesday: The Ashes between arch rivals England and Australia will kick off the mammoth new World Test Championship in July next year, according to a world governing body schedule released Wednesday.
The nine top-ranked sides in the world will compete in the new touranment, with each side playing six series on a home-and-away basis against mutually selected opponents in a two-year cycle.
The five-Test ashes will kick off the first championship in July next year, with the top two teams to square off in a June 2021 final.
Other Test series in the programme include the West Indies' three-Test tour of India and New Zealand hosting Sri Lanka, both in July, while the last league game will be in April 2021 with the West Indies visiting Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile Pakistan, who start their Test championship journey in October next year in Sri Lanka, have not been given a series against India amid growing political tensions between the two countries.
South Africa will kickstart their campaign in India in October 2019.
The ICC gave its nod to the Test championship last year as part of measures to boost the flagging fortunes of the traditional five-day format beloved of purists but with often lacklustre spectator and television viewer numbers.
ICC chief executive David Richardson called it a "genuine solution that gives fans around the world the chance to engage regularly with international cricket that has meaning and the possibility of a global title at the end".
The new Future Tours Programme (FTP) released by the ICC features all series and tournaments of Test, ODI and Twenty20 cricket for the 2019-2023 period.
New Test entrants Ireland and Afghanistan will play against each other in February next year and go onto play 12 five-day games each between 2019 and 2022.
Afghanistan have matches scheduled at their home base India and away against Australia, while Ireland will host New Zealand and travel to England.
The 12 Test playing nations and the Netherlands will also participate in a 13-team one-day international League that will act as a qualification pathway for the 50-over 2023 World Cup.
Hosts India along with the seven highest-ranked sides in the ODI league at the end of March 2022 will directly qualify, while the bottom five sides will get a second chance to enter through qualifiers. AFP

The structure of the men's FTP (2018-23) includes:
ICC Cricket World Cup  2019 and 2023
ICC World T20  2020 and 2021

Australian golfing great Peter Thomson dies aged 88
SYDNEY, Wednesday: Australian golfing great Peter Thomson, who won the British Open five times, died Wednesday aged 88 after a long battle with Parkinsons disease, his family said.
He had been suffering from Parkinsons disease for more than four years and lost his brave battle at home in Melbourne surrounded by family, a statement said.
Thomson was the first Australian to win the British Open, claiming five titles between 1954 and 1965, including three consecutive wins. Only Tom Watson in the modern era has matched the feat.
In total, he won 26 times in Europe, 19 times in Australia and New Zealand and another 11 in Asia and Japan.
He played only a few seasons in the United States, winning the Texas Open in 1956. But he did tee-off regularly on the American senior circuit, winning nine times in 1985, setting a record that may never be broken.
As well as being a great player, he was an outstanding contributor to the game.
Thomson served as president of the Australian PGA for 32 years, designing and building courses in Australia and around the world.
He also helped establish the Asian Tour and wrote for newspapers and magazines for 60 years. He was patron of the Australian Golf Writers Association.
The World Golf Hall of Fame called him the thinking mans golfer.
His clean, brisk game was based on cold logic and a gift for reducing things to their simplest essentials, it said.
His style was free of the extraneous, so that the path he would take to victory seemed a remarkably straight line. He is survived by his wife Mary, a son and three daughters, 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Banking sector will have to play pivotal role
The countrys fourth industrial revolution will immensely benefit the future economy growth and the Sri Lankan banking sector will have to play a pivotal role to meet future challenges, Central Bank, Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
While highlighting the invaluable service rendered by the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL) to produce high quality and skilled bankers Governor Coomaraswamy said IBSL is creating a healthy environment to mould the technical expertise required to make the financial intermediation function efficient and effective.
The Central Bank Governor made these remarks at the 24th Convocation of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka held at BMICH. Governor Coomaraswamy highlighted that although the country faced many challenges in the agricultural sector, especially rice and coconut due to the prevailing bad weather conditions, a steady progress can be seen in this sector currently.
He also highlighted the continuous service rendered by the Central Bank (CBSL) towards all banks in the country and said it is the duty of CBSL to keep a close tab on the activities of all banks and to strengthen them .
He said the CBSL as the apex financial regulator of the country is responsible to build capacity of the financial system, enhance risk management frameworks and maintain a delicate balance between technological innovations and the consumer protection.
CBSL, Deputy Governor K.D. Ranasinghe said our banking industry was growing rapidly with innovative financial products and services that contribute highly to the economy growth.
He said currently the IBSL educational courses are gaining international recognition and even the Charted Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) UK is prepared to grant exemptions for certain subjects that are included in the new IBSL Academy Programme
Ministry of Finance and Mass Media Secretary Dr. R.H.S.Samaratunga highlighted that the contribution made by the IBSL to the economic development and improving living standards of people was immense. He said that the banking sector remains resilient in the face of numerous challenges arising from local and global developments and said all bankers have a role to play in that endeavor.
He further said the technology advancements in developed and emerging countries have moved the banking industry away from traditional banking to internet banking and to mobile banking and now it is to digital banking.

Brain-boosting BREAFAST
Ever wonder why for some children manage to top the class every year Well, the secret lies in what they eat for breakfast. The secret is children who eat brain-boosting foods such as wholegrain cereals, eggs, vegetables and fish tend to fare better in school than kids who do not.
Better attention and memory
A recent study abroad, found that the attention span of a group of children who ate cereals for breakfast were more than double that of a group who did not eat breakfast at all. The latters ability to recall words from a list went down by 12 percent, while that of the breakfast cereal group went up by 5 per cent. Furthermore, the speed at which the breakfast cereal group was able to recall words was two to three times faster than the no breakfast group.
Children who eat a wholesome breakfast are more alert and have a better memory than who do not. So children have a good start to the day by taking breakfast!
Foods and nutrients that enhance brain function
The human brain is only 2 per cent of the total body weight, yet it needs roughly 20 per cent of the total calorie intake and a constant supply of glucose in order to function properly. Hence, it is important to fuel the brain with a proper intake of nutritious and well balanced foods to keep it at its peak. Good foods for the brain include:

Choline is good for the memory
Found in eggs and nuts, choline is absolutely vital for brain and memory development.
Anti-oxidants aid memory improvement
Brightly coloured vegetables and fruits (carrots, tomatoes and most types of berries) are packed with brain-boosting antioxidants like VitaminsA, C and E. Antioxidants not only supports the immune system, they also help keep the brain cells strong.
Omega-3 fatty acids improve cognitive functions
An important player in boosting cognitive functions, DHA and EPA rich omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats found in a variety of foods including cold-water fatty fish (salmon, tuna and mackeral), avocado, nuts (walnuts and almonds), and heart-healthy oils (olive oil).
Whole grains improve memory function
Complex carbohydrates such as wholemeal bread and wholegrain cereals contain folate and other B vitamins which help improve memory function.
Iron enhances mental alertness
Iron rich foods such as lean red meat, poultry, spinach, beans, dried fruits and whole grains improve mental alertness and energy levels. A well balanced diet consisting of the above-menti oned foods will not only make children excel in school, but in life too.

Call for zero tolerance policy on torture
The Government, Security Forces, justice system and the general opinion of the people should change in order to have zero tolerance policy on torture, stated activists of the Right to Life Human Rights Centre at a press briefing held yesterday.
The briefing was organised to commemorate the Week Against Torture which was implemented to commemorate the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture on June 26.
Prasanga Fernando a member of the Right to Life Centre said From June 2015 to 2018, attacks had been reported which could be considered above the law. However, many more cases go unlisted. Attacks on detainees while in Police custody have seen an increase, he said.
Attorney At Law Ameeza Teeger said the current Constitution protects against torture and an independent mechanism should be implemented to investigate allegations made against Police officers.
During the years 2007 and 2008,the Police recruited 26,000 personnel to the service and the government still uses old and traditional methods to investigate torture cases which should be improved.
New technological advancements should be used when investigations are bing carried out. There cannot be any justification towards torture, said Right to Life Centre member Philip Dissanayake.
Speaking on the culture of torture, Attorney at Law Prabodha Ratnayake said that torture had been a common practice in the past and must be done away with in keeping with the wishes of the people.
Some people want the authorities to interrogate suspects throught any means when seeking information. These kinds of opinions should be changed if we are to create zero tolerance towards torture, he said.

Captains who have been charged for ball-tampering
In the past few months, there is one controversy that has been creating major headlines in the cricketing world. The ball-tampering saga has had a big impact in the last three to four months.
First, it was the Steve Smith-led Australia who were guilty of tampering the ball in South Africa in March earlier this year. And now, Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal has been found him guilty of changing the condition of the ball and suspended him for one Test and a fine of 100 percent of his match fee by ICC match referee Javagal Srinath who said: After reviewing the footage of the incident, it is clear that Dinesh applied an artificial substance to the ball, namely saliva containing the residue of something he had in his mouth, an action which is prohibited under the ICC Code of Conduct. The footage shows that upon receiving the ball, Dinesh took something from his pocket and put it into his mouth. After sucking or chewing whatever he put in his mouth for a few seconds, Dinesh then proceeded to spit on his finger and polish the ball with his saliva which would have contained the residue of the artificial substance that he had in his mouth, on two separate occasions.
During the hearing, Dinesh admitted to putting something in his mouth but couldnt remember what it was, which I found unconvincing as a defence and the fact remains it was an artificial substance. In the pre-series briefing held on the back of the ICC Cricket Committee recommendations, both the sides were explicitly told that the match officials would be extra vigilant towards all aspects of fair play, including changing the condition of the ball and as such it is disappointing that this has happened.
However, this is not the first time when a captain has been accused and charged for ball-tampering. Hence, heres a look at instances where captains were charged for ball-tampering.
5 MICHAEL ATHERTON  ENGLAND VS SOUTH AFRICA, LORDS (1994)
It had barely been a couple of years since South Africa were back playing Test cricket after being banned for about 22 years. It was their 10th visit to the United Kingdom but they had won just two Test series before. However, it was after 29 years that the rivalry between the two sides resumed.
In the first Test at Lords, former England captain Michael Atherton created a big controversy after he used dirt from his pocket and put it on the ball. Batting first, on the back of skipper Kepler Wessels fine 105, South Africa posted 357 in their first innings. Allan Donald bowled a fiery spell as he took 5/74 helping the Proteas skittle out England for just 180.
The hosts had already conceded a big lead and the game was quickly slipping away. England were bowled out on the third morning and South Africa were slowly taking full control of the game. And Atherton during that innings (on the third day) decided to rub the ball with some sand which was in his pocket. He was caught on camera and was breaching Law 42.5.
Atherton in his defence tried to suggest that to keep his hands dry so that the rough side of the ball stays dry and his sweaty hands dont moist the rough part of the ball.
The former opening batsman was not fined or banned by the ICC by the England Cricket Board (ECB) imposed a 2,000 fine. England went onto to lose that Test match but made a good comeback and squared the series 1-1 in the final Test match.
4 INZAMAM UL-HAQ - ENGLAND V PAKISTAN, THE OVAL (2006)
In 2006, when Pakistan toured England, they played 4 Tests, 5 ODIs and 1 T20I. After a high-scoring draw at Lords in the first Test, England beat Pakistan comprehensively in the next two Tests.
However, the fourth and final Test began on a different note. Pakistan who had won the toss and put the hosts into bat first bowled terrifically and dismissed them cheaply. Mohammed Asif and Umar Gul took 4 wickets apiece as the visitors bowled England out for just 173 in their first innings. Pakistan then dominated with the bat scoring 504 and taking a huge lead. England did make a good recovery as they reached 298/4 at Tea on Day 4.
But there was one incident that didnt go down well with the Pakistan team. Umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove had changed the ball and awarded in the 56th over after they accused the visitors for altering and illegally changing the condition of the ball.
The Inzamam ul-Haq led Pakistani side wasnt happy with the decision and hence didnt take the field after the Tea break. They remained in the dressing room as the two umpires and the two England batsmen walked out to the middle. There was a lot of confusion as there were numerous between the Pakistan officials, the ECB officials and the match referee.
After almost an hours delay, the Pakistan side were ready to take the field. However, things got worse as the umpires decided not to take the field after Pakistans behaviour. Hence, the drama ended after the umpires handed England the match and deemed it as Pakistan forfeited the game, which was the first instance in Test history.
Skipper Inzamam ul-Haq was banned for four Test matches as he was in charge of his teams behaviour and actions on the field. Even though the Pakistan side was cleared of all the charges later the ban stayed as the skipper brought disrupt to the game.
3 SHAHID AFRIDI - AUSTRALIA V PAKISTAN, PERTH (2010)
Shahid Afridi has had his fair share of controversies throughout his cricketing career. This incident is the famous ball-biting one which took place at the WACA in Perth in an ODI.
During that tour, Pakistan were thrashed 3-0 in the Test series and they hadnt won a single game in the 5-match ODI series. 0-4 down in the series, Pakistan won the toss and batted first. After a top-order failure, Pakistan got to 212 and were bowled out in the 50th over.
Despite the low score, the game was heading towards a close finish as Pakistan bowlers kept taking wickets at regular intervals to peg the Aussies back. However, in the latter stages of the game, Afridi was caught by television cameras biting the ball. This was brought to the notice of the on-field umpires by the third (TV) umpire Rod Tucker. The ball was changed after the information was passed on and Pakistan went onto to lose that game in the final over.
Afridi who was the stand-in captain and also Pakistans T20 skipper was banned for two T20Is after he pleaded guilty in a hearing with Ranjan Madugalle (the match referee for that game).
2 FAF DU PLESSIS  AUSTRALIA VS SOUTH AFRICA, HOBART (2016)
South Africa were one of the few teams who consistently went to Australia and beat them in their own backyard. They had done it in 2008 and 2012 and were set to do it again in 2016.
After a stunning comeback in the first Test in Perth, the Proteas sealed the series in the second Test in Hobart as they dismissed the Aussies for 85 and 161 in the first and second innings respectively. They won by an innings and 80 runs as Australia suffered a rare series loss at home.
However, the Mintgate controversy broke out as Faf du Plessis was accused of applying mint saliva on the ball. Later, the ICC charged the South African captain for tampering the ball as he used an artificial substance to shine the ball. TV replays and footage revealed that du Plessis did have mint in his mouth while he was applying his saliva to shine the ball.
Faf du Plessis challenged the decision as well but to no avail as the ICC fined 100% of his match fees and also added three demerit points against his name.
1 STEVE SMITH  SOUTH AFRICA VS AUSTRALIA, CAPE TOWN (2018)
The Steve Smith-led Australia had handed a 4-0 Ashes drubbing to England and embanked the tour of South Africa with good confidence. They won the first Test handsomely but the hosts came back strongly in the second to square the four-match series.
It was a riveting battle as both teams were fighting tooth and nail to win the series. In the third Test in Cape Town, the Proteas batted first and scored 311. Australia fell short in their reply as they managed to get to just 255. After bagging a handy 56-run lead, South Africa looked in a good position of controlling the game.
But all hell broke loose when Cameron Bancroft was caught on camera trying to alter the condition of the ball with a yellow tape. Skipper Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft admitted in the post-day press conference that it was a deliberate and pre-planned and the leadership group were aware of it. They thought it would give them some advantage with the ball and aid reverse swing.
Smith and David Warner (who was a part of the leadership group) were removed as captain and vice-captain respectively in the middle of the Test match. They were also banned for one Test match by the ICC. Bancroft got away with three demerit points by Cricket Australia handed him a 9-month ban. Smith and Warner were given one-year punishments (bans) by Cricket Australia.  sk

## Title: Cause of Alzheimers all wrong

Cause of Alzheimers all wrong
Johnson and Johnson recently announced that it was halting a clinical trial for a new Alzheimers drug after safety issues emerged. This latest failure adds to the dozens of large, costly clinical trials that have shown no effect in treating this devastating disease.
In the first analysis of the disease, the German physician, Alois Alzheimer, noted odd changes in the brain of a patient who died of the condition. Alzheimer identified two kinds of protein aggregates that are not found in younger brains: plaques that are found between brain cells and tangles that are found inside brain cells.
Later research identified the proteins that made up the plaques as amyloid and those that form the tangles as tau. What these structures actually do is still under debate.
Unheeded warning
Alzheimer advised scientists not to jump to the conclusion that these proteins caused the disease. Unfortunately, his caution was ignored, and over the years it has become gospel that the buildup of these proteins causes Alzheimers disease.
One problem is that its not possible to test, in a scientific experiment, if this theory is correct. Only in recent years has technology been developed that can test what these proteins do, and it is clearly not what scientists previously assumed.
The continued failure of new drugs to make a difference has to be interpreted as evidence that the amyloid protein is not the cause of Alzheimers disease.
Promising new avenues
Perhaps it is time to rethink the disease altogether. One approach is to look for genes that increase the risk of developing the disease. The problem with this approach is that there are surprisingly few of these genes, and they are rare. Alzheimers does not appear to be driven by gene mutations, so this approach does not shed new light on the underlying processes.
Another option is to look at the risk factors for developing Alzheimers. One of these is type 2 diabetes. Clearly, diabetes is very different from Alzheimers disease, so whats the connection
In diabetes, insulin becomes less effective at controlling blood sugar levels. But insulin does a lot more than just control blood sugar; it is a growth factor. Neurons (brain cells) are very dependent on growth factors, and if they dont get enough, they die.
The loss of insulins growth factor effects in the brain appears to make neurons vulnerable to stress and reduce the brains ability to repair damage that accumulates over time.
When looking at brain tissue taken from deceased Alzheimers patients, researchers found that insulin lost its effectiveness as a growth factor, even in people who were not diabetic. This observation suggests that diabetes drugs might be an effective treatment for people with Alzheimers. Some experiments showed impressive results in animal studies, and several clinical trials have started.
Testing these drugs in animal models of another neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinsons disease, also showed impressive effects, and two clinical trials in Parkinsons patients showed good protective effects.

Chilling killing
A few years ago, an article appeared in a national English weekly. It read: A steady rise in crime rate including murders, mainly fuelled by underworld activities has shaken Colombo and its suburbs within the past few weeks, so Chilling Killing and underworld activities are not new to Sri Lanka.
Over the years, it has developed into a Killing Spree not only by underworld gangs, but by politicians themselves, setting the stage to give rise to high spate of murder, not only of gang rivals, but of innocent journalists, coinciding with barbaric torture, kidnapping, rape, swindling, robbery, rousing racial and religious hatred, revenge, trafficking in narcotics etc.
We are waiting till the political leaders take up this challenge in the near future. We are entitled to a prosperous future, without being willing to do the necessary labour to obtain it, makes us a society of sluggard fools with no solution.

CPC commences local production of Bitumen
Ushering a new era for the local construction sector, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has commenced bitumen production at the countrys sole refinery located in Sapugaskanda.
During a recent media tour to CPC, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga noted that, Understanding the rapid growth of the local construction sector and the demand for bitumen, CPC re-strategised the operations of the Sapugaskanda refinery to support bitumen process.
By commencing bitumen production locally, we envision to contribute towards the sustainable growth of the country, enabling us to produce quality material locally and save a substantial amount of government funds that would be otherwise spent on importing the finished product.
CPC expects an increase in profitability and enhancement in refinement once the processing commences locally. The ability to introduce bitumen at a competitive rate will positively impact the local construction industry by reducing their cost of raw material. CPC will also have a greater control over the quality of the product and believes that its fully-fledged laboratory with its skilled professionals will continue to maintain the quality to match international standards. In addition, the bitumen production also enables CPC to up the total diesel output by 15% and the furnace oil by 35-40%.
With the first phase of production, we are looking at catering to 40% of the countrys total bitumen requirement with a daily output of 150MT. Further, with continuous improvements to the refinerys processing capacities, we are aiming to increase the bitumen production to 225MT per day thereby increasing the total supply to 60% in the coming months, Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Dammika Ranatunga clarified.
With increased production of bitumen, not only are we able to positively impact the local construction sector by providing locally produced quality bitumen at competitive prices, but also be able to enhance the values of the refinery to uplift Small and medium Enterprises where the use of bitumen product is high,
Bitumen is known to be a crucial component as a binder in asphalt for roads, runways, parking lots and footpaths. Moreover, the material is used in countless applications from roofing, waterproofing, sealing and insulating for carpet tile backing, soundproofing, mildew protection, to bind blocks, backing to mirrors, on shoe soles, fence post coating, and soil stabilization. Not only does it builds roads, but also is vital for all kinds of infrastructure and construction projects that are in progress in Sri Lanka.

Education sector vacancies to be filled this year - Minister
All vacancies in the education sector will be filled by the end of this year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Vacancies in several sectors in the education sector including the Teachers Service, Principals Service, Teacher Educator Service and the Teacher Trainer's Service will be filled by the end of this year.
He made these remarks at a ceremony to award appointments to the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service at Temple Trees yesterday. The event was held under the patronage of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The Minister said there were 1,119 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service when this government came to power. But no action had been taken to fill these vacancies until this government took action to fill those vacancies in 2016.
I wonder how the Colleges of Education were functioning with such a huge number of vacancies, he said.
Of the 1,119 vacancies in the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service by 2015, 786 vacancies were filled by 2016 and the balance of 352 teacher educators were awarded appointments yesterday.
"Teacher Trainers serving at 19 Colleges of Education are responsible to take the education sector forward as persons who train teachers. If they make any wrong or if their duty is not done properly, the entire nation will be affected, he said.
Minister added that the teacher training should be more streamlined and the education of Colleges of Education should promptly be more modified as per the novel developments of the education sector.
Speaking on the measure taken to streamline the service of Sri Lanka Teacher Educators, the Minister said that moves are under way to provide more and effective local and foreign training for them.
Minister said that 13 year education for every child is compulsory now. Under this move, no one drops out from the education system until receiving the compulsory 13 year education. Even the students, who failed at GCE Ordinary Level can continue their education up to a degree. More priority has been given to technical education, he said.

England eye magical 500 after smashing new ODI record
NOTTINGHAM, Wednesday - England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said "the sky's the limit" for his record-breaking side, with a total of 500 firmly in their sights after their rout of Australia.
Morgan's men posted a new all-time ODI record of 481 for six at Trent Bridge en route to a 242-run thrashing of their arch-rivals to go an unbeatable 3-0 up in the five-match series.
Man-of-the-match Alex Hales top-scored with 147 on his Nottinghamshire home ground, just as he had done when making 171 in England's 444 for three -- the previous ODI record total -- against Pakistan at Trent Bridge two years ago.
Opening batsman Jonny Bairstow made 139 on Tuesday, his fourth hundred in six ODIs that included a century in a shock loss to Scotland just before this series.
Meanwhile Morgan, who missed the second ODI in Cardiff on Sunday with a back spasm, smashed England's fastest fifty at this level, off just 21 balls.
"I think (we're) definitely very close (to 500)," said Morgan.
"In the position we found ourselves today, with six overs to go, we'd have never imagined -- certainly after that game against Pakistan -- that we'd come close, pass, maybe stare down the barrel of scoring 500."
"The sky's the limit with these guys," Morgan added after England, the 2019 World Cup hosts, cemented their place at the top of the ODI rankings in style.
England might well have broken the 500-barrier had they not lost both Hales and Morgan, who put on 124 for the fourth wicket, off successive balls in the 48th over.
'PERFECT STORM'
"When 'Morgs' came out, he said 'If we're ever going to (get 500), now's the time' -- but we didn't quite get there," Hales told Sky Sports.
Former England captain Michael Atherton, commentating for Sky, labelled the match a "perfect storm" in that a talented England batting line-up were able to make the most of a good pitch on a ground with relatively short boundaries, while facing an inexperienced attack.
World champions Australia were without their injured Ashes-winning fast-bowling trio of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.
And their hopes of chasing down a daunting target were not helped by the absence of two of the world's best batsmen in Steve Smith and David Warner after the former captain and his deputy were both given year-long bans by Cricket Australia for their roles in a ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town.
Even with Smith and Warner, Australia might have struggled to avoid what became their heaviest defeat at this level, in terms of runs, and England's largest win.
England spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali shared seven wickets between them as Australia were dismissed for 239 with 13 overs to spare.
"What was most pleasing was the level of intensity we operated at, and continued to operate at throughout the whole game," said Morgan, who hopes to lead England to a maiden World Cup title next year.
'HARDEST DAY'
For Australia captain Tim Paine, the hurt was even worse than the blow to the face he suffered while keeping wicket in Cardiff.
"It's tough. I thought I had some headaches in Cardiff after 25 overs when I hit my head, but I had a few more out there today to be honest," he said after Australia's 14th defeat in 16 completed ODIs. "I've been playing cricket since I was a kid and that is the hardest day's cricket I have ever had in my life," the 33-year-old added ahead of Thursday's fourth ODI in Chester-le-Street.
"Everything we tried didn't work, everything they tried came off. Normally that happens for an hour or two then you get a couple of wickets.
"But for it to happen as long as it did, you have to take your hat off. They struck the ball as well as I have ever seen."

Expatriate worker defrauded of earnings by sisters paramour
A man who allegedly defrauded a 37-year old Muslim woman working in Kuwait of the money she had earned overseas, was arrested by officers of the Anuradhapura Police crimes division recently.
This follows a complaint made by the woman expatriate worker, on her return to Sri Lanka for a brief holiday. In her complaint, she said that she had remitted her salary to her sisters bank account for the last five years. She had remitted cash amounting to nearly Rs. 2 million in this manner. Her sister lives in the Kadathiha area in Anuradhapura.
When she returned home and asked her sister for her money, she found that there was hardly any cash balance lying to her credit in the account.
When she asked her sister what happened to the money, her sister told her that her paramour had used the money at his will, since she had handed over the relevant ATM card to him for his use.
The expatriate worker also said her sister had fallen out with her due to her complaint to the police and expelled her from her house.
Police said investigations revealed that the expatriate womans sister had been living with her paramour since her lawful husband was paralysed and bedridden. Further investigations are continuing.

Fitch Affirms Sierra Cables at BB+(lka); Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based cable manufacturer Sierra Cables PLCs National Long-Term Rating at BB+(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
The affirmation reflects our view that the rise in Sierras leverage is temporary and that the company will be able to deleverage in the next 12 months based on a sustained recovery in demand and profitability seen since the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2018 (FY18). Revenue increased by 30% in 4QFY18, compared with a 4% decline in 9MFY18, and EBITDA margin climbed to 12.2% from 5.9%.
Weaker profitability during most of FY18 was the main contributor to the companys high leverage, as Sierra was unable to pass on higher raw material prices and local-currency depreciation to customers. However, it has priced-in some of the cost of inflation with support from stronger demand since the start of 2018.
We expect net leverage - defined as lease adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR, excluding cash flow from overseas operations - to fall below 3.5x by FY19, the level above which the rating could be downgraded (FY18: 4.4x).
However, an inability to make meaningful progress towards deleveraging in the next 12 months could result in negative rating action.
Sierras rating also reflects its modest market share in the domestic copper and aluminium cable market, which is counterbalanced by its exposure to cyclical end-markets, such as infrastructure and construction. It also factors in risks associated with investments in international markets, where the company has yet to establish itself.

Fitch Ratings Lanka has revised the outlook on Siyapatha Finance PLC (Siyapatha) to sable from negative and affirmed its National Long-Term Rating at A-(lka).
The agency has also affirmed the National Long-Term Rating on Siyapathas senior unsecured debentures at A-(lka) and subordinated debentures at BBB+(lka). The rating action follows the revision of the Outlook on its parent Sampath Bank PLCs A+(lka) rating to stable from negative on June 13 2018.
Siyapathas rating reflects Fitchs expectation that support for Siyapatha would be forthcoming from Sampath, which owns 100% of Siyapatha and is involved in the strategic direction of the subsidiary through board representation.
Siyapatha is rated two notches below its parent because of its limited role to the groups core business and it is branded independently from its parent. Sampaths leasing book accounted for just 7% of group loans at end-March 2018, of which half came from Siyapatha. Siyapatha is a small contributor to group profit, accounting for 5% of group 2017 pre-tax profit.
Siyapathas senior unsecured debentures are rated at the same level as Siyapathas National Long-Term Rating, as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.

Five-year plan to achieve rice self-sufficiency
The Agriculture Ministry and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) signed an agreement on the implementation of a five-year development plan to enhance the rice production with the intention of achieving self-sufficiency in rice.
The ceremony to sign the agreement was held at the Agriculture Ministry, under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, recently.
According to the Minister, the Ministry in collaboration with the IRRI, plans to enhance the nutrition level of rice, enhance the production capacity of farmers, reduce the rice production cost of farmers, formulate a programme to manage soil, water and nutrition required for paddy cultivation, improve the knowledge and skills of agriculture scientists and researchers and also provide technical assistance to farmers.
The agreement was signed by Agriculture Director General Dr. W.M.W. Weerakoon and IRRI Director General Dr. Matthew Morell.
Dr. Matthew said the agreement identifies priority areas for Sri Lankas agriculture and outlines broad areas for collaboration and this will guide the planning and implementation of strategic initiatives in the country to re-invigorate Sri Lankas rice sector and support the government in achieving their key goal of self-sufficiency in rice.
Sri Lankas drive to restore rice self-sufficiency aligns with our goal in ensuring food and nutrition security in the region, said Dr. Morell.
The agreement that has been formalized will now help the Institute coordinate its efforts in supporting Sri Lanka as it strengthens the resilience of its rice and rice-based agri-food systems against climate change, he added.
Rice is the staple food in Sri Lanka and until recently, the country had achieved self-sufficiency in rice production. But in 2017, Sri Lanka was forced to import 700,000 tons of rice as the country experienced untimely flooding and its worst drought after 37 years. These recent challenges highlight the requirement for innovative solutions and partnerships to maintain Sri Lankas rice self-sufficiency.
That we had to import additional thousands of tons of rice in 2017 due to extreme climatic conditions reminded us of the urgent need to identify key areas we should act upon to ensure that we are better prepared in the event that catastrophes strike the country again, Director General of Agriculture said.

The global game and local priorities...:Sri rugby on radar
The month of June 2018 will long be remembered with a simplified need to be fit, agile, strong, quick, skilled and powerful enough to handle the pressure in the middle for the 80minutes regulation.
This is the basic need for all players with a hint of ambition for the team and their colours of origin.
Naturally it revolves around your preparation...be it school, club, country or full international.
June, glorious June, was all that and more ...the profusion of rugby around the planet, impossible to ignore and impressive to the last drop.
The summer internationals with northern and southern hemisphere reputations at stake. World series 7s scintillating and mind altering. World Cup focus with the next generation of gladiators in France for the IRB U 20 World Cup.
Super rugby capturing the impressive skills that define southern hemisphere flair.
Northern hemisphere form shining brighter than ever and hardly a gap the faithful claimed
Locally, not to be outdone ...the schools knockouts are full on and hugely followed despite all the drama we had last month during the last strides of our premier Singer League 2018.
Add the Sri Lanka club 7s to this hefty schedule and it really is a tough ask, to grab some sea level oxygen in the city by the sea.....
Life on planet rugby is justifiably, a heart thumping, lung busting, mind over matter, and all to play for script, that is impossible to imagine and beyond all expectations.
Stopping to catch your breath between matches, countries, stadia, and time zones ...is quite the mind numbing designer challenge indeed.
Needless to say, but grateful relief to have the planets most prolific Setanta channel looming large and live, like a kind physician with potent solutions to save our planet.....delightful and compulsive.
History will record the impressive stats and facts ...mostly predictable, but some real surprises ...thank you Ireland for shocking Australia in Melbourne and even bigger, USA beating Scotland in Houston in front of a stunned home crowd.
What a grand development for global rugby and hope for more magical results leading up to the world cup.
If magical was fair for Scots and U.S. heartsthen try to absorb how thrilling and pure inspiration the French revolution in the U20 World Cup. They beat defending champions New Zealand in the semis to alter the form book ...then at home as polite hosts, they set about stamping England out of the way ...beating them 33-25 to win that elusive world title...and French hearts a singing.
What a phenomenal result and more hints about the changing order in this remarkable sport.
Expect to see these young French gladiators graduate with distinction in the seasons ahead and dismiss the traditional pecking order.
On that note ...cant help but feel for England who must be straining at the gills, trying to accept runner up last world cup and a second final loss to France last Sunday, despite all their preparation and form.
On the day, in the middle, it was 33 points from an amazing team effort that set Paris on fire.
In Colombo the Milo knockouts sees passage for Peters, Wesley, Kingswood and Josephs into the semi finals.
Joes are the defending champions and look the part for sure.
Wesleys win over Patana, certainly shows us the massive teamwork that changed everything.
This also lines up wonderful possibilities for the semis:
Peters v Wesley.
Josephs v Kingswood.
Resident experts stand up ....who will it be in the final
Incredible if its a Joe-Pete repeat and mesmerizing opportunity for both to cap a long arduous season.
Wesley v Kingswood also on the cards ...as we know, anything, absolutely anything is possible in knockout rugby.
June is all impact and unforgiving demands on all the teams looking for victory and supremacy.
Islanders enjoy the rugby appetite and be proud of our code ...the spirit is strong, but the mind is stronger.
Bula bula Sri api!

How much is  too much
Up to 100 hair falls per day.
This is normal. So it is very difficult to gauge when this limit is crossed; Here are some warning signs that you should look for to know if you really have significant hair fall.
* If you see your hair on beddings and floors besides while combing and shampooing.
* If your hairs are getting thinner and smaller, this can be noticed near frontal hair lane.
* If you can see bald scalp through your shrinking mane.
* Receding of frontal hair line and baldness on vertex of scalp in case of males.
* While females may notice widening of central parting and reduction in volume of ponytail.

Justice for climate
GHG emissions due to anthropogenic activities are recorded to reach the highest point in the recent period. During 1970-2010, the anthropogenic GHG emissions have been increased and 78% of total GHG emissions were recorded from burning of fossil fuels and industrial activities. Therefore, providing solutions to adverse impacts for GHG emissions is very complicated since those impacts are not focused on specific location or specific group of people. They create adverse impacts to most of natural ecosystems and physical environment of the earth.
Hence, climate justice needs to be functioned as a collective collaboration. It is a combination of rights and responsibilities across generations, political authorities, states, international organisations, community groups and individuals. It needs human centred approach providing more equitable solutions in sharing benefits as well as disadvantages of climate change. Climate justice needs to focus on providing appropriate solutions to global energy demand without creating adverse impacts and to protect rights of vulnerable segments with impartial and fair mechanisms. The said approach is becoming stronger with international policy directions and evidences of climate science.
Impact of GHG emissions generate multiple issues across all biological ecosystems. Humans have an ethical obligation to understand why they are being considered as most responsible living beings for impacts of GHG emissions. Therefore, it is worth to analyze two major issues, firstly the main reason for the GHG emissions and secondly the violation of human rights and creation of vulnerability of humans due to the impact of GHG emissions.
Major reasons for Global GHG emissions
Continuity of economic and population expansions are the significant reasons for increasing global energy demand. At present, the global energy demand is 15 times higher compared to the figure of 2 billion metric tons of the year 1900. Despite the lower population (20% of global population) during 2004. Between 1970 and 2004, highest percentage of global GHG emissions were recorded from energy sector (marking 145% increase). At the same period, transport and industry sectors were responsible for 120% and 65% increase in GHG emissions.
United States and China are the largest energy consumers of the world and responsible for highest Gross Domestic Productions at the moment. During the period of 2009 - 2035, the worlds primary energy demand is expected to be increased by 40%. Furthermore, according to the case studies conducted, based on bottom-up CO2 emission reduction costing studies in Venezuela and Zimbabwe, revealed, CO2 emissions in developing countries will be increased by two or three times more than existing levels and economic development is identified as one of the major factors for this trend. Furthermore, China and India only will responsible for half of the global energy demand.
The economic development without sustainable consumption of primary energy creates negative impact on climate. Therefore, climate change acts as a risk multipler and generates reverse detrimental impacts to the economic development leading to more socio-economic challenges such as poverty, health issues, water scarcities and food insecurity.
vulnerability of humans due to the impact of GHG emissions
Impact of GHG emissions i.e adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, typhoons, heat waves and flash floods lead to basic human right violations in the context of right to life and right to live in any place with liberty, security and equal in dignity. Between 1980 and 2010, due to adverse weather conditions, 1200,000 mortalities were recorded in low and lower middle income countries. The climate change, adversely impacts on agriculture, water and sanitation, infrastructure settlements and so forth and hence generate issues on right to food, health as well as right to life and right to maintain satisfactory living standards. Creating devastating impacts on urban and rural settlements and infrastructure also lead to violate right to housing and right to property. Climate change cause displacement of humans and human migrations leading to health impacts, life threats and various conflicts. During the middle of the century, 50 million to 200 million people have moved as temporary or permanent migrants. The displaced individuals are often from vulnerable groups, leading to extreme poverty and basic human right violations in the context of housing, security and access to public services.
Both the vulnerability and responses to adverse weather conditions are not equal between men and women. In rural set up of most developing countries, women take part in collecting water and firewood. Hence, for an example women faced huge difficulties and were identified as most vulnerable category in Kobe earthquake (1995) and tsunami (2004). Hence, adverse weather conditions hugely affect women, putting an enormous pressure. In addition, especially elder people, children and disabled persons are at a huge risk.
The impacts of climate change are complex and cause a wide variety of repercussions for humans all around the world. Therefore, it is worth to analyze the challenges to the said identified issues previously order to provide right direction for climate justice.
Maintaining sustainability in primary energy consumption is a challenge:
There are several challenges in front of mitigating GHG emissions.
Who takes the main responsibility
Based on the IPCC projections, it was revealed that global temperature might increase minimum of 2C above pre-industrial level at the end of the century. It would cause catastrophic, irreversible impacts for all living beings. Furthermore, historical emissions cannot be replaced by present mitigation measures. However, only option is to reduce impacts of historical emissions by identifying and implementing appropriate adaptation mechanisms.
According to the United Nations, developed countries have more responsibilities and need to take leadership against impacts of climate change. The responsibility of the developing countries is to focus on sustainable development while developed countries need to adhere to the GHG mitigation targets defined under Kyoto Protocol. But unfortunately, USA, although being one of the major polluters, did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. With this background, developing countries feel uncertainties regarding the assurance of the term equity with common but differentiated responsibility and capabilities defined under the Kyoto protocol. To cut global CO2 emissions, universal synchronization and co-operation of strategies are required. Even though Japan and EU would jointly move towards common policies to reduce CO2 emissions with innovative technology approaches, alternative energy options and energy saving mechanisms, their efforts would not be successful until major CO2 polluters; i.e USA, China and Russian adopt joint policy commitments.
Is the principle that dictates the polluter to pay justifiable
The Nationally Determined Contributors (NDCs) were prepared by parties to reduce GHG emissions in the future by introducing clean green energy options (wind, solar, natural gas, hydro, tidal ) and energy efficient mechanisms including demand side energy management. Due to lack of capital investments, approximately 129 countries request international financial support and nearly 84% countries request international support. It has been proven that those countries which are already benefitted from GHG emissions automatically will be assigned certain responsibility to control future GHG emissions of developing nations.
Since prepared NDCs are not adequate to achieve long term targets, further actions need to be taken to increase investments and decarbonization efforts in the areas of city development, energy systems and land use amongst willing countries.
Challenges in Protecting Human Rights and reducing vulnerability
Current mitigation and adaptation policies are not providing real justice to the most vulnerable as certain segments in the society. For example, developing economies located in hot tropical and sub-tropical regions usually depend on agriculture as the major source of income and they do not have adequate resources and capacity to manage such disasters and enhance the level of resilience. Financial constraints, poverty, lack of technologies and awareness/ education as well as lack of appropriate policy directions are the major gaps in terms of protecting human rights and reducing associated vulnerabilities.
The adaptation and mitigation mechanisms which have been developed, sometimes cause contradictory impacts to other segments of the society. It is evidenced, several human rights violations occurred due to hydroelectric/biofuel projects and resettlement programmes. Furthermore, Clean Development Mechanisms, sometimes, generate human rights issues such as land use and tenure issues and benefit sharing. Therefore, protecting rights and benefits of vulnerable population and avoiding negligence /trade off in series of dealings are still challengeable.
Gender mainstreaming into climate change, acts as a late comer since most developing countries highly focus on poverty, employment etc. Due to lack of participation in decision making, lack of skills to manage disasters and immediate responses will be major challenges for women.
The Role of Climate Justice
Climate justice needs a strong direction towards protecting rights of people, sharing both advantages and disadvantages rightfully. Most importantly, the climate justice decisions and implementations need to be more liable, transparent and also participatory including both top to down as well as bottom to up approaches. More education and awareness are also compulsory to tackle both immediate and long-term responses to climate change.
International and local policy and decision makers need to be more careful when allocating resources in mitigation and adaptation strategies, paying more attention on realizing the obligations and respect towards human rights. Developed economies need to take leadership in reducing GHG emissions and to take the responsibility in providing technical assistance, capacity enhancements and financial resources to the members of developing countries. It is required to increase acceptable, new foreseeable financial allocations to discourse the mitigation and adaptation issues of developing countries. Furthermore, Climate financing needs to be in line with countrys available planning, budgeting system and public finance management. Development planners should have strong capabilities to manage climate finance effectively and efficiently.
Strong women voices, gender based researches, awareness and climate change education will be essential to reduce the vulnerability of women. Most importantly, building synergies between gender issues and international conventions related to desertification and climate change are required.
Justice for future is most important. Climate change and sustainable development are strongly interconnected with each other. Requirement of global commitment towards immediate actions for climate change and its adverse impacts are strongly emphasized in Goal 13 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, there is a strong trade-off between the climate sustainability and economic development and there are several arguments behind these two extremes in between economists and environmentalists. Therefore, sustainable development is always an acceptable option creating equilibrium middle pathway within these two extremes recognizing the obligations of present towards future generation.
Climate change impacts due to human activities leads to disastrous impacts. Therefore, humans have a major responsibility for the impacts of GHG emissions. The foremost existing issues, challenges and possible solutions need to be analysed based on a systematic approach. Hence, effective policies and strategies are required to mitigate and adapt to adverse impacts of climate change. Both global north and south need to play a major role having mutual understanding and assistance to combat this disastrous situation with a global vision. Each country needs its own vision to integrate climate change into their major economic sectors.
Climate Justice needs to be transparent, accountable needs to maintain fair and equitable approaches for all human beings. It is totally a humanitarian battle, protecting rights of people and reducing vulnerabilities associated with the poor. The international organisations, local governments, scientists as well as development partners require to sit together and try to provide holistic, impartial and sustainable solutions to combat adverse climate change impacts.

Kandy SC AGM on June 30
Kandy Sports Club has a record as the most successful rugby club in the country in the last two and a half decades with the most number of wins in the league and knockouts. They are the defending league knockouts, sevens 1st leg rugby champions, and are doubtful starters for the 2nd leg. However their AGM will take place on June 30 at the Lt. General Denzil Kobbekkaduwa Club house. The reputation that this club has achieved wherever the game is played has been earned as a result of the consistent success of Kandy SC team spanning over several decades right throughout the ranks from school leavers to senior players. Many famous rugby players have grown to great heights from this club not only to represent the National team, but also playing for overseas grade one teams.
Founded in 1874 Kandy SC has been the most successful Sri Lankan club after the resurgence in 1992 winning all titles offered by the parent body such as the league, knockouts and the rugby sevens on most number of times. This is one of the oldest clubs in the country with a history of 144 years.
Today, this club is an international venue with all facilities, thanks to Malik Samarawickrema. The club is gifted with all what they need with a modern club house, dressing room, tiers, restaurant, gymnasium and everything that a club requires. The game of rugby has become very popular, with the largest spectator attendance at all matches where Kandy SC is in action, since 1992, they have been dominating the game at all levels of sevens, league and knockout.
All the good work by Kandy SC has been due to Maliks solid backing. He is a disciplinarian and a man who knows the game well having given his best for rugby at school, club, province and national levels. As in the past, he will be standing by his favorite Kandy SC team in ensuring another wonderful season. He joined the club in the early 1990s, and from the day he stepped in, Kandy SC has gone from strength to strength both in the rugby field and administration. It was he who advised and helped the officials to do up the grounds, and today it is probably the best rugby ground in the country. He was instrumental in adding the tiers right round the grounds, and the modern pavilion built by him was named after 1969 Kandy SC captain late Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa.
When Malik joined Kandy SC they had not won a single championship, though they entered the cup finals in 1954, when the tournament was only five years old and lost to CR & FC. They first won the Clifford Cup in 1992, from there onwards they have been winning championships after championships, and today this club is known as the champion rugby club home to the countrys best players. When the history of rugby is recorded at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will stand as one of the greatest administrators of this sport.
The club has won the league on 18 occasions, knockouts 22 occasions, Presidents trophy 12, and are the current League knockouts and first round sevens champions. What the club needs today is a good president.

The King of Horror
It is amusing that as I try to figure out the opening line for this article, I find myself distracted by one of my favorite Stephen King interviews,in which King talks about the vital importance of a good opening line. There are all sorts of theories, he says, its a tricky thing. But theres one thing hes sure about: An opening line should invite the reader to begin the story. It should say: Listen. Come in here. You want to know about this. What King says next is even more significant. Weve talked so much about the reader, but you cant forget that the opening line is important to the writer, too. To the person whos actually boots-on-the-ground. Because its not just the readers way in, its the writers way in also, and youve got to find a doorway that fits us both.
A door Stephen King has no trouble looking for. After all he is the Big Mac of writers (his words, not mine). But the great thing is, unlike the fast food restaurant, King is actually good for your soul - provided you have a taste for excellent pieces of horror-tinged prose.
Something which, I, sadly dont have. But which millions of others seem to cherish. It is said that King has sold an estimated 350 million books to-date, and he is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. John Grisham and Fifty Shades of Grey author E.L. James may outsell him these days, but its hardly a problem. Hes not competitive, says his longtime agent Chuck Verrill. The only guy he ever cared about was Tom Clancy. They were both at Penguin once, and it was made clear to King that he was seen as the second banana to Clancy. He didnt like that, but hes very content where he is right now.
Not so in the early years though. It had hurt at first. The reason was clear. By writing horror novels King had entered the least respected genres of fiction. King admits this is true, and asks, But what could I do Then he adds, I have to say this: To a degree, I have elevated the horror genre. Its more respected now. Ive spoken out my whole life against the idea of simply dismissing whole areas of fiction by saying its genre and therefore cant be seen as literature. Im not trying to be conceited or anything. Raymond Chandler elevated the detective genre. People who have done wonderful work really blur the line.
But the critics continue to be brutal. King recalls an article in the Village Voice. Early in my career, The Village Voice did a caricature of me that hurts even today when I think about it. It was a picture of me eating money. I had this big, bloated face. It was this assumption that if fiction was selling a lot of copies, it was bad. If something is accessible to a lot of people, its got to be dumb because most people are dumb. And thats elitist. I dont buy it.
The cartoon was doubly painful because King says he never thinks about money. Im not a clothes person. Im not a boat person. We do have a house in Florida. But we live in Maine, for Christs sake. Its not like a trendy community or anything. We have the houses and stuff. My wife likes all that. But Im not very interested in stuff. I like cars, because I grew up in the country and a car was important. So weve got more cars than we need, but thats our only extravagance.
King was born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father abandoned the family when King was very young (He went out to buy cigarettes and never returned). He was raised poor, by his mother, who worked in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged. As a kid, he says, I went to see every horror movie I could possibly see. Sometimes my brother went with me. My brothers two years older, and he would put his hat over his face. I never put my hat over my face.
He had started to read when he was around twelve years old  borrowing books from a mobile library. I read a wide range of books. I read The Call of the Wild and The Sea-Wolf one week, and then Peyton Place the next week, and then a week later The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Whatever came to mind, whatever came to hand, I would read. When I read Tess of the dUrbervilles, ...I loved that book, so I read a whole bunch of Hardy. But when I read Jude the Obscure, that was the end of my Hardy phase. I thought, This is ridiculous. Nobodys life is this bad. Give me a break.
Kings first published story was, I Was a Teenage Grave Robber, which appeared in 1965 in a fan magazine called Comics Review. Around that time he received a scholarship to attend the University of Maine in Orono, where he met his wife, Tabitha, a novelist with whom he has three children and to whom he is still married. To this day, King believes there are two secrets to success: I stayed healthy, and I stayed married.
After having struggled for several years to support his young family by washing motel linens at a laundry, teaching high-school English, and occasionally selling short stories to mens magazines in 1973, he sold his novel Carrie, which quickly became a best seller. Since then, virtually all of his novels and most of his short stories have been adapted for film or television. Although he was dismissed by critics for much of his career his writing has received greater recognition in recent years, and in 2003 he won the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters from the National Book Foundation. King has also been honored for his devoted efforts to support and promote the work of other authors. In 1997 he received the Writers for Writers Award from Poets & Writers magazine.
Ever ready to advise young writers King has many tips on how to write a good novel. Using the passive voice, he says, should always be avoided. Timid writers like passive verbs for the same reason that timid people like passive partners. The passive voice is safe. He also says adverbs should never be used. The adverb is not your friend, especially after he said and she said. And yet, he does not see the need to obsess over perfect grammar. The object of fiction isnt grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story. His most important piece of advice is Read. Read. Read, because  if you dont have time to read, you dont have the time (or the tools) to write.
With a career spanning over forty-four years as a writer, forty-three novels, eight collections of short stories, eleven screenplays, and two books on the craft of writing, when the Paris Review asked King how important were his surroundings when he was at work he had this to say. Its nice to have a desk, a comfortable chair so youre not shifting around all the time, and enough light. Wherever you write is supposed to be a little bit of a refuge, a place where you can get away from the world. The more closed in you are, the more youre forced back on your own imagination. I mean, if I were near a window, Id be OK for a while, but then Id be checking out the girls on the street and whos getting in and out of the cars and, you know, just the little street-side stories that are going on all the time...My study is basically just a room where I work. I have a filing system. Its very complex, very orderly. I write down birth dates to figure out how old characters are at certain times. Because if I do something wrong now, it becomes such a pain in the ass to fix later.
Talking about the unique way his novels get under the skin of the readers, King explains, Ive always thought that the sort of book that I doand Ive got enough ego to think that every novelist should do thisshould be a kind of personal assault. It ought to be somebody lunging right across the table and grabbing you and messing you up. It should get in your face. It should upset you, disturb you. And not just because you get grossed out. I mean, if I get a letter from somebody saying, I couldnt eat my dinner, my attitude is, Terrific!
So, beware. If Stephen King is around, you are bound to come across a world filled with mysteries, the improbable and the inexplicable; rats as big as cows, plants that swallow publishers, men who eat their own fingers... As Holly Gibney says to an empty room at one point in The Outsider: Anything is possible. Anything at all. The world is full of strange nooks and crannies.
If those last lines gave you goose bumps, relax. The King of Horror himself is scared of many things. He is mortally frightened of flying and of number 13. The number 13 never fails to trace that old icy finger up and down my spine. When Im writing, Ill never stop work if the page number is 13 or a multiple of 13; Ill just keep on typing till I get to a safe number. When Im reading, I wont stop on page 94, 193, or 382, since the sums of these numbers add up to 13.
Tell me you are smiling. Tell me you will sleep with the light off, tonight.

Stephen King Quotes 1. Books are a uniquely portable magic.2. The most important things are the hardest things to say.3. If being a kid is about learning how to live, then being a grown-up is about learning how to die.4. When all else fails, give up and go to the library.

The new land deed to Parliament was handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka yesterday evening.
The deed was handed over to Speaker Jayasuriya in the presence of Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella and other ministers, deputy ministers and Parliament officials.
It was revealed recently, that the Parliament and the 12-acre plot of land it is situated on, had no official deed for the past 36 years. The ownership of the land had been provided to Parliament by a Thamba Sannaspathra, a royal edict engraved on a copper plate by late President J. R. Jayewardene to the then Speaker M. Bakeer Marka in 1982.
The total area of the Parliament premises, which was 12 acres, one rood and 32 perches in 1982, had extended over the time and the new deed includes all surrounding areas. Survey activities pertaining to the land had been carried out during the past few months.

Lankan canned fish free from parasites - CFMASL
Local canned fish does not contain parasites, assured the Canned Fish Manufacturing Association of Sri Lanka (CFMASL).
CFMASL President Shiran Fernando at a press briefing said that their association could give an assurance to the public that its products were totally free from parasites. Fernando said they use 100% locally caught ocean fresh fish which comes from fishing grounds from Sri Lanka and parasite worms were not found in the Linna fish (Decapterus russelli) which they use for canning.
Any organism has parasites and whats need is to give the right treatment and remove them. For that we have got the best machines from Spain which is more than five times the price of a normal machine because we want to guarantee the quality of our products,  he said.
Fernando said his company cooks fish at 121 C for 55 minutes in extreme high pressure under quality assured environment going far beyond the standard requirements. Our company adheres to all the FAO standards and we have been 35 years into fish and we are exporters as well, he said. Fernando said CFMASL purchased over kilos 7 lakhs of local fish in 2017 and they have by now exceeded that amount this year. He said their objective is to produce total fish can requirement of the country by 2020 which will enable the saving of US$65 million annually which were spent on fish imports to the country.
TESS (Pvt) Ltd Consultant and Food scientist Prof Arthur Bamunuarachi, said local manufacturers follow FAO guidelines to the letter in fish manufacturing and canning process. Hence the public had no reason to have fear of parasites in local caned fish.
He said the fish from the catching point should be kept in a temperature of -3F until production, to get the best quality of it and as a food scientist he was well versed with the FAO guidelines. The local can fish manufacturers strictly adhere to those FAO guidelines, he asserted. The machinery buildings and staff of local can fish producers were of very high quality the professor said. He also assured that the fish that comes to local producers were of high quality. Since local producers used scientific methods the issue of parasites does not at all affect them, he added.

Lankan exports to Bahrain double during last five years
The Heart of Gulf -the gateway multi-billion Gulf market- is so impressed by the diverse and high-quality range of locally made exportable products in Sri Lanka, it even called them to be viable investment opportunities for partnering.
Specific Sri Lankan industrial product lines such as organic food, beverages and speciality jewellery are of high quality and premium value. There are great potentials for them in Manama and in Bahraini markets said the Managing Director of Bahrains Al Jaberiya Group Mohammed Sajid.
Al Jaberiyas Sajid, who was leading a seven-member Bahraini business delegation to Colombo was in discussions with the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen in Colombo. Sajid is also the Chairman of GCC Gold and Jewellery Association in Manama.
The Island Kingdom of Bahrain, known as the Heart of Gulf, has strong and historic logistical connectivity in the region and is considered as the best gateway to the $1.5 trillion Gulf market.
Our main import from Sri Lanka is Ceylon Tea. However, when we arrived here we found a bigger array of special high-quality products beyond Tea said Al Jaberiyas Sajid.
We are attracted by made in Sri Lanka organic food and beverages. There is great appeal for organic food and beverages in Bahrain. Specifically, organic coconut-based food products such as oil, milk, sugar, and powders. Such an organic range of coconut food products are hard to come by elsewhere in South Asia. I am myself a jewellery maker for international high profile buyers and Sri Lankan jewellery designers have grabbed my attention due to their high skills world class output. We as Bahraini investors feel oranic food, jewellery and tourism sectors offer viable investment opportunities for potential Bahraini investors and importers in Manama.
According to the Department of Commerce, Sri Lankas exports to Bahrain more than doubled in the last five years from $5 Mn in 2013 to $12.36 Mn in 2017. Last years total trade with Bahrain was $26.75 Mn a 7.4% increase from 2016s $24.9 Mn. Sri Lankas main three exports to Bahrain last year (ranked from top) were electric items such as Conductors, edible Preparations, and Tea while the three leading imports from Bahrain last year (ranked from top) were aluminum, petroleum bitumen and cotton.
Bahrain is also a major employer of Sri Lankans in the Gulf-Almost 6000 skilled and unskilled Sri Lankans are employed in labour and professional service sectors in Bahrain.
Our bilateral trade is below $30 Million and has great potential to improve. During my meeting with Bahraini Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism His Zayed bin Rashid Al-Zayani during my February 2016 visit I stressed that the two countries have not yet exploited and have not taken the strategic advantage of the enormous economic, commercial, touristic, outsourcing and investment opportunities and the natural endowments, with which Minister Al-Zavani too agreed, Minister said.
I especially call you to focus on the three FTAs that Sri Lanka has-with India, Pakistan and Singapore -and leverage from them by setting up in Sri Lanka. Members of Sajids delegation also expressed their interest to explore Sri Lankan SME ad micro sector during June 19 meeting with Minister Bathiudeen.

Less pressure on Sri Lanka at UNHRC
The pressure on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) will be considerably less with the United States withdrawing from the Council, Co-cabinet spokesperson Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He however added that it was the countrys responsibility either way as a member of the Council to adhere to the UN Human Rights Charter.
We have to fulfill our human rights obligations for our own people, regardless of any pressure, he said. The UNHRC in 2013 adopted a US sponsored resolution against Sri Lanka at the Council. In 2015, the government co-sponsored another resolution with the US promising to fulfill many human rights obligations.

Magic  BEHIND the lens
Ravindra Ranasinghe will hold his second solo local photographic exhibition Visions beyond the frame - triumphant odyssey on June 29 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. The exhibition will be open to public from June 30 to July 1. Most of the images on display at the venue have received international recognition and awards. A coffee table book with nearly 100 images will also be launched at the exhibition.
Ranasinghe has bagged many awards locally and internationally including the worlds most prestigious EFIAP Distinction - Excellence - Federation Internationaledel Art Photographique.
He always loved photography as a hobby and not for fame or gain. His foray into the bigger world of photography began just seven years ago, when Athula Ranaraja encouraged him to submit one of his photographs for a competition, which won him a Gold Medal in the Amateur category. This spurred him to perfect his technique and augment his knowledge. He followed a Certificate Course in Photography conducted by the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka under Academic Director, Panduka De Silva. This drove him to persistently perfect his skills, not only as a photographer but as a pure artist who creates spellbinding images, with a style that is unique to him.
By 2018, he had not only been crowned with the photographic worlds most prestigious accolades but won the overall award in the Open category for the second consecutive year at the State Festival of Photography which accumulates to 23 national level and 59 international awards, 485 acceptances through 275 images in 105 competitions across 40 countries. Recently, he was appointed as the Assistant Membership Director - Sri Lanka for the Photographic Society of America.
Ranasinghe was inspired by award winning international photographers Steve McCurry, Terry Donnelly and RaulVillalba for their style and technique and by Sri Lankan photographers Henry Rajakaruna, Chandrasena Perera and MahindaJeevananda for the support they rendered.

Mahindananda's case transferred to another High Court
The Court of Appeal yesterday issued an order transferring a case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage to another court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Court of Appeal Justice Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Justice S. Thurairajah made this order pursuant to a transfer application filed by former Sports Minister Aluthgamage.
The Court of Appeal further ordered to expeditiously conclude the High Court trial against Mahindananda Aluthgamage. The court observed that there is a fair reason to believe that this matter should be transferred from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to another court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money.In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said he would deny a fair trial. Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha with Counsel Keerthi Tillekaratne instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage. Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.

Major  change  in 2.0
RJinikanths 2.0 seems to be stuck in a huge post-production problem, and with every passing day, the future of the film is turning out to be a big question mark.
The film, which was initially planned to hit the screens in May 2018, was first postponed to August 2018. Now, according to a report, the release date of the film is likely to be shifted to 2019.
This is because of many changes in CGI of the film, says the report. With many pending post-production work, it is not clear when the film will see the light of the day. It is said that some of the CGI outputs were not satisfactory and the makers are re-working certain portions of the film.
The film was supposed to hit the screens before Kaala.
Directed by Shankar, 2.0 has Amy Jackson and Akshay Kumar in the lead roles. Academy Award winner AR Rahman has composed the songs for the film.
2.0 is a sequel to Rajinikanth-Shankars Enthiran, which is about an AI robot called Chitti.

Meghan Markle and Harry  stun at Princess Dianas niece wedding
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry were in fine spirits on Saturday as they arrived for the wedding of the Duke of Sussexs cousin - exactly four weeks after their own Royal Wedding.
The newlyweds were seen smiling and laughing as they attended the wedding of Celia McCorquodale to George Woodhouse at St Andrew and St Marys Church in Stoke Rockford, Lincolnshire.
Celia, the younger daughter of the Princess of Wales sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, sported the tiara that Diana wore for her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.
The bride attended Meghan and Harrys glittering wedding at St Georges Chapel in Windsor exactly four weeks ago and returned the favour by inviting her cousin and his new wife to her own celebrations. Meghan and Harry looked delighted to be attending the wedding as they arrived at the picturesque country church, holding hands and smiling and laughing with other guests.
This came just 48 hours after the Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen in Cheshire for her first joint public engagement with the monarch, but without her new husband.
They had arrived in Runcorn following an overnight journey on the Royal Train, which Express.co.uk understands set off on Wednesday night and after arriving at its destination, the pair drove across the Mersey Gateway Bridge before heading to the Catalyst Museum in West Bank, widnes.
There, the Queen unveiled a plaque to officially open the 1.86 billion project, a six-lane toll bridge over the River Mersey, to ease traffic between Runcorn and Widnes.
As they left, the Queen and Duchess were presented with flowers by Savannah Cafferty, 11, and Alarni Wain, who was celebrating her eighth birthday.
The event at the Catalyst Museum offers a birds eye view of the new crossing from the glass top observation gallery.
The royal party were also treated to a performance by local school children there called Bringing Communities Together: Haltons river crossing over the ages.
The Queen and duchess then got into a car together before heading to their next engagement in Chester, 20 miles away, for two more royal engagements.
Such an occasion marks the first time the Duchess of Sussex attended an event with her husbands grandmother alone.
It came after the Queen and Meghan appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony together for the Trooping the Colour, which marks the monarchs official birthday celebration.

Minister Athukorale replies Anunayake Thera regarding monks in prison, uniform
According to Section 106 of the Prison Act, it is mandatory for anyone sentenced to imprisonment to wear the jumper which is the prisoner uniform.
The Commissioner General of Prisons has the responsibility to implement this Act as an official duty, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
The Minister stated this in reply to a letter addressed to her by Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Anunayake Thera, Chief Lekhakadhikari, Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha. recently.
Ven. Prof Rahula Anunayake Thera, in his letter to the Minister, stated that according to Sri Lankas statutory law, the power to expel a bhikku or remove his robe is vested with the Sangha Sabha, which performed the bhikkhus ordination and higher ordination. The Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs also could not do so unless ordered by the Mahanayake Thera of the relevant Nikaya.
Minister Athukorale in her reply to the Anunayake Thera, added that with due respect and honour to the Anunayake Thera, she wished to state that the content of the Theras letter was not in keeping with the countrys statutory law.
However, within the Buddhasasana, the removal of the robe is an action taken due to debasement, while a bhikkhu could disrobe on his own.
The full right in this connection rested with the particular Nikaya to which the bhikkhu belonged or the Bhikku himself. No government or ruler or a party representing the government had the right to do so.
Given these facts before an independent court of justice, all citizens of the country are bound to act according to the existing laws of the country and abide by it and respect it, the Minister said.

Ministry still to find suitable investor
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development which has been seeking for a suitable investor to develop the Chalmers Granary Land in Pettah since October 2017, said they had failed to find one under the current scheme.
The Ministry asked Cabinet that they be allowed to offer several options for the payment of the investment, in order to attract investors.
In November 2016,Cabinet approval was granted to develop this land as a mixed development project to enhance wider corridors for the public to move within the development and to connect the proposed Multi Model Transport Hub (MMTH) in Fort and the Financial Hub in Pettah.
Around 250 shops at Sir Baron Jayatilaka Mawatha, Olcott Mawatha, Malwatta Road which connect to this land have also been proposed to be connected to this development.
Request for proposals to offer the land over a 99-year lease was called in October 2017 but by the closing date on March 15, no proposals had been submitted.
A meeting for investors had been later convened at the ministry in late March of this year and five investors who had shown up had pointed out that they would consider investing if the terms of payment were changed.
The Ministry thus has offered three options for investors to work with. Cabinet approved the payment schemes offered by the Ministry to investors.

Co-cabinet spokesman Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said President Maithripala Sirisena was speaking to the Mahanayakes regarding a Presidential pardon for Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara.
He however could not confirm whether this would materialise or not. Addressing the weekly media briefing at the Department of Government Information, Senaratne said the government could not go against the law of the country to make an exception for the Bodu Bala SenaGeneral Secretary.
We cannot go against the decision of courts. This is the legal system of the country. He is not the first monk in this country to be jailed. Ven. Thalduve Somarama was jailed and sentenced to death for S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes murder and he went through the same process and S.B. Dissanayake was also imprisoned for two years for insulting court.
He added that 18 religious leaders which included 15 Buddhist monks are in prison for various crimes today.
The minister stated that all prisoners had to wear the jumper under the law. No matter what the Sangha laws are, there is a law in the country which had to be adhered to, he said.
We will have to amend the Prisons Ordinance if we are to give them special preference, but under the current law it cant be done.
He also explained that the Attorney Generals Department had not received notice to appear in court when Ven. Gnanasara Theras appeal was taken up in court on Tuesday. The appeal had been postponed to June 22.

Secured Transactions Act to be amended:
More benefits for SMEs to obtain credit
The Cabinet has approved amending of the Secured Transactions Act No 49 of 2009 to enable Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to leverage their assets and obtain credit for growth.
The proposal submitted to Cabinet by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pointed out that a preliminary draft bill has already been prepared by the Legal Draftsman with regard to the above proposal.
In addition to the Secured Transactions Act, the government will also amend the Amend Prescription Ordinance (Chapter 68), Trust Receipts Ordinance (Chapter 86), Mortgage Ordinance (Chapter 89), Finance Leasing Act, No 56 of 2000, Inland Trust Receipts Act 14 of 1990, Companies Act, No 7 of 2007 and Registration of Documents Ordinance (Chapter 117) to allow the proposal to be implemented.
Presently moveable property is not considered as good security by bank and hence SMEs face difficulties to obtain bank financing. A well designed and well implemented secured transaction registry will increase access to finance for SMEs by creating a unified legal and institutional framework that allows them to leverage their moveable as collateral, the Cabinet Paper said.

Mundalama residents protest factory construction
People resident in several villages in the Mundalama area conducted a protest on the Chilaw - Puttalam road demanding the government to halt the construction of a factory in the 412-acre area in Mundalama using fly ash emitted by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant.
As the demonstrators refused to disperse until and unless a responsible officer visited and spoke to them, police had to summon Mundalama Divisional Secretary A. M. C. M. Premasuriya to speak to the demonstrations.
When the demonstrators demanded a written undertaking to stop the constructions of the proposed factory, the Divisional Secretary refused to accede to their demand and the protestors said they would never abandon the protest until some guarantee was given.
Thereafter, the Chairman of the Puttalam District Development Committee, Parliamentarian Hector Appuhamy spoke to the demonstrators via the mobile phone of the Mundalama police OIC and promised to halt the construction work until he held discussions with the demonstrators and they later dispersed peacefully.
Administration manager of the proposed factory, Channa Ratnayake when contacted, said the proposed factory is intended to minimise the environmental damage caused by the Norochcholai coal power plant. It will only build blocs using fly ash of the Norochcholai factory.
Although a licence had not been obtained for the project so far, the Wayamba Provincial Environmental Authority had issued guidelines to proceed with the project. Black flags had been put up in Mundalam against the Chinese presence and shops remained closed while police had beefed up security in the area yesterday.

NPC mulls traffic monitoring via Google
National Police Commission is taking steps to control ever increasing traffic in major cities using Google Data.
Prof. Amal Kumarage from the Moratuwa University presented to the National Police Commission (NPC) and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) as to how persisting traffic issues could be resolved using Google data.
He made a comprehensive presentation on improving Transport Traffic Management in Sri Lanka based on a software on June 14.
He also explained the magnitude of the traffic problems faced by major cities in Sri Lanka including Colombo and Kandy.
There is a huge increase in the use of private vehicles as opposed to public transport modes such as trains and buses.
The deterioration of public transport has led to the increase in private vehicles causing huge traffic congestion in towns with an increasing number of road accidents. A large number of private vehicles not only causes traffic and vehicle accidents but also aggravate environmental problems, loss of useful man-hours and fuel.
As a result, major cities could become unlivable places in the near future.
Prof. Kumarage said one long-term solution for traffic problems is to strengthen the public transport. Sri Lanka Police is playing a major role to control traffic and vehicular movements on a daily basis.
Prof. Kumarage also explained the use of technology such as Google data in Transport Management and traffic control in Sri Lanka.
Prof. Kumarage added that Transport Traffic Management in Sri Lanka can be effectively handled and coordinated with the Transport Ministry, Provincial Transport Ministries, Traffic Police, Urban Development Authority and the Motor Traffic Department.
This presentation was made as an initiative by the Committee on Motor Traffic and Tourist Police appointed by NPC to look into the policing issues related to Traffic and Tourist police.
This is one of the seven committees appointed by the National Police Commission according to an idea of NPC Chairman P. H. Manathunga in 2017 to identify and address priority areas that need immediate intervention by Police. Prof. Kumarage who was invited by the NPC made this presentation at the Commissions weekly meeting.

With absorption of students to KDU: SAITM will stand abolished by law: Dr. Rajapakshe
The Medical Faculty of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), will stand abolished by law after absorbing its students to the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister moving the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (Special Provisions) Bill for debate in Parliament yesterday, said a special Clause to revoke the degree awarding status of the SAITM Medical Faculty and thereby to stand it abolished would be included in the Bill at its Third Reading.
As per the Bill, the students registered with the SAITM in between September 15, 2009 and May 15, 2017, would be absorbed to the Kotelawala University to follow the MBBS Degree Programme if they had obtained basic qualifications. Basic qualifications mean 3 S passes for Chemistry, Physics and Biology at the Advanced Level Examination or an equivalent foreign qualification including equivalent qualifications of students who have offered the subjects Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics.
The absorbed students would be awarded the MBBS Degree (KDU) if they successfully complete the study programme. The Minister said each SAITM student absorbed to the KDU would be assessed and that clinical training had been made mandatory for all of them, including those who have already passed out from the SAITM.
The Minister, observing that the Bill was presented in agreement with all stakeholders, regretted that a handful of students were protesting near the Parliament roundabout yesterday and the day before. If any party was against the Bill, they have seven days to challenge the Bill in the Supreme Court. No petition was filed against so far and that was the reason we could take it for debate very soon. The SAITM students must be meted out with justice as they have nothing to do with its erroneous start and everybody was in agreement with this solution, he added.
The Minister said the passage of legislation to absorb SAITM students to the KDU would amicably settle a long standing burning issue that hampered the education of medical students for 10 months, triggering incessant protests, causing road blocks and disturbance to the day-to-day life of the people. He pointed out the quality of university education had deteriorated drastically due the issue.
He revealed that Agencies that send students abroad for medical education, have mushroomed in the recent years, while they receive a commission of Rs 500,000 for each student they send to Medical Colleges in countries such as India, Bangladesh and Nepal. This commission is Rs 1 million for a student they send to European countries. These Agencies were pumping money to some of those student protests and unrest as they have benefitted by the protraction of the issue, he added.
Parliamentarians humiliate themselves by speaking of 118 list:Kiriella
Parliamentarians humiliate themselves by repeatedly speaking of a list of 118 names which nobody was sure of existing, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this comment in response to UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma, who called on Deputy Speaker Ananada Kumarasiri to reveal the names of MPs who had obtained cheques, property or any other benefit from Arjun Aloysius and put an end to the matter.
The MP made this request in reference to the speech of Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake in Parliament on Tuesday, where he alleged that certain MPs had obtained various other perks from Aloysius in addition to money.
Minister Kiriella pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on many occasions, had refuted the existence of such a list. The story of this alleged list of 118 MPs started by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara. But the Speaker clearly said that there was no such thing. In this backdrop, it is inappropriate to take the same matter into discussion during Parliamentary sittings. By doing so, we are defaming ourselves as well as the House. It is true that Ranjan Ramanayake made some claims regarding it. But why do you need to bring it up the same today he questioned.
The Deputy Speaker said that he would bring Alahapperumas concerns to the attention of the Speaker.
Postal fees increased by Gazette Notification
The Government yesterday in Parliament, presented a Gazette Notification to increase postage fees.
According to the notification issued by the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister, the minimum postage fee has been increased to Rs 15 from Rs 5. Postage fee for each 20g has been increased by Rs 15.
The Gazette Notification says that this fee would apply up to 100g.
Moreover, the postage fee for mail which weighs from 100g to 250g had also been increased. Accordingly, the postage fee for each 50g has been increased by Rs.10 for mail which weighs between 100g to 250g.

JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa said 33 students from among those in the first four batches of SAITM have obtained less than 2 C passes and 1 S pass at the GCE AL Examination.
Joining the debate on General Sir John Kotelawala Defense University (Special Provisions) Bill to absorb the SAITM Medical students to the KDU, he said the University Grants Commission (UGC) provided the educational qualifications of students registered with the SAITM Medical Faculty to COPE upon the request of the committee.
He said as per the given document, three out of 16 local students in the first batch, 13 out of 37 local students in the second batch, three out of 14 local students in the third batch and 14 out of 55 local students in the fourth batch have obtained less than 2 Cs and 1 S at the AL Exam.
Stating that setting 3 S passes as the minimum qualification was not fair.
He requested that it be made at least 2 Cs and one S.
He said this was also the request of the Deans of eight State Medical Faculties.
Observing that even the students who obtain higher Z-scores as 1.8 or 1.9, miss the opportunity to enter State Medical Faculties, he said two students whose Z-scores were merely 0.058 and 0.0744 were also among the students registered with the SAITM Medial Faculty.
He requested the Government to table in Parliament the basic educational qualifications of SAITM students to be absorbed to the KDU.
Govt. presents Apartment Ownership (Special Provisions) Bill to Parliament
The Government presented the Apartment Ownership (Special Provisions) Bill in Parliament yesterday, to facilitate the registration and disposition of certain Condominium properties owned by the State or by a State agency.
The provisions of the Bill would be in operation for a period of five years. The Bill was presented for First Reading by the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
The Bill removes the existing impediments to vesting the title of the condominium houses constructed by the National Housing Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and other State institutions prior to December 31, 2009.
Under the Bill, the properties would be registered notwithstanding the non-availability of the building plans approved by the Local Authority and the non-availability of the Certificate of Conformity issued by the local authority.
The Bill gives legal approval for condominium houses constructed before 2009, by state institutions even if the floor areas have been extended by the owners in violation of regulations.
Debate on private education: Grero, Bimal dont see eye to eye
A heated argument between JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake and Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero erupted during the course of the debate on private education in Parliament yesterday.
JVP MP Rathnayake said it was inappropriate for State Minister Grero to take part in a debate on private education as he is a stakeholder in the private education business who owns an international school. He made this remark at Grero when the latter stood up to reply the concerns raised by Rathnayake.
There is a clear conflict of interest in State Minister Grero participating in this debate. Do not use your position for the sake of your business. You are no different to Arjun Aloysius. It is a shame that a person who finds his livelihood by selling education participates in this debate. You came to the JVP office once, seeking our support to save the Lyceum school which belonged to you. You have no moral right to speak in this debate, charged MP Rathnayake.
However, Grero said that he simply wanted to make a clarification as the State Minister.
You should not sling mud at me when I attempted to make a clarification in my capacity as a state minister. I remember that you were one of my students sometime back. You should be ashamed of what you said, Grero replied.
Dr. Rajapakshe reaffirms lecturer solicited sexual favours
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, reaffirming that a Lecturer at the South Eastern University had solicited sexual favours from female students, said he had referred the matter to the Bribery Commission for investigation.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, when Deputy Minister H. M. M. Harees questioned whether the Minister had evidence to prove his claim in the House at a previous day. Deputy Minister Harees said parents, students and lecturers of the Oluwil University had been inconvenienced due to this statement as it was highlighted in the media.
I am not speaking without evidence. The female student came along with her parents and submitted an affidavit to the University Grants Commission (UGC), detailing sexual harassment claims. The Lecturer had threatened that he would break the bones of the girl unless she agreed to provide him sexual pleasure. The Lecturer in question, had demanded sexual favours in return for good grades and I specifically named the Lecturer in question in my previous speech in Parliament, he said.
He added that the UGC had initiated an investigation concerning the allegation and also forwarded the case to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The plight of the Oluwil University cannot be hidden. There was no discipline in it and was completely out of control. Vice Chancellor Prof. M. Najim who was appointed three years ago, was trying hard to bring the University to proper standards. Yet, a few lecturers together with the Registrar were trying to sabotage his attempt, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe added.

Presidential hopeful at stake
The fractious nature of party politics came to the fore last week as the two rival factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) engaged in a tussle to gain political advantage in view of the upcoming presidential and general elections in 2020.
The catalyst for this appears to have come from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and its political strategist, Basil Rajapaksa, former Minister of Economic Affairs in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government and younger brother of the former President.
Buoyed by the SLPPs strong showing at the local government elections in February, the SLPP is now laying down conditions to the SLFP even though it is the breakaway faction of the mainstream party. This has produced mixed reactions from SLFP parliamentarians still loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena.
This situation has come about following the fallout of the motion of no confidence moved by the Joint Opposition (JO) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in April. The motion was comfortably defeated but in its aftermath, the United National Party (UNP) insisted that it was no longer tenable for those ministers who voted for the motion to remain in a government where Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister.
Thereafter sixteen SLFP ministers, state ministers and deputy ministers as well as Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala resigned from their positions and sat with the opposition. However, in doing so, they made it clear that they were not aligning themselves with the Joint Opposition group in Parliament but would function as an independent group.
This stance is now irking the hierarchy of the SLPP, which is the default political party the JO parliamentarians will revert to at the next national elections in the event they are unable to reconcile with the mainstream SLFP by then.
The SLPP, Basil Rajapaksa in particular, is insisting that the group of sixteen should take a decision about their political future. The SLPP has indicated that, if the group is unable to reach a unanimous decision, it would be able to accommodate parliamentarians in the SLPP on an individual basis. This is obviously an incentive for those who are in the group of sixteen to cross over to the SLPP.
Fate of the Group 16
Basil Rajapaksa has also stated that the group of sixteen will not be welcome in the SLPP as long as they remain members of the SLFP. He is insisting that they should leave the SLFP and obtain membership of the SLPP, a sacrifice which at least some in the group are reluctant to make.
This has placed those in the group of sixteen in an unenviable position. They have already lost their ministerial perks and privileges. However, most of them feel a sense of loyalty to President Sirisena and do not wish to defy him by joining a camp that is opposed to his leadership.
On the other hand, many in the group, especially those in the more contentious electoral districts, are aware that their chances of re-election could possibly be enhanced if they ran on a SLPP ticket rather than a SLFP list. For this reason, they would prefer to throw in their lot with the SLPP but they fear they will anger and disappoint the President by doing so.
Others in the SLFP who still remain with President want the President to rally the SLFP which is still the parent party with an established history and go it alone at the elections. In this group are Minister Duminda Dissanayake who was recently appointed as national organiser of the party as well as Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera, Sarath Amunugama and Mahinda Samarasinghe.
There are other concerns as well. Among the group of sixteen are several seniors, including former General Secretaries of the SLFP S. B. Dissanayake and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, former General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Susil Premajayantha and senior party stalwart John Seneviratne.
At least some of them are of the opinion that if they were to defect to the SLPP, they would not be accorded the same seniority and respect that they enjoy in the SLFP. This is because, firstly, they would be considered as late entrants to the party and secondly, because the SLPP is under the firm control of the Rajapaksa family, an issue they also encountered in the SLFP when Mahinda Rajapaksa was President.
This conundrum has not been helped by public pronouncements by the likes of S. B. Dissanayake who have floated the suggestion that their objective is to have President Sirisena run as the SLFPs presidential candidate in 2020, so that after his victory, he could appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister.
Others in the party query whether their remarks have been sanctioned by President Sirisena who, it will be recalled, was quite categorical in the run up to the 2015 general election that he would not be appointing Rajapaksa as his Prime Minister even if the SLFP won the election.
There has been a consistent war of words between those who still remain within the government, those in the group of sixteen and those in the JO. These verbal interactions, although they could be considered pre-election rhetoric, have been far from cordial and have not helped the cause of unifying the SLFP. For all these reasons, there is much ambivalence and differences of opinion about the SLFP aligning with the SLPP.
2020 presidential poll
The group of sixteen did meet with President Sirisena last week to discuss these issues and the message they received was that the President wanted them to take decisions as a single entity, instead of individual parliamentarians making their own ad-hoc decisions.
If these were the issues irking the mainstream SLFP, the SLPP also had its share of anxious moments last week. That came in the form of controversy over former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who is being touted as a potential presidential candidate for the party at the 2020 presidential poll.
That was after it was reported that outgoing United States Ambassador Atul Keshap, who made a courtesy call on Mahinda Rajapaksa was reported to have indicated that the United States would not support the prospect of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming President of the country.
Despite the United States being among the most powerful nations in the world, these sentiments would have amounted to little if not for the fact that the younger Rajapaksa is in fact a citizen of the United States and, under the 19th amendment to Constitution introduced by this government, dual citizens are now prohibited from seeking high political office in Sri Lanka.
That would mean that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa would have to renounce his United States citizenship if he were to run for President and questions remain whether it is simply an over the counter process which he could do at will or whether the United States government could potentially place stumbling blocks in his path.
That is what the UNP would be hoping for and that is what the speculation was all about. The SLPP has not been helped by the fact that both the United States Embassy and the former Presidents office failed to issue a categorical denial that ruled out the possibility of such a discussion taking place.
The next national elections are many months away but the shadow boxing between the major political camps has already begun. Unless an agreement is reached soon between the different camps loyal to President Sirisena and former President Rajapaksa, it is clear that the SLFP voter will be faced with a dilemma at the next election: should it opt for the official party or should it go with the rebels who have dared to defy a sitting President It is a question most SLFPers hope they wouldnt have to contend with, come 2020.

Professionals, step forward
Apparently, there are two things in life that one cannot escape: death and taxes. Nearly all countries levy taxes on personal income as well as goods and services. These funds in turn are used for welfare and development. In this sense, taxes can be termed as an investment for the future.
But Sri Lanka faces an uphill struggle to broad base its tax revenue. Until very recently, there were only 400,000 direct tax payers out of a total population of nearly 22 million. This means that we have to rely mainly on indirect taxes such as Value Added Tax (VAT) on various goods and services (indeed, in some countries it is known as Goods and Services Tax or GST) to meet the revenue targets. In fact, almost 80 percent of the tax revenue comes from such indirect taxes. It is these funds that are used for education, health, infrastructure development, poverty alleviation and other welfare measures.
The goal is to have at least one million tax payers in the medium term, which is not impossible at all. Around 69,000 new tax files have been opened after the new Inland Revenue laws were passed recently, but this is not adequate. The silver lining in this statistic that most of the new tax payers have come forward voluntarily. This trend should continue. However, judging by the number of new luxury cars on Colombos roads alone, there should be many more people capable of paying taxes.
True, the Government can track down those who evade paying taxes, but it would be far better if this becomes an entirely voluntary exercise. Sadly, many professionals including lawyers, doctors, tuition teachers and architects who have benefitted from the countrys free education system do not give back by paying due taxes, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said. We have to agree with his assessment. There are also many instances when they go abroad without serving their Motherland which leads to a revenue loss as well as brain drain.
A mechanism must be evolved to collect tax revenue from large-scale tuition classes and other untaxed/unaccounted activities. A consultant doctor who earns Rs.1,000 from each channeling patient collects around Rs.30,000 per day, at the rate of 30 patients a day. Coupled with the monthly Government salary, the income of such a consultant would easily exceed Rs. 500,000 per month. It is only fair that he or she is called upon to pay a tax component to the Treasury. After all, the people have contributed to their education through the indirect taxes imposed on goods and services, from a cake of soap to a restaurant visit.
Furthermore, some professionals in certain sectors enjoy perks that are not given to any other sector. The duty free car permit for public servants is one such perk. Under this permit, a Government servant can bring down a car completely duty free. Hence, a car that costs around Rs.8 million in the open market will cost only around Rs.3 million under a permit. Permits are issued every five years, which means that some government servants will never pay duty on a car until they retire or even afterwards. This is how the Government recognizes and rewards their hard work, but do they think about the people the same way For example, the doctors strike at the drop of a hat, depriving the poor people of healthcare, while the rich can go to private hospitals (where the strikers have no qualms about working or channeling).
In this context, the Finance Ministry has decided to reject a proposal by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) to provide doctors with an income tax ceiling of 12 per cent along with other concessions. Minister Samaraweera has however decided to increase the Distress Availability Transport (DAT) for specialist doctors but no tax relief would be granted. This is a laudable decision.
The equation is rather simple - if more people pay direct taxes, fewer people will need to pay indirect taxes. Minister Samaraweera has expressed a willingness to reduce VAT by another 2.5 percent over the next few years as the number of direct taxpayers rise at least until we can see a ratio of 60:40 (Indirect: Direct) among taxpayers.
Things are moving firmly in this direction, according to the statistics released by Minister Samaraweera. In just two months since the implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act, total Government revenue has increased by 8 per cent - from Rs.256 billion in June 2017 to Rs.276 billion in June 2018. In May 2018, the Department of Inland Revenue had made Rs 5 billion more in income tax revenue than May of last year.
These are positive signs that show a brighter future for Sri Lanka. Eliminating waste and corruption must also be a priority for the authorities, since the funds that go for these nefarious acts can then be used for development and welfare projects. While taxes are not the only means of Government income, they do play a major role. The onus is on those who can, to pay their taxes on time.

The Government Radiological Technologists Association (GRTA) will launch a trade union action from June 26 after staging a token strike on June 20 and 21 in the North Western Province, GRTA Secretary Dharmakeerthi Epa said.
According to Epa, trade union action is to be taken in order to get all the transfers reversed. Direct requests for Radiological examinations coming from the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital, Chilaw Hospital and other state hospitals located in the North Western Province will be rejected. Epa was addressing the media during a press conference held in Colombo, yesterday.
According to Epa, the transfers of Radiological technologists had been made to carry out the night workload of state hospitals in the North Western Province while having a control over the membership of the union. This is unreasonable, he said.
Now 22 have days passed since the union members started a work to rule campaign. There is no response from the relevant health authorities.
Therefore, the token strike and other trade union action will be taken, he added.

Ronaldo  delivers again  as Portugal  down Morocco
Moscow, Wednesday: Cristiano Ronaldo followed up his opening game heroics at the World Cup with the only goal in a 1-0 win for Portugal against Morocco as the European champions edged closer to the last 16.
The Real Madrid star struck in the fourth minute in Moscow to surpass Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas as Europe's all-time leading scorer with 85 international goals.
Victory sent Portugal top of Group B on four points ahead of Spain's game against Iran in Kazan, as a second straight defeat for Morocco condemned the African nation to an early exit in their first World Cup appearance since 1998.
Morocco coach Herve Renard opted for a back four, with Manuel Da Costa and Nabil Dirar coming into the side, to provide added protection against the "absolutely exceptional" Ronaldo after his hat-trick against Spain.
But his plans were torn apart within minutes at the Luzhniki Stadium as Ronaldo wriggled free of the imposing Da Costa to bury an unstoppable header past a helpless Monir El Kajoui.
It was Ronaldo's fourth goal of the tournament, more than his combined tally at three previous finals, and left him trailing just Iran's Ali Daei (109) on the list of top international goalscorers.
The Real Madrid forward threatened a second soon after, swivelling on the edge of the area and scuffing just wide after a powerful run from left-back Raphael Guerreiro.
Mehdi Benatia forced a smart low save from Rui Patricio at a corner for Morocco, before Hakim Ziyach skipped his way into the Portugal area, his goal-bound effort blocked by an outstretched leg.
Joao Moutinho then nipped in ahead of Mbark Boussoufa to get a vital clearing touch in the six-yard box as Morocco consistently targeted the right side of the Portuguese defence.
A crude lunge from Benatia on Ronaldo left the Portugal skipper writhing around in pain, while Morocco felt aggrieved when Nordin Amrabat was hauled down by Guerreiro as he muscled his way into the area.
Khalid Boutaib was flattened by Jose Fonte in an aerial challenge that again had the Moroccans up in arms, with Renard warned for gesturing for the video assistant referee.
Morocco goalkeeper El Kajoui kept his side in the game when he stuck out a strong left palm to repel a Goncalo Guedes effort following Ronaldo's lofted pass over the top.
Ronaldo blazed over from 15 yards after a quick free-kick caught Morocco out, Guedes's miscued attempt rolling invitingly to the five-time world player of the year.
Morocco continued to carve out opportunities as Patricio clung on well to a curling Belhanda shot, and the Portugal keeper pulled off an even better save minutes later.
Another dangerous delivery from Ziyach was flicked on by Belhanda, with new Wolves signing Patricio flinging himself to his right to magnificently claw the ball to safety.
A further opening fell to Benatia, the Juventus defender neatly shifting the ball onto his left boot only to lash over the bar as Morocco's frustrations mounted. The lively Ziyach nipped past Fonte in the closing minutes but found Pepe standing in his way, with Benatia hammering over one final chance to seal Morocco's fate.
Portugal will meet Iran in their final group game on June 25, with Morocco set to bow out after their match against Spain in Kaliningrad. AFP

Saudi Arabia World Cup 2018 team plane goes on fire in mid air
Saudi Arabia's official team plane caught fire in mid air as they travelled to their next World Cup match.
Flames were seen from the engine as the Russian Airlines Airbus was en route to Rostov where they take on Uruguay on Wednesday. An official statement read from the football association read: "The Saudi Football Federation wishes to reassure everyone about the safety of all members of the mission of the national team after a minor technical malfunction in an engine. "The plane landed a few minutes ago at Rostov on Don Airport, and UNOMIG personnel are now safely heading to their residence."
Videos uploaded to twitter show fire shooting from the engines underneath the wings.
The plane was a Russian Airlines Airbus A319-100 and no one was hurt in what must have been a terrifying incident. The aircraft was initially purchased as new by American airline Frontier Airlines, before being bought by Russian-based Donavia in July 2013. Airline Rossiya have leased the plane since April 2016.
The players were then filmed calmly leaving the stricken jet, which is 12 years old. They are now on their way to the team hotel. They next take on Uruguay after a chastening 5-0 loss to hosts Russia last Thursday - their second heaviest defeat at the World Cup.
Their boss Juan Antonio Pizzi, a former Spain international born and bred in Argentina, called that defeat 'shameful'.

## Supertitle: Ball tampering disgrace in the Caribbean

Ball tampering disgrace in the Caribbean
Sri Lanka should take  a leaf from Aussie PM, CA
The sad and shocking incident unfolding in the Caribbean involving the game the country loves most is certainly hard to swallow.
One neednt have tell a cricketer that he is taught from the day he dons the white flannels and takes the bat and the ball into his hands that he should never question the word of the umpires. The umpires word is law and it is an accepted fact irrespective of whether he is right or wrong. In the spirit of cricket you have to abide by the rules. In that sense to go and challenge the umpires decision is really uncalled for and based on a technicality to hold up an international cricket match for two hours is unpardonable.
This is what Messrs. Dinesh Chandimal the captain, Chandika Hathurusingha the coach and Asanka Gurusinha the manager did during the drawn second Test against the West Indies at St Lucias.
Their action needless to say, has brought the entire country into shame. It is a stigma that will not go away or forgotten quickly, if we are a nation of sports lovers like Australia.
Barely had the dust settled on the Australian ball tampering incident involving captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft (who carried out the crime) at Cape Town in March comes this shocking event where Chandimal has been caught applying artificial substance to the ball. To make matters worse the Sri Lanka team management argued their case with ICC match referee Javagal Srinath delaying the start of play on the third morning for one session (two hours).
Chandimal has already been punished for the first incident where he will miss out the third and final Test and was docked 100 percent of his match fee. Further punishment awaits him and the two officials (Hathurusingha and Gurusinha) when charges for conduct contrary to the spirit of the game is taken up which could lead to suspension between two to four further Tests.
If the ICC goes soft on these individuals they are going to lose control of the whole circuit. They have to make an example of them because if they dont, every Tom, Dick and Harry is going to do it and get away with it.
With the amount of technology available today it is absolute stupidity of a player to think that he can get away with what he is doing. Usually you have at least 16 cameras on the ground and there can be as many as 32 even. At any given time these 11 players on the field must be mindful of all these cameras pointing at them.
A VICTIM OF
CIRCUMSTANCE
It is hard to imagine that the current group of players are going to be involved in such monkey business where they risk putting their careers on the line. If you view the footage of Chandimals crime it is clear that somebody instructed him to do it. The way Chandimal went about doing it you could see that he had no prior knowledge even of how to cheat. Somebody gave the sweet to him and told him do it and he did exactly that. In all innocence he did it in the stupidest way possible. Adding salt to the wound when Chandimal was asked at the inquiry what he put in his mouth, he said he didnt know. Is this quality of the management that we have
Its a sad state of affairs that Chandimal who is batting at his best as he has ever done during his career to be embroiled in a situation like this. How well he batted getting a hundred with his back to the wall and instead of getting praise he deserves he is now looked upon as a cheat. He is a victim of circumstance where people in their shortsighted desire to get the results they want have ruined the future of this cricketer.
There are certain traditions of the game that you uphold and this is a Test match and not a practice game which you have held up for two hours.
Because the sport today is adopted over a number of hours on the television screen, to keep the TV audience running without the opportunity to watch cricket is really detrimental to the whole game in general.
It was surprising that the West Indies were very benevolent because any other skipper would have asked for the teams forfeiture of the game.
Apart from the ball tampering and delaying tactics of the Lankan management there was another incident that took place where Roshen Silva was asked to change his bat by the umpire as the gum that originated from the tape around his bat was creating a sticky effect on the ball.
Silva was using a new bat so why do you want to have tape on it These are valid questions that one needs to come forward and explain. These are incidents that have never happened on the cricket field before and one has to really carry out an independent investigation and get to the bottom of it.
The moment you take the spirit out of any sport there is no sport left. If you are not going to leave your fan and cricket supporter with a feeling of joy that his team has engaged and won fairly and squarely whats the point Why should he spend good money and watch the sport
These are the important elements that affect the sport when incidents of this nature happen and needs to be nipped in the bud.
Sadly none of our leaders see the gravity of the situation to even make a comment on what has happened. How can you go forward with a tarnished management like this The game is bigger and the country is even bigger than that. Winning and losing is part and parcel of sport.
You dont try to win matches at any cost the way these people seem to be doing.
We should draw a parallel and follow a similar path how the Australian Prime Minister and Cricket Australia (CA) handled the whole situation to salvage the reputation and good name of their country. It is not about winning and losing but the good name of a country cannot be dragged through mud.

Three-way tussle for Milo Presidents trophy schools k/o rugby crown
St. Peters College Bambalapitiya who defeated St. Anthonys College Kandy after a one sided affair in their Milo President trophy inter-school rugby knockout championship quarterfinal match at Royal Sports Complex are one step away from qualifying for the finals.
Peters were expected to be given a tough fight by Anthonys but it turned out to be a one sided match as the Peterites came on top against a St. Anthonys outfit, who have failed to live upto expectations.
St. Peters acting captain and nippy scrum half Jason Karunaratne led from the front. He created the openings for many tries in their 39-12 win and he has been playing really well throughout the season. Their two centres the Madushanka brothers Dilshan and Rukshan along with full back Shehan Liyanapathirana, flanker Sunera Fernando and hard working fly half Kenneth Wimaladasa too were in the thick of the game and added their names to the try list.
The Peterites who meet Wesley in Sundays second semi-final are now one of the favourites to win the championship along with defending champions St. Josephs and Kingswood who are scheduled to meet in the first semi-final on Saturday. St. Josephs beat Maliyadeva College Kurunegala by 45 points to 17 in another one-sided quarterfinal at the Sugathadasa Stadium. The Josephians defended with a lot of heart which paid off in the end. Wesley College pulled off a stunning win in their quarterfinal match against much fancied Isipathana College by 22 points to 15 also at the Sugathadasa Stadium.
Wesleys young hero was wing three quarter Kavindana Perera who scored two tries with co-winger Mohandas Paranitharan scoring the match winning try after the scores were deadlocked at 15-all.
Kingswood College Kandy caused the other quarterfinal shock when they beat their home town rivals Trinity College Kandy by 24 points to 15 at Nittawala.

Hambantota Port US$ 1 billion investment :
Treasury gets final tranche of US$ 584mn
China Merchant Port Holdings Limited (CM Port) yesterday released the final tranche of US$ 584 million for the Hambantota Port, completing the US$ 976 million investment. This marks the single highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) received by Sri Lanka to date.
The cheque was handed over to the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake by the Chief Representative of China Merchant Group in Sri Lanka - Ray Ren.
This third final tranche of US$ 584,194,800 follows the first and second tranches released in December last year and January 2018, amounting to US$ 292 million and US$ 97 million.
In terms of the Concession Agreement, CM Port has agreed to deposit a further sum of US$ 146 million for port and marine related activities.
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Government entered into a Concession Agreement with China Merchant Port Holdings Limited of Hong Kong in July last year for the management, operation and development of Hambantota Port on a Public Private Partnership model.
The Port has been making heavy losses since its grand opening in 2010 under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
In December last year two Sri Lankan companies established under the concession agreement namely, Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services Co. (Pvt) Ltd. (HIPS) officially took over the Hambantota Port, thus making the concession agreement effective.
The two companies established in Hambantota plan to invest an additional US$ 400 million to US$ 600 million on phase I and II of the Hambantota Port. These investments are likely to attract many other foreign investors, making Sri Lanka a pivotal maritime and Logistics Centre.
CM Port is one of the most successful global companies in the ports sector, and their investment in the Port of Hambantota can be described as a credible vote of confidence in its potential as well as in the economy of Sri Lanka, says Dissanayake.
During 2017, the Port of Colombo was ranked as the 23rd largest Container Port and 13th best connected Port in the world. The SLPA also recorded a Net Profit of Rs 13.2 Billion in 2017, as against a Net Profit of Rs 1 Billion achieved in 2016 .With transshipment volumes in the Port of Colombo during the first five months of 2018 as against 2017 increasing by 19.2% and Jaya Container Terminal managed by SLPA recording a transshipment growth of 21% during the period, the conclusion of the Concession Agreement of Hambantota Port would enhance the profitability of the SLPA, he said.

UPF funds allegedly used for Bond issue - Tennakoon
Centre for Human Rights and Research Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon yesterday alleged that funds of the University Provident Fund (UPF) had been used in the Bond issue.
It was revealed that an amount of Rs.880 million had been used by Perpetual Treasuries, he said.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Human Rights and Research yesterday, Tennakoon said that the key objective of the Fund is to ensure retirement benefits for the UPF members and each one of them would lose nearly Rs.750,000-Rs.800,000 from their funds due this situation.
He said that eventhough it was revealed earlier that Perpetual Treasuries, a primary dealer, had made billions of rupees in profits selling Bonds and among the buyers who ended up with the Bonds included the Employees Provident Fund. This was the first time it has been revealed that University Provident fund was also used.
Tennakoon said that in order to balance the alleged loss caused to the UPF through the Bond issue, the University Grants Commission has taken initiatives to reduce the interest rates given to the UPF members.
The interest rates in 2014 was 15.0%, in 2015 - 11.0%, 2016 - 11.3 and in 2017 it was reduced up to 10.5%.This was carried out by National Savings Bank which has been handling the UPF transactions. They have failed to follow proper protocols, Tennakoon said.
Tennakoon further said that the University Grants Commission has not filed any case against their loss and the bond issue.
He said that the loss caused to the UPF due to bond issue has not been confirmed yet and added that neither the university lecturers union nor the student union highlighted this matter.

Uruguay into last 16 with hosts Russia
Rostov-on-Don, Wednesday: Uruguay booked their place in the World Cup knockout stage along with Russia on Wednesday, as Luis Suarez scored the winner on his 100th international appearance in a 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia in Rostov-on-Don.
The South Americans take on the hosts in their final Group A match on June 25 with top spot on the line, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia have been eliminated after both suffered back-to-back defeats. Russia and Uruguay will face one of the top two from Group B in the last 16 -- either Portugal, Spain or Iran.
The 31-year-old Suarez, whose previous two World Cups both ended in bans after his infamous 2010 handball against Ghana and bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini four years later, took advantage of a goalkeeping error by Mohammed Al-Owais to put Uruguay ahead midway through the first half.
Oscar Tabarez's side missed plenty of opportunities to add further goals, but a toothless Saudi outfit never seriously looked like snatching a point.
Uruguay, semi-finalists eight years ago in South Africa, have now reached the knockout stage for the third straight time, while Saudi Arabia will try again in their search for a first World Cup win since 1994 in their final game against Mohamed Salah's Egypt.
Suarez made a bright start, looking to make amends for his poor performance in the opening 1-0 win against Egypt, firing a left-footed volley from Cristian Rodriguez's knockdown which was blocked by Ali Al-Bulayhi.
The Saudis managed to have plenty of early possession, although without looking overly threatening, only to gift Uruguay a 23rd-minute lead.
Al-Owais -- winning only his second cap after replacing Abdullah Al-Muaiouf in goal -- completely missed a floated Carlos Sanchez corner and Suarez tapped in his 52nd international goal unmarked at the back post.
That strike was Suarez's sixth World Cup goal and made him the first Uruguayan to score in three separate finals. AFP

We will follow Sri Lankas progress closely and look ahead to engaging with Sri Lanka between now and March 2019 in the spirit of friendship that has marked our recent relations. As Sri Lanka takes further steps outlined in the Geneva resolution, the United States will also support and expand our bilateral partnership.
Sri Lanka co-sponsored with the United States two UN Human Rights Commission Resolutions: 30/1 in 2015 and Resolution 34/1 in 2017, and the United States continues to extend its support to Sri Lanka to fulfill these important commitments and obligations as articulated and reaffirmed in these resolutions. Sri Lankas continued progress toward fulfillment of these international commitments will facilitate further growth of our bilateral relations and enhance Sri Lankas ability to engage with friends and partners around the world, a statement issued by the US embassy said.
The US withdrawal marks the latest rejection of multilateral engagement by the Trump administration - following its exit from the Paris climate accords and the Iran nuclear deal - and comes a day after the UNs most senior human rights official condemned the US for separating children from parents at the border with Mexico.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley issued the announcement, with Haley saying the Geneva-based organisation was not worthy of its name.
Haley described the council as a protector of human rights abusers and accused the body of politicising and scapegoating countries with positive human rights records.
She said the decision had not been taken lightly, and added: We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organisation that makes a mockery of human rights.

Creating a Departure Lounge to become World class Medical doctors and Bio Medical Scientists:
The Value of Pre Medical study programmes
Sri Lanka and the surrounding region hasbeen producing world class scientists to the world. Thethousand dollar question for parents and students is; how can we get there and from where This article concentrates mainly on Medical and Bio Medical Science areas.
Medical programmes typically requires high marks at the Advanced Level examinations. For example in the UK , the top ranking Universities such as the University of Aberdeen requires 03 A grade passes in Advanced Levels in the London stream and 02 A and 01 B pass in the Local stream to enter in to the screening process seeking admission to a medical school.Thereafter, they will have to achieve an IELTS score of 7.0 in all bands (no band less than 7) and are required to pass the UKCAT exam .
This allows them to move in to MMI (Multiple Mini Interviews). After successful completion, finally they are allowed to gain entrance to the Medical school. The important point here is that the outcomes of University of Aberdeen Medical School is recognized by the General Medical Council (GMC), UK and the graduates will obtain the provisional registration with the GMC.
This will allow them to apply for internships in all Commonwealth countries opening doors to become an international medical doctor. If the student does not possess an Advanced Levelgradingas mentioned above they could enter in to a Pre Medical Studies programme where the entry qualifications is 03 C passes in both forms of ALs.
Upon completion, they would be eligibleto apply for the screening programme to pursue medical education at the University of Aberdeen. In case the students are not selected for medicine they could move in to Bio Medical related studies with a one year exemption of those programmes where professional status and perks are equal or more than the medical doctors. (average salary of a Medical doctor in the UK is between 55,000- 80,000)
With the changing healthcare and biomedical science environment today, young students who are pursuing avenuesto become Bio medical scientistsappear at the forefront. Bio Medial Sciencesalso creates many other pathways to be Geneticists, Human Embryology and developmental Biologist, Immunologist, Pharmacologists, Microbiologists, Molecular biologists, Physiologists and Exercise & Sports scientists.
Biomedical scientists carry out a range of laboratory and scientific tests on tissue samples and fluids to help clinicians diagnose and treat diseases. They also evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. For example, they may work on medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes or AIDS, screen for and monitor a range of diseases or carry out tests for emergency blood transfusions.
Specialties in Biomedical scientists: Usually specialize in one of four areas: infection sciences, blood sciences, cellular sciences or genetics and molecular pathology.
Infection sciences: This includes medical microbiology and virology where identification of micro-organisms causing disease and their antibiotic treatment is studied.There is alsofocus on identification of viruses, associated diseases and monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines.
Blood sciences: This includes Clinical Chemistry, Transfusion sciences Haematology and Immunology. In clinical chemistry, focus is on the analysis of body fluids and toxicology studies whereas transfusion sciencedeterminesdonor/recipient blood compatibility. In haematology, functions related to blood and related diseases are the focus and immunology concentrates on the understanding the immune system and its role in combating disease.
Cellular sciences: the focus in this segment is histopathology and cytology where microscopic examination of diseased tissue samples takes place.
Genetics and molecular pathology: Genetics includes study of genes and hereditary variations in genes and in molecular pathology, study and diagnosis of disease through examination of tissues and fluids at molecular level are performed.
Starting salaries of Bio Medical Scientists in the UK range from 22,128 to 28,746 per annum.With experience and/or specialist knowledge, you can earn a salary of 26,565 to 35,577 per annum. Senior biomedical scientist, could to earn 31,696 to 48,514 and consultant biomedical scientists will earn more than 50,000.
Biotechnologists: Biotechnologists use biological organisms to develop or make products designed to improve health, food and the world around us.
They study the genetic, chemical and physical attributes of cells, tissues and organisms and identify practical uses for this knowledge to aid medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, or environmental advancement to essentially improve the quality of human life.
The work involves manipulating living organisms or their components to design or enhance vaccines, medicines, energy efficiency or food productivity.In the last decade, the growth of biotechnology has been phenomenal. Large biotechnology companies tend to use the term biotechnologist as a job title. Other organisations titles such as laboratory technician, research assistant, genomic technologist, flow technologist or bioprocessing engineer.
Types of biotechnology include;
Environmental- detecting and controlling pollution and contamination in the environment, industrial waste, and agricultural chemicals, creating renewable energy and designing biodegradable materials to reduce humanitys ecological footprint
Medical and health- using live organisms or biomolecular processes to develop and improve treatments, identify inherited diseases, cure certain disorders, and even lead to organ regeneration
Industrial- using cloning and enzyme production to preserve and enhance the taste in food and drink, and developing enzymes to remove stains from clothing at lower washing temperatures
Agricultural biotechnology- improving animal feed and genetically modifying crops to increase pest resistance and productivity
Biofuels- using organic compounds to reduce the cost of bio-refining reagents and put biofuels on equal footing with fossil fuels, and creating chemicals from renewable biomass to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Marine and aquatic biotechnology- increasing the yields of farmed fish and designing disease-resistant strains of oysters and vaccines against certain viruses that can infect fish.
Sports and exercise scientist : An exercise physiologist will investigate how people respond and adapt to muscular activity and will use their skills and knowledge to improve performance and fitness levels or to help prevent or treat illness.
They will typically provide scientific support to athletes and teams within a single sport or several sports.
This may involve monitoring training through the measurement and assessment of physical functions such as respiration, metabolism and the nervous, pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. They might also be involved in developing fitness-training programmes to make sure athletes adequately prepare for competition.
Salary:
Exercise physiologists employed in the sports sector may earn between 18,000 and 35,000. If you work in high-profile sport science, salaries can exceed 60,000 and may reach up to 100,000.Salaries for qualified exercise physiology lecturers in higher education typically range from 23,952 to 36,162.

## Title: WELL-WATCHED POT

WELL-WATCHED POT
An aluminium pot, a few stones and a burner were enough for Surahee Bohoran. She would assemble them for a makeshift oven and make a delicious cake. Watching his mother produce the culinary masterpiece with the most basic items tickled 14-year old Tony Bohorans taste buds. Of all the siblings, he was the first to taste whatever delicacy his mother chose to cook  be it a hopper or string hoppers. Dreams were taking form in his little mind and turned into a well-baked structure. Tony felt the heat in the kitchen. But he never got out of it. Instead, he chose to stir the pot and simmer himself down.
My mother became a single parent in the early 1970s when my father passed away. Her day was filled with activities. She did dishes, cooked, washed clothes and educated us the children. She managed all this singlehandedly. Bohoran now recalls with gratitude.

These were the days when the oven, like most other cookery equipment such as microwave oven, was still regarded as an out-of-bounds subject in everyday conversation. Though he does not now remember how his mother arranged the makeshift oven, the taste of the cake is still fresh in his memory.
Seated in the Managing Directors chair with a calm authority, Tony Bohoran, who founded Raffles Restaurant chain 19 years ago, justifies why he released his collection of recipes invented over the last 15 years in a coffee-table book form. Titled Tonys Recipes, the book introduces you to Tonys world of starters, soups, salads, seafood, poultry, meats, desserts, refreshing beverages in addition to a guide of marinations for BBQs, general cooking and other useful information.
His culinary-savvy mother impacted Tony for the rest of his career. Following a few odd jobs, he established his career as a chef. Unlike most other chefs who came from the ranks, Tony opted for the academic path. He obtained a diploma and degree related to his field. The recipe collection is dedicated to his mother, the pillar of his success, as a token of gratitude.
Lack of professional recognition
Becoming a chef  or establishing as one  in Sri Lanka has dire consequences, as Tony opines. The industry lacks professional recognition. The qualified chefs tend to migrate for better pay and recognition.
We need to address this issue. We need to treat the chefs as real professionals. That really does not happen in Sri Lanka. On the contrary, the chef is an industry in European countries, especially Australia. Most chefs are recognised with Michelin stars. You come across Michelin restaurants. People are motivated to enter the field. Like doctors and engineers, the chefs are well looked after, Tony assesses the chef phenomenon in Sri Lanka.
A few years working under uncaring bosses forced Tony to establish his own business empire. When he left to initiate his own enterprise what he lacked was only money. The rest he had already earned: being constantly in touch with the Colombo society, familiar with its culinary tastes and requirements and the right kind of contacts. He had people to fund his new enterprise and head the kitchen. About 400 employees work under him today.
All that came to pass because he preferred the job of the chef to that of a cook.
Challenge accepted
A cook will have to cook forever. To become a chef, you need to be multi-talented. You should have a capacity to manage people, calculate the costing, aware of the laws that govern the employees, nutrition and hygiene factors, Bohoran anatomises the difference between the two familiar terms.
If you ask a cook to prepare a menu for one week, Tony goes on to explain, he will prepare something. But a chef knows the scientific norms of a menu. For instance, each person has a requirement of calories on a daily basis. Each person has a nutrition requirement which includes protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. Besides you need to have iodine and iron as well. A chef takes all these factors into consideration when he prepares a complete menu.
To illustrate the chefs task, Bohoran takes the case of Maldivians. He explains why the Maldivians are small-made compared to other Asians.
In the Maldives, you dont find very many natural resources. They do not have vegetables in abundance. Their main diet is fish and rice with a bit of onion. With the remaining sources, they prepare a marmite-like delicacy called Rihaakuru. It is full of protein. But their basic meal lacks other nutritious values such as vitamin and carbohydrate. They have an overdose of protein.
Sri Lankan diet
More or less the same law applies to the Sri Lankan diet. Compared to the Sri Lankan diet, the European diet is well balanced with nutrients. They eat more protein, less carbohydrate with more vegetables and salads. That explains their well-built form. On the contrary, the Sri Lankan diet gives prominence to carbohydrate over the three main meals. The meal has lesser protein and vegetables. It affects the growth of body and brain.
A bulk of recipes in Tonys collection are not vegetarian-friendly. Bohoran accredits it to the percentage. Only five per cent of the Colombo society is vegetarian, he claims.
My wife is a vegetarian. But I am not. A lion cannot eat vegetables. A rabbit cannot eat meat. Likewise, the humans have to eat anything because they are omnivorous. They cannot survive with only vegetables. Leave vegetarians aside. The vegans lack the nutrients they require essentially. If you really want to become one, you should at least be lacto-vegetarian consuming dairy products. Otherwise, that meal habit makes you prone to many sicknesses and diseases.

Remember to burn it down!
As for generating cholesterol, Bohoran comments that the eater should be able to control it. Cholesterol has become a menace because people do not burn their energies. The remedy for cholesterol does not lie in avoiding food that generates the fat-like substance in the body. Eat cholesterol-rich food, but remember to burn it down.
The collection has been prepared in response to various queries he had been getting. It is not for the industry, Bohoran insists. His target audience is the affluent housewives.
Tony Bohoran has a passion to spice up the industry with professionalism. He believes that the industry is not managed properly. Sri Lanka has way more to go with a tight competition coming from the fellow Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, India and the Maldives. With his globetrotting experience, Tony claims that Sri Lanka offers an inferior product at a higher price.
Once, during my stay in China, I paid only USD 90 to a five-star hotel. The quality of the service and food was much better compared to Sri Lanka. It is beyond comparison. But you have to pay more than USD 90 to a five-star hotel in Sri Lanka.
The Tourist Board has their own argument, Tony points out. If you dont sell at a higher price, you will get cheap tourists. The cheap tourists are essentially the backpackers or the budget travellers. Arguments aside, the budget travellers will make it to Sri Lanka whether the prices are high or low. If you break down the tourist population, most of them are not high spenders. The tourists in Sri Lanka while on a transit are also considered a tourist arrival.
First we need to attract people by giving them value for money. If I spend my money, I automatically value it. For that, we should have professionalism in the hotel industry. Sadly, Sri Lanka does not have it.
And the remedy It is the responsibility of all the stakeholders. The government has to get involved. The private sector must get involved in their own right. More marketing shall take place. Tonys Recipes is an attempt to cater to that need.
You can become a cook by watching, Tony emphasises. But you can never be a chef automatically. It requires years of experience and experiment.
For most budding chefs, an invite to appear before Tony to show their culinary feat represents some chore. Bohoran has his own criterion when he recruits his chefs.
Before finalising the recruit, he asks the interviewee to make a creamy caramel. It is a basic recipe, Tony reminds, with milk, eggs and sugar. Once the caramel is prepared, Tony cuts it in half.

Perfect marble
I need to see the inside like a marble, Tony insists. The interior that looks like marble is perfect. If there are pores, it speaks for the cooks capacity. He knows how to make a cream caramel, but not the technique. Every recipe has a scientific technique behind it.
You should never beat up the eggs. What happens when you beat up is that the white and the yolk hold on to the air. As you beat, the air gets trapped in the custard. With that, it sets the air bubbles. That explains the pores inside.
On a different note, Tony takes mayonnaise for example. You need the egg yolk and mustard for the preparation. Plus, you need to pour oil at the same time you beat it up. Practically speaking, you need both your hands. The hands have to function in sync. When you beat eggs, you incorporate eggs into the air. The oil gets coated in the air particles. If you happen to increase the speed of pouring oil, the preparation will collapse. A skilled chef, for that matter, should know the art of balancing.
That is the issue with most Sri Lankan chefs. They do not know the technique. One major concern is that the government-sponsored Sri Lanka Institute of Hotel Management has space only for 30 students at a time. They receive about 200 applications. The leftover crowd chooses private hotel schools which are money-oriented. Finally, the outcome is inferior, Tony explains.
Tony Bohoran is not a chef fallen from the skies. His is a long arduous journey. That journey began with the small step of a well-watched pot that belongs to his mother.
