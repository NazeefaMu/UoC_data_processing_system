Battle of the Lagoons on July 30
Hands across two rivers way back in 1979 the first ever friendly encounter between Holy Cross College, Kalutara and Maris Stella College Negambo took place at that time both schools were administered by the Marist Brothers. They took over the administration of the College facing the Kalutara lagoon in 1978.
Rev. Bro. Francis Silva who had served in Maris Stella College during yester years and, the first principal of Holy Cross College under the Marist Brothers administration, was instrumental in the birth of the Big Match between the two colleges
From 1995 on wards cricketers of both colleges are starving for a Big Match. During the non-playing era, which is still on course, old boys of both colleges get together to celebrate the Big Match they witnessed/participated all around the world, but an official match is what everyone are eagerly waiting for.
The present old boys unions of both the colleges have got together for the revival of the Battle of the Lagoons by organizing an event named Road to Big Bash with the participation of old boys of both the colleges. This event is organized with the motive of getting together and convince the stakeholders to resume the paused Battle of the Lagoons.
Old boys of both the colleges are warmly welcomed to take part in this memorable and crucial event which will be held on the 30th of July at HCC Grounds, Kalutara. The event consisting of two T20 matches will follow a brotherhood walk starting at 8.00 a.m. from the famous Kalutara clock tower.

LTTE, a terrorist organisation in EU, restrictive measures against it remain
EU further clarifies:
The Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in a release provided further clarification on the EU's designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation following the judgement of the European Court of Justice on 26 July, 2017.
Following is the statement:
On 27 December 2001, the Council of the European Union adopted a legal framework for measures to combat terrorism. These measures include the freezing of the assets of individuals, groups, and entities related to terrorism, whose names are included on a list which is biannually reviewed by the Council of the European Union to ascertain that there are grounds for retaining them on the list.
In 2006, the Council placed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on the list, and has maintained the LTTE on the list ever since.
While the LTTE did not challenge the Council measures by which they were initially listed, they did contest their subsequent retention on the list before the General Court. In its judgement delivered in 2014, the General Court annulled the restrictive measures concerning the LTTE due to procedural shortcomings. However, the General Court decided to maintain (until the conclusion of any appeal) the effects of the annulled measures in order to ensure the effectiveness of any possible future freezing of funds. The 2014 judgement was appealed by the Council of the European Union at the European Court of Justice.
The Court of Justice found that the Council failed to explain why it believed the LTTE still had the intention to continue terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka despite the LTTE's military defeat in 2009. In the judgement issued on 26 July 2017, the European Court of Justice therefore confirmed the annulment of the continued freezing of the LTTEs funds between 2011 and 2015. The judgement only applies to this specific period of time.
These same funds remain frozen as a result of the two most recent reviews by the Council which took place in July 2016 and January 2017. Any future review must take into account the judgement of the Court of Justice issued on 26 July 2017.
At present, however, the LTTE remains designated as a terrorist organisation in the European Union (EU), and the EU's restrictive measures against the LTTE remain in force.

No one can harass people through TU action
No one can be allowed to harass people and hamper their day today life through trade union action, Minister S. B. Dissanayaka said
Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said the elected government is duty bound to restore the normal lifestyle of the people and to protect them from being harassed.
The minister was addressing the media on Thursday at the SLFP headquarters with Minister Laksman Senevirathne.
He added that the public should come forward against those who are harassing people and against unjustifiable trade union actions such as the trade union action of certain employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The TU action of CPC is unethical and unjustifiable as this government never sells State properties like the previous regime.
It was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who sold State properties to foreign countries outright. A six acre land, in which the Army Headquarters was functioning in front of Galle Face Green, was sold out for a hotel project for a foreign company. A 240-acre land of the proposed Commercial City Project was handed over to the Chinese company by him without revealing the agreement to anyone. No one knew anything about those outright agreements. Even the Cabinet didnt know anything about the transactions as Rajapaksa didnt reveal it even to the Cabinet. Everything was done secretly. But the persons who make a huge cry over selling State land did not dare to say a single word against Rajapksas outright land sales, he added.
According to the Minister, the government has taken measure to have the best agreement for the country with regard to the Hambantota Port leasing out agreement. With the Hambantota Port agreement, the area will be subjected to rapid development including the Hambantota International Airport.
Speaking on the forthcoming Local Government elections, the Minister said the process of selecting all SLFP candidates will be completed within the next two weeks. Out of the 160 seats, candidates for 100 seats have been selected by now.
When questioned whether he can be satisfied with the investigation into the Treasury bond scam, Minister Dissanayake said he is happy with the way investigations are carried out. Investigations are being carried out impartially and all responsible persons for the scam will have to face justice.
It was observed that certain persons tried to hamper the investigations into the Treasury bond issue until the President appointed a Presidential Commission to inquire into it, Minister Dissanayake said.
Minister Senavirathne said the investigations have come to a crucial stage now and legal action will be taken against responsible persons.
The impartial investigation, which is being carried out now is also a victory of the people. If this government was not in power, it is certain that there would have been no investigation into the bond scam, Minister Senavirathne said.
Minister Dissanayake added that Rajapaksa should not try to destroy the SLFP.
Rajapaksa after giving the Chairmanship of the SLFP to present Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena, should not pull by the present Chairmans leg, he said.

No significant impact of Dengue Vaccination during ongoing outbreak
The Dengue Vaccination (CYDTDV Dengvaxia) is not expected to have a significant impact during the course of an ongoing outbreak, World Health Organization Representative to Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said.
Addressing a Media Workshop on Dengue Prevention, Control and Management organised by the WHO and the Health Ministry held at the Government Information Department Auditorium on Thursday, she said countries should consider the introduction of CYD-TDV only in geographic settings (national or sub national) where epidemiological data indicate a high burden of disease.
Zero prevalence should be approximately 70 percent or greater in the age group targeted for vaccination,Dr.Pendse said. According to Dr. Pendse, the vaccine is not recommended when zero prevalence is below 50 percent in the age group targeted for vaccination. Dengue vaccine introduction should be a part of a comprehensive dengue control strategy, including well-executed and sustained vector control, evidence-based best practices for clinical care for all patients with dengue illness, and strong dengue surveillance.

Rejected leaders attempting to gain power by fuelling flames of racism
The leaders who were rejected by the people are now fuelling the flames of racism and attempting to regain power somehow or other by indulging themselves in unruly acts that would not be tolerated by the people, said State Minister of Fisheries Dilip Vedaarachchi.
He was addressing a Dahamhamuwa at the Bodirukkarama Viharaya in Agunakolapelessa, recently. The foundation stone was laid for the construction of a shrine room at the temple premises. The people now live in peace and harmony because there is no fear psychosis or the white van culture, he said.
The minister said the Rajapaksa family earned fortunes in an unruly manner, while plundering the wealth of the less fortunate people of the country.
The opposition rejected by the people now spread false stories to mislead the people, but the people who are aware of what the Rajapaksa regime did, will not be misled or deceived by such utterances. The Minister said the locking up of the tills in temples was done from time immemorial, but the Opposition is trying to gain political mileage from this. The State Minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa is now in the custody of the Joint Opposition.
The members of the Joint Opposition are aware that they are unable to gain a place in politics without his support.

Agreement signed today: Billion dollar investment salvages Hambantota
More positive,stable out look for economy projected :
Would greatly help reduce countrys debt burden :
The government will enter into a billion-dollar partnership with a state-owned Chinese company today to revive the loss-making Hambantota port, the Prime Minister announced as the opposition ditched a debate on the issue.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government would conclude the agreement today on the $1.1 billion deal with China Merchants Port Holdings to jointly manage the port which had become a huge burden on the economy.
Cash from the Chinese firms majority stake will be used to repay part of Sri Lankas huge foreign debt, the Prime Minister said.
He accused members of the Joint Opposition of scuttling a parliamentary debate the government offered on the deal that involves the transfer of a 70 percent stake to the Chinese firm on a 99-year lease. We tried to get them into a debate.
They (the JO) did not make use of the opportunity we gave them in parliament to talk about it, The Prime Minister said. But, how can they oppose this.
At the adjournment time (of parliament) the Opposition was disruptive, the Speaker asked them to go and sit. They did not go and sit, so the adjournment took place.
Let us face the facts. How can they (the JO) go and oppose this Hambantota deal. How can they oppose it. Who signed it We are giving the country a better deal without debt. Without any implications of security, he said.
The Prime Minister made it clear that the former Rajapaksa regime was planning to hand over the Hambantota port on a platter to the Chinese as the government was unable to repay the huge debt.
The Prime Minister said the Hambantota port had accumulated a loss of Rs 46.7 billion since 2011. This money could have been better spent on education.
He said the government will also arrange an investor for another white elephant project of the former president, the Mattala airport, by the end of this year.
We can find a partner for the Mattala airport by the end of this year, but I have bad news for you, he said. There are no takers for the Sooriyawewa cricket grounds and tax payers will have to pay for its upkeep.
He noted that the previous government had borrowed $1.5 billion to build the port, but the Chinese valued it at much less and around $1.4 billion.Asked why there was such a discrepancy, the Prime Minister said: That is the 1.5 billion dollar question! The government has already announced that the Sri Lanka Navy will be responsible for the security of the port and no foreign navy will be allowed to use it as a base.
The Prime Minister also announced that the government expects between two to three billion dollars in foreign direct investments in the next two years and much of it will come from China, India and Japan.

AG's panel objects to submission by Mahendran's lawyer
The Attorney General's panel assisting the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday, objected to a submission made by Arjun Mahendran's lawyer.
Mahendran's lawyer Chanaka de Silva yesterday, sought permission from the Commission to allow a representative be present when data is derived from Mahendran's mobile phone for a forensic digital examination.
Mahendran handed over two mobile phones on July 26, 2017 to the PCoI. The surrendered mobile phones are kept under seal until they were to be examined by a team with forensic expertise.
De Silva also requested the Commission to provide a copy of the derived data to him.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, said there is a process established by law when conducting investigations as these. He pointed out that even though there is no written law as such, the suspects or their representatives could not be present when data is derived from their digital communication devices.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out that there were international best practises followed when such an investigation is done. He said it is for the first time in Sri Lanka that such an investigation is done.
ASG Kodagoda also pointed out that the investigators did not like to use the highly sophisticated technologies and tools "in front of the public and certainly not in front of fraudsters."
Commissioner Justice P. S. Jayawardena told said the Commission understands that the investigation was invading the privacy of the owner of the mobile phones and said the Commission would take the fact in to consideration when issuing an order regarding the submission made by De Silva.
The Commission also requested ASG Kodagoda to provide with international best practises followed by the investigators when conducting a digital forensic examination.

Sri Lanka will play India twice this year when they make a tour to India in November-December.
Currently India is involved in a series of three Tests, 5 ODIs and a one-off T20 in Sri Lanka.
The tour is expected to end on September 6 after which Sri Lanka is due to undertake a tour to UAE where they play Pakistan in a series of 2 Tests, 5 ODIs and 3 T20Is in September-October.
Following this tour will be the one to India in November-December where Sri Lanka are billed to play a similar series of three Tests, 5 ODIs and a T20I.
The Sri Lanka tour to India has been brought forward from February next year because we are hosting the tri-nation Independence Cup during that period, said Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley de Silva.
Sri Lanka was due to tour India from February end to the first week of April next year and the dates would have clashed with the Independence Cup. Thats why we requested the India Board for a change to bring the tour forward and they have agreed to it, said De Silva.
The dates for the Pakistan series and the Indian tour are currently being worked out, he said.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka have a full program of Tests and ODIs for 2018 where they are billed to play 13 Tests (both home and away) in addition to a series of ODIs that includes bilateral matches as well as the Independence Cup tri-nation and Asia Cup.

Dhaka: Australias cricket authorities are hopeful that a Bangladesh tour due to start in less than a month will go ahead despite a player rebellion over pay, a senior team official said.
The scheduled two-Test series has been placed in jeopardy by the long-running dispute, which has pitted Australias top cricket stars against the games governing body.
There is obviously a lot of work to be done. But we are hopeful and optimistic that the tour will go ahead, Gavin Dovey, Australia cricket team manager told reporters in the Bangladesh city of Chittagong late Thursday.
The fate of the series depends on the resolution of a revenue sharing deal between Cricket Australia and players. An Australia A tour of South Africa has already been cancelled because of the dispute. Cricket Australia said Thursday it will take the bitter row to independent arbitration if an agreement cannot be reached by early next week.
Dovey made his remarks at the end of a four-day tour by a Cricket Australia team to inspect facilities and security arrangements in the South Asian nation.
The team visited the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong which is to host the second Test from September 4-8. AFP

Awaiting a democratic solution
Democracy is a strange word. How else one can explain the fact that the Democrats in America were against giving full citizen rights to black dwellers in that country. The party advocated westward expansion, greater equality among all white men, and opposition to the equality of all humans.
In 1860 the Civil War began between the mostly-Republican North against the mostly-Democratic, slave-holding South. Abraham Lincoln had to fight against racism; as president he is best remembered for leading the Union through the Civil War and freeing Confederate slaves with the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation; for delivering the Gettysburg Address, the most famous oration in American history, on November 19, 1863. In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision; Chief Justice Roger Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that this ruling would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.
American history
Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats. Lincoln argued, The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended to say all were equal in colour, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity, but they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.
At the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863, the address he made became the most quoted speech in American history. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the world.
World War I
While American history gives that message Russian history emphasizes different aspect of the struggle for democracy.
After overthrow of Czar after a struggle Kerensky assumed power as a democratic leader Provisional Government. Right wing promoted army strong man Kornilov. The major challenge was that Russia was exhausted after three years of its participation in World War I, while the provisional government offered little motivation for a victory outside of continuing Russia's obligations towards its allies.
Russia's continued involvement in the war was not popular among the lower and middle classes, and especially not popular among the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, and now they felt deceived. Furthermore, Lenin and his Bolshevik party were promising peace, land, and bread under a soviet system. The army was disintegrating owing to a lack of discipline, leading to desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.
During the Kornilov right wing uprising, Kerensky had distributed arms to the Petrograd workers, and with their help defeated the conspiracy but failed to consolidate democracy or peace in the country. The threat of the right wing conspiracy was not over. By November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. On October 2526, 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. He was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces. It took fewer than 20 hours for the Bolsheviks to seize the government and defeat right wing conspiracy. Latter established soviet democracy.
In this historical background we have to discuss the emergence of democracy of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe, the fearless leader who signed an agreement with Prabhakaran and dedicatedly searched for an outcome without the disaster of a full-scale war. PM Wickremesinghe is celebrating his 40th year in politics. By now he has become the leader of liberalism combined with social capitalism. This combination of liberal democracy has developed recently influenced by post modernism. He has been influenced by the developments in Germany and Thrudowian Canada.
The problem of liberalism has been exposed by Marxist leaders such as Marx, Lenin and particularly by Trotsky. In the struggle for democracy and social justice there is hardly a separate liberal base in urban society in developing countries like Lanka.
The vacillation of liberal leaders arises due to the lack of stability in the social base. The professional middle class is no substitute as they usually help right wing, dictatorial elements to take power. In this situation it is the duty of the left and workers' leaders to intervene positively to carry out the tasks of democratic revolution. Strangely enough, during the Second World War it was Winston Churchill who countered the vacillations of liberalism of conservative leaders and mobilized masses against fascism of Hitler.
Second World War
Churchill was not a leftist of any kind and he was thrown into wilderness during the 1930's because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of King Edward. However Churchill took the lead in warning about fascist Hitler and in campaigning for rearmament. He understood the nature of fascism better than Chamberlin. On September 3, 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany following the outbreak of the Second World War, Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, the same position he had held during the first part of the First World War. As such he was a member of Chamberlain's small War Cabinet. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 194041 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Hitlers fascism. Later he led Britain as Prime Minister until after the German surrender in 1945.
In July 1945, after Germany had surrendered but not Japan, Britain held its first general election in a decade. To the surprise of many, Churchills Conservative Party lost in a landslide, having been successfully portrayed by the Labour Party as anti-worker and anti-welfare. But his seat he won defeating combine opposition candidate. They have a perfect right to kick us out, he purportedly said upon hearing the news. That is democracy. That is what we have been fighting for. He returned to the premiership in 1951, remaining there until ill health induced him to resign three-and-a-half years later.
Mahinda camp believes that the turning point has come! Apparently they were waiting for the day to show their might in mass unrest. Criminal attraction created by anti SAITM, Polpot gode socialist attacks made by the student movement and misguided trade unions are the treasures of the Mahinda fascistic campaign. These are bogus affairs from top to bottom. May be it is a display attractive only to the miserable and marginalized. However, the fascistic Joint Opposition was partially successful in political and psychological terms when it used media to make people believe that it succeeded in ensuring large scale break down in the day-to-day affairs. Fascistic politics are not based on reality. Hence they are happy, so their programme is implemented. Recently they have increased many fold the sabotage actions.
Yahapalana government
Unfortunately, leaders of Yahapalana government including PM Wickremesinghe, are undisturbed about the negative development taking place. The recent handling of strikes and student unrest has of course improved the image of leaders. Some say Ranil Wickremesinghe is over confident and dismisses Mahinda group activities as primitive politics rejected by civilized humans.
However Polpot socialist youth, campaign against what they called Indian expansionist actions. Two controversial matters currently being negotiated between the two countries are the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the Trincomalee harbour project that revolves around the lease of oil tanks. While conscious workers understand that if properly handled ETCA could be helpful to expand the job opportunities and open the Indian market for our goods, there has generated a formidable opposition amongst sections of the local business community and professionals. The general belief is that medical doctors of the government Medical Doctors Association is opposing because they fear that they will not be able to withstand Indian competition.
With 40 years experience can PM Wickremesinghe go beyond historical impediments to implement a democratic solution to the ills of the country

Breeding mosquitoes for dengue control still at research level
Breeding of dengue mosquitoes through a biological method to control dengue is still at research level. It will take another two to five years to obtain successful results, World Health Organization Representative to Sri Lanka Dr Razia Pendse said.
Addressing the Media Workshop on Dengue Prevention, Control and Management organized by the WHO and the Health Ministry at the Government Information Department Auditorium, she said dengue is an issue of national concern in Sri Lanka. A societal approach is needed to tackle dengue. Every individual needs to contribute to arrest dengue upswing. The WHO implements the global strategy for dengue prevention and control from 2002 to 2020.
According to Dr. Pendse, protecting against mosquito bite, vector prevention and control, and timely medical care are currently the only effective measures against dengue. There are no drugs yet to treat dengue. The treatment being provided seeks to address dengue symptoms and complications. With climate change, more frequent and larger outbreaks of dengue are being experienced globally. This trend can and must be arrested with enhanced vector control and personal protection practices.
Dr. B. N. Nagpal said there are certain issues when it comes to controlling dengue in Sri Lanka. For example, if a person is dengue infected through a dengue mosquito bite that takes place at the Government Information Department Auditorium, the health authorities would go to his/her home located 30 kilometres away from the Government Information Department Auditorium and fumigate the whole area. The dengue mosquito flies about 500 metres. Water tanks located on roof tops need to be cleaned thoroughly and regularly. The eggs of dengue mosquitoes survive for 400 days in dry condition.
Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Dengue Control Unit Dr. Nirmala Pannilahetti said a total of 301 dengue deaths and 110,372 dengue patients are reported from all parts of the country by Thursday. Dengue mosquitoes breed in places located inside construction sites, religious institutions and schools. Around 40 percent of dengue mosquitoes breed inside discarded items.

Brendon McCullum stars in Middlesex win
LONDON: Kent earned a first win in four T20 Blast matches, beating Somerset by seven wickets in a rain-affected game.
Sam Northeast's unbeaten 54 guided his side to a revised target of 181 off 18 overs after Somerset made 197-6.
Middlesex moved off the bottom of the South Group, ex-New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum smashing 63 from 28 balls to help beat Essex by 72 runs.
In the North Group, Northants easily passed Worcestershire's 158 all out to earn a seven-wicket win.
Brett D'Oliveira (52) was the mainstay of a below-par Rapids total, in which seven players failed to reach double figures, with Richard Gleeson (3-12) and Rory Kleinveldt (3-25) doing the damage with the ball.
Reigning T20 champions Northants scored 160-3 to earn a third win in four matches and go second in the table.
Openers Richard Levi (47) and Adam Rossington (42) ensured a blistering start and Alex Wakely's unbeaten 46 got the Steelbacks over the line with 14 balls left.
Middlesex had no shortage of leaders as they batted Essex out of the game on their way to a total of 203-6 and a crushing 72-run win over Essex Eagles.
T20 Blast skipper McCullum was at his destructive best, reaching his half-century off just 19 balls and scoring 54 of his 63 runs from boundaries.
England ODI and T20 captain Eoin Morgan added a more considered 39 from 30, while wicketkeeper John Simpson (50) also made a half-century.
Pace bowler Tom Helm then took 5-11 from just 20 balls as Essex were all out for 131, with James Foster's 25-ball 50 the only show of resistance in a lacklustre reply.
The result takes Middlesex up to fourth in the table, with Essex dropping to bottom spot.

Call for disciplinary action against Jayaratne, Aluthgamage
The Government members called on Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take disciplinary action against Joint Opposition MPs Priyankara Jayaratne and Mahindananda Aluthgamage for ridiculing Parliament following its adjournment.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera came up with this request during a hurried convened press conference at the Parliamentary complex to explain the Governments position on the confusion reigned in Parliament yesterday morning.
Back to back press conferences were held called in Parliament yesterday by the Joint Opposition, JVP, Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala and the Government. The press conference called by the Government was attended by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella, Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake and Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera.
MP Priyankara Jayaratne sat on the Speakers chair and unofficially presided a session after the House was adjourned. The JO agitated in the House at a previous time demanding to take action against a Parliament employee who reportedly sat on the Speakers chair. MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage sat on the seat allocated for the Parliament Secretary General and rang the Quorum bell summoning the members in. The Speaker should take disciplinary action against the JO MPs who purposefully ridiculed Parliament. Insulting Parliament means insulting the people, the Deputy Minister said.
He said the Government members would make a formal complaint to the Speaker in this regard requesting an inquiry.
Speaking to the media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said the JO ran away from the debate facilitated by the Government on the Hambantota port draft concession agreement. We facilitated the debate as per the Presidents direction to get the views and constructive criticism of the Opposition to the draft agreement. We were well prepared for the debate. The JO deliberately disrupted it knowing that their shady deals behind the construction of Hambantota port would come out during the course of it, he said.
Responding to a question by a journalist Minister Kiriella said the resolution with regard to the Gazette extraordinary issued by the President declaring supply and distribution of fuel as essential services was duly passed in Parliament. Having the Mace inside Parliament is enough to pass legislation. It needs not necessarily be at the bracket. We did nothing contrary to Standing Orders. The Deputy Sergeant-at-arms held it because the JO MPs tried to grab it and run, the minister explained.

Canada Court rules not guilty
Sri Lankan men accused of human smuggling:
A British Columbia (B.C.) Supreme Court judge has acquitted four Sri Lankan men on charges of human smuggling in relation to the arrival of 76 Tamil migrants on the MV Ocean Lady ship nearly nine years ago to Canada.
The ramshackle vessel traveled across the Pacific Ocean for an estimated 45 days before it arrived in B.C. in October of 2009.
Four people aboard  Francis Appulonappa, Hamalraj Handasamy, Jeyachandran Kanagarajah and Vignarajah Thevarajah  were charged with human smuggling. On Thursday, Justice Arne Silverman found all of them not guilty.
"I am satisfied that the sole motive that each of them had was, through mutual aid, to get themselves to Canada," said Justice Silverman in his 57-page decision.
Crown lawyers tried to argue that the men orchestrated the voyage to make a profit, claiming they collected money from passengers. Justice Silverman said there was not enough evidence to prove that. "While there is evidence of organized crime, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the activities of any of these four accused were connected to it."
Lawyers for the men used the argument of what's called "mutual assistance" in their defence of the charges of human smuggling.
That defence arose out of a Supreme Court of Canada judgment that ruled the country's human smuggling laws were too broad.
The court found that two sections of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act do not apply to some people who help refugee claimants reach Canada.
"Those people who are seeking asylum, those people who are assisting their families or those people that who are mutually assisting one another to seek asylum, you cannot convict those people of human smuggling. That's an exemption that the court created," said Phil Rankin, lawyer for Jeyachandran Kanagarajah, one of the four men accused.
That defense was used in the case of the MV Sun Sea, where four men were charged with human smuggling for bringing 492 Sri Lankan migrants to B.C.'s coast in 2010. Lesly Emmanuel, Nadarajah Mahendran and Thampeernayagam Rajaratnam were acquitted by a jury after their lawyers argued they had acted on humanitarian grounds or had been misidentified.

Chaos reigns in HOUSE: JO members storm well
Parliament sittings came to an abrupt end at 11.45 am yesterday as chaos reigned in Parliament when the Joint Opposition members swarmed the well of the house following a heated argument with government side members.
This is with the announcement to take the vote on the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act on making fuel distribution an essential service.
The arguments flared up as the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya called for a voting as a member was heard requesting for a division although it was not clear as to who made the request.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned sittings till August 4 as the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the Mace for protection as Joint Opposition members stood around the mace.
However government side members said Aye to pass the resolution before Parliament sittings adjourned.
At this occasion Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake rose to his feet and said the debate was adjourned the previous day as there were two government side members to make statements on the resolution.
We want a clear statement from the government as to what government do in connection with the attack on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC) workers on Wednesday, Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Here are the pictures of attackers.What do you do to the Welikada OIC who assaulted a Provincial Council member The Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister should make a statement, he said.
Joint Opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said the government should respond to questions raised by the Opposition. Thereafter joint opposition members were seen coming into the well and walking towards the Speakers bench. Then Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asked if Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake will make a statement. The minister said that he would make a statement after the investigation was over. The Speaker then requested to calm down. Please cooperate to continue proceedings the Speaker said. You should not waste time and public funds. The division is asked for so the vote should be taken now.
The quorum bell was rung and during the bell was being rung the argument continued.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who joined the cross talk insisted that no statements could be made when a vote is called for. This will set a bad precedence.We cant allow it,he said.

Is Chris Froome Britain's least loved great sportsman
Bearing in mind that it took 110 years for the first Briton to win a Tour de France, you'd expect the man who then wins four of the next five to be one of the most loved and admired sportsmen of this or any other era.
There is no fluking a yellow jersey. Three weeks of physical attrition, of relentless mental calculations and stress, of staying ahead of a shifting mass of rivals ganging up to unseat you, of managing egos and efforts within your own team, of high mountains and cruel cross-winds.
And yet when Chris Froome won his third Tour last year, having run up Mont Ventoux in his cleats on his way to victory, he failed to even make the 16-strong shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year.
In case you want to blame the host broadcaster, it is worth remembering that in addition to the three BBC representatives on the selection panel there were former sporting greats Ryan Giggs, Victoria Pendleton and Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson; sports presenter Ore Oduba, writers Amy Lawrence and Liz Nicholl, chief executive of UK Sport; David James (sports editor of the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People), Adam Sills (sports editor of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph) and the Mail on Sunday's Alison Kervin.
That is a pretty wide cross-section of the sport-obsessed. It was also in an Olympic and Paralympic year. But 2015, when Froome became the first Briton to win the Tour twice, was not. He still came seventh in the eventual public vote, with just 3.86% of the total votes cast.
In 2013 he finished sixth with 5.2% of the vote. This after a five-year period when British male cyclists - Chris Hoy, Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins - had won SPOTY three times between them.
Froome is not a man to bemoan his lot. Yet as he rides into Paris in yellow once again, having survived multiple challenges in one of the most competitive and ferocious Tours in memory, you could forgive him wondering what else he must do to be as cherished as some who have achieved significantly less.
There was certainly a shadow cast at the start of his reign by the success of Wiggins, the Neil Armstrong to his Buzz Aldrin. The second man on the moon will never enjoy the instinctive adoration as the first. There was the perception too, unfair though it may have been, that on the stage to La Toussuire during Wiggins' coronation in 2012, Froome had at least considered regicide if not tried to commit it.
It explains a slow start to his dance with the British public. But now, when his own Tour deeds have thrown Wiggins' achievements into stark relief, when the revelations about his former team-mate's therapeutic use exemptions have made some place a mental asterisk next to his win Only four other men in history have won three yellow jerseys in a row before. Each of them is a giant of the sport: Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Miguel Indurain. Only the last three of them and Bernard Hinault have won four or more in total. If you do not appreciate Froome now, you probably never will. If the Champs-Elysees this Sunday doesn't make you relish what he has done and sense it in its proper context, you may also be missing out.
"Just to complete the Tour is hard enough," says Geraint Thomas, his team-mate first at Barloworld almost a decade ago and with Sky in the garlanded years since.
"Just to physically get round 3,000-odd kilometres of mountains, sprints, wind and rain, the pressure you're under - you have to be on top of your game to get through it. To win it takes a whole new level, and to win it multiple times, year in, year out hitting that same level, is super impressive.
"The training to even get there is full-on. Chris lives and breathes it from November all the way through to the following October. There is a lot of time away from his young family, a lot of training camps, on top of a volcano in Tenerife, hour after hour of hard graft.
"And it's not just the training - it's living the right way. The mental discipline is just as hard as the physical work. I do the training and I enjoy it. That's the easy part.
"It's when you're at home and you're starving hungry and you want to pig out but can't, when tea is quinoa rather than the massive pizza you'd really like. You go out with your partner and she will have a glass of wine or a dessert, or she orders a steak and you have to settle for a piece of steamed fish. Chris lives like that throughout the year."
Wiggins was a great stylist on his bike, smooth on the pedals, a track rider's instinctive handling skills. Froome is all elbows and effort, grimacing up mountains, descending like the last few frames before an almighty pile-up.
If that has kept the aesthetes cool towards him, the struggling amateurs can understand both the determination and the improvement it has brought. Wiggins could be wonderful company for his team-mates, but he could also be moody and introverted. Froome has grown into the role of team alpha male, learning from his predecessor, managing all the messy stuff that comes with the leader's jersey.
"Being in yellow takes at least half an hour away from your recovery every day," says Thomas, who spent four days on top of the GC standings this month.
"You finish the stage, you try to do your warm-down, then it's on to the podium, and that's the good bit. Then you have to do TV and radio, and you get asked the same two questions 15 times, which gets quite monotonous when you're already so tired.
"You then speak to the print media, you go into another press conference, and then doping control. If you can get the job done in doping control you can be in and out in 10 minutes. If it's been a hot day and you're dehydrated, you can be in there for an hour. All the other guys will be straight onto the team bus to do their warm-down, get some food down them and put their feet up.
"You get booed a lot. And it can be intimidating on those mountain roads. It's not like football, when the spectators can abuse you but not actually touch you. On those big climbs on the open roads, you never know. They could hit you; riders in our team have been punched before. It's another challenge."
Froome is restrained in his public utterances, polite rather than extrovert. But he is no cycling robot. There is a back story which should both amaze and endear: growing up in Kenya with rock pythons for pets, spending long weeks in a small corrugated iron hut, with no running water and only a long-drop toilet, in a small village high in the red-dirt hills of Kenya's Rift Valley, the only white kid for miles around; getting knocked off by his own mother in his first race, aged 13; entering himself in his first world championships after borrowing the email account of the head of Kenyan cycling.
There is quirk and there is humour. Thomas tells a story from the pair's younger days when they were preparing for the national championships by staying at his girlfriend's parents' house.
Two nights before the race, Froome insisted on making everyone a potent Kenyan cocktail called a dawa. Except the ones he made for his team-mate were both more numerous and significantly stronger. He ended up beating his host by 10 enfeebled seconds.
There was also an engaging naivety. "Sometimes he had no idea about other riders," remembers Thomas.
"'Who was that guy He looked strong today.' 'Yeah mate, that was Nibali. Only someone who's won every Grand Tour there is to win'
"He's still like that now. Someone can switch teams and it will fool him. 'Who's that in the Trek jersey He's quick!' 'Mate, that's Contador'"
Sky's organisational and ethical struggles since the first revelations 10 months ago about Wiggins' use of the corticosteroid triamcinolone have both damaged the brand and leaked into the image of its other riders, no matter how removed from it some were. Froome too will always have the unconverted in his congregation, unwilling to accept his improvement over the past seven years nor the explanation that blood parasite bilharzia was to blame for his previous inconsistencies.
Then there is how British or not he is perceived to be, born in Nairobi, schooled in South Africa, resident now in Monaco, although it is not a unique story; Wiggins was born in Belgium to an Australian father, former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss spent his early years in Johannesburg and England rugby union captain Dylan Hartley was born and raised in Rotorua, New Zealand. Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton also live in Monaco. "I'd lived in Kenya but I didn't feel Kenyan," Froome told me after his first Tour win. "I'm British, with a British passport from birth."
English cricketing darlings Colin Cowdrey and Ted Dexter were born in Bangalore and Milan respectively. The first man to win a medal for Great Britain at a modern Olympics, way back in 1896, was Charles Gmelin, born in Krishnagar, India. Terry Butcher, the epitome of blood-soaked, badge-kissing Englishness, was born in Singapore.
You can pick your own path through that debate. What is unarguable is the manner in which Froome has won his Tours - with a solo attack at the top of Ventoux, with an ambush attack on the descent of the Col de Peyresourde, with an audacious uphill escape at the end of stage 14 this time around, having also ridden through picnics and survived a broken rear wheel.
Two years ago he had urine thrown at him by one spectator. He has been spat on. On this Tour he was jeered by partisan supporters of home favourite Romain Bardet. His composure has survived all that, with even French journalists who were charmed enough by Wiggins to dub him "Le Gentleman" coming round from acceptance to admiration.
"Cav is like the Muhammad Ali of cycling," says Thomas. "He's so close to Merckx's record for stage wins at the Tour.
"Brad had so much variety in all he achieved, Sir Chris did things no British rider had ever done before. It's so hard to compare across the different disciplines, but Froomey is right up there with them. He's not behind any of them."  BBC

Dilruwan puts rest of Lankan batting to shame
India leads overall by 498 runs with two days play remaining :
GALLE: Dilruwan Perera was picked in the Sri Lanka team for the ongoing first Test against India as the second spinner to Rangana Herath. There was no doubt that he could also bat and chip with some useful scores as his Test and first-class batting records indicate.
Yesterday at the Galle International Stadium Perera put to shame the Lankan top order batting by scoring a flawless 92 not out off 132 balls with four sixes and 10 fours. He deserved a century for his gutsy batting display but unfortunately he ran short of partners. It was the second time he had missed out on scoring a maiden Test hundred. He was dismissed for 95 on his Test debut against Pakistan at Sharjah in 2014.
Thanks to Pereras durable knock Sri Lanka replying to India massive score of 600, made 291. It was still a good distance away but the way Perera batted in the middle the Indians didnt want to take a chance and enforce the follow-on although they enjoyed a lead of 309.
Despite an interruption for rain that brought the tea interval forward only 6.3 overs were lost for the day and India extended their overall lead to 498 by finishing on 189 for three wickets with first innings failures Abhinav Mukund and Virat Kohli each scoring fifties. The ease with which they got about scoring their runs was further proof of how easy the pitch was playing.
Mukund was dismissed shortly before the close for 88 trapped lbw to give debutant Danushka Gunathilaka his maiden Test wicket. Kohli who figured in a 133-run stand with Mukund was unbeaten on 76.
The Lankan batsmen could learn a thing or two from Perera, the top scorer in the innings the way he batted against Indias pace cum spin attack on a pitch that is still good for batting. Perera was not afraid to come down the track to the spinners and smite them over and he also played the short ball quite comfortably pulling and cutting with aplomb.
When Sri Lanka resumed yesterday at 154-5 a lot depended on former captain Angelo Mathews who was the last of the recognised batsmen. He managed to take his score from 54 to 83 before being dismissed shortly before the first drinks break for the day. At that point it looked as good as over for Sri Lanka with only the tail to come and already one batsman short with Asela Gunaratne being ruled out of the series.
However Sri Lanka found an unlikely protagonist in Perera who was not out 55 at Mathews dismissal at 205. He took it upon himself to score as many runs for his team with the aid of the tail and when the last wicket fell that of Lahiru Kumara soon after lunch, Perera was left unconquered on 92. His daring innings was applauded by the Indian players which gave an indication of its value to his side.
The nearest Perera came to be dismissed was at 38 when he looked to all appearances done and dusted when a ball from Ravinda Jadeja struck him on the front pad and the umpire also thought so and gave him out. But Perera had the common sense to review the decision and to everyones surprise he survived the appeal as the ball tracker showed the ball bounce clearly over the middle stump. Perera didnt need a second chance to get down to business and show who was boss.
The wily left-arm spin of Jadeja accounted for three of the four wickets to fall yesterday with debutant Hardik Pandya picking up the fourth which happened to be his first Test wicket when he got through the defences of Nuwan Pradeep.
Sri Lanka already down to 10 batsmen without the services of Gunaratne suffered another jolt when Rangana Herath, the captain had to leave the field after hurting the middle finger of his bowling hand trying to stop a powerful Kohli drive at extra cover.

## Title: A future sans fossil fuel

A future sans fossil fuel
All over Sri Lanka, while drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles were languishing for hours in long queues near filling stations, electric car owners were seen driving by with a smile. This may seem to be a simple observation, but the reality should hit us hard  the world is going to run out of fossil fuel possibly within the next 100 years and we should move on to alternatives.
While we spend a staggering US$ 6 billion a year to import oil and debate about a fuel workers strike, other countries are already thinking 20-30 years ahead, to a future sans diesel and petrol vehicles. Both UK and France plan to ban sales of all diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040. The objective is two-fold  save on fossil fuels and ensure better air quality as electric and fuel cell cars are non-polluting.
In addition to the diesel and petrol ban, the proposal will include a fund to help local councils reduce emissions through measures such as retrofitting buses, reprogramming traffic lights, and changing road layouts. Similar programmes are under consideration in the Netherlands and Germany.
The air quality in Sri Lanka is not so bad yet, but we are getting there as more vehicles enter the roads every day. But in the long term, we should be even more concerned about the fuel issue. The time to think is now. Do we spend more and more every year on fossil fuel or do we move into alternative sources of energy, both for vehicles and electricity generation The choice is crystal clear.
But our problem is living by the day, without pondering on the future. The year 2040 is less than 25 years away  but do we have an energy policy which looks just 25 years into the future The simple answer is no. Tax and duty policies on hybrid and electric vehicles have fluctuated so wildly over the last 10 years that most people are actually reluctant to put down money on importing such a car. We should have clear cut policies on the import of hybrid and electric cars that will not change at least for the next five years. This will boost the confidence of buyers. The manufacture, import and use of hybrids and electrics should be encouraged as a means of saving on fossil fuels.
There is a concern that having more all-electric cars on our roads would actually work negatively, because these are charged off the national grid, which in turn depends mostly on fossil fuel. This happens to be true. Hence the decision to increase the taxes and duties on all-electric cars. This is why we have to think of moving away from fossil fuels for electricity generation by focusing on renewable energy options such as wind and solar. Sri Lanka is located in an ideal position for both these types of renewable energy. The Governments recent announcements on new solar and wind power plants are therefore encouraging.
In the meantime, the Government should consider tax and duty waivers for solar powered charging units for electric cars at least until the renewable energy component of the national grid reaches 30-40 percent. Most electric car batteries will soon be able to light up a whole house once the car is parked overnight in the garage, thereby lessening the burden on the national grid. There should be a gradual decrease in duties on electric cars and hydrogen fuel cell cars (the latter will be commonplace 15 years from now). Just imagine the fuel savings if at least 30 percent of the vehicles on the roads were hybrids and electrics. It is also vital to plan for a public transport fleet that runs on alternative fuels and entices the motorists to come on board.
If you scanned the fuel queues carefully, it was very obvious that three wheelers dominated them. This newspaper has time and again called for the gradual phasing out of this fundamentally unsafe vehicle by at least 2030. After all, three wheelers are responsible for, or involved in, the majority of accidents reported countrywide.
From a purely political viewpoint any move to limit three wheelers may be unpopular, but the three wheeler market is already saturated with over 1.2 million in circulation. The best alternative is to slash duties on sub-1,000 CC cars and increase duties on three wheelers to the point where buying one is simply not worth it. We need a safe, reliable taxi service in Colombo and elsewhere, but the tuk-tuk is simply not an option as the Government moves ahead with the Megapolis plan.
We also need to move on with the times. Driverless and intelligent cars are coming and we should be ready for them. Some cars already have limited autonomous driving functions. In the near future, cars will be able to interact with road signs, traffic lights and with each other which will help reduce accidents and smoothen the traffic flow. The future is already happening in this sphere and the time has come to plan ahead.

Global Logistics CFO says Karunanayakes purchased Monarch penthouse
Chairman's money kept in company safe paid bank loan instalments:
ASG Kodagoda shocked GLTC keeps Rs 75 mn in company safe:
Seylan Bank loans Rs.150 million to be paid in 15 installments:
The Chief Financial Officer of Global Logistics and Transportation B.H.J.Sinnaiah summoned to the Treasury Bond Commission testified regarding a loan facility taken by his company to purchase a penthouse on behalf of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Evidence was led on a previous day regarding a penthouse of 4000 squarefeet rented by the former Perpetual Treasuries CEO Arjun Aloysius on behalf of Minister Karunanayakes family, spending Rs.10 million as the lease payment.
The former owner of the said apartment, Muthukudaarachchige Vinodini testified before the PCoI on July 24,2017. According to the evidence given by her, Karunanayakes purchased the said penthouse in the latter part of 2016 through a company named Global Logistics and Transportation Company.
According to evidence led at the Commission yesterday, the Global Logistics and Transportation Company (GLTC) director board includes Chairman T.V. Lakshmikanthan, Mela Karunanayake, Onella Karunanayake and Lakshmi Shankar.
According to Sinnaiah,70% of the company shares is owned by OSM Holdings represented by the two Karunanayakes and the 30% of it is owned by Hampton Group, which is a foreign company represented by the two Lakshmi's who live in Great Britain. Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who was a director of the said company, has stepped down from his post in January 2015 following the appointment as Finance Minister.
Sinnaiah said he received instructions in July 2016 from the two local directors of the GLTC to seek a loan facility to purchase the said penthouse.The two directors are Mela Karunanayake and Onella Karunanayake, the wife and the daughter of Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Sinnaiah also said the GLTC applied for a loan facility from Seylan Bank in the latter part of 2016 to purchase the said penthouse at Monarch residencies in Colpetty.
Following the instructions, Sinnaiah has sent an email to a Seylan Bank Senior Manager requesting a loan facility of Rs. 150 million to be paid in 15 installments. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda read out the email sent by GLTC. According to the email, the GLTC has told Seylan Bank that the penthouse was to be rented out and the repayment of the loan will exclusively be done with the rental income. In previous evidence it was revealed that the said penthouse was purchased for Rs.165 million.
Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked Sinnaiah on what purpose the GLTC purchased the penthouse. Sinnaiah said according to the two local directors, the company was to buy the penthouse for several purposes including to be used when the Chairman and his family or foreign clients of the company visit Sri Lanka.
Sinnaiah said the two Karunanayakes told him that when the above said visitors are not in the country, the penthouse will be given on short term rents.
Commissioner Justice Jayawardena asked if Sinnaiah was aware that the Karunanayake family was occupying the penthouse when the process to purchase the space was initiated. The witness answered in the affirmative. Justice Jayawardena then asked Sinnaiah if any GLTC foreign visitors occupied the purchased apartment. Sinnaiah said when such foreign visitors came they rented out hotel rooms and not the purchased penthouse.
Following this reply, ASG Kodagoda queried whether GLTC mislead Seylan Bank from where the GLTC acquired the loan, stating that the apartment rental money will be used to pay the loan installments.
Even though the witness refused as such, he did not give an explanatory answer to the question.
Eevidence led before the Commission revealed that the loan facility acquired to purchase the Penthouse was paid back using money belonging to GLTC Chairman T.V. Lakshmikanthan.
According to the evidence Lakshmikanthans money, of which the origin is undisclosed, was kept in the GLTCs money safe since February 2016. According to Sinnaiah, GLTC Chairman Lakshmikanthan has visited Sri Lanka twice in February 2016 and February 2017.At both instances, Lakshmikanthan has placed Rs 70 million and Rs 75 million of his personal money in the GLTC money safe.
Justice Jayawardena asked him if the money came in dollars or rupees to which Sinnaiah said he is not aware of the currency.
ASG Kodagoda asked if Sinnaiah issued a receipt after receiving the money.Sinnaiah said he did not, since the money is his Chairmans personal money.Kodagoda said he is shocked by the revelation that a company keeps Rs 70 million in cash, in their money safe. He questioned Sinnaiah as to how big the GLTCs money safe is. Sinnaiah said it is a medium sized safe.
Sinnaiah said even while he was testifying before the PCoI, there is an amount of Rs 50 million in cash in the GLTCs money safe.
ASG Kodagoda observed that there could be a possible instance of money laundering relating to this process of dumping millions of cash into a company safe and went on to say that the GLTCs money safe seems to be a Perpetual Treasury Box. Perpetual Treasuries Limited lawyer Nihal Fernando PC stood up to say the reference to perpetual was unnecessary to which ASG Kodagoda swiftly replied that it is just a Friday afternoon.
The Commission also observed that there were no documents to prove the inflow and the outflow of the said money safe. ASG pointed out without even a scrap of paper of prove, Sinnaiah is unable to support the claim that Lakshmikanthan has placed large sums of money in GLTCs money safe. Kodagoda then went on to ask how exactly, Lakshmikanthan brought Rs 70 million worth cash to the company, while amusing those who were present at the hearing by demonstrating the action of a person carrying a heavy object.
Sinnaiah said his Chairman Lakshmikanthan came to the company on two occasions in February 2016 and February 2017 in a car. He said Lakshmikanthan carried the Rs 70 million and Rs 75 million on the said two occasions in two parcels. Sinnaiah said his Chairman told him to wait further instructions on the money after he kept the money in the safe.
Kodagoda asked If Sinnaiah knows as to how his Chairman earned such large sums of money, to which the witness said his Chairman is a businessman who operates from Britain and owns several businesses.Asked how old Lakshmikanthan is, Sinnaiah said his Chairman is around 70 years.
Answering to ASG Kodagoda as to what followed the purchasing of the Penthouse,Sinnaiah explained how the GLTC paid the installments of the loan taken from Seylan Bank.
The first installment was due on October 2016. The company did not have sufficient funds to pay the installment.So I sought Miss Onella Karunanayakes instructions. She told me that she would talk with the Chairman. Later on she got back to me and said to use Chairmans money kept in the safe to pay the installment, Sinnaiah said.
Sinnaiah said eight installments of the said loan were paid in the same fashion by using their Chairmans money kept in the money-safe.
The PCoI is to sit again on Monday (31).

'Govt. will not suppress trade unions fighting for just demands'
Today the country's people say that they feel that there is a government in the country in the aftermath of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union strike, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He added that people felt that there is a government in power after taking into account the way the Government faced the CPC employees strike effectively. He said so, speaking at a ceremony held at the NARA Institute on Thursday
Amaraweera added that the government would never suppress trade unions or employees fighting for just demands. We are prepared to give an ear to the just demands of trade unions," he added.
He said that the government will not allow attempts of certain elements who are attempting to overthrow the government under the pretext of Trade Union action.
The government could only be overthrown by an election, but not by a coup. No force is allowed to topple this government which came into power through the democratic process, he said.

Govt.'s promise to safeguard rights of masses not put into practice:CTU Gen. Secy.
The general public voted for the establishment of the Yahapalanaya regime to end corruption and safeguard the rights of the people, but not to create a regime similar to the previous regime, said the Ceylon Teachers Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin.
He was speaking at a media briefing at the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU) Hall yesterday, along with several other trade unions to voice against the attack on Petroleum Trade Union members.
Stalin said the Government had come into power with the promise to safeguard the rights of the general public, yet it had not been put into practice. He also said, A country should have sustainable economic policies. Although it does not necessarily imply that a government should prioritise economic objectives of the country over the needs of the general public. Therefore, the leaders of the country have to pay attention to the concerns and demands of the public, prior to the implementation of plans to achieve economic growth.
The General Secretary further alleged that the attack on Petroleum Trade Union members was conducted by the Government.
CMU General Secretary Sylvester Jayakody said that petroleum trade union action had been conducted to protect the resources of the country and not with the aim of satisfying narrow needs such as demanding for higher wages.
Jayakody also stated that continuous trade union action would be conducted islandwide if no equitable solutions be provided immediately by the Government to the prevailing issues related to the petroleum strike.
Delegates from the Ceylon Bank Employees Union, Ceylon Plantation Workers Union, United Workers Union, Government Press Employees Union and Insurance Employees Union also participated.

Hambantota Port agreement: Colombo Port TU Collective welcomes Govt.s decision
Representatives of Colombo Port Trade Unions Collective yesterday said that they are in total agreement with the Governments decision to lease out the Hambantota Port which has become a huge burden to the countrys economy, to a Chinese Company.
The Colombo Port can no longer bare the burden of the Hambantota Port, Sri Lanka Nidahas Sewaka Sangamaya (SLNSS) Secretary Ariyadasa Pathirana said.
The Colombo Port may face a risk of bankruptcy, if the loan instalments of the Hambantota Port are paid by the Colombo Port any further, Pathirana said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he added that the Hambantota Harbour has become a burden not only to the Colombo Port but also to the entire country. The Colombo Port has been settling the loan instalments of the Hambantota port amounting Rs.9.1 billion (Rs. 9,100 million) annually.
"The Hambantota Port, which is not a profit making venture, is not a feasible venture," Pathirana said.
According to him, the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo Port will function under the Colombo Port from August 1. Vehicle transhipment activities, which are presently carried out at the Hambantota Port, has been scheduled to be carried out at the ECT from August 1 with the commencement of its activities.
Asked whether the ECT will be privatised, Pathirana said that the Government authorities including the Ports and Shipping Minister have promised them that the ECT wont be privatised and that it would be developed as a Government entity under the Colombo Port.
The Colombo Port's revenue had seen a drastic drop after the commencing of operations of the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) under a Chinese Company. The CICT was privatised by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Independent Port Trade Union (ITU) Chairman Lal Manawaduge said that the All Ceylon Port General Workers Union (ACPGWU) backed by the JVP urges the Government not to lease out the Hambantota Port levelling baseless allegations about the agreement which is going to be signed.
The ACPGWU, which is making a hue and cry over the Hambantota Port agreement did not utter a single word when former President Rajapaksa handed over the CICT to a Chinese company, Manawaduge added.

High Altitude Sports Complex for Nuwara Eliya
The agreement for the construction of Nuwara Eliya High Altitude Sports Complex was signed yesterday between secretary of the sports ministry Dr. D. M. R. B. Dissanayake and Chairman of Ellips Projects of Prance Picard Oliver at the auditorium of the sports ministry in the presence of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera and Deputy Minister H. M. Harees
Approval for the project has been given by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
It is expected to construct the proposed high altitude sports complex, on a land of 34.5 ht. In extent, located in the City of Nuwara Eliya. A height of 1500-3500 metres (above sea level) is required to build a high-altitude sports ground. . The land on which the proposed high altitude sports ground lies at an altitude of 1895 metres (above sea level).
A high Altitude environment increases the power of endurance in sports persons. Therefore this venue would in particular, increase the power of endurance among those who are engaged in athletics while the sportsmen and women engaged in sports such as Kabadi, Netball, Hockey, Swimming, Cycling, Rugger and Volleyball would find this place an ideal venue. They can also enhance their capacity of endurance. Generally a successful training requires 3 to 6 weeks and when it comes to such training in China or Japan costs 10,000  25,000US$, whereas this cost is 8,500US$, here in Sri Lanka, which would be adequate to cover the cost of training in several sports and on the other hand it would be adequate to cover the cost of training in several sports and on the other hand it would save foreign exchange. We will be able to earn foreign exchange by training athletes.
Not only that, this would cater to the need of an International High Altitude Sports Training Centre for the sake of the athletes in neighbouring countries as well. This position will be ideal for foreigners since they can experience the vividness of the weather within a time as short as 24 hours on the other hand it would as pave way for direct and indirect economic benefits such as generating new sources of income to the economy, employment opportunities to those who are engaged in the field of sports providing short-term job opportunities for people for developing our sports economy.
The estimate cost of this project will be 75,528,700.91 EUROS and they have informed that 100% of this amount would be provided through HSBC by the Ellips Projects SAS. (70% as a foreign loan and 30% as a local loan)

Indratissa raises issue over validity of evidence
Arjun Aloysius' lawyer Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indratissa yesterday suggested that the evidence collected by the Treasury Bond Commission from April 27 to July 27, 2017 was done with no proper authority.
Indratissa PC made these observations at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday (28).
His suggestion was based on the position that President Maithripala Sirisena did not issue a gazette when extending the term of the PCoI on April 27, 2017. He pointed out that there was only a letter issued by the President to extend the Treasury Bond Commissions term on April 27,2017.
Accordingly, Indratissa PC said the evidence collected by the Commission during the said time period could be invalid.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said there is sufficient compliance of Section 4 of the PCoI Act for the President to extend the term of a Commission of Inquiry.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said it is not mandatory for the President to issue a gazette when extending the term of a Commission of Inquiry Act.
According to the Commission of Inquiry Act, the President warranted to extend the time period within which a CoI needs to submit a report on the inquired matter, despite the time for the submission of such report has expired or not.

Its a very slow wicket and it hasnt changed much  Dilruwan
GALLE: Sri Lanka off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who top scored for his team with an immaculate 92 not out thinks the Galle Stadium pitch does not hold any terrors for the batsmen.
Speaking to the media at the end of the third day of the first Test Perera said, I think the pitch is still behaving the same. There isn't too much turn, one or two balls turn but not always. This is not the typical Galle pitch. Even tomorrow, I don't think we can look forward to that much of a turn. However, this wicket is very slow. When the ball was new yesterday, it was turning a bit. When the ball gets older, it's easy to score runs.
Based on Pereras assessment of the pitch Sri Lanka should not find it difficult to bat out the Test in the next two days unless there is a dramatic change to its condition.
India are already 498 in front with seven second innings wickets in hand and will declare sometime today setting Sri Lanka a stiff target. We'll have to look at what the target we're going to get and then take a decision. We shouldn't think of the target but bat the way we can bat. However, we'll have to have a plan on that.
Perera expressed his disappointment of not being able to reach his maiden Test hundred.
It was not just a century but its a Test century so I am very disappointed to be honest. I was trying to get closer as much as possible to score it but I didn't have the opportunity. Indian opener Abhinav Mukund who scored a fluent 81 painted a different picture of the pitch.
There was turn towards the end of the day. There are a couple of balls that are skidding on and going. I think there will be a lot more assistance for Ashwin and Jadeja in the second innings than there was yesterday or today. The wicket is going to assist spin more often than not. Probably by lunch or tea tomorrow, I think there will be a lot more turn.

JO conducts mock Parliamentary session, ridicules Speaker
Joint Opposition(JO) members, who remained in the main Chamber after Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned Parliament, conducted a mock session yesterday ridiculing the Speaker, Parliament and its traditions.
Speaker Jayasuriya abruptly adjourned Parliament following a tense situation created by the Joint Opposition members as they stormed into the well and made a din in the House while the vote on the Gazette Extraordinary proclaiming supply and distribution of fuel an essential service was in progress.
Parliament officials, the Speaker and most of the Government members left the Chamber after the Mace was taken out, but the JO and JVP MPs remained. The Quorum started ringing after about 15 minutes following the adjournment and the media personnel, who were in the press room, rushed back to the Chamber.
As the journalists approached the press gallery, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage invited them to take their seats stating that Parliament is going to resume. Journalists then came to know that the quorum bell had been rung without reason by one of the Parliamentarians inside the Chamber for their amusement.
For a while MP Prasanna Ranatunga was seen seated on the Parliamentary seat reserved for the President, which is next to the Prime Ministers seat.
About 20 JO MPs, several JVP MPs, and few UNP backbenchers were seen in the Chamber.
JO MP Ranjith de Zoysa said aloud that they would have to appoint a new Speaker to resume the sittings.
He proposed the name of MP Priyankara Jayaratne for the post and MP Prasanna Ranaweera seconded it. Jayaratne was escorted to the Speakers chair by MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Rohitha Abeygunawardena as the other JO MPs cheered.
With Jayaratne in the Speakers chair, MP Prasanna Ranaweera made a speech criticising the Government and Speaker. After a while Jayaratne came down to his seat and other JO MPs mocked that the sittings were abruptly suspended. The JO MPs then left the Chamber yelling derisive remarks and slogans against the Speaker and Parliament. The JVP MPs looked on but did not join with the JO.

Football lacks competent officials
Kandy has become a town where the game of football is almost dead and buried. The obvious answer is because they lack competent men to run it. It is said that football was played at Getambe, Nittawela, Podi Bogambara, Police Grounds and the legendary Bogambara Stadium in a big way. In the good old days football was played mainly at Bogambara Stadium when it was under the Municipal Council, and also Police Grounds and University grounds also helped in a big way. Today the biggest problem is that the coaches get involved with the Committee and get into FFSL coaching where they are well paid and they have only coaching programs.

Her efforts are appreciated by all sports- loving ladies in Kandy. Despite the limited facilities, Kandy has continuously produced some of the best netball players. Netball too has a long history in Kandy. It has been suggested that the Kandy Netball Association should get-together and organize a tournament among schools and clubs in the region.

Lance Armstrong is back in cycling, in a way. Still an outcast to the race, instead he has set up a daily podcast recorded from a small office at the end of the garden of his Austin home, and at occasional other venues nearby.
Does Lance Armstrong still deserve a platform in cycling
The 45-year-old is as knowledgeable as youd expect for a veteran of 13 Tours. Topics have ranged widely from criticizing race organizers for ending the Tours Queen stage on a treacherous descent to having a hangover as a result of too much ros wine during his July 4 celebrations.
Fresh off the airwaves of his latest podcast, known as Stages, Armstrong tells CNN: I had two platforms before [his public mea culpa to doping four years ago]: cycling and cancer.
Im not saying its right or wrong but they went overnight, not just the cycling but the cancer. A man with no platform is a lost man.
This is not Armstrongs first podcast. For the past few months, he has had one called The Forward [disassociating himself from the past] in which guests have ranged from the author Malcolm Gladwell to the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre.
But while that has been well received, Armstrong has been blown away both by the listening numbers and the positive feedback of his latest venture over the airwaves, in which he shares the stage with radio host JB Hager.
At the time of speaking to CNN, he was averaging 300,000 listeners a day -- double that of The Forward -- with the numbers rising. Much to the chagrin of the Tour organizers no doubt, it has been something of a hit of the race.
NOT CONCERNED BY NEGATIVITY
Surely with his past doping indiscretions on the bike there has been some negative feedback
The team deal with the emails and Im sure there are plenty of emails that tell me to go f*** yourself, he says.
But Im not overly concerned by the negativity. If someone wants to fire off and make a personal attack, it doesnt affect me. If its a comment on the accuracy of the show then Id try to fix that.
The feedback on Facebook Live, Twitter and Instagrams been good.
Stages is just part of Armstrongs return to cycling. In the months leading up to it, he was getting back on his bike more and more for general fitness, as well as paying closer attention to the professional peloton.
Armstrong lists off some of the comments he has received. I had one saying I didnt want to listen but I did and its good, or you have people saying I shouldnt like it. One guy called it his guilty pleasure.
But the seven-time Tour winner, whose race victories have since been erased from the annals for his doping past, knows his cycling return will not be received well by everyone.
Its the first time in years that Ive got something to give me a platform, he said. People can choose not to listen but Im my own boss with this and nobody tells me what to do.The question is what next -- platform wise -- for Armstrong He has had some talks with parties about his future.
But taking his podcast to France next year is not on the agenda. For one, he knows in all certainty he would be blacklisted.
Hey, its never say never isnt it he says. But I have very little interest in doing that. I can watch the Tour in my house and then walk across to my studio.
God bless those on the Tour having to drive three hours every day between the stages. Thats miserable -- you need a vacation at the end of it. This works perfectly for me right now.But of the wider question of his future, Armstrong has no idea what lies ahead, with a $100 million lawsuit looming from the US government for fraud for doping while racing in the US Postal Service colors.
Theres one thing left that you all know about, thats a significant fight so to speak, he says of a case which begins on November 6.
Thats looming and Ive got no choice but to fight the case.
For now, I have to get on with my life.
In the meantime, Armstrong will continue with his podcast for which he will be joined by former teammate George Hincapie in the final week.
He may crop up yet again as he has done in the television mockumentary Pharmacy Road on HBO, telling the story of a 1982 drug-fuelled Tour de France, with Armstrong in a scene-stealing moment.
I watched it with my son the other night and I thought it was funny, he says. Its nicely over the top. It was fun to do, like Stages.

Ledecky on course for fifth worlds gold in Budapest
Budapest: Freestyle queen Katie Ledecky on Friday cruised towards her fifth gold at the world championships as the fastest into the womens 800m final in Budapest on Friday.
Despite only turning 20 in March, Ledecky is already the most decorated female swimmer in world championships history.
She earned the 13th title, spanning three championships, by anchoring the USAs quartet to victory in the womens 4x200m freestyle relay on Thursday.
Ledecky clocked eight minutes, 20.24 seconds in the 800m heats on Friday morning, the fastest into Saturday nights final as the defending champion.
It was fine, it went to plan, said Ledecky.
I just had to get my lane for tomorrow, move on and have one more swim, she said.
Im excited. I always enjoy my last race at a meet, just giving it all and leaving it all in the pool.
Ledecky already has five medals at these championships -- freestyle golds over 400m and 1500m, plus the 4x100m and 4x200m relays, as well as silver in the 200m freestyle.
Busy Dressel, Sjostrom
Fresh from victory in Thursdays 100m freestyle final, Caeleb Dressel, 20, was second fastest into the mens 50m freestyle semi-finals during a busy morning for the American.
Brazils Bruno Santos was the fastest at 21.51sec with Dressel just 0.10 behind.
Australias Cameron MvEvoy was the seventh fastest through at 0.44.
It was good, I felt strong, said McEvoy.
It was about where I thought I could go physically, which is a positive, there is a lot to be happy about.
Dressel was back in action less than half an hour later as the fastest qualifier in the mens 100m butterfly heats, blasting out in 50.08 -- a clear second ahead of his nearest rival.
Singapores Joseph Schooling, Britains James Guy and South Africas Chad le Clos all booked their place in Fridays semi-finals.
Sarah Sjostrom, the womens 100m butterfly gold medallist on Monday, is the name to beat over 50m by clocking 25.25, the fastest into Fridays semi-finals.
Like Dressel, it was also the start of a busy day for the 23-year-old.
She is the favourite in the womens 100m freestyle final on Friday having become the first women to cover the distance under 52 seconds last Sunday with a new world-record of 51.71.
However, she was far from happy with her 50m butterfly swim.
The time was good, but everything else was bad, said Sjostrom.
I had planned to do the first 25 fast and then relax, but the start was bad, everything went wrong in the first 25 metres, then it got better towards the finish.
impossible
In the 100m free final, I aim to go under 52 seconds again, if I do that I think I will win it, but it will be impossible to break the world record again.
Japans Rikako Ikee was the third fastest at 0.47 into the 50m butterfly semi-finals, while Australias Holly Barratt was only 12th fastest at 0.66 back. Hungarys Iron Lady -- Katinka Hosszu -- had plenty of noisy support at the Duna Arena as she clocked the second fastest time, 0.48 secs, into the womens 200m backstroke semi-finals behind Kathleen Baker of the USA who swam 2:06.82. Australias Emily Seebohm was the third fastest at 1.12 back, while Canadas Kylie Masse, who broke the womens 100m backstroke record on Tuesday, was fifth fastest at 1.48 back. I just have to keep my race together, said Seebohm.
I want to go faster and then see how we go, I just want to get through. AFP

Mangala promises wide ranging economic reforms
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday promised wide ranging reforms to the economy in the wake of a positive report from the IMF on the countrys economic condition this month.
We have long term, mid and short terms goals for the economy, explained Minister Samaraweera, addressing a media briefing at the Central Bank yesterday. He added that though the coalition government had inherited a weakened and debt ridden economy from the Rajapaksa regime in 2015, it had managed in the last two years to increase government revenue from 10.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 14.2 percent of GDP in 2016.
For the nine years of the Rajapaksa regime, government revenue fell drastically. It was the lowest of all the countries in South Asia. In the meantime, expenditure and debt increased exponentially. All income was needed for debt servicing, Minister Samaraweera said.
He pointed out that from 2005-2014, government debt had increased by 33 percent.
We needed reforms but Mahinda Rajapaksa ignored that. I would define those nine years as one where Sri Lanka became a crony capitalistic Kleptrocracy, Samaraweera said.
The Minister further explained that the country would experience the real crunch in debt servicing in 2018-2019, where the government will have to pay close to Rs 3.2 trillion in debt servicing payments by the end of 2019. 82 percent of those loans coming up for repayment are from the Rajapaksa era,he said. As the country celebrated 40 years of the Open Market Economic policies this week, the Finance Minister said that the government was creating a better investment environment for investors and that the newly established Public Private Partnership unit of the Finance Ministry would help develop infrastructure in the country.
One of the key public private partnerships of the government, the Hambantota Port Project, he said was due to be signed today (29) and it would be the biggest undertaking a government has done, after the Mahaweli scheme.

Neymar, the darling of starless Brazil
Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian golden boy Neymar is riding high on a wave of unprecedented popularity at home where a year ahead of the World Cup news of his possible transfer has become an issue of national debate.
Reportedly pondering a 222-million euro ($256.8 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona, the Brazil captain showed this week why the French club would be willing to pay a world-record price to get him.
Neymar remained serene amid the speculation frenzy, scoring for Barcelona in a 1-0 victory over Manchester United in an International Champions Cup friendly midweek. But the general view among football pundits at home is that he must leave Barcelona to emerge from the shadow of Argentinian teammate Lionel Messi and target individual glory.
Brazil fans see Neymar as the key to a sixth World Cup title in Russia next year and the first Brazilian to win the Ballon d'Or since Kaka in 2007.
In a recent poll carried out by Globoesporte.com 75 percent of fans favoured his transfer away from Barcelona. All rumours are meticulously dissected in the Brazilian media, with television station Esporte Interativo creating a global buzz in mid-July by announcing that Neymar had "accepted PSG's offer".
In Brazil, Neymar is an icon, and the transfer has become a national issue.
If Messi has long been criticised in Argentina for his lack of national commitment, Neymar has always delivered.
At just 25 years he is already the fourth top scorer in Brazilian history with 52 goals from 77 matches -- three goals shy of Romario and already past legends such as Bebeto or Jairzinho.
The player from Sao Paulo has always had huge pressure on his shoulders as the unique Brazilian star of his generation.
Since his early days at Santos -- also the team of the legendary Pele -- Neymar has been touted as the next superstar.
In 2013 he even inherited the number 10 jersey immortalised by three-time world winner Pele, despite always playing 11 for his club side.

The Oval stages its 100th Test
The Ashes were regained here, countless centuries were scored here and decisive wickets taken. This was the scene of the most famous duck in cricket. The place is called home by Alec Stewart, Ricky Ponting and many more. It has been quite an innings for The Oval and this week the ground brought up its century.
If Lords is the home of cricket in England, The Oval is its favourite day out. The atmosphere here is different from Lords  more raucous, but no less enjoyable. So often it is the venue for the final match of a Test series, and it is the perfect ground for it.
As the the ground hosts its 100th Test where England are currently playing South Africa, Surrey have published on their website the memories of several iconic players. From Ponting to Andrew Flintoff, from Kevin Pietersen to Brian Lara, all have spoken about what the ground means to them.
Sir Donald Bradman arrived here in August 1948, for his final Test, needing four runs to end his international career with an average of more than 100. He was bowled, second ball, for a duck. The average slipped to 99.94.
Devon Malcolm
For England fans, Ashes memories stand out. There was Pietersens 158 that ensured the urn would be regained, after the unforgettable summer of 2005. That is one of the Tests Surrey chose among the 10 most memorable to take place here. Bradmans last Test is there, too, along with the first Test in England  staged in 1880  and Australias victory two years later that was the birth of the Ashes.
And yet, because of Englands opponents are South Africa, the 1994 Oval Test is worth a second look. On that day, Devon Malcolm  a frighteningly quick, frustratingly unpredictable bowler  decided South Africas batsmen were history. He was delighted to learn this Test had made Surreys top 10.
Wound up by a bouncer from Fanie de Villiers that struck him on the helmet, Malcolm says he told the South Africa fielders: You guys are history. He then produced an extraordinary spell, taking nine for 57 from 16.3 overs, to win the game for England.
He told Standard Sport: It is 23 years ago but I dont think a day has gone by without someone asking me about it. I might be in the supermarket or somewhere like that but people will still come over and mention it.
Judging by the number of people who say they were there, there must have been 60,000 or 70,000 in the ground! People talk about me being hit on the head, and that added fuel to the fire, but I had felt good all day. I remember telling the coaches in the morning that I would take six wickets and win the game for England.
The Oval pitch was good for fast bowlers back then: the more you hit the pitch, the more you got out of it. People sometimes talk about the nine for 57 as though it was the only time I bowled well for England but I often did well at The Oval.
I took five for 94 in a Test against Pakistan there in 1992, and I was man of the match in a one-day international against New Zealand in 1990.
Malcolm believes he was inspired to do well here by the success of another Jamaica-born quick  West Indies great Michael Holding. In 1976, West Indies beat England by 231 runs, with Holding claiming match figures of 14 for 149.
I was brought up in Jamaica like Michael Holding and we all know about his performance at The Oval, said Malcolm, now 54. I remember watching it regularly on videos and wanting to do well there, as he had done. Playing at Lords was special but I often seemed to save my best for The Oval.
I still watch the nine-for from time to time. Most things are available on YouTube now and people still send me clips via email. Its surprising that even young kids ask me about the spell. Id expect it from their granddads!
Malcolms 11-year-old son, Jaden, is a promising fast bowler in the Northamptonshire academy. If he plays international cricket one day, he will rarely face a challenge as tough as the one England bowlers accepted when they took on Hashim Amla here in 2012. Amla spent more than 13 hours at the crease, making 311 not out. It is the highest Test score made on this ground by anyone alive, and bettered only by the 364 made in 1938 by Sir Len Hutton, who died in 1990.
Now, Amla is back for more, the foundation on which the South African batting effort is built. It will be his first Test innings on the ground since the triple-century but he has played limited-overs games here, too, and had a brief stint with Surrey in the second half of the 2013 summer.
The Oval is up there in my three or four favourite venues around the world, said the 34-year-old. Especially when the sun is out and I dont need hand warmers in my pockets.
I enjoyed my time at Surrey and you dont know what the future holds. I had a great time here, and it is a great place to play.
Amla is one of many overseas greats to play Test cricket here and represent the county. Kumar Sangakkara is the most recent name on a list that includes Ponting, Waqar Younis and Sylvester Clarke.
Yet one family is synonymous with this county and ground. Both Micky and Alec Stewart played for Surrey and England; Micky was coach of the national team as Alec became a prominent player, who went on to captain his country. Alec is now director of cricket at Surrey and the familys significance is reflected around the ground, through the Micky Stewart Members Pavilion and the Alec Stewart Gate.
Lords is wonderful but The Oval is special in a different way, said Alec. It has always felt like home. If England and South Africa can feel comfortable here, the 100th Test will be one to savour.

Pakistan SC disqualifies PM from office; Nawaz Sharif resigns
Nawaz Sharif has resigned as Prime Minister of Pakistan following a decision by the countrys Supreme Court to disqualify him from office.
The ruling came after a probe into his familys wealth in the wake of the leaked 2016 Panama Papers, which linked Sharifs children to offshore firms.
Sharif has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the case.
The five judges reached a unanimous verdict in the Islamabad court, which was filled to capacity.
Following the verdict, Nawaz Sharif has resigned from his responsibilities as prime minister, a spokesman for Sharifs office said in a statement.
There was heightened security in the capital, with tens of thousands of troops and police deployed.
One of the judges, Ejaz Afzal Khan, said that Sharif was no longer eligible to be an honest member of the parliament. Pakistans Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan earlier advised Sharif to accept Fridays verdict.
The court has recommended anti-corruption cases against several individuals, including Sharif, his daughter Maryam and her husband Safdar, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and others.
Pakistan has repeated history. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is resigning. He was the 18th prime minister of Pakistan. Not a single one of the 17 Prime Ministers that preceded him have completed their full term in office.
Many believe that the Supreme Court has started a process of cracking down on corruption, which augurs well for democracy. Others see this as part of a long history of political manipulation through which the countrys powerful military establishment has sought to control civilian decision-making.
The case hearings - spread over nearly 15 months - have been marred by controversy. The case belongs in a criminal court. The Supreme Court, which is an appellate body, initially refused to hear it. But then it not only admitted the petition for hearing, it also took the unusual step of instituting its own investigation into the case, with a dominant role for military intelligence services. - BBC

Parliamentary sittings end as JO members swarm well
Parliament sittings came to an abrupt end at 11.45 am yesterday, as chaos reigned in Parliament when Joint Opposition members swarmed the well of the House following a heated argument with government members with the announcement to take the vote on the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act on making fuel distribution an essential service.
The arguments flared up as Speaker Kari Jayasuriya called for a vote as a member was heard requesting for a division, although it was not clear as to who made the request. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya adjourned sittings until August 04 as the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the Mace in his hands to protect it as the Joint Opposition members were standing around the it. However, the government side members said 'Aye' for passing of the resolution before Parliament sittings adjourned.
The debate on the resolution which commenced on Thursday and put off for yesterday, was taken up for vote following the presentation of the papers and oral answers. On this occasion, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake who was on his feet said the debate was adjourned the previous day as there were two government side members to make statements on the resolution.
"We wish for a clear statement from the government as to what the government would do in connection with the attack on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC) workers on Wednesday" "Here are the pictures of the attackers. What do you do to the Welikada OIC who assaulted a Provincial Council Member The Prime Minister or the Law and Order Minister should make a statement."
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said the government should respond to the questions raised by the Opposition. Thereafter, Joint Opposition members were seen coming towards the well and walking towards the Speaker's bench. Among the members were MP Bandula Gunawardena, Gamini Lokuge, Pavithra Wannaiarachchi, Padma Udayashantha Gunasekara, Sriyani Wijewickrama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Tharaka Balasooriya, Prasanna Ranatunga, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Dinesh Gunawardena, Vidura Wickramanayake, etc.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya later questioned whether Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake make a statement. The minister said that he would make a statement after the investigations were over. The Speaker then requested the members to calm down. "Please cooperate to continue proceedings," requested the Speaker. "You should not waste time and public funds. The division is asked for so the vote should be taken now."
The quorum bell was rung and during the bell was being rung, the arguments continued.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who joined cross talks at this stage, insisted that no statement could be made when a vote was called for. This would set a bad precedence. "We can't allow it."
"A division was requested from the Opposition side. So a vote has to be taken," Speaker Jayasuriya said. "Later we could have a debate on it after discussions at the Party Leaders' meeting. Now take the vote by name. Isn't the vote system working we can't allow Parliament to be run like this."
Thereafter, the names of members were called to take the vote by name. While the names were being called out, Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando took the the Mace in his hands as Joint Opposition members thronged in front of the Speaker's chair.
Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Kushan Jayaratne was near the Mace for its protection. Then sittings adjourned until August 04 on the motion of the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Petroleum supply, distribution an essential service not passed in accordance to Standing Orders:JVP
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), observed that the resolution under the Essential Public Services Act that declared petroleum supply and distribution an essential service, was not passed in accordance with Standing Orders in Parliament yesterday.
The JVP Parliamentarians made this observation at a press conference held at the the Parliamentary Complex after Parliament Sittings came to an abrupt end. JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that when the vote was taken up, the Mace was not in the bracket of the table.

He also said the Chair is not effective when the Mace had been taken out. Whatever being announced from the Chair is not valid when the Mace is not in its proper place.
Further to that, the results of the vote was not announced. It was a vote taken by name. We do not know the results of the vote. Voting did not come to an end. So one could not say the resolution was passed, Dissanayake said.
We do not consider the resolution as passed, he said. JVP MPs Vijitha Herath and Bimal Ratnayake also participated at the Press conference.
Resolution not duly passed -JO
The Joint Opposition (JO) observed that the resolution declaring petroleum supply and distribution an essential service was not duly passed in Parliament yesterday.

Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said the Gazette Extraordinary proclaiming the supply and distribution of fuel an essential service was not valid as it had not been properly passed in Parliament.
"A vote was taken on the resolution to give effect to the gazette and the vote did not come to an end when the Speaker adjourned the House abruptly," said MP Gunawardena. "The vote was taken by name. Nobody knows the final count."
He said the Speaker should announce the results of the vote. He added that nothing of that sort happened and the resolution had not been passed by the time Parliament sittings was adjourned.
Joint Opposition member Chamal Rajapaksa addressing the press conference, said the resolution could not be considered passed according the Standing Orders of Parliament.

Maha Illuppallama Seed Farm:
Does Govt plan to sell it to a foreign company: JVP
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, demanded to know whether the Government had made plans to sell the Maha Illuppallama Seed Farm to a foreign company.
Raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament yesterday, the MP alleged that the Government has prepared a draft agreement to hand over local agricultural seed production to a Bangladesh private company named Lal Teer.
The MP said that Cabinet approval had been granted for this move.
This deal not only vests the rights of local seed production to a foreign company, but also grants it the authority to import seeds and obtain patents for local seeds. This may pave the way for bio-piracy and a collapse in local seed production. The Government has not discussed this move with any stakeholder with regard to the move, the MP charged.
The MP inquired from the Government the conditions that had been laid down by the Government for the foreign company to produce local seed paddy. The MP also urged the Government to table the draft agreement in this regard.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the Government is ready to facilitate a Parliamentary debate on the matter at a future date.

Questioned by the media of the mock session held by the Joint Opposition members following the sittings being adjourned, the Deputy Speaker said that an investigation would be held if there was a complaint in that regard.
He also said that the members of the Joint Opposition should act with a sense of responsibility as a sum of Rs 16 million of the people's money is spent for a single sitting of Parliament.

Ports Authority employees call off strike
Port Authority employees on Thursday called off their token strike scheduled for today (28) since President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to introduce amendments to the Hambantota Port Agreement on August 1.
The Agreement was expected to be passed in Parliament today (28) and scheduled to be inked on Saturday (29).

Qatar refuses to outsource foreign policy in Gulf crisis
QATAR: Qatar refuses to bow to Saudi-led demands to outsource its foreign policy to resolve the Gulf crisis, its government spokesman told AFP in an interview.
Sheikh Saif bin Ahmed Al-Thani, who holds ministerial rank, accused Doha's adversaries in the crisis -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt -- of meddling in Qatar's internal affairs.
What's behind this crisis of course is Qatari sovereignty and independence to put it very simply.
It is about... outsourcing our foreign policy so that decisions are not made in Qatar, and that is something that will never be acceptable, he said.
Sheikh Saif said the Saudi-led bloc had laid down a new ultimatum on Tuesday by publishing a list of individuals and terrorist entities allegedly linked to Doha.
This list, it's still an ultimatum, it's still something that is stalling resolving the crisis, the official said. However, we have said it from the start, we are open to dialogue, we are open to negotiating... The first step should be lifting the illegal blockade. In the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years, Riyadh and allies have been boycotting Doha since June 5.
They have sealed the emirate's only land border, ordered its citizens to leave, and closed their airspace and waters to Qatari flights and shipping.
They are demanding that Qatar break its longstanding ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, blacklisted as a terror group by the four governments although not by the international community.
They also want Doha to close broadcasting giant Al-Jazeera and a Turkish military base, and to fall in line with Saudi-led policy in the region, particularly towards Iran.
Sheikh Saif insisted that this crisis was again triggered by them not by us.
Qatar was prepared to discuss anything openly as long as it does not impinge on the country's sovereignty and independence, he said.- AFP

The Regulations on Prohibited Tobacco Products gazetted on Sep 1, 2016 had not been intended to have any effect on the traditional betel quid, Health Ministry sources said.
The main objective of the regulations was to provide the legal background for authorities to prohibit manufacturing, importing, selling or offering for sale of various items like Mawa, Babul, Beedi, Panpara, Gurkkha among others, which are manufactured with various toxins and harmful ingredients and protect schoolchildren and youths from the addictive substances.
Young generation in Sri Lanka tend to use Smokeless Tobacco (ST). Mawa, Babul and other similar imported ST products sold in the market at affordable rates. A recent survey reveals that schoolchildren are specifically targeted by the ST manufacturers and sellers, the sources said.
These products causes many major health problems, particularly oral cancer, cancer in the esophagus, and stomach and affect mental health. According to the health ministry reports, an increase in the number of oral cancer in the younger generation are evident in the last decade and it is directly attributable to smoking and using STs, the sources said.

Strike strategists ignore Dengue crisis
The strike this week by the trade unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) brought a new challenge to the government that hitherto has been facing the political rivalry of the Joint Opposition (JO), and other anti-government organisations and groups that were carrying out their opposition mainly on democratic footing. The walkout by the petroleum workers, with hardly any notice, especially with regard to such a vital supply of a resource for the functioning of society was a matter that needed the most swift and effective action by the government; both to keep society running and counter the criticisms that would be leveled at the government for the breakdown of services. The strike was against moves to bring Indian participation to the working of the Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee, to make it a useful component of a developed economic system in the country, and against the lease agreement with the Chinese investors for the proper functioning of the Hambantota Harbour  the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port. The strike sought to win public support and sympathy with the use of the patriotic nationalist slogan that it was against the selling of these two vital national development facilities, and by implication the key areas where they are located, to India and China.
What the strikers, who were obviously happy at being able to cripple the economy and society in one single move, with stopping the flow of petroleum based fuel in the country, with all the problems it would cause to the day-to-day lives of the people, in every class of society; did not realize was the opposition of the people to such a strike, with such massive hardship to the people, especially with the what is a near epidemic of Dengue fever. They had forgotten how the doctors of the GMOA had to pull back on their planned long strike, following the calls by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, and other religious leaders, to reconsider their decision because of the spread of Dengue, and the related hardships faced by the people. The petroleum strikers may have thought that Dengue patients are only affected by a doctors strike, and not by the workers of any other section in society.
Interestingly, the GMOA doctors launched another strike almost in sync with the CPC workers, this time not mainly about SAITM, but with focus at the alleged attempt to abduct Ryan Jayalath, the Convenor of the Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC). The strike was called off the same day after discussions with Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, who is in charge of the Police, and an assurance that the complaints regarding this alleged abduction would be looked into, with some criticism of the Police action, too. The GMOA was thus able not to be hurt by the Dengue crisis.
Public opposition

But the situation with the CPC strikers was different. There was a huge public opposition to the strike, especially in the context of the Dengue situation, apart from all the hardships it would cause to the normal lives of the people. This opposition was both in the urban and rural areas. The strike imposed sudden hardship in taking suspected Dengue patients to a doctor or hospital, the visiting of Dengue patients in hospitals, and taking of necessary food and other assistance to patients. There was also a danger that if the CPC strike goes for long, it would affect the treatment to Dengue patients (and other patients too) in hospitals, with the inability to use equipment for diagnosis and treatment at these places. The CPC strike became a major health issue in the country, which far exceeded any patriotic nationalist feelings over Trincomalee and Hambantota that the strike organisers were seeking to build upon.
This gave the government, both the necessity and the opportunity to bring in the Essential Service Regulations and deal with the situation, by bringing the Military to move into the key CPC operational locations, the refineries at Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela, and begin the dispatch of fuel to the country, despite opposition, and even physical obstacles by the strikers. The Military was also able to get a train load of fuel to move to Katunayake, to serve aviation needs, notwithstanding the strikers who slept on the track till they were removed. One aspect of the public reaction to the strike was seen in some persons who sought to take direct action against the strikers, matters that were calmed down by the Police and Military. At the end of the first day of operations, the Military had sent out several fuel bowsers and that train, from Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela. The strikers soon backed off, saying they have called off the strike temporarily till next Tuesday. There were also several bowsers with their tyres deflated at the locations, which showed the service breakdown planning by the strikers, which also showed the need for the Essential Service Regulations.
The strike trend on the patriotic nationalist line was also planned to extend to the Port of Colombo, but the use of the Essential Services Regulations to deal with the CPC strikers, had given a warning to the port workers planning strike action. They stopped the action, knowing the Military may move in to carry out the operations.
As this is written the Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese investors has been placed before Parliament and is due for debate. The JO will certainly make a big noise against it, but what is interesting is to know what plans the Rajapaksa Regime would have had about making the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, constructed by the Chinese, a functional operation which it was not, for several years after it was opened. Would they have not continued with Chinese operations, to make this a functional port in the Indian Ocean Region This has never been said in the JO criticism on the Hambantota Port issues, and it does not seem to interest the trade union activists opposed to the current arrangements, too.
The Government will now have to look at the proper functioning of the Hambantota Port, as well as the CPC, in the context of wider public support for continued activity in society, without the breakdown strategies of the trade unions largely aligned to the JO, and influenced by the patriotic nationalist groups on Sinhala majoritarian extremism.
What the government should see in this trade union action is a major political move against it, when other political campaigns have so far failed to have any direct action against the government, although public opinion has been turned away. It will have to do a much better public awareness campaign on these two key areas of development which can be the vital aspects of development in Yahapalana Governance, which certainly needs a considerable build up in publicity to be seen as pro-people and society, in the context of postponed elections and the continuing debate on the new constitution, increasing corruption, and the moves to establish what some think is a Sangha Raja.
PC Polls delay
The Cabinet decision to amend the rules governing the conduct of Provincial Council Elections, which will require the holding of all PC elections on the same day, will certainly lead to more criticism of the government over poll delays. It is faced with the huge criticism over the delay in the Local Government Polls, which is hardly eased by the various statements made by the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faiszer Musthapha in this regard. The recent statement that the new changes will lead to a doubling of Local Government representatives will also lead to more criticism, with the public certainly not keen on increasing these kindergarten or primary school trainees in the current political system.
With arrangements already being made to call nominations for the next elections to the North-Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa, PC elections in early October 2017, this Cabinet decision is most likely to postpone these elections, so that they would be held with all other PCs, under the amended rule. However, if the Government does not want a delay in the PC polls, it has the ability to expedite the planned amendments, and dissolve all PCs accordingly on one day, and hold the next elections at an early date.
It is to be seen what the governments action will be. The requirement for petitions before the Supreme Court on the new amendments, and the parliamentary process on the amendments, point to a delay in the PC polls, and not the holding of polls for the three PCs that will end their terms by end September this year, by October 1, 2017 as planned. It is certainly a burden the government will have to bear, that need not have been kept this long for action.
Police trouble
The Police have been exposed in what are hasty decisions or statements that call for much more serious action  apart from daily mediation. High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan, member of the Trial-at-Bar on the high profile rape and murder case of schoolgirl Vithya in Jaffna, has made it very clear that those who killed his guard policeman were in fact targeting him. He has raised questions about how the Police said it was not so before a full inquiry was done.
There is a similar situation over the attempted abduction of the Ryan Jayalath, the Convenor of the Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC), with white van allegations, too. The Minister of Law and Order has said the Police were wrong, as had so many others in their criticism of this, which the Police spokesman said was a normal arrest operation. It is time for the Police to be more thoughtful in its statements, and actions, too.

Ton-up Stokes punishes South Africa in 3rd Test
LONDON July 28: Ben Stokess century against a depleted South Africa attack left England in a commanding position at tea on Fridays second day of the third Test at The Oval.
South Africa were 18 for one in reply to Englands first innings 353, a deficit of 335 runs.
Dean Elgar (eight) was out to what became the last ball before the interval when he was caught behind off Toby Roland-Jones to give the Middlesex seamer, one of three debutant in Englands XI, his first Test wicket.
Earlier, Stokes made 112 against a South Africa attack missing the ill Vernon Philander.
The seamer only bowled five overs Friday before being taken to hospital for tests on what appeared to be a worsening stomach complaint. Philander had enjoyed a superb return of two for 17 in 12 overs on Thursdays rain-marred first day and, if fully fit, would surely have relished the continued overcast conditions in what is the 100th Test staged at The Oval.
England had been criticised by several former captains for some slap-dash batting in a huge 340-run defeat by in the second Test at Trent Bridge that saw the Proteas level this four-match series at 1-1. But Stokes got the balance right on Friday by being aggressive against the old ball and watchful when the new one arrived before upping the tempo late on. England resumed on 171 for four, with Alastair Cook 82 not out and Stokes 21 not out.

USAs Notre Dame University to support in disaster management
The University of Notre Dame of USA will implement the Monsoon Intra-Seasonal Oscillation-(MISCO) Inter-monsoon fluctuation in Sri Lanka to support in curbing human disasters due to weather conditions in Sri Lanka. This is a result of an agreement reached with the University by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in March 2017. It has been decided to establish a system of precise forecasting systems for all weather related issues, including rainfall, temperature changes, humidity, wind, warm and cold currents in the ocean etc.
A discussion in this regard was held on July 26 at the Ministry. Professor Harendra J. S. Fernando is in charge of the project. NARA is coordinating. A special aircraft is used in the implementation of the MISCO project. The equipment also monitors the temperature up to 10 kilometres from sea level and the wind speed two kilometres from sea level. All other matters, such as the cucle oceans are being considered.
The Minister stated that the government will provide all assistance to implement this project.
The project, which begins in 2018, ends in two years. However, the MISCO project is implemented between 2017 to 2022. Officials including the SL Navy and Meteorological Department participated in the discussion.

Venezuela: The other side
Global media is full of stories about massive demonstrations, violence and mass protests against the government of President Maduro, whose fall they predict as imminent. An orchestrated campaign of vilification of the Bolivarian revolution and suppression of factual developments has been continuing ever since Maduro was elected as President. International media has, however, kept silent about arson attacks on government offices, hospitals and members of the security forces by supporters of the Opposition.
The Opposition has staged a Parliamentary coup. It has passed several unconstitutional laws including an amnesty law to grant impunity to those accused of violent crimes and a housing privatization law. The Supreme Court has over-ruled these laws and has suspended the National Assembly. Arsonists have set fire to buildings of the Supreme Court. Nor has the Opposition heeded the call of President Maduro for dialogue. Mediation efforts by Pope Francis have also been rejected by the Opposition.
On July 20 and 21 the Opposition staged a massive strike. However, a significant feature of the strike was the non-participation of the workers, who were locked out by employers to make their strike a success. Most participants of the strike included shopping mall and commerce employees, private transport providers. Workers repulsed crowds that came to attack and set fire to the Venezuelan TV. The Opposition plans to block election centres today (29) and march to Miraflores Presidential Palace on Sunday the 30th.
Today Venezuela is a deeply polarized society with the upper classes and middle class on one pole and the poor, comprising workers, peasants and indigenous people on the opposite pole. As it is Venezuela is heading towards civil war unless a peaceful solution is found.
Government of President Maduro has been working within the Constitution and has called for elections to a National Constituent Assembly as a means of giving an opportunity for the people to charter the course of future development. The election is fixed for tomorrow (30th).
United States is interfering in developments in Venezuela and has threatened to use all options to effect regime change. This week it threatened to apply strong and swift economic sanctions against Venezuela. Already several eminent persons have been sanctioned. Trade alliance Mercosur has expelled Nicaragua from its membership.
By overthrowing the Bolivarian regime the United States hopes to halt or reverse the leftward trend in Latin American politics. Hence the outcome of the power struggle in Venezuela has more than a national significance.
Confrontation mounts in Jerusalem
Pursuing further its aggressive policy of illegally making undivided Jerusalem its capital Israel has introduced new security measures at one of Muslims holiest sites Al-Aqsa mosque restraining Muslim devotees visiting it.
This follows an earlier incident in which two Israeli security guards were killed at the entrance to the mosque.
Palestinians are staging protests at the Mosque against the new move and confrontation is mounting. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez has called upon Israel to demonstrate restraint. Turkish President Erdogan has said that by this move Israel is undermining its Islamic character and it constraints on Muslims visiting the mosque cannot be accepted. Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has also criticized the move. Palestine Authority has suspended security cooperation with Israel in protest.
The mosque is situated in East Jerusalem which is considered the capital of a future independent Palestine state. Meanwhile the Knesset (Israeli Parliament) passed the first of three votes (67:41) to approve what it termed Jerusalems Basic Law to define anew the status of Jerusalem in violation of international agreements. According to this new law, 80 percent of MPs in the Knesset should vote for any sale of land in Jerusalem to a foreign party. It is a pre-emptive move to prevent East Jerusalem being the capital of a future Palestine state.
US Senate rejects again Trump's health law
Last Wednesday United States Senate once again defeated by a majority of 10 votes a plan to repeal and replace the Obamacare with a Republican plan. Senators opposed it on the grounds that it is only a plan and no replacement Act was presented. According to the plan it would have taken a two year delay in replacement. Eight ruling Republican Party Senators also voted against the plan.
The day before Senate also rejected the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BRACA) with the support of nine Republican Senators. It included deep cuts in Medicaid  a health program for the poor and disabled persons. Approximately 22 million people gained health insurance under President Obamas Affordable Care Act.

Warner hits back in bitter Australia pay row
Sydney: Australia vice-captain Dave Warner has accused Cricket Australia of wrongly blaming players for not resolving a bitter pay dispute saga which threatens next months Test tour to Bangladesh.
CA chief executive James Sutherland upped the ante on Thursday when he said unless intensive talks over the next few days produced a compromise, his organisation would seek the intervention of an industrial umpire to end the impasse.
The Australian Cricketers Association hit back, saying CA was to blame for the crisis dragging on and that it had lost the players through its hardball tactics.
Warner, who has been outspoken in the push for players to keep a 20-year revenue-sharing arrangement in place against CA opposition, also fired back at the governing body.
This Baggy Green (cap) means the world to me, he wrote on Instagram late Thursday beneath a picture of himself in his Test kit.
Myself and all the other players, female and male, want to get out there and play.
We offered Aus$30 million ($24 million) of our money to grassroots as a peace plan. It was ignored. We asked for mediation twice before and it was rejected. Now CA says there is a crisis.
The players are unemployed and some are hurting financially but continue to train. Administrators all still being paid. How is it our fault no deal is done
After months of negotiations, the players and CA have failed to reach agreement, leaving 230 cricketers unemployed since the end of June when their contracts expired.
Sutherland went on the attack after knocking back recent compromise proposals from the ACA, who remain adamant that players must receive a percentage of the games gross revenues.
We feel that what has been proposed actually jeopardises not only the Bangladesh tour but in turn the Indian tour that is upcoming and beyond that even  dare I say it  the Ashes tour, Sutherland said Thursday.
We have concerns that the urgency at our end is not being reciprocated at the other side and thats why we can hopefully bring the matter to resolution and failing that an independent arbitrator to come in, make a decision and we accept the umpires decision.
The ACA likened arbitration to an adversarial process more akin to a courtroom.
This dispute has arisen from Cricket Australias attempts to, without making the case, end a successful 20-year partnership with players, it said.
Cricket Australia has lost the players and most of the games stakeholders in the process.
The first match on the Test tour of Bangladesh is due to start on August 22, followed by a one-day tour to India in September and October ahead of the showpiece home Ashes series, beginning in November. AFP
