FORMER GOVTS AIRBUS deals to be probed
The government is investigating as to why the previous government ordered A350 Airbuses for SriLankan Airlines in 2013 when the country did not need such long distant air buses, Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said yesterday.
He said the government is investigating as to who entered into these agreements and if those agreements were legal and if commissions have been taken for ordering the manufacturing of these air buses. The Minister made these observations yesterday while taking part in the debate on the regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act.
He made these observations in response to a statement made by Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti who said that the government could incur large scale financial losses if it fails to inform Airbus to halt the production of four A350 Airbus aircraft that is to commence manufacturing soon on demand of the previous government.
The COPE Chairman told Parliament that the government should inform the relevant companies in Germany and France to halt the production as it will have to pay a huge amount if the deal is cancelled after the resumption of the production of these airbuses.
The Government has already lost US$ 125 million as a result of terminating a deal to acquire four other A350 air buses earlier, COPE Chairman said. It will have to pay more again if it failed to cancel the deal without delay.
With the sanction of the COPE, JVP MP Handunnetti proposed that the Government discuss the issue with both French and German Governments and to put a stop to a decision the Rajapaksa regime took by placing the controversial order for eight Airbus A350 aircraft.
We must decide if we want the remaining four aircraft. According to the agreement, the Airbus company will commence manufacturing these four this September. We may have to pay millions of rupees if we cancel the order after they start manufacturing the aircraft.
Mahinda Society, the past pupils association of Mahinda Vidyalaya, Galle will hold Black and Gold - Mahinda social night on September 30, at the Golden Rose Hotel, Boralesgamuwa from 7.30 p.m.
The COPE wanted me to inform the House that it is necessary to have discussion between the Governments to suspend the manufacturing until a firm decision is reached.
The Sri Lankan Government should talk to these two Governments, MP Handunnetti said.
He also said COPE will carry out separate investigation on the deal signed in 2013 to acquire the Airbus aircraft and on the termination of the deal to acquire four aircraft by the present regime.
However at this stage Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella stated that the COPE Chairman could investigate only into the matters that has been referred by the Auditor General only. He added that the COPE chairman could not inquire into the government policies. He also said that although the COPE Chairman inquires, it has to do so at the COPE Committee only.
COPE Chairman said that he was making the statement on the request made by members of the COPE committee.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that COPE Chairman made this statement for the benefit of the government. However, Senaratne who welcomed COPE Chairmans cautioning said: According to my understanding, COPE Chairman Handunnetti is cautioning the Government. What he is trying to say is that the manufacturing will commence soon.
If the manufacturing process starts, we may have to pay them more to cancel the order. Hence, prior to starting the manufacturing he wants the Government to take a decision.

Germany goes to polls
Parliamentary elections in Germany, the most powerful member state of the European Union will bwe held tomorrow (24th). Chancellor Angela Merkels Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is expected to win with ease. In an opinion poll last week it had received 36 percent of votes while its alliance partner Social Democratic Union (SDU) polled 22 percent. Alternative for German (AfG) and the Left Party are competing for the third pace with around 11 and 12 percent.
In the Bundestag CDU have 311 seats out of 630. If it wins Angela Merkel will become Chancellor for a record fourth time. However, CDU  CSU Alliance may not get an absolute majority in the Bundestag and hence it will have to go into a coalition with at least one minor party which will need hard bargaining.
A noteworthy and alarming feature of the election is the support that the far right-wing pro-fascist Alternative for Germany has received. In the elections in 2013 it received only 4. 3 percent whereas the last opinion poll showed that its support has increased to 11 percent. It is the only German political party that welcomed the Trump victory and UKs exit (Brexit) from the European Union. Incidentally such fresh support for the far right is contrary to the general trend against such views as shown during the elections in France and Britain.
One major reason for the added support for the AfG is the problem of increased immigrants in Germany. Anti-immigrant sentiment in the country has compelled even Angela Merkel to promise tighter border control though her government has been the most liberal in accepting and welcoming refugees into Germany.
Unlike in France and Britain no surprises are expected at the German elections after which the status-quo is expected to continue.
May proposes post-Brexit UK  EU partnership
The second phase of EU  Britain talks on Brexit is scheduled to take place on October 19  20. British Prime Minister Theresa May has proposed a new economic and security partnership between the EU and the UK after the latters exit from the EU in May 2019.
However, the European Union is reluctant to enter the second phase without concluding the first phase, discussions on it being inconclusive. The EU insists on three conditions for completing the first phase. According to them Britain must pay adequate compensation to the EU, the amount running to several billions of Euros. Britain is willing to pay but differences remain over the amount. The second condition is about the Irish border about which agreement has to be reached. The third is the status of European citizens in Britain. The EU wants the present status and privileges for its resident to remain unchanged. Britain, on the other had wants to restrict them and grant a special status not amounting to full citizenship. The European Union will keep the status quo of British citizens in its member states unchanged. At present they enjoy all privileges of other citizens of those countries.
Prime Minister May was expected to give a Speech in Florence Friday (22) outlining her new proposals. She proposes a two-year transition period after UK leaves Britain. She is also willing to pay 10 billion Euros as compensation. EU expects much more. May proposes that the amount is to be discussed and agreed during the transition period. She has also pledged more privileges to EU citizens remaining in the UK after Brexit.
Anniversary of Sabra and Shatila massacre
September 16 is a Dark Day in the Palestine calendar. On that day 35 years ago September 16, 1982 - following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon right-wing Christian Phalange militia stormed Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in West Beirut and massacred hundreds, maybe thousands of their inmates, including many children.
The invasion began on June 6 after the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had defended the camps since its inception, agreed to leave Lebanon in August. The PLO was given an assurance by the United States that civilians left behind would be protected. On September 14 Lebanese President elect was assassinated and Israel army invaded and occupied West Lebanon. It surrounded the refugee camps so that none could leave them. Phalangist militias then stormed the camps and conducted the massacre under protection from the Israeli Army.
The massacre lasted two days. Israeli army supplied the bulldozers to dig mass graves. In 1983, Israels investigative Kahan Commission found that Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defence Minister, bore personal responsibility for the slaughter.
The massacre at Sabra and Shatila was a direct consequence of Israels violation of the American-brokered ceasefire and the impunity bestowed on Israel by the US and the international community that provided impunity to the killers should be held responsible for it.
Israel continues its aggression and violation of human rights of the Palestinians even today. The entire Gaza strip is a prison as a permanent siege is maintained by the Israeli army. Palestinian territory is rolled back and Jewish settlements are erected in Palestinian land after expelling the residents by force of arms. Water, electricity and other basic amenities are not provided to them and their movements are restricted. All civilized nations and peoples should call upon Israel to abandon its genocidal and apartheid policies. Palestinians should not be left to the mercy of the invader.

How can we improve Sri Lanka cricket
Developing ones own skill in cricket comes only at club level (Higher Division cricket) by playing for the club with others who have represented Sri Lanka or played higher level of cricket.
I reached higher level not due to playing school cricket or being coached by school cricket coaches. I was never coached while playing for the school. Those who have the talent learnt fast by playing their own type of cricket and making good scores during the school cricket season.
It is upto Sri Lanka Cricket to select qualified good coaches on a paid basis and send them to various provinces and train those young talented who perform well in club cricket.
Also the National Cricket Selectors must go round, watching club cricket and incentives given through S.L.C. to those who perform and doing well.
It is high time former top Sri Lanka cricketers, what they speak will go out and watch cricket and act whether what they say is done and be in touch often with S.L.C cricket committee.
Even politicians who played cricket should help those who want to improve cricket without speaking out to the media blaming the administration just to gain respect.
I cannot understand why other former Sri Lanka cricketers write to the media just giving out their views.
It is cricket whoever the individual be must be made to improve and not to throw mud at others.
Even the Minister of Sports or the Prime Minister should appoint a top level cricket administrator and former cricketer who has much time at his disposal to advice. May Sri Lanka Cricket develop from good work done and become World Cricket champions.
Those who do good the public will admire.

ICC to approve four-day Tests
South Africa v Zimbabwe on Boxing Day :
The ICC is likely to grant Test status to the four-day match between South Africa and Zimbabwe on Boxing Day, but strictly as a trial exercise.
A final decision on Cricket South Africa's request that the experimental day-night fixture in Port Elizabeth be considered a Test will be taken at the ICC board meeting in Auckland in October.
Four-day Tests are being seen as one of the solutions to make the longest format more viable and attractive in an age where Twenty20 has become the most popular version of the game.
However, the ICC's Cricket Committee - the forum primarily entrusted with keeping the sport relevant - has not been in favour of reducing the length of Tests from five days to four.
In 2015, the Cricket Committee, chaired by former India captain Anil Kumble, opposed the idea of four-day Tests. The ICC Chief Executives Committee (CEC) and the top brass of the ICC management, however, had voiced support for four-day Tests.
In June this year, the Cricket Committee said that while its primary focus will remain on developing cricket structures it was not against experimenting with four-day Test cricket, but without any commitment. According to people involved in the discussions, the support for four-day Test cricket was growing, though there was considerable reluctance from traditionalists.
The game's administrators are inclined towards four-day Tests because the concept helps ease their biggest problem: scheduling. With domestic Twenty20 leagues taking up a large part of the calendar, boards have been struggling to find enough time for full international tours.
Earlier this week CSA and the BCCI, after months of deliberation, agreed to reduce the Test series from four to three matches and play an extra - sixth - ODI on India's tour to South Africa in January.
Haroon Lorgat, CSA's chief executive officer, is a firm supporter of four-day Tests, especially as a way to induct Ireland and Afghanistan into the fold. We recognise that there is a place for higher-ranked teams to play the lower-ranked teams, or even the lower-ranked teams among themselves, in four-day Test match cricket, Lorgat said.
I hope that apart from being a trial, we could have it as a permanent arrangement.
It is understood that administrators are trying to work towards a resolution that would allow Full Members to decide between themselves whether a Test should be four or five days. The stance of the players, the biggest stakeholders in the game, is not yet clear. Last year, in an annual survey conducted by the Federation of International Cricketers Associations, they gave the idea a thumbs down.
Lorgat, however, was confident. He said he had checked with the South African team management and they were supportive of the idea of a four-day Test against Zimbabwe in December.

Inclusion of certain proposals could lead to separatism: Hemakumara
Constitutional Assembly Interim Report:
Mawbima Janatha Party Leader Hemakumara Nanayakkara warned yesterday that the inclusion of certain proposals to the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly by several parties at the behest of Diaspora and Non-Governmental Organizations could once again lead to separatism.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that our party is in agreement with some of the proposals in the interim report. But, we cannot agree with several proposals which may lead to separatism again.
This report apparently states that the Unitary State is not suitable for Sri Lanka eventhough it has remained so since ancient times. This is an attempt to replace unitary state with a united state. We oppose it. Sri Lanka is for all communities and all Provinces belong to all communities.We must give foremost place to Buddhism while guaranteeing equal rights to the other religions,Nanayakkara said.
The report describes Sri Lanka as unitary country with a central government and provincial units. Then how can this be a unitary country, the Mawbima Janatha Party Leader asked.
There is also an attempt to create Federal states without using the word Federal. Administrative powers should be decentralised in all Provinces. For example, there should be more translaters in areas dominated by the majority community.Any injustices to minority communities can be addressed only in a unitary country.The aim of these people depend on Diaspora and Non-Governmental organizations is to build a federal state by cutting the powers of Governors and giving more powers to Provincial councils, he added.
Nanayakkara said Northern Province Governor C.V. Vigneswaran has urged the government to withdraw Army personnel from the North.
But, he again says that the Army should be redeployed when there is an emergency, Nanayakkara said.
It is the Security Forces who protect the Northern people and not the Northern Chief Minister.The Chief Minister has his own security unit for his security, he added.

Jake LaMotta: Not a great champion but a boxing beast
Jake LaMotta should have been in Las Vegas to watch Gennady Golovkin and Saul Canelo lvarez, two distinguished middleweights pitched together to echo the deeds of the divisions glorious past, a fight reckoned to restore boxings faltering image. LaMotta, who knew a lot about the games sullied reputation, would have given it a wry smile.
The fight did not quite do its job. It was a terrific rather than a truly great contest and dreadful misjudgment by one of the officials overwhelmingly in favour of lvarez returned a split draw, drowning out all other post-fight sentiments. So, unfairly but inevitably, Golovkin-lvarez will be remembered only slightly more fondly than the theatrical crossover fight in the same ring three weeks earlier between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor.
To rinse away the taste of that farce, LaMottas was a name the promoters raised in the week before GGG-Canelo. He was lauded alongside Sugar Ray Robinson, his nemesis. They spoke, too, about the later Sugar Ray  Leonard - and Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns and Roberto Durn. They hoped the past might gild the present. Maybe their memories were selective.
LaMotta, the world middleweight champion from 1949 to 1951, was not ringside on either night but seeing out his final days in a nursing home in Florida. If asked, he could probably recount the night he threw his fight against Billy Fox in 1947 to get his title shot against the charismatic Frenchman Marcel Cerdan two years later  and how he lied about the fix for 13 years. He had bowed to the arm-twisting of Foxs influential gangster manager, Blinky Palermo, but never properly cashed in on being world champion.
He defended the title twice before running into Robinson for a sixth and final time. Then he got fat, fought on for three years, losing four and drawing one of 10, knocked down for the only time in his career, but quitting on his stool twice. His best years were in the 1940s, as a foil for Robinson and terroriser of lesser opponents. He was not a great champion but he surely was one of the toughest, a boxing beast.
The fine details of his brief reign and the denouement are not always absorbed in recollections of his career, mainly because one of the greatest movies of all time painted him in classically Shakespearean mode, a doomed victim to fear then pity. Martin Scorseses Raging Bull simultaneously rehabbed LaMottas standing as a middleweight champion and exposed the essential ugliness of his personality. But his boxing was not the real story.
As Scorsese told the New York Times when the film finally started making noise after its release in 1980: Those who think its a boxing picture would be out of their minds. Its brutal, sure, but its a brutality that could take place not only in the boxing ring but in the bedroom or in an office. Jake is an elemental man.
Scorsese did not say that as something to be proud of but a fact foolish to ignore. Chuck Palahniuk said something similar when I asked him about his exploration of elemental maleness in his book Fight Club. What the filmmaker and the author shared was a fascination with the glamour of violence.
Not a lot about LaMottas life appeared glamorous, apart from his seven wives, perhaps, the second of whom, Vikki, appeared in Playboy. The last to indulge him was Denise Baker, who was 30 years his junior and by his side when he died of pneumonia on Tuesday, aged 95.
They met in the famous Manhattan bar, PJ Clarkes, in 1993, married two decades later and they shared a stage in a short theatrical rerun of his life that she co-wrote and directed, called The Lady and the Champ. It contains LaMottas glib take on his many marriages: My first wife died from eating mushrooms. My second wife died from eating mushrooms. My third wife died of a skull fracture. She refused to eat the mushrooms. The production got worse reviews than LaMottas fight against Fox.
Mrs LaMotta VII told the celebrity gossip site, TMZ, this week: I just want people to know, he was a great, sweet, sensitive, strong, compelling man with a great sense of humour, with eyes that danced.
He was all of that  and he was less as well. He went to reformatory school for attempted burglary (never a good look on the CV: attempted); he beat a bookmaker nearly to death and left him for dead, he was serially cruel to his wives, at least some of the early ones, he got six months on a chain gang for introducing men to underage girls in his Miami nightclub, he got bit parts in movies and he recycled his life in a standup act, the centrepiece of which was the On The Waterfront I could have been a contender monologue that formed such a poignant closing to Raging Bull.
I was not alone in discovering that, to get an interview, the going rate was whatever he felt like asking for on the day. For all his admirable fighting deeds, LaMotta knew well enough that, if it were not for the book and the movie, the life he led would have been as tough to sell as those of his less famous contemporaries.
As Don King says, you dont get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.  theguardian
TRIBUTES
Film director Martin Scorsese has paid tribute to the larger than life Jake LaMotta following the death of the former world middleweight champion boxer.
LaMotta, who passed away on Tuesday at the age of 95, was the inspiration behind Scorseses 1980s classic Raging Bull, which starred Robert De Niro as a young LaMotta looking to earn himself a world title shot in the ring.
Scorsese met LaMotta on a number of occasions and agreed to direct the biographical film when he drew comparisons to the New York natives story, with Raging Bull going on to attract critical claim for De Niros performance and the narrative of LaMottas life.
"He was, as they say, larger than life, Scorsese said after LaMottas death. He lived a tough life, with a lot to overcome, but thats exactly what he did. Im glad to have had the chance to know him.
De Niro chose to keep his tribute to LaMotta to a short, four-word statement, which simply read: Rest in Peace, Champ.
LaMotta sparred with De Niro during his preparations for Raging Bull to ensure he fit the boxer image during filming, with the pair taking part in one-to-one sessions that left the professional impressed with the actors talents  LaMotta would later claim the De Niro could have fought professionally.
In 2013, De Niro spoke about their sparring sessions, and admitted he could not quite believe how well LaMotta could still take a punch despite his growing age. I sparred with people with gear on, but we were careful, De Niro told Time magazine.
We werent looking to kill anyone. Then I trained with Jake. He would say, Hit me, dont worry, dont worry. He was 55, but he was really tough. I didnt realise until I got to his age that you could still take a punch.
De Niro would go on to win an Oscar for his depiction of LaMotta, while Raging Bull was nominated for eight Academy Awards in total, including Best Picture and Best Director. Along with De Niros gong, the film also claimed the Best Editing award.  Independent

Kandy SC fails by a whisker
Abu Dhabi Harlequins RC Western Asia club champs:
Last afternoon at the Nittawela rugby stadium in perfect playing conditions, Kandy Sports Club were expected to pull this game off in their favor, but failed in the process due to sheer bad luck as they were beaten by Bahrain RFC by 24 points (3 goals, 1 penalty) to 23 (1 goal, 2 tries, 1 penalty and 1 drop goal) in the Western Asia club league championship.
The teams were well matched with lots of talent and there were several phases of good rugby. Bahrain RFC tried to push and force things, but failed due to some superb team work from the Kandy Sports Club XV.
Kandy SC failed to play constructive rugby in the first half and took time to settle down which made them close the gap towards the end. The intensity wasnt there as the half time scores indicate Bahrain RFC ahead 24-13.
In the second half, Kandy SC brushed off Bahrain RFC, and never allowed them to score a single point. In the alternate Kandy added ten points with cohesive rugby which proved they are a quality side and produced some enthralling rugby, although they failed to add on the bonus points, which would have helped them to win the title.
The title goes back to last years winners Abu Dhabi Harlequins Rugby Club who have a win and a draw.
For Bahrain RFC it was Mark Burnell, Irwin Philips Rich Muncaster who did the scoring and kicks at goal were off the boot of Luke Bradley.
For Kandy SC skipper Gayan Weeraratne, Anuruddha Wilawara (two) scored the tries and the goal, penalty and the drop goal came from the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe.

## Title: New Constitution to solve national issues

New Constitution to solve national issues
All those interested in resolving the national problem accept that a major step was taken by the Yahapalanaya when interim report of the steering committee set up under the Constitutional Assembly was presented by its Chairman Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressing that Sri Lanka should remain one undivided and indivisible country where maximum devolution should be granted. PM explained that it states, there shall be specific provisions included in the Constitution to prevent secession.
The report has proposed provincial councils would be the primary unit of devolution while local bodies have been named as the implementing agency of both the central government and the provincial councils. Under the heading Division of Powers between the several tiers of government to be clear and unambiguous the report states; there is general consensus, including among the Chief Ministers who made submissions before the Steering Committee, that powers must be clearly and unambiguously divided. Previous week masses were happy about the implementation of the Office of Missing Persons Act.
Democratic institutions
The independent OMP is expected to inquire into petitions relating to thousands of people who disappeared and give these families at least the consolation of knowing what has happened or not happened to their loved ones. Though it does not include prosecution and punishment for the war time criminals, getting the truth out is a major consolation. One can hope, within the coming months or years, masses will see effective checks and balances among the four main democratic institutions -- the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the media. But as the Dharma yuddaya for democracy is starting from the side of the needy, shaking the corrupt bigoted rich people, the past fascistic rulers start their counter strategy. Certainly villains will get defeated; however to reach that vision of democracy, the downtrodden have a long way to go.
Son of Philip entered the Dharma yuddaya when he declared that their proposals included to repeal the executive powers of the President to some extent while to appoint a President elected by the votes of all the communities to uphold the position of unitary state of the country.
Unfortunately same position was declared by Nimal Siripala de Silva. NGOs do not represent the people. The steering committee therefore should focus on the citizens of the country and consider their ideas as well, Dinesh Gunawardena said while highlighting that the constitutional steering committee interim report only highlighted ideas of a small group. Further, he said the Joint Opposition would not allow anyone to change the status guaranteed for Buddhism in the present Constitution. In the streets they were helped by the healthcare and education services countrywide strike action. Though they claim it is not connected to this national debate, coincidence is obvious.
Parliament should not be allowed to reverse the victories which were accomplished by uniting the country after defeating terrorism, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said speaking at the launch of ELIYA Forum in Colombo recently. He explained that people fear, the accomplished victories would be scraped by bringing in a new Constitution. This is why experts coming from different fields decided to create the Eliya to enlighten the public about the new Constitution. We want to inform the people that the new Constitution should not be brought in, he said.
We must be grateful to this fascistic leader for coming out openly challenging democracy that has grown in the Lankan soil in recent history. He candidly admitted that there were shortcomings in the current Constitution but said the motives behind the introduction of a new Constitution were dreadful! Of course it is dreadful for the fascistic gang of Mahinda and Gotabhaya. Then he came out with the stinking lies and filthy distortions they used to throw at militants of democracy. The same groups which collected funds for the LTTE and supplied weapons to them are today attempting to achieve what they could not accomplish from terrorism. The new Constitution is a necessity of separatist Tamil politicians and international organisations which attempted to hinder the war against the LTTE, he said.
False propaganda
However according to war leader Field marshal Fonseka, the fascistic gang, which was a small group of Gotabhaya, who with cruelty and hate committed heinous crimes was the greatest obstacle to the regular war conducted by him and other non criminal soldiers and officers in all four forces. Gota has said that they have no faith in the government which is attempting to introduce the new Constitution. We saw how the government assured army leaders that the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) would not be set up. However, it was established later on. The government always said it would protect war heroes but today a large number of soldiers had been imprisoned, Rajapaksa charged.
What rubbish! Of course there were those in the government ranks that got carried away by the false propaganda of fascistic gang but democracy relentlessly fought back and radicals were able to come with democratic proposals for the constitution and for the election process. Having got defeated in the discussions within the constituent assembly; now they want to confront with strikes, demonstrations, backed by violence and terror. Eliya consist of Ven. (Prof.) Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera, Rev. Fr. Wimal Thirimanna, Dr. Dayan Jayathilaka, Sarath Weerasekara, Thamara Kunanayagam, Manohara de Silva PC, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Rushdie Habeeb and Dr. Seetha Arambepola who addressed the forum. Then there were few Members of clergy, a number of politicians, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, few artistes, academics and professionals attended the event. Apparently they wanted to remove the Yahapalanaya by a group of Honorable Trustees of the people appointed to govern the country as trustees for a limited period! They claim the set up today amounts to Executive and Parliamentary dictatorship. Simple, remove both parliament and president and appoint honourable trustees!
Masses that supported Yahapalanaya expected, in order to implement the promised programme, the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) without attempting to undermine each other should collaborate at least few years. They should be mindful of the potential of so called third force of fascistic Mahinda group.
Fortunately JVP has opted for a position hostile to the fascistic camp where as frontline breakaway group is becoming the militant red coloured tail of the fascistic force. They claim the democratic demands of the Tamil speaking people are tied to the American and Indian imperialism. They take the private medical college SAITM as an imperialist project to take over Lanka! They say they are independent but there attacks, strikes road blocks, Hartal have been essential components of the struggle of Mahinda to takeover the country. However apart from SAITM campaign led by medics others have avoided confrontation avoiding mixing with fascistic politics. Bigger problem today is unfortunately internal; while a section of the government led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe strongly support the main document of the proposed new constitution which will transfer the Executive Powers to the parliament and the office of the prime minister after 2020.
Executive Powers
SLFP group wants the office of the president to retain the Executive Powers. Latter say that before an overhaul of the constitution is made, the people want the government to deliver on the many other promises they made.
They argue that government should stop itself getting entangled in sillara politics or retail politics from now on and focus on a few big wins, where high-profile scandals are investigated fully and offenders are brought to justice and judged according to the law of the land. However masses are less interested in robbery and corruption than brutal murders and racist violence against innocent people especially children.
Those who oppose democratic constitution and prepare for a struggle will be the biggest enmity of the people.

Novel water supply project for Jaffna
A new water supply project has been proposed for the Jaffna peninsula.
The project envisages making use of 20% of the annual rainfall into the Vadamarachchi Lagoon with a surface area of 78 sq km. This project approved by the Cabinet and the Northern Province Chief Minister, is implemented under the guidance of engineer A.D. S. Gunewardana, former Irrigation Ministry Secretary and retired Irrigation Director.
The Northern Development Committee, appointed by the Prime Minister, working out of the Policy Development Office, monitors implementation, a press release issued by the Policy Development Office, said yesterday.
The actual fact is the real loss of 1250mm of annual rainfall through evaporation year after year has never been taken into water balance equation by experts who engaged on this by GOSL. The Dutch and a number of British Government Agents have tried their hands at supplying water through the lagoon with little success. However, the specialists who were engaged with this matter have established one important fact. The lagoon can be leached under controlled conditions.
Lately the Israeli, American, German and Australian consultants have carried out feasibility studies to supply water to the Jaffna population.
All these attempts were unsuccessful.Now a Sri Lankan engineer, Prof. R. K. Guganeshrajah of the Surrey University has come up with the new proposal to prevent evaporation partly with a simple but brilliant engineering intervention by storing 20% of total rainfall on 78 sq km in a small tank of 10 sq km thereby reducing the surface area from which evaporation takes place.

National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act debate:
Money given to multinational companies on pretext of providing free health: Rajitha
On the pretext of providing free health, money had been given to multinational companies and laws updated for the benefit of a chosen few. There was also a huge tender scam in supplying drugs. Five specialist committees were appointed for the regulation of drugs. But from next year, measures have been taken to produce 85% of the drug requirements within the country and the government was able to make health services a completely free service, said Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He said so at the commencement of the debate on the regulations under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, in Parliament yesterday.
Presenting two regulations of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority with regard to the pricing of medical devices such as intraocular lenses, he explained the reasons that the prices had to be increased. Senaratne said since registration in 2009, for the past eight years, there had not been any increase in the prices of medical devices. Moreover, this institution is no longer a State institution and it's now a private institution under the new national drugs policy. Hence the salaries should be paid by the Authority itself. There are also specialised committees appointed and these committees need to be paid unlike in the past where these were free. However, if you take the increase in prices, this is the lowest in the region. What we expect through the increase in these charges is a better service. One is that in the past, due to the low charges, one representative registers many types of drugs, sometimes the same drug under various brands and
varying in price. Then he deals solely with the highest priced brand and he presents that to the government too. This has paved the way for many unnecessary drugs to be imported to the country. Now we have made the registration simple and it could be done online and through the data processing system. We have also appointed five specialist committees comprising specialist doctors, he said.
The Health Minister said there has also been a huge reduction in around 300 medicines. This had an impact in the market. He said he had tried to regulate the prices of expensive medicines, but did not interfere in the scientific aspect.
We have also reduced the price of intraocular lenses and all state hospitals are provided with these lenses free of charge. We have also reduced the price of stents. Around 150,000 patients died due to their inability to spend for their medical facilities. They did not have free health services. Now we have changed that and we have spent up to 1.8 million and we are ready to spend even more. Earlier, there was a limit on allocations for cancer patients and once a patient reaches that limit, he is simply put on pain killers and he feels he is dying due to his illness, he said, adding that now no patient is deprived of the opportunity to receive treatment.
He said there was also a great tender fraud and the drug companies monopolised the medical sector. Next to the weapons mafia, the next in the world is the medicines mafia. But he said now the government has changed all that and created a huge difference in the health sector that is beneficial to the patients.
Senaratne noted that not a single company reacted when the prices of intraocular lenses was reduced. We have used scientific methods and we were assisted by the Customs as well. We were able to do so much because we had a strong National Medicines Regulatory Authority.
We have now signed 38 agreements with regard to manufacturing of medicines within the country. By next year, we anticipate to produce 85% of the requirement of medicines within the country. We also intend to regulate authority for both foreign and local indigenous medicines. We will also introduce price regulations on private hospitals in future too, said Minister Senaratne.
The Import Export (Control) Act and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act were debated in Parliament yesterday.
Tele Drama industry, artistes facing hardships: Alagiyawanna
Due to foreign Tele dramas and films being telecast on local channels, local Tele dramas and artistes are facing a huge challenge. Hence, proper laws and standards should be implemented, said Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna.
The Deputy Minister said so in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by JVP- MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa regarding issues faced by the local Tele Drama industry.
Due to foreign Tele dramas being telecast on local channels, local Tele dramas and artistes are facing a huge challenge. Through taxes so far Rs. 1.5 billion is being collected. Discussions also have been held with several parties in the Tele drama field. However, there are no standards set for Tele dramas and proper laws in this regard are required. However, even through the new Budget, taxes should be imposed in a manner that is fair to all. The taxes were imposed since 2006 but there are irregularities and discrepancies. All these will be addressed and rectified, the Minister said.
By the imposition of taxes on foreign films Rs. 36.5 million was earned in revenue in 2016. The income derived through taxes imposed on foreign tele dramas in 2015 was Rs. 89.4 million while in 2016, Rs. 124.1 million was earned.
'Govt. has adopted a people centric health policy, not one that favours doctors'
The Government has adopted a people centric health policy and not one that favours doctors, said State Finance Minister Eran Wickremeratne.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, joining the debate on the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act.
We knew that there was a medicines mafia operative in this country. For years, medicines under different brand names were imported at exorbitant prices and the people had no choice other than to pay this price which greatly profited the medicine importers. However, from 1976 to 2017, nothing was done to address this issue. But the current Health Minister took a bold decision and implemented regulatory measures and consequently the prices of 48 medicines were reduced, Minister Wickremeratne said.
However, he pointed out that the current government has brought in a drugs policy. This is not a doctor centric policy, but a people centric policy. We have reduced the prices of intraocular lenses. Free education is given to all and doctors are obliged to provide their services to the people. This is free health service. No room should be given to destroy the faith people have on doctors and no one should be allowed to monopolise the medical field, he said, adding that the emergency ambulance service will be implemented throughout the country.
Minister Wickremeratne said that health services should be made available to all without discrimination and called on all to join together in building a quality health service in this country.
70th Anniversary of Parliamentary sittings: Special sessions fixed for October 3
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, announced that a special session had been fixed for October 3, 2017 to mark the 70th year anniversary since the introduction of the Parliamentary system in Sri Lanka.
The Speaker announced that the Parliamentary Business Committee had decided on Thursday, to hold extra parliamentary sittings on September 26 and on October 09 as well.
According to Parliament sources, the debate on the amendments to the Municipal, Urban Council and Pradeshiya Sabha Ordinances would be taken up on September 26, 2017. Sources also said that these amendments would be made to provide proper legal effect to Municipal and Pradeshiya Sabhas, the mixed electoral system introduced for local bodies recently.
Meanwhile sources also said that the session on October 09 would be held for debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee presented before the Constitutional Assembly on Thursday.
Parliament yesterday approved motions to hold special sessions.
Changes to power sector vital or people would face severe hardships :Niroshan
As a country when we consider the rapid economic development and social transformation, we should provide an uninterrupted power supply of a high standard, said State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Niroshan Perera in Parliament yesterday.
He pointed out that if changes were not made to the power network, we could face a severe crisis in the near future which could have dire consequences on the lives of the people. If we were to keep postponing these issues and fail to invest in the power sector, it could affect the productivity and standard of the power sector paving the way for a massive power crisis.
The minister said the power sector was constantly evolving, based on modern technology. Hence, we need to focus on long term strategies that would be beneficial to the country. During the past, there was an electricity mafia in the country that was ruining the countrys economy. Some politicians and government officials were only concerned about their commissions and personal benefits, while trying to structure the power sector to suit their sinister motives, he added.
Marine Drive will not affect S. Thomas' College play ground: Kiriella
The play ground of S Thomas' College Mount Lavinia would not be affected by the Colombo Marine Drive extension, said Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
Minister Kiriella made this observation while tabling an answer in response to a question raised for oral answers by MP S M Marikar in the House.
"We will use modern technology and protect the play ground of S Thomas' College when constructing the Marine Drive is done," minister Kiriella said.
The minister said decisions whether to extend the drive from Dehiwala to Panadura would be made after a feasibility study. He said two consultation companies have been chosen to carry out the study.

## Title: SC gives major assurance to voter democracy

SC gives major assurance to voter democracy
While the Supreme Court earns the worthy respect of the people for its decision on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the decision has also shown that the independence of the judiciary is a reality today, which is a major change from the situation that prevailed for more than a decade before the major political change of January 2015, and especially bad during the near decade of the Rajapaksa Regime.
In deciding that the proposed changes to the Provincial Council electoral process, which included the postponement of some provincial council polls that are due very soon, and the move to enable parliament to decide on the timing of PC elections, the Supreme Court has clearly established the rights of the voters to decide on such major issues that involve the core of democracy. The Supreme Court has addressed the concerns of the people, expressed very strongly by the political parties and civil society organisations that opposed the governments move to change the PC electoral process, stating the proposed changes would need both a 2/3rd majority in Parliament as well as a national referendum.
It is a fact that the government paid little heed to the concerns expressed by those who opposed this move, on the grounds that letting Parliament decide on the timing of such elections would give such decisions a strong political hue that challenges the importance of the democratic process on such major electoral decisions. While the thinking of the government to hold all PC elections on the same day has much in favour, considering the cost and organisational abilities, and preventing the benefits that some political parties would gain by having polls on different days by their ability to bring all resources to one or two provinces at a time; the major issue against, it in the current context, was the politics that would necessarily prevail when Parliament decides on such a date.
Making the people of Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern Provinces whos Provincial Councils complete their current terms in late September and early October, and in all other PCs, to wait till the end of 2018, when the term of the Northern Provincial Council ends, would have enabled Parliament to manage the affairs of the dissolved PCs until Northern PC poll is due, enabling parliamentary politics to manipulate the fixing of the final date for the election of all PCs. This is certainly moving against the principle of democracy on which the PCs are elected, and the Supreme Court has made it clear that such political cum parliamentary majoritarian manipulation of the democratic process is wholly unacceptable.
The amendment to the Provincial Council election process passed in Parliament this week will introduce a change in the system of voting, moving away from the system of complete Proportional Representation (PR) to one of 60 per cent on First Past the Post and the balance with PR. It has also provided for a mandatory 30 per cent of women candidates to be included in the nomination papers of parties and independent groups contesting PC polls from now on. These are favourable changes that strengthen the democratic process, and assurance by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the Sabaragamuwa, NCP and Easter PC polls would be held by March next year, or even earlier, is most welcome for the progress of democracy in the provincial councils.
The government has thus overcome a major clash with the Opposition and democratic political forces in the country, which was not in any way necessary in pursuing a policy of democratic administration.
Of course, the SC ruling on the necessity of a referendum will also impact in favour of those in the government and opposition, who are opposed to any major changes in the Constitution, and would be a push back to the all or major constitutional reform.
Coming political clashes
With the Local Government and PC polls now becoming a reality after all the planned, organisational and legal delays that now appear to have been overcome, the elections when held will certainly show new political realities, which will give more impact to the much publicized clashes between the SLFP and the Joint Opposition (JO). The divisions in the SLFP are now moving to more concrete situations, where the Sirisena Rajapaksa rivalry can come to an open confrontation that will not be easily avoided.
The division between the members of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), where the SLFP is the largest party, will certainly come to a much sharper situation than what prevailed during the General Election in August 2105. The alliances of the SLFP membership in the country have not yet been tested, and the time is fast approaching when that test will take place. In the next elections, whether Local Government or PC, there is all possibility of a clear two-way clash between the SLFP ranks, unlike in August 2015, when the UPFA and SLFP remained largely united. This did change with that large number of SLFPers who joined the Sirisena  Ranil Government after August 2015, in what was called a Grand Coalition of National Unity. Meanwhile, the JO has continued to carry on a campaign against the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena to the UPFA/SLFP, emphasizing on the importance of the Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership.
As the call for the new elections take place, the divisions between the UPFA/SLFP alliance will certainly move to a break, with the JO members who wish to contest these polls having to come under a different party label.
The SLFP organisation is firmly under the control and direction of President Sirisena, although one is uncertain of the local membership level. With the official SLFP running its own candidates in these elections, the JO group will of necessity have to contest either as an independent group, or as it seems most likely now under the Si Lanka Podujana Pakshaaya (SLPP) banner. Mahinda Rajapaksa has already indicated this would be the reality. Which would mean the Maithripala Sirisena led SLFP/UPFA contesting under the Chair or Betel Leaf symbol and the SLPP contesting under the flower bud symbol. This will be a major test of the actual popularity of the two rival leaders, and will also show the position of the SLFP membership, especially in the rural sector where it is believed to be strongest.
The legality
This brings out a major issue of the legality of rivalry within a single political party. There has been a judgment in the past when politicians who challenged the leadership of a major political party had to fight on their own, as seen with the failed challenge that the late Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake post to then President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The present SLFP members, who remain supportive of Mahinda Rajapaksa, will be unable to contest on the Blue party ticket, when the Sirisena-led SLFP nominates its own candidates, The Rajapaksa-JO group will then have to contest the official SLFP candidates, from the SLPP, as indicated at present, which will raise a major legal issue of their continuing to be SLFP members. The opinion of many legal and political analysts is that they could very well lose their SLFP membership.
The result will be an open clash between the official and formal SLFP (whatever its mass membership base) with a rival political party. It is only the post-election count that will show the actual strength of the rival groups, but it is a very good organisational position for the Sirisena faction, with the key party posts and the local organiser posts held by its members.
Jumbo benefit
The clash between the SLFP rivals will certainly be of much benefit to the UNP, which will be formally opposed by both factions, and possibly by the JVP too, in the Sinhala majority areas. The most likely result would be a success or the UNP, due to the rivalry among its main opponent, fighting in two actions.
There is also a strong possibility that the JVP, as the party that has not controlled government power, except in a short lived coalition, getting much more support, especially from those who voted for the Common Candidate in January 2015, with their determination to continue with the change, with those who have never held the reins of power.
However, as the SLFP clash and rivalry widens, the UNP, despite the image problems over the Bond Scams and other issues of corruption that keeps emerging, has a chance of gaining the major benefits from the politics of division in the opposition ranks.
These clashes, and the possible success of the UNP, could well be a major opportunity for the Eliya strategists, if they are able to present a message that will go beyond the crooked politics of today.

Speaker instructs Minister to conduct special audit
Alleged misuse of Bandarawela road construction funds:
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday instructed Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha to conduct a special audit into an alleged misuse of money in Bandarawela by allocating funds twice for the construction of rural roads.
The Speaker made this observation yesterday when Badulla UNP Parliamentarian Chaminda Wijesiri brought to the notice of Parliament that Rs.4 million allocated by the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry and directed to the Uva Provincial Council for construction of rural roads under the Development of 10,000 km Rural Roads Project has been misused.
Minister Musthapa asked the Parliamentarian to direct the copies of the letters to him and he would direct his officials to make a special audit inquiry.
However,a heated argument arose between MP Wijesiri and Minister Musthapha when the former alleged that the line ministry had sent funds to the District Development Coordination Committee. There had been a violation of the constitution. MP should be aware that no line ministry sends funds to District Development Coordination Committees. It is done by the Provincial Councils, the minister said.
However, the Speaker too agreed that the Minister was correct and there had been no violation of the Constitution but an investigation should be carried out if there had been a fraud.
MP Wijesiri said that the Ministry had allocated money on July 25 this year for development of 28 roads. The UVA Chief Minister had laid the foundation for some roads.
Some projects have already been completed.The constructions of some are in progress.Money has already been allocated for some projects, MP Wijesiri said. Money also has been allocated for the construction of some roads in areas where any construction has been banned by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) due to the Uma Oya project issue. MP Sunil Handunetti said this matter could be brought before the Committee On Public Accounts and as for the Ministry a special audit inquiry could be made to find out if there is a fraud.

We work in a conscientious and transparent manner -AGs Counsel
Counsel of the Attorney Generals Department delivering a special statement before the Presidential Commission investigating into the Central Bank Bond issue yesterday said that they perform their duties in a conscientious and transparent manner and do not engage in any conduct that would amount to fraudulent misappropriation of public funds.
Our conduct throughout the inquiry proceedings of this Commission and in the conduct of investigations, have been guided by our resolve to assist this Commission to unearth the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth and in national and public interest, the counsel said.
The full statement is as follows: On September 20, 2017, following Senior Additional Solicitor General Mr. Dappula De Livera, PC, having made an application for a brief adjournment of proceedings to commence the examination of Mr.Arjuna Mahendran, while initially objecting to the application and later diluting that submission, Presidents Counsel Mr.Romesh De Silva made reference to the team of counsel from the Attorney Generals Department assisting the Commission, participating at the Commission at the tax payers expense. Ostensibly, Mr.De Silva made such a reference following instructions to do so from his client Mr.Arjuna Mahendran, and having received fees to make such an utterance.
In view of the insinuation made against officers of the Attorney Generals Department assisting this Commission, that we are wasting tax payers money by moving for an adjournment of proceedings, it has now become necessary to place on record the manner in which the ten of us are utilising tax payers money. We are compelled to make this statement due to a couple of other reasons as well, including an allegation that was made sometime ago by another person, that officers of the Attorney Generals Department are working at this Commission in the manner we do, in anticipation of promotions.
Indeed we are conscious of the need to ensure that we as well as all other public functionaries who exist on public funds which includes money contributed by tax payers, perform our duties in a conscientious and transparent manner, and do not engage in any conduct that would amount to fraudulent misappropriation of public funds or an extravagant use thereof. We are also mindful of the need to ensure that, public funds are used in national interests and in the best interests of the public.
In fact, as public servants who are assisting this Commission in addition to most of our routine duties and responsibilities, we are entitled in terms of applicable circulars to receive an additional monthly allowance. However, all of us took a decision way back in March this year, to refrain from collecting that allowance to which we are entitled to. We believe that, such voluntary service to the nation is appropriate, particularly when assisting a Commission of Inquiry, which in our view is investigating and inquiring into what has now been revealed to be in our view, one of the largest financial scams, if not the largest financial scam, independent Sri Lanka has ever been victim to.
We have served this Commission to the best of our ability, and we believe that our services have resulted in this Commission unearthing shockingly wrongful, illegal and massively fraudulent activities which have resulted in loss to the exchequer of this country of unprecedented magnitude.
We wish to emphasise that our conduct throughout the inquiry proceedings of this Commission and in the conduct of investigations, have been guided by our resolve to assist this Commission to unearth the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and in national and public interest. It is a time consuming process, which we are engaging in.
We also wish to reiterate that, the application for a postponement of the examination of Mr. Arjun Mahendran was made due to reasons beyond our control, in order to get fully prepared, and not for the purpose of enjoying luxuries at the expense of tax payers.
We believe that, Your Honours the Honourable Commissioners who have most judiciously being hearing and considering the evidence led, those who have observed these proceedings objectively and on a daily basis, and the public who have had the benefit of detailed reporting of these proceedings by the media, will finally judge us and determine whether we have wasted even a rupee of the tax payers money.
Thus, we wish to deplore the comment made by Mr. Romesh De Silva, remaining mindful of the fact that, he may have been prompted to say what he said on instructions, and fees paid by his client,the statement said.

Who is fooling whom
There have been lofty claims by the present cricket hierarchy on how smart their decision making is compared to those made by the Interim Committee/s that preceded their tenure in office.
The examination of one such claim on how cricket was down in the doldrums during the tenure of the previous Interim Committee and how they have improved performance reveals the true story.
People holding high office often make unsubstantiated and false claims knowing very well that most such irresponsible statements are mired in subjectivity.
However, we are now presented with a situation where subjectivity can be completely ruled out and a very fair analysis can be carried out.
The Indian cricket team played a series of 3 Test matches in Sri Lanka during the tenures of both administrations one led by Sidath Wettimuny and the other by Thilanga Sumathipala. A simple apple with apples comparison tells readers the simple truth.

Some stark revelations that the above statistics reveal are;
 India was not allowed to cross the 400 run mark even once during their previous tour. However, during the recently concluded tour they surpassed the 400 run mark by a long way accumulating 622 for the loss of 9 wickets. Sri Lanka knocked over 58 Indian wickets during the previous tour but lost only 32 wickets accumulating an aggregate of 1,949 (528 more runs than Sri Lanka) on their way to achieving their only Test series whitewash overseas during the history of Indian cricket.
 The lack of penetration in the bowling attack showed up like a sore thumb during the recent tour whereas the Indian team was bowled out under 400 runs in all innings barring one where they declared their innings for the loss of 8 wickets in the second test during the previous series.
 The Sri Lankan team was far more competitive during the previous tour with all games going down to the wire and finishing on the fifth day.
In fact, Sri Lanka may well have gone on to achieve a series win if Kusal Perera had not perished playing a reverse sweep at a crucial passage of play during the 3rd Test played at the SSC grounds.
In contrast, the team wilted without a challenge during the recent tour where all games concluded under four days during the recent series.
 Historically, it has always been the Sri Lankan seam bowlers that have troubled the Indian batting. It was evident during the previous series in 2015 that the Interim Administration was mindful of this weakness judging by the type of fast tracks that were prepared and the bowling combinations that were picked throughout the series.
In stark contrast the present administration was unwisely attempting to beat the Indians at their own game by preparing turning tracks.
Yet another glaring example of the lack of knowledge and focus of the current administration.
The Interim Administration of Sidath Wettimuny made several changes post Indian tour where the Head Coach exited and several changes made to the team by drafting in several new faces.
Kusal Mendis and Milinda Siriwardhena were two such worthy of mention and Sri Lanka went on to win the next series against the West Indies 2-0 in Tests, 3-0 in ODIs and squared the T20s 1-1. It needs to be mentioned that the West Indies team that was beaten in this manner was far more potent than the Zimbabwean and Bangladeshi teams that the Sri Lankan team lost to under the present administration. It was plain for any casual observer to notice that the administration was working to a plan. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the current administration that appears to be in shambles and total disarray drifting in stormy seas without a rudder to navigate.
The fervent hope of the cricket loving general public is that the leadership and the government heed these unambiguous signs and bring in the necessary changes provided under the Sports Law of the country.

PC Elections Amendment Bill, anti-democratic
The collective of election monitoring organisations yesterday said the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill passed in Parliament this week was anti-democratic and it aimed to delay the Provincial Council Elections.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said the aim of the act was something else.
"Its utmost purpose was to postpone Provincial Council elections. The Government was misleading the public and get their attention for the Act by marketing some points such as holding election on the same day and the increase of women's representation, he said. The Government had earlier attempted to postpone election via the 20th amendment. But the Supreme Court has halted it. Then they selected this path to reach their goal, he said.
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said the procedure used to pass the Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill is the first ever anti-constitutional attempt reported throughout the Parliament history of Sri Lanka.
He said all the Parliamentarians voted for the bill were responsible for future issues that come as result of passing the bill by breaching laws and traditions of the country.
Executive Director of the Transparency International Sri Lanka Asoka Obeyesekere said the passage of the bill is not an issue. "The most concerning issue is the process followed to pass the Bill," he said.
All of us know about the challenges that the country faced with the 20th amendment bill. We do not have the system of post enactment judicial review. Therefore, we can only change an act before the pre-enactment judicial review. He said. He said the Bill on the Provincial Councils Election Amendment was used to change the electoral system of the Provincial Councils.
"People would say this Government is the one that removed the process for urgent bill through the 19th amendment. We have to wait for the final Provincial Council Election Amendment Bill to know about the actual law. It illustrates that there is a big issue in governance and that the parliament functions and parliamentary process have a big issue.

Unemployment worsened due to current education system
A burning problem in Sri Lanka is the challenge of providing employment to the youth. Being without employment is a big loss not only to the youth concerned but to the entire country, said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
He was addressing the representatives of teachers and university students at his Galagedara office, recently.
In most countries, youths get jobs when they are 18, 19 or 20 years. However, the sad state of affairs in our country is that the prevailing system of education does not enable one to get a job after leaving school. You cannot qualify to get a job merely through knowledge from books. In other countries, those leaving school are enabled to get a job without difficulty as they receive an education which fits them for employment. In Sri Lanka, a student does not get the practical knowledge which makes him suitable to be selected for a job. This has resulted in the increase of youth unemployment, the minister said.
Sri Lanka occupies a high place in comparison with other countries in respect of literacy. It is more than 93 percent. Our student population is more than 4.2 million. The number of schools we have is about 10,200. A total of 353 out of these are national schools. The number of teachers is about 235,032. We have 15 universities. The students who pass out of the schools and the universities annually join the employment queue, he pointed out.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said, We face the challenge of finding employment for them. They should be incorporated actively into the economic processes of the country. This will not be a big challenge if our education system produces persons who fit into the countrys development process, who can contribute to the improvement of the country and who are qualified for employment.
We should develop our agriculture to a high level. It is through the development of rural industries, small-scale industries and medium scale industries that the rural economy can be strengthened. The Presidents attention is primarily focused on the utilization of every inch of land in the country for its development and economic advancement.
It is the duty of all of us to take the country forward by increasing the incomes of the people, by enhancing production, by multiplying employment opportunities and by strengthening peace and amity among communities, the minister said.
Engaging in politics of trickery only to gain power, without taking into consideration the development of the country will not result in the welfare of the people. No one should think of only getting into power through the ballot of the people merely to enjoy the privileges of office. One should use ones office only for the advancement of the cause of the country and the people. It is a crime to do otherwise, he said.
Democracy is well established in our country today. It is the duty of all peoples representatives to utilize that freedom in such a way that it will not harm the forward march of the country. However, some peoples representatives often exceed that limit and act only to realize their personal goals, inviting thereby the opprobrium of intelligent citizens. We should always try to conduct ourselves according to high democratic principles. When we do so peoples representatives will win the respect and the approbation of the people, the minister added.
He said it has become imperative that political parties and peoples representatives work in dedication to minimize unemployment, eradicate poverty, strengthen the economy and usher in a social, economic and cultural regeneration in this country.
However, it has to be said that some political leaders and peoples representatives conduct themselves in an utterly disappointing manner, Minister Amunugama said.

About 75 percent of deaths due to NCDs
About 75 percent of deaths that occur in Sri Lanka are due to Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) while 40 percent of those are due to cardiovascular diseases, Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry Dr. Suraj Perera told the Daily News, yesterday.
According to Dr. Perera, 10 percent of the 75 percent of NCD deaths are due to cancer. Another 10 percent is due to other NCDs. Seven percent of the total number of deaths is due to diabetes. Annually, a total of 138,000 deaths are reported from Sri Lanka.
Dr. Perera added that eight percent of deaths that take place in Sri Lanka are due to chronic respiratory diseases and 11 percent of deaths are due to communicable, maternal, prenatal and nutritional issues. Fourteen percent of deaths are due to various types of injuries. In 1985, there were only 4,416 cancer deaths reported in Sri Lanka but it increased to 9,403 by 2005. In 2009, there were 11,286 cancer deaths in Sri Lanka which shows a clear increase, he added.

UN: Bangladeshi Prime Minister on Thursday proposed creating UN-supervised safe zones inside Myanmar to protect Rohingya Muslims who are fleeing a military crackdown to seek refuge in her country.
These people must be able to return to their homeland in safety, security and dignity, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told the UN General Assembly.
The United Nations says more than 420,000 Rohingya have fled for safety to Bangladesh in the face of an army campaign in northern Rakhine state that includes rape and the burning of villages.
The military operation was sparked by attacks carried out by Rohingya militants on police posts on August 25.
Hasina accused Myanmar authorities of laying landmines on the border to prevent the Rohingyas from returning and said the United Nations must take immediate measures to find a solution to the crisis.
The prime minister laid out a five-point plan that called for the protection of the Rohingyas in safe zones that could be created inside Myanmar under UN supervision. The United Nations has described the military operation as ethnic cleansing and French President Emmanuel Macron went further, describing it as a genocide. Myanmar must stop the violence and the practice of ethnic cleansing, agree to allow a UN fact-finding mission, ensure the return of refugees and abide by a report that recommends citizenship for the Rohingya, said Hasina. They currently lack it.
There has been mounting international outrage over the plight of the Rohingya, prompting the UN Security Council this month to call for an end to the violence.
The creation of such safe areas would require the approval of the Security Council where China, a strong supporter of Myanmar's former junta, has veto power.
The 1.1-million strong Rohingya people have suffered years of discrimination in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship even though many have longstanding roots in the country.
The recent exodus of Rohingya has brought the number of refugees from Rakhine living in Bangladesh to over 800,000, said the prime minister.- AFP

Can Sri Lanka finish among top three
2017 Asian Rugby Sevens Series second leg in South Korea :
Sri Lankan Tuskers are ready for the high expectation that comes with their fighting nature where they will look to get the tournament second leg off to a winning start in the Asian Sevens series 2nd leg in Incheon Namdong Asiad Rugby Stadium in South Korea today.
In this second leg Sri Lankans are drawn in Pool A along with Japan, China and Chinese Taipei.
The players are going to have no excuses in terms of being able to come out and be comfortable where they are playing and their placing as they are bunch of professional rugby players. In reality that comes with added experience, expectation as well and a bit of pressure the players put on themselves.
There is plenty on the line for a Sri Lankan sevens rugby outfit that has exuded a relaxed and focused vibe during training for the past two weeks at Racecourse International Stadium in Colombo.
Its always a bonus that doing well will get you to this kind of top tournaments especially playing against the best like Japan, Hong Kong and South Korean teams in Asia.
Selection committee chairman of Sri Lanka Rugby Michael Jayasekara said, We had an injury problem to our wing three quarter Buddhima Piyaratne, so we had to replace him with experience player Srinath Sooriyabandara in the last minute. We got a very young side that is really good, hence if we play to our potential, I am expecting them to finish at least among the top three in the tournament in South Korea as we are really capable of achieving this.
On 23 September Sri Lanka will play Japan at 7.14 am (SL time), China at 10.32 am (SL time) and their final match for the day will be against Chinese Taipei at 1.28 pm (SL time).
The 12 member probable full squad of players who will represent each of the eight teams will be.
Sri Lanka - Sudarshana Muthuthanthri, Jason Dissanayake, Kevin Dixon, Omalka Gunaratne, Naveen Henakankanamage, Tarinda Ratwatte, Danushka Ranjan, Sudam Sooriyaarachchi, Danush Dayan, Chanaka Chandimal, Hirantha Perera, Srinath Sooriyabandara.

## Title: A Constitution for All
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, September 23, 2017 - 01:00
A Constitution for All
There is a raging debate on the merits and demerits of a new Constitution. This is a healthy feature of a vibrant democracy where debate and consensus go hand in hand. Significantly, all the political parties represented in Parliament participated in the Constitutional Assembly process that seeded the new Constitution, even though some parties pulled out in the latter stages. Even the parties not represented in Parliament got an opportunity to make oral and written submissions to panels that sought public views. Thus all the stakeholders had an opportunity to present their views on a new Constitution.
The new Constitution is one that ensures a strong economy based on a progressive framework, where its benefits will be shared by all citizens, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is also the Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly. The Prime Minister made this comment when the Interim Report of the Constitutional Steering Committee was submitted to Parliament on Thursday.
There was near-universal agreement among political parties, civil society groups and the public that the 1978 Constitution was well past its prime. Changing times require different approaches. Post-conflict Sri Lanka faces a myriad of new challenges to address which we require a different Constitutional framework. This is in essence the raison d'tre of the new Constitution.
Post-conflict, the biggest challenge is fostering reconciliation among different communities and religious groups. The conflict pitted brother against brother and affected communal and religious harmony that had existed for centuries. The onus is on the Government to resolve this issue, ensure lasting peace and reconciliation and create a truly Sri Lankan identity among the populace. President Maithripala Sirisena, in his well-received address to the United Nations General Assembly, focused extensively on this issue and urged the International Community to support the Government in this endeavour.
But reconciliation is anathema to communalists in both the North and the South who espouse extremist and virulent views that aim to perpetuate the ethnic divide. Ethnic strife is their oxygen, without which they can longer deceive their communities. Hence their attempts to scuttle the movement towards a new Constitution by spreading various lies about it.
They created a phobia among Sri Lankans that the new Constitution would take away the countrys unitary status and also nullify the foremost place given to Buddhism. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have unequivocally stated that the country will firmly retain the unitary character and the foremost place given to Buddhism. In fact, the Prime Minister noted that the formulation of our new Constitution is being done on the very principles of Buddhism.
Many moderate Tamil politicians including Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Minister Mano Ganeshan have categorically stated that they do not want to see changes on such issues. On the other hand, all parties, even the extremist parties on both sides, have agreed in principle that devolution of power to some extent is essential to resolve the outstanding issues facing the country. It is up to the parties to decide the nature and units of devolution.
We already do have devolution of power in the form of Provincial Councils and Local Government Institutions. Those involved in formulating the Constitution must necessarily examine whether these institutions are sufficient or whether we need alternative mechanisms that take devolution further. However, the fact that all parties are keen to contest the next Provincial Council Election shows their commitment to the concept of devolution. Prime Minster Wickremesinghe stressed that safeguards will be built-in to ensure that no province can secede.
The voter is at the heart of any democracy. Recent events in Parliament have reinforced the value of the vote. Parliament this week voted overwhelmingly to amend the Provincial Council election Act giving greater representation to women and also making it possible to hold all PC polls on the same day. Moreover, the Polls will be held mainly on the First-Past-the-Post system which enables a level playing field for all candidates.
All parties and independent groups will now have to ensure that their nomination lists have at least 25 percent women. This is long overdue, because we have one of the lowest rates of political participation by women even in South Asia. One of the prime reasons for the lack of womens representation (especially professionally qualified women who had no family political connections) was the Proportional Representation (PR) system, where each candidate had to spend at least Rs.100 million to campaign within an entire district as opposed to a single electorate under the First-Past-the-Post system. Other factors such as election violence and elections law violations by strong-arm male candidates also kept many women away.
Holding all PC (and Local Government) elections on the same day is another praiseworthy idea. This will reduce overall administration costs and also ensure that no Government can pour in all State resources to a single province or two to win an election, a la Wayamba 1999. These measures, as well as the new Constitution in the offing, will make Sri Lanka a more mature, even more vibrant democracy.

Devout journalist
Noel Robert Jolly Aaron:
At this sad moment of the passing away of Noel Robert Jolly Aaron, I have special reason to be sentimental about his departure.
I am the oldest surviving editorial staffer of Lake House, possessing a wealth of information and personal memories about journalism and journalists of this prestigious institution. My esteemed friend and colleague, who just passed away, was perhaps one of the last surviving members of dedicated journalists. He belonged to an exclusive tribe that held classical devotion to professional journalism as a personality medal.
Aaron was actively present in journalism when he was on the staff of Lake House at a number of levels. Through the hours, he sat at the desk. He was never moved by the hands of the clock. His agenda was set by the need to fulfill his professional duty, whatever the hour maybe.
I tend to think he had hardly any other life than what he had as a professional journalist at Lake House. I remember some people saying that even after his retirement at the end of a fruitful and complete tenure, he was in the habit of standing on the pavement gazing at Lake House. This is not a mere bit of odd information nor a rumour or an attempt to underline an eccentricity. His devotion called for that kind of unusual gesture.
At times, he appeared and sounded stubborn, but that is entirely because his loyalty to his professionalism called for such an attitude. Whatever the external manifestations and gestures were, he was a totally humane individual inside. He was only driven by his insistent urge to be perfectly professional. At times, he would walk the corridors of Lake House in something of a trance probably pondering on something he missed or he had to do. When everything is said and done, what has to be summed up is his classic devotion to the highest values of journalism, in or out of active service that never left his personality. It was a given and built-in. I am quite certain wherever he maybe, after his passage on Earth, he will invariably be preoccupied with what went on in his active life as a classic individual given totally to professional journalism.

## Title: Essex County title win end of the beginning

Essex County title win end of the beginning
"The end of the beginning." Those were the words Essex chief executive Derek Bowden used to sum up the county's first Championship title for a quarter of a century.
The English domestic game has gone through many changes since 1992 when Essex last lifted the Lord's Taverners Trophy, but much of their success in 2017 has been built around a home-grown product.
Eight of the side which beat Warwickshire by an innings at Edgbaston on Thursday have come through the county's age group system.
But, for the first time in its history, an Essex side not featuring Graham Gooch has secured the County Championship.
Tipped as potential relegation candidates at the start of the season after winning Division Two in 2016, Essex's run to the title came courtesy of fine collective performances as well as stand-out achievements from players such as Jamie Porter, Simon Harmer and Nick Browne.
Throw in the presence of former England captain Alastair Cook for most of the season and the return of former players Varun Chopra and Adam Wheater, top flight and international experience has helped take Essex to the next level.
"We genuinely believe one team, one dream," Bowden said. "It's not just the players on the field, but the people behind the scenes - the ground staff, coaching staff, commercial staff.
"There was a strategy and plan for this moment. It has worked."
So who was key in helping a side who were Division Two underachievers become the best in the country in a little under two seasons
TEN DOESCHATE TRACES SUCCESS BACK TO SECOND TIER
The dominance of Ryan ten Doeschate's side this season has been illustrated by the fact they have secured top spot with two games to spare and have won eight of their 12 matches, four more than anyone else to date in Division One.
"It's a hard feeling to describe, it's something I've been thinking about literally every night I've gone to bed about how we can get this job done," Ten Doeschate told BBC Essex.
"The boys just kept delivering. It's been an amazing season and it's been so worth the effort we've all put in."
Ten Doeschate tracks the county's achievement in 2017 back to the start of 2016 when they started to build momentum in four-day performances.
"Literally from game to game, we feel like we've played better cricket since beating Gloucestershire at the start of last season," he said.
"There's a belief that goes back that far and we've just transferred it to a division higher."
PORTER LEADS FROM THE FRONT
Among those whose performances this season will have grabbed headlines have been Essex fast bowler Jamie Porter.
The 24-year-old, who almost gave up the game early in 2014, has claimed 64 Division One scalps in 12 games to date at an average of 17.86, one more than spinner Simon Harmer at 20.19.
But the West Ham supporter, who was almost lost to the world of recruitment when he thought a professional career might be beyond him, is happy to share the plaudits. "As a side we've been very good, everyone's contributed," he told BBC Essex."Everyone who's played has played a part and the coaching staff have been unbelievable.
"We feel we've had every base covered with our bowling attack.
"We've gone to grounds in the past couple of games where if they've produced a green seamer, we've got the bowlers for that or if they produce a turning pitch, we've got the best spinner in the country.
"I always looked up to David Masters when I played with him. I wanted to become the leader of the attack and be the guy that the skipper throws the ball to when he needs a wicket.
"That's what I'm trying to be - lead from the front, take responsibility and do my part for the team."
South African Harmer, who was originally recruited in the winter on a one-year Kolpak contract, was quickly secured on a two-year extension in June once his performances started propelling Essex to the summit.
WILL SILVERWOOD'S SUCCESS OPEN DOOR TO ENGLAND JOB
Head coach Chris Silverwood has overseen Essex's march to the title with a cool persona.
His steady stewardship has led many to tip the former Yorkshire and Middlesex bowler, who played six Tests for his country, to be England's next bowling coach.
"It would be somewhat disappointing if Chris wasn't on the radar of England," Essex chairman John Faragher told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra. "He is a talented coach.
"He's enjoying time his here and has done a great job."
In the same season as Silverwood's coaching stock has risen, Tom Westley has made an England Test debut and fast bowler Porter has been tipped as a possible Ashes squad member.
"Chris has brought lot of thought. He is an intelligent man as well as a coach," chief executive Bowden added.
"He has thought about the squad, his coaching staff, the scouting network. He isn't just a coach. He is far more intelligent than that."
Despite potential advances from the national team for the crop of their playing and coaching talent, Faragher believes Essex will continue to thrive as a result.
"We're ambitious," he said. "It's good for us to see a player represent England, and if Chris goes on to work with England then so be it."
Porter, meanwhile, is staying level-headed about talk of a place on the plane to Australia in October. "I don't expect to be on that Ashes tour," he said. "If I am, that'll be a dream come true and I'll try my hardest to take that opportunity. I'm just going to take everything as it comes."  BBC

Finn (8/79) gives Middlesex crucial win in survival bid
LONDON: Steven Finn's eight-wicket haul inspired Middlesex to a 36-run win over Lancashire at Lord's and boosted the 2016 champions' hopes of survival.
Lancashire, chasing 221, were bowled out for 184 with Finn claiming 8-79.
Middlesex face fellow strugglers Somerset in their final game.
Haseeb Hameed retired hurt on 23 during the morning session after being struck on the hand by a James Harris delivery, and returned with his side nine wickets down, but did not add to his score.
The 20-year-old England opener, who was later revealed to have fractured a finger on his right hand, had on-field treatment but struggled to hold the bat and left the field for more than three hours.
A broken finger ended Hameed's involvement in last winter's Test tour of India, and his latest injury comes two days after Middlesex seamer Toby Roland-Jones, tipped to make England's Ashes squad, went down with a lower back complaint.
The 20 points collected from this game mean that, regardless of how their rivals perform in their ongoing matches, Middlesex will be safe if they win their final fixture of the season at Taunton, which starts on Monda
Surrey took a firm grip of their match against relegation-rivals Somerset on day three before rain and bad light ended play early at The Oval.
No play was possible after tea but the visitors had already been reduced to 113-4, still 51 runs behind Surrey's first-innings total.
Earlier, Surrey added 105 to their overnight score before being bowled out for 433 with Peter Trego taking 5-67. Kumar Sangakkara was out for 157, his fourth 150-plus score this season.
The Sri Lankan was eventually dismissed as he tried to attack the seam bowling of Somerset captain Tom Abell, but the 39-year-old had already ensured Surrey had earned a maximum five batting bonus points.
Yorkshire, county champions in 2014 and 2015, face a potentially nervy final day at Headingley if they are to claim the victory which would go a long way to avoiding relegation to Division Two.
Already-relegated Warwickshire, 49-1 overnight in their second innings, made 251, thanks largely to skipper Jonathan Trott (59) and Tim Ambrose (49).
That set Yorkshire 175 to win, with 21 overs to face in the gathering gloom. But Jeetan Patel claimed two of three wickets as Yorkshire closed on 56-3.
Only 20 overs of play were possible on day three of the Division One match between Hampshire and county champions Essex because of rain.
Essex moved from 208-3 to 226-3 in their second innings in the 30 minutes of action possible before lunch.
The visitors closed on 247-5, 69 ahead, as Ravi Bopara (57) and Dan Lawrence (101) were both dismissed by Fidel Edwards after a stand of 147.
Philip Salt's maiden first-class half-century on day three saw Sussex set Durham 264 to win at Chester-le-Street.
