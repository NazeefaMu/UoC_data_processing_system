THE SHAPE OF WATER MAKES A SPLASH AT OSCARS
US: Fantasy romance The Shape of Water took home the Best Picture Oscar on Sunday, capping an awards season which has seen the film lavished with acclaim and glittering trophies.
Guillermo del Toros Cold War-era story of love between a mute cleaning woman and a mystery merman-like creature being held in a top secret government laboratory in Baltimore has dominated Hollywoods annual prize-giving season.
The quirky love story challenges viewers to cheer for an unorthodox couple, embracing the themes of tolerance and acceptance.
I want to tell you, everyone that is dreaming of using fantasy to tell the stories about the things that are real in the world today -- you can do it, said Del Toro, who also took home the best director prize.
Del Toro also earned a Golden Globe and Directors Guild Award this season for helming the movie, which won four Oscars overall on Sunday -- the other two were for best original score and best production design.
In the movie, Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who has been unable to talk since her throat was slashed as a baby, recruits her gay neighbour (Richard Jenkins) and colleague (Octavia Spencer) on a mission to break out the labs amphibian prisoner, whose days are numbered.
Michael Shannon rounds out the cast in a scenery-chewing turn as the sadistic government employee responsible for the magical creature, which is also in the sights of Russian double agents who have infiltrated the facility.
The Shape of Water finds Guillermo del Toro at his visually distinctive best -- and matched by an emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance, reads the critical consensus on reviews collation website Rotten Tomatoes, where it holds a 92 percent approval rating.
For Del Toro, the most gratifying reaction always comes from the fans, he told AFP at a recent luncheon for the Oscars nominees in Beverly Hills.
The most beautiful thing which Id heard, in different ways, was that the movie has healed someone emotionally or has given someone emotional ointment for the soul, he said.
Its a moment in which you are being told over and over again by ideologists that you should fear the other and that the other is your enemy that is the cause of your problems.
In reality, the answer is the other is the solution to your problems. The other is all you have. The other is the path, and the movie says embrace the other. The film comes at a time when Hollywood is becoming increasingly outspoken at awards ceremonies on issues like immigration, government foreign policy, gender equality and sexual assault.
At first glance a magical-realist fairy tale, The Shape of Water is perhaps the most overtly political of all the best picture nominees, in its clarion call for solidarity.
Although its middle-aged, male director might not tick the diversity boxes, it has a female co-writer, Vanessa Taylor, and lead, Hawkins, as well as black and gay characters -- not to mention the creature itself.
Its impossible not to see (the politics) this season, or actually the last few seasons, Del Toro told AFP.
To me, it is encouraging that these are the moments in which we come to the forefront somewhat in the cultural landscape. And its a time to speak about what we can do better. The Shape of Water has repaid the trust of Fox Searchlights executives, who have seen their production budget outlay of around $19.5 million reap $126.4 million worldwide so far, according to Box Office Mojo.
Del Toro recalled at a recent writers discussion in Beverly Hills that it was easy to win over the studio brass with his pitch, which essentially went through the film from start to finish using set drawings and a model of the creature.
I knew it was a movie at the end of the pitch, when we were all teary-eyed, and I thought, Weve got a movie, he said. But when it got to the point of the musical number and the (sex), I pitched rapidly. - AFP

Agriculture should be given top priority
Top-priority should be given to agricultural development activities, but the government has kept it at 4th place, as its main objective is power-generation. This has directly influenced the deterioration of agricultural activities, Provincial Councillor and All Ceylon Farmer Federation Chairman Namal Karunarathna said.
He said that by the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took over another portfolio called Law and Order and Prison Reforms Minister.
Therefore, he could catch the former Central Bank governor easily, as he is currently in Singapore. At present, all thieves are at large.

Education should encourage the artist within each student
The National Literary Festival 2017 - 2018 was held under the patronage of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Minister S. B. Nawinne at the BMICH yesterday.
I. Alwis was awarded the first place for his work under the Childrens stories above 18 years category.
K.D.J. Abeykoon was awarded first place for her short stories under the same category, while W.M.C. Gunawardena was awarded first place for Literary Criticism and R.P.R. Rajawardena was awarded first place for song composition.
N.S. Withanachci was awarded first place for poetic composition, while V. Shakthivel was placed first for research study on folklore and D.L.D.D. Rasanjana was placed first for academic articles on Sinhala encyclopedia/dictionary.
Addressing at the event, Head of the Normadic School, Dr Sunil Ranasinghe said that it was the responsibility of artists and writers to create an environment to prevent nuclear war and environmental pollution that could obliterate human life from earth.
He also pointed out that naturally, both a hunter and a looter live in each human being, which they inherited 200,000 years ago. So corruption and fraud is in our DNA, Dr Ranasinghe said.
But we can control it with the art and literature because there is also an artist in each human being inherited by way of DNA.
He also pointed out that the education should be moulded so as to not destroy the artist in each person.

Lanka needs to follow standards to make its funds more attractive
Mattias Martinsson, Founder and CIO of Tundra Fonder AB, a Swedish asset manager specialising in frontier markets stressed the need to follow environmental, social and ethical standards to make Sri Lanka funds more attractive to the global investors.
Martinsson expressed these views speaking at Tundra Fonder Sustainability Forum, organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in collaboration with Tundra Fonder, in Colombo yesterday .
Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) EGE will become the norm, Martinsson said adding that 37% of assets growth during 2012-2016 came from SRI assets and it grew by twice the rate of conventional assets during the same period. According to Martinsson, this growth will accelerate in the years ahead. Tundra Fonder, currently managing US $ 400 million worth of funds has expanded its presence in countries such as Vietnam, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Martinsson also noted that global wealth is shifting towards developing countries and Tundra sees tremendous opportunities in frontier markets for a long time to come.
Highlighting Chinas major investment commitments in main frontier markets such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Martinsson stressed that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China have already gone through a major growth phase, and Sri Lanka now has the chance of becoming one of them.
Martinsson said Sri Lankas highly literate, hard working, growing workforce creates economic growth and ideal investment climate adding that the local tourism industry ,which has a good growth potential needs to come up with a proper plan especially to attract high-end tourists to better garner economic benefits.
Highlighting key challenges, confronted by Sri Lanka, Martinsson stressed that Sri Lanka has the highest exposure towards interest rate with a relatively high share of government debt. In addition, frontier markets growth is mainly hampered due to low liquidity and political risks.

Personal insults behind Warner-De Kock row
Durban: Personal insults were at the root of a row between Australias David Warner and South Africas Quinton de Kock during the tea break of the fourth day of the first Test, their captains said.
The incident is in the hands of match referee Jeff Crowe, with no immediate clarity about when a decision could be expected.
CCTV footage showed Warner apparently turning on De Kock as the players walked up a narrow staircase leading to the dressing rooms at the start of the interval in Durban in a match won by Australia.
What was said and done during that interval was regrettable on both sides, said Australian captain Steve Smith.
Quinton got personal and evoked an emotional response from Davey. Those things are not on from both sides. Getting personal on the field is crossing the line in my opinion.
Smiths version was disputed by South African manager Mohammed Moosajee, who blamed Warner.
There were words said out on the field. If you are saying something youve got to take it and thats the opinion of Quinton. Let the investigations begin and let the match officials decide, said Moosajee.
South African captain Faf du Plessis said the umpires needed to ensure proper behaviour on the field.
From what Ive heard there was a lot of personal stuff being said, to and from. Who started it, I dont know. If it was happening on the field it should have been nipped in the bud.
The fact that it spilled over after the field shouldnt have happened.
The CCTV footage shows Warner being restrained by teammates Usman Khawaja and Nathan Lyon before being persuaded to go into the dressing room by Smith. Du Plessis said he had been aware of the incident. I heard the commotion and went outside and just asked David to go into his dressing room. It needs to stay on the field when you are chirping each other. There need to be boundaries on that.
Smith acknowledged his players were certainly very chirpy on the field.
But he said that as far as he aware his players had not got personal with De Kock.
Smith said he hoped the remaining three Tests would be played in the right spirit but added: We play our best cricket when were aggressive, when were in the fight together and hunting as a pack as one. Were working for each other and backing our mates up in the field. Thats part of being an Australian.
He said there had been regrettable incidents from both parties but hoped for better behaviour in the next three Tests.
Im not going to say nothing will ever happen again but as far as Im concerned weve just got to try and play within the spirit of the game.
Du Plessis said he expected aggression from the opposition when he played against Australia. Im certainly not sitting here complaining about it. I was disappointed to see the way it unfolded yesterday but I expect a tough series and I look forward to the battle.
According to Du Plessis, De Kock was unaffected by the incident.
Quinnys fine. I dont think you get a reaction from him most of the time. When you look at him now its like nothing happened.
Meanwhile, Australian off-spinner Lyon was charged with conduct contrary to the spirit of the game after he dropped the ball next to AB de Villiers after completing a runout of South Africas star batsman, an incident captured on television.
Lyon was expected to be fined or penalised with a demerit point for what is classified as a level one offence. He was said to have apologised to De Villiers and the pair were seen shaking hands while the teams warmed up on Monday. AFP

Port City to add office space in Colombo
In a recently organized seminar by the Organization of Professionals Association (OPA) of Sri Lanka held at their Auditorium in Colombo, Liang Thow Ming, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of Port City Colombo gave an overview of the Port City project.
He was invited to make the presentation on the mega investment project under the topic Port City and the future of Sri Lanka.
Addressing the gathering, Liang Thow Ming likened the large stretch of Port City land, once properly reclaimed, to a blank sheet of paper which one could freely draw upon, (meaning, plan). He said that it should be seen as an opportunity to create one of the top cities in the world right here in Sri Lanka which every Lankan could be proud of. He said, the Port City project is also huge from a local context, in terms of size it would have 21,000 units of apartments, as well as increasing the currently available office space in Colombo to 5 times that i.e. from 300,000 to 1.5 million square meters. However, in comparison with other global projects, we are not large; the Palm Jumeirah is 2 times the size of the Port City and the Marina Bay in Singapore is 330 hectares which is 15 percent larger. However, we have the opportunity to be the best in this region. So, we, together with the government, have tried to strategize this, and what we want to do is actually target Port City toward the whole of South Asia, he said.
Fielding questions from the audience he gave reasons as to why Sri Lanka is ideal for this project, pointing to his presentation and the concentric circles around the island, each representing just one hour of flying time from the Katunayake Airport, Liang said. If you look at the first circle, and the second circle, by the time we have reached the second circle, we would have covered the 5 southernmost provinces of India. And the population there is 450 million. Then in another half an hour you can go to Mumbai and in three and a half hours to New Delhi, three and a half hours to cities like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and get to Dubai in a little more than 4 hours. This is what the Prime Minister was talking about when he said Sri Lanka will be able to fill the void of a financial city between Dubai and Singapore; because we are right in the middle.
Speaking about the Belt Road Initiative (BRI), he said it was divided into two parts i.e. one part which was over land and the other which is over the ocean. The one over land is referred to as the belt and the one over the ocean is called the road. We are smack in the middle of the road and we are also in the center of shipping routes between Africa and Asia as well as Europe and Asia, which is the reason why Colombo is the top port in South Asia.
Colombo on the other hand has been hailed as the most livable city in South Asia he adds, quoting a statistic provided by Mercer. And I agree that Colombo is very good and very beautiful, but what we need to do in the Port City will be a quantum leap. 
The Chief Marketing Officer said that through the development of an interchange of expressways, driving to any part of the country would be much easier. People would be able to drive down to Hambantota, to Kandy, to the airport because it would literally link to the entire network of expressways in Sri Lanka. Recently we signed a MoU with the government to create this tunnel system, which will link our Northern and Southern entrances. And with this tunnel we are going to create some more entryways to the Port City and then there are also plans to extend the tunnel all the way to Marine Drive. Once the tunnels are built, Galle Face Green will be extended by another 20 - 30 meters once it is complete; which means you have a bigger area to play in.
Referring to the light rail system proposed by the government, he says that 7 lines in total are being planned. Two of these lines are in a more advanced stage of planning right now. The RTS 1 will run from Fort all the way to Bambalapitiya and the RTS 4 will run from the same place to West Malabe. They will both have a station in Pettah, which is on a future development proposed by the government to make a multi-modal transport hub. He says that once this was done all they would need to do would be to have a line from the multimodal transport hub running into the Port City. We will develop 5 stations over there as well, he said.
Liang Thow Ming further said that there were proper engineering studies done prior to commencing the project and two of their coastal engineering consultants, spent a year studying the wave patterns before getting to the drawing boards this was to make sure that the project does not affect the North and South shores of Colombo.

2018 may prove challenging for container shipping companies-Fitch
Sustaining last years improved profitability in 2018 may prove challenging for container shipping companies, Fitch Ratings said.
The fact that some companies are likely to have remained loss-making in 2017 highlights the ongoing weakness in sector fundamentals due to persistent overcapacity, which may undermine a longer-lasting recovery.
Financial reports or preliminary results released so far indicate that container shipping companies had stronger performance in 2017 than 2016. Fitch Ratings say they expect most carriers to have boosted profitability, although performance varies company by company. Maersk Line generated EBIT of USD634 million in 2017 compared to a loss of USD421 million in 2016, while Hapag-Lloyd and COSCO Shipping also materially improved their financial results. But while Hyundai Merchant Marines (HMM) operating loss in its container division halved last year, it remained large at USD280 million.
Container transport volume growth ranged from 3% for Maersk Line to 30% for HMM, and economic and trade growth should support further increases in 2018. We forecast container transport volumes to increase by more than 4.5% this year, consistent with the IMFs global trade growth forecast of 4%.
Higher freight rates supported better financial outturns even as operating costs increased due to higher fuel prices.
However, it is not clear that higher freight rates will be maintained. The Shanghai Containerised Freight Index was on average 27% higher in 2017 than in 2016. But its average reading in 4Q17 was lower than in 4Q16. It has increased marginally in early 2018, but remains lower on average than in the same period last year.
Sustainable recovery of freight rates depends on continuous and consistent capacity discipline in the industry. Freight rates are volatile and many previous increases reversed when the supply and demand imbalance returned.
Supply growth is expected to have been about 4% in 2017 with a further acceleration to over 5.5% in 2018, again exceeding demand growth. This may put pressure on rates and make it challenging to sustain the profitability achieved in 2017.
New orders were low in 2016-2Q17 but surged in 2H17, including mega ships, as market sentiment improved with a focus on scale and vessel size.
In 4Q17 Maersk Line exercised an option for two new vessels, each with a 15,200 TEU capacity to be delivered in 2019. CMA CGM ordered nine 22,000 TEU mega vessels in September 2017.
HMM also announced an ambitious growth strategy, targeting a 5% market share and using ultra-large container vessels.

The suspects who set fire to a shop in Teldeniya on last Sunday (March 4) night were arrested by the Teldniya police yesterday (March 5) morning.
According to the police media unit, the Teldeniya police had arrested 24 suspects in connection to this incident.

According to police media, the 24 suspects those who were being arrested in connection to setting fire to the shop in Teldeniya were to be produced to the Magistrate Courts of Teldeniya yesterday. However, another four suspects who were involved in the attacking incident happened in front of the filling station have been arrested by police.

AB de Villiers records a rare golden duck via run out in Test history
AB de Villiers might be one of the fastest runners in the sport but the frequency of him getting run out, especially in the crunch moments, is quite high. His love with the run outs carried over his career due to poor judgement while running due to his partners or by himself.
A similar sight was repeated during the ongoing Test match as South Africa's No.4 had to depart without a run to his name. He walked out to bat when the Saffers were 39/2 while chasing 417 but couldn't last more than one over.
South Africa's last hope in this chase evaporated with De Villiers, who scored an unbeaten 71 in the first innings, getting run out facing only one ball. Aiden Markram pushed a Nathan Lyon's delivery towards David Warner at square leg and De Villiers raced for a single. By the time Markram sent back his senior partner, Warner fired a throw to Nathan Lyon who did no mistake in disturbing the stumps. The 34-year-old lost his balance in returning to the bowlers' end and even a dive couldn't save him from getting out.
This was the 6th time AB de Villiers got run out in the Test format; the joint 2nd most times by a South African. John Waite got out via run out in Test cricket on seven occasions. Overall, this was De Villiers' 29th dismissal in International cricket via run out which are the most such dismissals among South Africans surpassing Jacques Kallis' 28 runouts.
This was the 8th Test duck for AB de Villiers with four of them in the last 12 innings.

Special Envoy of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein said he hoped Sri Lanka would become a strong advocate for the treaty.
Prince Mired was speaking after a meeting with Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana at the Foreign Ministry on Monday.
Congratulating Sri Lanka for acceding to the Convention, Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein expressed hope that Sri Lanka would become a strong advocate for the Convention, the Foreign Ministry tweeted.
Sri Lanka acceded to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, commonly known as the Ottowa Convention, in December.
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said Sri Lanka has been an advocate for the convention even before adopting it last year.
She pointed to the countrys mine clearing programme, which began in 2002, as an example.
During his official visit, Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein will call on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Ministry sources said.
Prince Mired will also visit the Northern Province with the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister to witness mine clearance activities, and meet with land mine victims, Ministry sources said.
The government hopes to make the country mine-free by 2020. 164 states have adopted the Ottowa Convention since it opened for signature in 1997.
Sri Lanka is one of the only countries in the region to have signed it. India, Pakistan, and Nepal have not signed the Convention.

Art from the heart
Brain drain, a process that rids intellectuals and scholars from their motherlands, has become a grave matter for developing countries and their governments.
These individuals leave their motherlands not only seeking for greener pastures but due to secure suitable employment, childrens education, get rid of dilemmas and safety issues and for various other reasons.
The developing countries in Asia would fast-track their sustainable development efforts if they find means to protect and recognize these skilled individuals who reluctantly bid adieu to their motherlands for obvious reasons.
Ajit Bodiratne, an old Royalist, is an individual who has become a victim of brain drain. A true lover of Sri Lanka and its diversity and heritage, Bodiratne now lives in Kentucky, Canada with his family of two children and his parents.
After leaving college, I pursued my higher studies in the field of accounts. While working for the garment sector and a few other accounting organizations I managed to do my exams and become an accountant. Yet I couldnt find employment that is suitable for my qualifications that would help me to work towards achieving Chartered Marketer status. This frustration and agony made me migrate, Bodiratne said.
He adds, I was able to find suitable employment in Canada after communicating with a few companies while living in Sri Lanka.
Apart from being a fully-fledged accountant, Bodiratne is a versatile artist. The pictures of Gamini Fonseka, Jeewarani as well as sceneries and self-portraits he drew with the ball-point pen were admired and highly commended by his peers while he was residing in Sri Lanka.
Eventually he has broadened his purview to become an oil-painter and now he mostly paints on canvas.
I have a collection of paintings in hand and am working on producing more. The little time off work is utilized for drawing. The drawings I do using the ball-point pen too are in high demand here hence this is becoming a lucrative second profession for me, he said.
Bodiratne is looking forward to holding his first art exhibition in Canada this year.
Being a Nature-boy he loves to grow vegetables in the backyard of his house during his leisure time. This is something his father who hails from Ratnapura had done when they were living in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is my motherland and I intend to come back to my country with my wife once my childrens education is over and they have gotten jobs, Bodiratne adds with passion.

Aussies wrap up first Test as Warner, De Kock bust-up probed
Australia wrapped up a 118-run win on the fifth day of the first Test against South Africa on Monday but the result is likely to be overshadowed by an ugly bust-up between David Warner and Quinton de Kock.
It took Australia 18 minutes and 22 balls to claim the last South African wicket when De Kock swung across the line and was leg before wicket to Josh Hazlewood for 83.
South Africa were bowled out for 298, adding five runs to their overnight total of 293 for nine.
The win gave Australia a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. Just before the rapid conclusion of the match, however, video footage emerged showing Aussie firebrand Warner pointing and directing a verbal barrage at De Kock during Sunday's play at Kingsmead before he was restrained and pulled away by his teammates.
The incident reportedly took place as the players were returning to their dressing rooms at tea.
The match was effectively won and lost in the first innings when Australia took a lead of 189 runs.
Half-centuries by Warner and skipper Steve Smith and 96 by Mitchell Marsh enabled Australia to make 351. Early wickets by off-spinner Lyon and a devastating spell of fast reverse swing bowling by Mitchell Starc sent South Africa tumbling to 162 in reply.
South Africa fought back in the second half of the match, bowling with more purpose to bowl out the tourists for 227, then recovering from a nightmare start to their second innings, largely through Markram, who made 143, and De Kock. The batting of the lower order of the teams was a significant difference. Australias last five wickets fell for a total of 166 runs overs the two innings, while South Africa could muster only 27 runs over the same period.
Starc had match figures of nine for 109 and was particularly effective against South Africas tailenders. AFP

Ravi Dadlani has 25 years of multi-sector experience and has gained an encyclopaedic knowledge of the tyre industry over the last decade, CEAT Kelani Holdings Chairman Chanaka de Silva said. He is the ideal candidate to continue the momentum at this juncture when the company is venturing into new product categories and new export markets.

Celebrating  culture and art
The faculty and students of Devi Balika have for many years celebrated the arts and the impact it has on the student body as a whole. The girls of Devi Balika show remarkable aptitude when it comes to drama, dance and public speaking. This was seen in their annual cultural show Manjari or known as Inflorescence 2018, is their way of appreciating the arts.
And through this appreciation of the arts, they have given themselves the opportunity of discovering themselves and their talents.
The morning kicked off at the J.D.A gallery with the art exhibition and then shifted to Devi Balika where the artists were honored with prizes. Of course the morning featured so many more aesthetic items such as beautiful dances, songs and public speaking. It was a morning of gaiety and vibrancy shown by the dances.
Devi Balika has always been a school that has placed much emphasis on the performing arts and aesthetics. And when these girls put on a show it is all due to their hard work, commitment and dedication. They have the brains no doubt. They just need the platform.
Head Girl of Devi Balika Theshani Weligamage who was the English compeer, chose her words carefully beautifully illustrating the importance of the morning 
This event is as natural as sunshine and as vital as nourishment. Technically inflorescence means a cluster of flowers, with the budding and the unfolding of the blossoms. The Arts Circle of Devi Balika Vidyalaya together with the Peoples Republic of China, holds Inflorescence the art exhibition, providing the platform for a cluster of young artists to bloom in full color, said Weligamage.
The event is a unified amplification of the efforts of the teachers in charge, the panel of judges and the committee members of the Arts Circle.
I wish to point out that an event of this caliber is done through the efforts of the faculty and the students. It is part of the culture at Devi Balika to encourage our students to be creative and bring out their talents. We are always behind them when it comes to realizing their potential. Our faculty have the desire to see our girls excel. An event like this is a unified approach. For any dream to come true what you need is desire, discipline and dedication. So we always push them to make use of these opportunities. We also wish to thank the parents for the sacrifices they make. They have supported our faculty and students. This event is a success. Our Art Circle is very active and praiseworthy. Events like this provide our students with various experiences, said Principal of Devi Balika, W.D.P.K. Samarasinghe.
The principal pointed out that win or lose, what is important is the experience these students take out of this. Because this is something more than receiving a certificate. Taking part is what is important. She also pointed out that this experience will benefit these children when they leave the portals of Devi Balika and become responsible citizens of this world. The freedom they receive, the creativity they develop and the charisma they create within them, will certainly aid them in succeeding in life.
Kingsley Gunatillake is a painter, an installation artist and a book artist. His formal training includes a Bachelor in Fine Arts from the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo He is currently a lecturer on the faculty of Visual Arts of the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo.
The paintings on display tackle profound and deep themes with great clarity. Today child art is regarded as one form of art which is in high demand. This is because every child is a creator. That is something I believe very strongly. Even Picasso has stated that every child is a creator, said Gunatillake.

Change   comes   with a   child
CUP mission
Education is the foundation, where people can begin to improve themselves and their communities.
Todays children are tomorrows leaders and educating them will have a positive impact on their futures and their communitys future.
All Children have the right to quality education regardless of their economic background.
All Children have dreams and they desire to fulfill them.
In leveraging technology, knowledge, and resources to create educational opportunities for Children.
Making an interest to read and write among children and bring out their inherited talents and creative thoughts.
Somewhere in a corner of that giant oak table, she shuffled the chaos of her little workstation. She had so much to do. Observing her fathers moves and moods was one. At times he would pout. Bent forward with raised eyebrows, he would occasionally take a break to meditate on a character sketch.
The Sinhalese-reading children of the seventies and eighties will still remember who S A Disanayake is. His name is kind of eponymous with the Asterix-type characters who came to life in the Mihira newspaper cartoons.
Father created a character called Punchitta following my birth. Whenever he draws a few sketches, he used to show them to me. So to say I had a good access to his work. I wont forget his contemplative moods.
Her father had instilled the art of neatness in her. He had her table, bookshelf, bed and the book bag well organised. Her father made her a box-like bag so that she can carry much stuff inside.
Father entered us to various art competitions both international and national. He wanted to pass down his legacy to a certain extent. When I was eight, I started the violin. I was drawn away from arts and studied music up to Bhatkande. Art is beautiful. But I find it a bit difficult.
Nadee Tharanga Disanayake has produced a few books for children. There is more to childrens books than writing some fairytale. The childrens books have the potential to change one whole society, Nadee believes. That belief led her to initiate the Childrens Upliftment Programme (CUP) in 2005.
I formulated the organisation with the assistance of a few friends. Together we worked out on how the underprivileged or the less-privileged children can be benefited from the childrens literature.
Nadees fervent belief was that she should  and she could  make some worthy contribution towards the betterment of children in need.
CUP was brainstormed in 2004 with the primary objective of building up the future of the younger generation of the country. Its scope is further narrowed down by targeting the community which suffered from poverty, lack of attention and guidance. At the beginning CUP was registered as a charitable organization under the Companies Act No. 1982 and today it is a registered non-profit making charity organization.
We have set up libraries in the rural villages. And we are conducting programmes to encourage children to write storybooks. At the same time, we offer numerous scholarship programmes. For the visually impaired children, we have established therapy units. The very first one was set up in Karapitiya.
The change comes with the child, Nadee maintains. The adults are a tough species to crack down. If anyone ever believes that this society needs to be changed, they should begin with the children. Thats precisely why Nadee got together with a few adults to form CUP to begin change with the children.
As a Commissioner at the Inland Revenue Department, Nadee Disanayaka is constantly in touch with the affluent crowd who are willing to offer a helping hand. But they have their own share of concerns as well. They have no time for charity, for one. Most charity organisations are not trustworthy, on the other hand. They would look forward to sponsoring a child through a genuine charity organisation that can be transparent about how the funds are exhausted. If the funds reach the right place, there are enough people who would like to donate.
I think I had some writing talent. Whatever the skill you may have, you need to practise it. A writer should constantly write. I have written several childrens books. I take time to edit them. All the time I feel that the raw writing should be improved more. Then I am obliged to pass that inheritance to the younger generation.
Nadees books are a result of extensive research in various fields. Childrens books should be more creative in order inculcate wholesome habits. One of her books focuses on offering a comprehensive idea of the Inland Revenue Departments role.
A poor child makes friends with a rich child. The rich child is conversant in English, while the poor child is well versed in maths. They share the knowledge with each other. The poor child observes certain things. His friend scribbles down in the textbook itself. Whenever he needs money to visit the doctor, the rich child channels a private physician for his friend. The rich childs father is a wonderful man, the poor child thinks. The bulk of welfare such as pensions and free services offered by the government is a result of the earnings of the rich childs father. The poor child wants to thank his friends father in person.
Finally the poor child makes a resolution to become rich and do his part by paying income tax which in turn benefits the whole society. Paying taxes is a social responsibility. We enjoy the benefits of parks, highways and streetlights. These services come as a result of government expenses. Thats why we should decrease the budget gap. You need to teach that a child should brush teeth twice a day. They wont learn that naturally. Having said that, it should not be forced either. The training should be done naturally.
Disanayaka also made a point about bilingual books. More childrens books should be published in both English and Sinhala side by side.
We did not speak English as children. We studied English with difficulty. But the younger generation should be motivated to read the books in both languages.
Who chooses everything for the adult, Nadee questions. It is the parents responsibility introduce children to the books and reading. A child should be given a chance to read.
A child should be given a chance to write what he remembers. It could be a list, favourite author. Or even the contents. It could even be a diary. Let them write every day, and there should be a reward to them following the lapse of 365 days. You can tell a child to go to Katharagama from Colombo, they dont know how to go. But you can give them tips on the transport and highway system. A child should be given guidance.
If a child has been introduced to iPad, then why not literature A child would not suddenly go for an iPad.
When I was doing A/Ls, my father bought a colour television set. But he did not unpack the box until my exams are over. I think thats how parents should behave with children. Todays social media is a huge distraction for the child. The adults can opt to stay away from the distractions. But the children are not mature enough for that. So the best thing is to replace social media or iPad by a physical book.
We cannot change the whole world. But Nadee believes in lighting one candle. Develop your childs language and then let them choose their future career. And for that, the adults should let them write in the first place.

A reception centre not so welcome
There was a spate of building collapses in Colombo in the recent past, at the height of the rainy season, most widely publicized. One such is a multi-storey reception centre at Charlemont Road, Wellawatta.
At that time, there was a big public outcry against the Colombo Municipal Council, which approves of building plans. How can one put up a building on a road reservation or a canal bank What can CMC do, when approval is given for five-stories, and if a developer puts up two more stories
This argument and excuses put forward by the CMC are totally wrong, lame and illegal. CMC has Municipal engineers and inspectors, who are supposed to go to the field and report such irregularities. CMC can certainly stop such illegal constructions. It is their job and they are paid for that. Of course, in a poor third world country like Sri Lanka, anything can be done with money!
Now all have forgotten about Charlemont Road building. Business is as usual, until the next rainy season, and the next building collapses Alas!
Dear Municipal Commissioner, do not try to sweep your garbage under the Carpet.
It is stinking. Get your staff to do their jobs. Tell them not to accept bribes. Remove all unauthorized buildings from Colombo.

Through a quagmire of politics, emotion and belief, we have lost sight of what is happening to our shoreline and it is time that we all face our real threat - that of climate change (see www.HighTideOnMainStreet.com).
All over the world, the danger is similar: glaciers are disappearing from Alaska to South Africa. This is the reality, the ice is melting and sea levels are rising. This has resulted in the shoreline beginning to move inland. This is obvious, but the ratio of occurrence is incredible: for each foot of rise in sea level, the average global shoreline moves about 300ft inland. For some countries this ratio could be different. These changes are a result of the Earths temperature being 1.50F warmer than it was just a century ago. This may not seem like much, but if you consider that the heat from human emissions is roughly equal to 400,000 atomic bombs exploding across the planet every single day, it is significant. Ice melts at 320C and it does not care for your political party or if you believe in climate change or not.
Carbon emissions and rising sea levels
Figure 1; Changes in global temperature, sea level rise and CO2 concentration. (Courtesy www.HighTideOnMainStreet.com)
Sea level rises; global temperature fluctuations and greenhouse gas emissions have had a regular pattern for over millions of years. As it is shown in the CO2 emission pattern (Figure 1), the concentration at present has steadily reached up to 400ppm. Consequently, it is now predicted that the amount of CO2 concentration could increase up to 1,300ppm by 2100.
This realization has created the need for us to pursue alternative energy sources to cut down our use of fossil fuels that contribute to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Models very confidently predict that this could result in an increase in the global surface temperature between 2.50C and 7.80C over pre-industrialized levels. This means that we will not be able to stop the rise completely, but we can slow it down.
Green technology, energy and switching onto sustainable practices can no longer impede the inevitable rise of our sea levels, but the right practices can slow down this impending doom. Further, we need to start adapting to rising sea levels and the possibility of a future with a more unpredictable climate.
Understanding climate change
Climate change has invariably brought out new topics of discussion in the lives of academics to understand this new phenomena. Research carried out in Bangladesh has found that, whichever adaptive strategy proposed for climatic changes, the strategies would not be effective if the victims of its impact do not understand climate change. The concept of environmental migration in the meantime has been mostly discussed in the West Africa region with special reference to forced migration. These studies related to West Africa have revealed that climate change alone is not the cause for migration out of the region. Moreover, when the consequences of climate stresses coincide with economic and social stresses, the probability of forced migration increases significantly (see Brown, O., 2009, Migration and Climate Change, IOM Migration research series). The poorest are the least able to adapt to these climate change scenarios and thus are the most vulnerable. So how can we enhance the resilience of the most vulnerable communities It should be done through a holistic approach, rather than addressing the systems of social, environmental and economical separately.
Climate change like any problem has its positives and negatives. The most promising fact is that the globe will have to work together with a common goal of mitigating and adapting to climate change. The worst case scenario would be the collapse of food chains and increase in world hunger. When considering sea level rises, most climate change discussions point towards the disappearance of many of the greatest cities. This begs the question of what would happen to the poorest of the poor and the shoreline communities; especially that of the fishing communities in developing and least developed countries. The only hope left now is to have strong action taken by governments and civilians to change our reality.
China, the worlds largest greenhouse gas emitter has given its consent to move towards a green economy. Thus it is up to us, ordinary citizens to continue demanding that our political leaders tackle climate change, the hardest problem that humanity has ever faced. We also need to adapt to a shoreline which is shifting inland for the first time in human civilization and these changes need to be done sooner than later.

Conte hails fantastic guy Astori after players death
Manchester: A visibly shaken Antonio Conte paid an emotional tribute to Davide Astori, describing the 31-year-old who died suddenly on Sunday as a fantastic guy.
Conte, who coached the Fiorentina defender when he was in charge of the Italian national team, said the players death, due to a suspected heart attack, was a tragedy.
This is a tragedy and it really hurts me. Its very difficult at this moment to find the right words for the family, Chelsea coach Conte told Sky Sports ahead of his teams Premier League match at Manchester City on Sunday.
I had him with the national team. He was a great player but especially a fantastic guy. I stay close to his wife, parents and daughter. He was only 31 and its very difficult to explain this situation.
Astori, who played 14 times for Italy, was found dead in his hotel room in Udine on Sunday morning where his team had been due to play Udinese in Serie A.
The game as well as the rest of the top-flight programme was cancelled as a mark of respect. AFP

Defy overcrowded domain step into an unchartered land with ample growth opportunities
George Bernard Shaw once said, The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
Leaders venture out and are not afraid to challenge the status quo. They step into the unknown, looking for opportunities to grow, innovate and inspire. You can read in the newspapers, books and the net about the great leaders who faced challenges but none of them claimed a personal best by keeping things the same.
Leaders who challenge the process are willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services adopted  even if there is a risk of failure. And if they do fail first or second time, they learn quickly from their actions and do it again.
For those of you who are unfamiliar with this powerful practice, Challenge the system can be broadly summarized in the following manner. It is the practice in which:
* Leaders search for opportunities and seize initiative in order to change the status quo.
* They look for innovative ways to improve the organization or the world. In doing so, they experiment, take risks and achieve small wins.
* And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities.
The concept is relatively easy to grasp.
Opportunities
Leaders have to search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow, and improve. Each leader has to ask himself, How do I go to work today and do something that will move the enterprise and myself another step in the right direction Although there has never been a time when a company could rest on its laurels and survive, it is even truer today that if you are holding your own, everyone else will be passing you by.
To search for opportunities, leaders must use the four essentials:
1. Seize the initiative: Initiative is one of the tenets of Army operations. To be effective on the battlefield, or the boardroom you must gain and maintain the initiative. It is essential to make your competition react to you, not you to them. Once initiative is lost, all control of the situation goes to your opponent. The first of Stephen Coveys Seven Habits is to Be Proactive. Proactive leaders are able to seize the initiative and gain control of their personal and business environment.
2. Make challenge meaningful: This tie right back into Inspire a Shared Vision. When people understand why they are doing things, they buy into it and are much more motivated to accomplish their objectives.
1. Innovate and create: Routine work drives out non-routine work and smothers to death all creative planning, all fundamental change in any institution.
2. Look outward for fresh ideas: We need to leave behind the Not Invented Here (NIH) attitude. There are all kinds of sources of information and knowledge that we have not yet tapped into. Continually question the status quo and look to see how others are handling their challenges. Experiment and take risks by constantly generating small wins and learning from mistakes. Leadership is learning by doing, adapting to actual situations. (Tennis star Martina Navratilova lost 21 of her first 24 matches against Chris Evert. She decided to accept more risk and hit more freely and beat Evert in 39 of their next 57 matches. No woman tennis pro has ever won as many matches or tournaments as Navratilova)
3. Create a Learning Environment: The best leaders are the best learners - and the best creators of a learning environment.
Some of the ways we can create a learning environment are by:
1. Simulations or trials. Test things out before you put them in place. Everything can be a pilot.
2. Ask if anyone if the group has had experience doing this before. Have that person share their knowledge.
3. Keep track of the process and were a mistake was made. This will reinforce the learning environment.
4. Get others involved. Learning involves more than a few people.
5. Celebrate each correct move.
Behaviours that derail the Challenge
Challenge the system is more easily preached than practiced, often resulting in a strong feeling of hypocrisy about leaders. On numerous occasions, people have told me, My boss says he wants us to be creative, challenge the status quo, and think outside the box. But when we question why certain work must be done the way it is being suggested, we hear something like, If you have a problem with it, no one is forcing you to work here!
How would you translate that message It can certainly come across as controlling, deceitful, and quite disabling to creative efforts. It is usually much easier for you to challenge something you believe needs improving, than to have others challenge something you believe does not. There will always be operations in an organization that are untouchable at the moment. But, you will lose your credibility as a leader if you declare yourself immune to change or your favorite things off limits to the scrutiny of others.
Sometimes, this practice is communicated as challenge only the little things. There are organizations that seem to allow people to dabble, tweak, fine-tune, or slightly improve, but any change that might be considered too big is off limits. There is nothing at all wrong with continuous improvement. It just does not require the same degree of leadership that more ambitious opportunities call for.
Inherent in this practice is the need to experiment and take risks. Challenge the system is never completely safe. Remember, if there is no chance of failure, there would be no risk taking, only sure thing taking. Leaders must continue to work at creating an environment which promotes the taking of a few chances.
In some companies, challenge is positioned as additional work vs. part of the job. I remember hearing a boss actually say, If people around here think they have time to go off and look for new ways to do things, maybe they dont have enough to do right now.
Challenging the system is not something else that people need to do, on their own time. It is the only way to keep up with change occurring every dayfrom competitors, technology, economic conditions or whatever. If change is not done by you, it will be done to you, and leaders know on which side of that statement they most want to be.
Full power
There are three pieces of advice when attempting to bring forth the full power and value of Challenge the system. First, keep yourself and others focused on the specific behaviors associated with it, and do not get caught up in the various misinterpretations of the word challenge.
Next, remind others that the practice is ultimately about taking action to create change. It requires preparation, dialogue, respecting others, and cooperation, because change usually produces some level of discomfort for those affected by it.
Finally, remember that Challenge the system is a two-way street. You cannot expect others to enthusiastically pursue growth in this practice if they are repeatedly shut down every time they offer a new or different approach.
Needed good leaders
Let us recap what we have learnt. Challenge the system does not mean challenge the values or standards, just because uncompromising integrity or flawless quality are too hard to live by. It does not mean attacking other people when we don't agree with their ideas or points of view.
Nor does it mean seeking to dismantle what is working well, or attempting to eliminate something that is simply a personal inconvenience for you. Challenge the system is about finding and implementing new and better ways of doing things in order to constantly improve to grow.
People in most organizations today have some pretty ambitious objectives to meet each year. The waters are choppy and the wind in their faces is strong, which means that hitting the numbers takes a lot of hard work. But hard work by itself is seldom the answer.
It also takes a lot of different work. I frequently ask people if they think they can meet their goals for the coming years by continuing to do their work the way they are currently doing it. Without exception, the answer is no.
This is one reason why organizations need more good leaders. They need people who will cease the ongoing complaining about how outrageous goals might be (and some indeed are beyond reason), and start rallying people to figure out what can be done to accomplish them. Isn't it ironic that so-called impossible goals are accomplished all the time Somehow, people do figure out an answer.
3 -points
As we go along with this series, we will share with you some of the proven to-do items that enable people in organizations to be more effective in Challenging the system and implementing innovative ideas and methods.
In the meantime, there are a couple of things you can immediately start practicing as a leader, in order to lay the groundwork for helping others embrace the need to challenge the way things are done.
First, do not allow new ideas to be immediately discounted with little or no consideration. Intervene by prompting rich and open dialogue to ensure that ideas get a fair hearing.
Second, never allow invalid assumptions to rule the day over proven facts. Ask team members to justify their beliefs about whether something new will work or why it won't.
Finally, spend less time reviewing and reporting on results already in the bank and more time on pursuing new possibilities.

In an unprecedented move, former working director of ITN, former senior consultant of Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRC-SL) and a well known film producer, Dr. Arosha Fernando who has been recognised for producing the highest number of films in recent times, along with the high budget film producer who has produced the popular films Super Six, Pravegaya and Maya, R. Sadesh Kumar have acquired shares of one of the five film circuits in Sri Lanka, Movie Producers & Importers Company Pvt Limited also known as MPI film circuit at an undisclosed price. They have been subsequently appointed to the board of directors. Dr Fernando has produced 16 films within a short span of four years including the movie Eka Dawasaka Api which is currently being screened in the CEL film circuit.
This is a historical move as this is the first time in history that the ownership of a film circuit has been purchased by a new party since the establishment of the five film circuits in Sri Lanka in year 2002.
MPI film circuit has a total of 34 film theatres including both Sinhala centres and Tamil centres spread across the country. It's one of the largest film circuits in Sri Lanka after the state owned Rithma film circuit which comes under the National Film Corporation. Rithma has 57 film theatres. MPI is licensed to produce, distribute and screen Sinhala films as well as import, distribute and screen Tamil, Hindi and English films.

Responding to the questions raised regarding the new acquisition, Dr. Arosha said We know that once developed, any film circuit can be a lucrative business and we hope to work closely with the other board directors to make a solid plan to develop MPI to different height by end of the year.

Rajanganaya reservoir issue
Drinking water project under NWSDB, says GM
The drinking water supply project utilising water from the Rajanganaya reservoir is a government development project supervised by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the NWSDB General Manager Eng. D.U. Sumanasekara, issuing a special statement, said.
Sumanasekara said that the project is not a privately owned water-bottling project. After the completion of the project, it will be maintained and controlled by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, he further stated. The NWSDB observed that it needs to come to a common understanding with local farmers associations on utilizing the waters of the Rajanganaya reservoir, despite the fact that the Irrigation Department agreed to allocate 44,000 cubic metres for this project in 2015.
The NWSDB pointed out that it is possible to limit the water supply for the concerned water project in the drought season and give priority to the water supply allocated for the farmers in the area. The current Thambuththegama Water Supply Project which was implemented under the Mahaweli Project provides drinking water for around 4,750 families from the Nallachchi reservoir. The proposed plan attempts to acquire water from the Rajanganaya reservoir to extend to the Thambuththegama Water Supply Project.
The Thambuththegama project requires 19,800 cubic metres per day. The new project will provide water for 28 grama niladhari divisions in Thambuththegama, four in Galnewa Divisional Secretariat and 12 in Talawa Divisional Secretariat.
The proposed project is funded with a loan of Rs. 17,000 million from China Development Bank.The water project was suspended by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, adhering to the instructions given by Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake, consequent to the protest by Rajanganaya farmers opposing the intake of water for the project from the Rajanganaya reservoir.
The Anuradhapura District Coordination Committee Meeting is to sit tomorrow, under the headship of President Maithripala Sirisena, to reach a final decision on the matter.

Emerald Fund of NDB Zephyr partners Invests in Idea Group
In December 2017, Emerald Sri Lanka Fund (Emerald Fund) invested in Idea Group Limited (Company), one of the leading manufacturers and distributors of PVC roofs, ceilings and architectural material in Sri Lanka.
The company will utilize the new capital to support the expansion of its production facilities and to meet working capital requirements.
Idea Group was founded by Sampath Mayakaduwa and commenced its operations in 2008. The Company operates through an island-wide network of approximately 400 exclusive franchise outlets under the brand names of Sivilima and Siyana. This extensive network serves as a robust platform for the launch and promotion of complimentary products such as an extensive range of wall panels, adhesives and other household fixtures.
In 2016, Idea Group acquired a distressed architectural hardware manufacturing facility and within a short period converted it into a profitable operation. Since the acquisition, the firms management has successfully restructured costs, rationalized products and launched new product lines.
The company is expected to benefit from the growth in demand for alternative roofing materials in Sri Lanka with increased market awareness of the health hazards associated with asbestos based products. The Companys PVC based roofing solution, i-Roof, offers a range of features such as environmentally sustainable, long-lasting colour, high tensile strength, fire retardant and anti- corrosive. Unlike asbestos based products, which are currently banned in 55 nations worldwide, i-Roof does not possess any associated health hazards making it a preferred solution for roofing needs of customers. i-Panel, the Companys flagship ceiling panel brand offers a range of attractive designs and products that can be easily installed and maintained.
In 2017, the Company began manufacturing PVC roofing products and will commence manufacturing of ceiling products this year. The Company foresees large job creation opportunities and promotion of much needed import substitution through the expansion of its domestic manufacturing facilities. The aim of Emerald Fund and the Company is to operate these facilities incorporating high social and environmental standards.
We are pleased to invest in Idea Group led by a dynamic entrepreneur. We are impressed by the innovative and visionary leadership of the Company. We believe the Idea Group will emerge as a one- stop-shop for construction materials in Sri Lanka, said Senaka Kakiriwaragodage, Managing Director of NDB Zephyr Partners Lanka (Pvt) Limited, the manager of Emerald Sri Lanka Fund.
Sampath Mayakaduwa, founder and CEO of Idea Group said, We are very honoured to have Emerald Fund as our partner to support our growth journey. We expect that the Emerald Fund teams expertise in financial management and business strategy along with its global network will be significant contributors to our future growth.
The Emerald Sri Lanka Fund is a pioneering private equity fund dedicated to investing in small and mid-sized businesses seeking expansion capital in Sri Lanka.

The Government presented the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in Parliament on March 7, 2017.
The Bill was scheduled to be taken up for debate on July 5 and September 19 last year, but the Government had to defer it amidst the objections of various groups.
The Sri Lankan Government ratified the U.N. International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPPED) in December 2015 and the Draft Bill is to satisfy its obligations under the ICPPED.
The Joint Opposition raised objections to the Bill stating that it poses a threat to the Security Forces. However, the Government clarified that the Bill is not retrospective and its main intention is to ensure that every Sri Lankan citizen gets the freedom to live without fear of being a victim of enforced disappearance or abduction. The Bill will be passed following a full day debate.

An essential probe
A few political entities in Sri Lanka depend solely on communalism as their political oxygen. They somehow want to stir up communal passions and create clashes between the various communities. This has been their modus operandi for decades. They seize upon even the most trivial incident to set up attacks against the minority ethnic communities and religious groups.
People voted overwhelmingly against such communal politics at both elections held in 2015. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have risen above communal politics and proven that they are the leaders of all Sri Lankans regardless of ethnicity and religion. Many initiatives have been taken to foster reconciliation among different communities, as per the recommendation of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and other experts.
In such a context, suspicions will naturally arise when an incident of a communal nature occurs in any part of the country. The Ampara incident has shocked all right thinking citizens and the Government, which is striving to achieve reconciliation. The suggestion has already been made that an unseen hand is behind the ethnic violence in Ampara. This claim should be probed thoroughly, because we can remember how certain politicians orchestrated the attacks against Muslims and their business establishments in Aluthgama in 2014. These elements are still active in Sri Lankan politics and they will leave no stone unturned to create communal disharmony.
But there is an even more disturbing aspect to the Ampara violence against Muslim-owned shops and religious places. There are credible reports of police inaction in the face of the marauding mobs. It is indeed a very serious matter if Police just stood by as the attacks took place. Complaints have been made that the B Report submitted to the Court on the incident by the Police is also incomplete.
Now Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the new Law and Order Minister has ordered another inquiry into the recent attacks on Muslim establishments in Ampara, following these complaints of Police inaction. Earlier, the Law and Order Ministry instructed the Batticaloa DIG to conduct a complete investigation into the incident. The Ministry states the Government will take measures to conduct an impartial, comprehensive and fair inquiry and also to build up public trust. Measures have been taken to compensate the affected parties whose properties were damaged during the attacks. Plans have been made to pay compensation soon to renovate shops and mosques damaged in the incident.
It is essential to probe this entire sordid episode and nab not only those who physically attacked property, but also any others who may have instigated the rioters from behind the stage. The maximum possible punishment should be given to these perpetrators regardless of their stature. Any Police personnel who failed to discharge their duties must also be dealt with after an impartial investigation.
This must be the last time that Sri Lankans have heard of ethnic clashes. We have emerged from 30 years of darkness and no political or other force can be allowed to take the country back to those dark days. Reconciliation cannot be achieved overnight after decades of strife, but this kind of incident can stifle progress in that direction. The authorities must nip any such attempts in the bud.
Fortunately, the Government was able to contain the Ampara violence before it spiralled out of control. The credit should also go to the majority of peace-loving residents of Ampara who did not fall prey to the tactics of the perpetrators. We should also be grateful to the Bhikkus and the Muslim Clergy who acted with responsibility to ensure peace during the period of tension. It is heartening to note that a good rapport exists among the clergy of various religions which augurs well for the future. The media, especially the provincial correspondents, also acted with responsibility.
The Government should not allow any room for a repetition of an incident of this nature. Ethnic and religious discord brings in its wake severe consequences for any country. For example, no investor will want to invest in a country where ethnic clashes are common. Tourists too will evade a country that is not peaceful. The onus is on religious leaders to get together and reassure the public that there is no room in modern Sri Lankan society for racism and religious bigotry. The public should also boycott any politician in their areas who harbour religious and ethnic bias.
In the long run, the best answer for achieving reconciliation is creating a truly Sri Lankan identity that transcends all ethnic and religious barriers. Many multi-ethnic countries such as Singapore have already done this, whilst preserving the languages, traditions and traits of each community. Any Singaporean, whether Malay, Chinese or Indian will tell you he/she is a Singaporean. Students now learn all three languages in school and in 25-30 years there will be only a few people left who still cling on to communalism. There will be a new generation of youth bereft of such archaic ideas and concepts that will take Sri Lanka to new heights.

First Sri Lankan  to engineer and produce Grammy Award winning recordings here
The Sooriya Village will host Kavichandran Alexander from March 5 to April 4. Kavichandran Alexander (Kavi) is the first Sri Lankan to engineer and produce multiple Grammy award winning recordings.
Kavi has recorded many top international artists including Padmabushan Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhat, V.G. Jog (Guru of Pandit Amaradeva) and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan (son of the guru of Pandit Ravi Shankar) and the first Asian to both produce and record major symphony orchestras, such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic, The Saint Petersburg Symphony and the Hungarian National Philharmonic.
Music recorded by Kavis label have been featured in six Hollywood films including Dead Man Walking (Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon), Angel Eyes (Jennifer Lopez), Meet the Fockers (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) and the Bon Jovi documentary The Circle.
As his association with music and musicians around the world reflect, Kavi is truly a connoisseur of global classical music and most certainly the only Sri Lankan of this stature with the ability to speak fluently in Tamil, Singhala and English. Kavi is making it back home since he left Ceylon almost 50 years ago.
He will be conducting multiple meet and greet sessions and workshops, at The Sooriya Village and in selected cities away from Colombo from March 7.
At the meet and greet sessions, he will share knowledge, expertise and skills gained from his experiences working with world renowned artists, interspersed with interesting life stories and anecdotes.
By attending Kavis workshops, participants will gain substantial knowledge on purist microphone techniques, microphone control, microphone anatomy and his own unique microphone placement methods aimed specifically at capturing un-amplified, acoustic music.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, March 6, 2018 - 01:00
Going  rockers over  jockers with a flair for underwear!
Today I take on the brief of writing an incomplete look at the history of men's underwear. No one can disprove the reality that following the invention of Father Adams fig leaf various styles of underwear have evolved.
After people learned to weave cloth, the loincloth became the earliest form of underpants. And it still continues to be in many rural parts of Sri Lanka. So remember that the so called innovative designer unmentionables were invented by the Sri Lankan farmer and fisherman over 2,500 years ago. It is called a breechcloth, a narrow loincloth supported by a waistband. We call it an amude. It is the most practical and comfortable nether garment ever invented.
As far as I recall since the 1950s most middle and upper class Sri Lankan men opted for jockstraps as under-clothing, although they were primarily designed for athletes and sportsmen to give their procreative appendages solid support. Perhaps their brevity and easy-to-wash convenience made them popular among local males for everyday use, even though they were far from being athletic types.
The not-so affluent however opted for the more affordable underwear called the lunket which I believe was uniquely Sri Lankan. Small time local tailors made a killing with bits of waste cloth to turn out cotton type thongs the size of skimpy, hanky-panky lingerie! They were certainly not the cutting edge of designer underwear and depending on the choice of material could cut into the area where your thighs begin.
The lunket actually resembled a womans bikini bottom with three straps of the same material sewn into the left side to facilitate tying them in place. Even if one of the perilously slender straps snapped you could be assured that the thingamajig stayed in place. I do believe that they were later copied by international designers to reinvent the feminine bikini bottom. And the colours dear readers ranged from pastels of all shades to polka dots.
Now back to the jockstraps. Most people called them jocks. I added a more fanciful sobriquet to the nether supporters by rechristening them Jockers and alternately Jockeroos. I still do and so do the grandkids who always take a leaf from their irrepressible old DaDa, much to the chagrin of the family matriarchs.
I concede they are right because one must exercise caution when being jocular with a jockstrap. Take a closer look and you would be sure to observe that at a pinch it could be used as a slingshot. Yes siree, with its matching elastic straps and cotton pouch it could serve as great material for a ready-made catapult.
You see, the family kids refer to their cotton briefs, or any type of underwear for that matter, as Jockers. It is also true that both grandsons Rex Tharindu (13) and Kingsley (9) wear the Real McCoy jockers because they both represent their school Under-XIII cricket team.
For further protection in the event a spinning or swinging ball hits you down under is a hard cup that fits inside your jockers. The cups are hard material inserts and when a rock hard cricket ball hits one its called ringing the bell, which rhymes with hell, which is what it hurts like.
But I must say that rather than a ringing tone it sounds more like a sickening clunk which can be heard all around the ground even without the aid of the new-fangled stump microphones. And imagine the terrifying prospect of being hit where it hurts most without the protection of a groin guard.
Cricketers are advised: Dont leave home for a game without it! It is politely known as a box or abdo-guard and provides ample protection to the  shall we say, pelvic region. But the players commonly refer to it as a ball guard. And you had better have your own because most players arent up for sharing!
There is an old cricket joke that the first box was used in cricket in 1874 and the first cricket helmet was used in 1974. So we know that the earliest players had their bits and pieces in mind and were taking measures to look after them! Another startling facet that strikes us is that it took men 100 years to realise that their head and brains were equally important.
But I have been digressing from the subject of mens under things although other allied appurtenances mentioned of unmentionables have been brought into play. Time was when the key word was unmentionables and it only mattered to mothers that they were clean. You never knew, after all, when you might be knocked down by a bus.
Many are perhaps unaware that Yankee manufacturers have conjured up rump plumper undies that are booty boosters for flat-arse males. I am acquainted with several such un-endowed chaps who could certainly benefit from such an accoutrement. But I suspect it is constricted despite its promise of being like a big smile. I mean, it sounds great that it makes your cheeks go up but if it is too taut you will feel the pinch.
The fashion pundits say you can tell a lot about a person from his underwear, but the catch is that only a very few people will see it, unless you want them to. Surely, it is one of the most private and personal decisions in menswear. Yet it is worn every day, all day, right next to the skin.
As such, comfort is paramount in underwear and while many men prefer one kind of underwear, it makes more sense to choose the style based on the days activity. Your undergarments are often the unsung heroes of your wardrobe.
Even then, its still early days for the male underwear. Womens lingerie has seen an amazingly large number of brands entering the market but men too are conscious of what they wear inside. In Sri Lanka, the underwear market is only beginning to evolve and the brief remains the most popular cut in mens underwear.
So, things have moved swiftly from not having any choice in underwear to more than 40 odd styles in colours enough to give the rainbow technicolour nightmares. They come in lots of different cuts, such as high-waisted, G-string, hip-huggers, high and low rise as well as briefs, boxers, trunks, jockeroos and swimwear. And except for boxers and jockers no one can distinguish between swimwear from underwear. This is fortified by an incident at a Colombo boutique hotel pool when I decided to join the kids for a splash.
It was during the busy lunch hour when the verandahs were chock-full of diners. That was when the beastly grand-brats yelled at the top of their voices: Hey Dada, are those your swimmers or your jockers [emailprotected]

Government unequivocally condemns racial violence
The Government while condemning the recent incidents of violence and misinformation campaign targeting the Muslim community and others, yesterday urged every citizen of the country to desist from falling prey to such hate campaigns.
President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered the Security Forces and the Police to enforce Law and Order and to take immediate action to counter any acts of violence affecting any community in liaison with District and Divisional Secretaries and other administrative officials, a statement issued by the Government Information Department under the hand of Director General of Information Department Sudharshana Gunawardhana said.
The full statement:
The Government of Sri Lanka strongly and unequivocally condemns the recent sporadic incidents of violence that had sparked off in Ampara and Digana, creating communal disharmony, where some places of worship, residences and businesses have been damaged.
The Government also condemns the hate and mischievous misinformation campaigns carried out by some, especially via social media targeting the Muslim community in particular and others as well, with the clear objective of creating disharmony among communities and inciting violence.
The Government urges every citizen of Sri Lanka to desist from falling prey to such hate and misinformation campaigns. As a country that had suffered by acts of violence for nearly three decades, we as a nation should desist from repetition of such.
At the National Security Council Meeting held today His Excellency the President has ordered the Security Forces and the Police to enforce Law and Order and to take immediate action to counter any acts of violence affecting any community, in liaison with the Government Agents / Divisional Secretaries and other District Administrative Authorities. Already they are working to ensure the full and impartial enforcement of law to protect all communities against any attacks that create communal/religious disharmony.
The Government will not hesitate to take firm and stern action against the perpetrators of crimes,and those who violate law and order. The Government urges for total co-operation from all citizens irrespective of any communal, religious differences to build a Nation that is stable, peaceful and progressive, where diversity is respected; and, -- where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy ail freedoms that are the rights of equal citizenship.
Every Sri Lankan citizen inclusive of the clergy, politicians, social leaders, civil societies and media should and must deplore any violence and must co-operate to bring peace and harmony to achieve reconciliation, the statement added.

Rule of law, key to Democratic Governance
Guidelines for administrative accountability
The applicability of the Rule of Law in Fundamental Rights jurisdiction through equality was further expanded and articulated by Fernando J in the case of Jayawardena v Dharani Wijeyatilake, Secretary Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Others [2001], in respect of the termination of the holder of the office of Inquirer into Sudden Deaths, where it was held that: respect for the rule of law requires the observance of minimum standards of openness, fairness and accountability in administration and this means- in relation to appointments and removal from offices involving powers, functions and duties which are public in nature- that the process of making a decision should not be shrouded in secrecy.
Rule of law and the pleasure principle: Application to Cabinet of Ministers
In 1994 Fernando J in Bandara and Another v Premachandra [1994] held in relation to the pleasure principle contained in Article 55 of the Constitution:
It may well be that in the United Kingdom the prerogative in regard to office held at pleasure was very wide. However, any such prerogative recognizes or conferred under a written Constitution, such as ours, with separation of functions, must necessarily be subject to limitations. Article 55(5) makes the pleasure principle subject to the fundamental rights and language rights. Article 55(1) makes it subject to the provisions of the Constitution, so that other limitations may be found elsewhere in the Constitution. The concept of holding office at pleasure suggests prima facie, that dismissal may be for a reason- good, bad, or indifferent  or without any reason. However, since Article 55(1) is subject inter alia, to Article 12, dismissal, even by the Cabinet of Ministers, cannot be for a reason which involves the denial of equal protection violative of Article 12(1) or an infringement of Article 12 (2). The subjection of Article 55(1) to the equality provisions of Article 12 mandates fairness and excludes arbitrariness. Powers of appointment and dismissal are conferred by the Constitution or various authorities in the public interest, and not for private benefit, and their exercise must be governed by reason and not caprice.
Rule of law and the public trust
The concept of public trust and the abiding principle that the powers of the state and that of its officials, agents and instrumentalities are held in trust for the public is a necessary corollary of the more generic concept of the rule of law and operates, complements and renders efficacious, the judicial application of the rule of law as a vital check on State and administrative excess.'
In the cases of Bennet Ratnayake v The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and others [1999] and the Widesheeya Chitrapata Anayanaya Karannange Sangamaya v National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka (1999). It was held by the Supreme Court that:the statutory powers which the respondents have are, like most statutory powers, not absolute, unfettered, or unreviewable; they are held in trust for the benefit of the public; and they cannot be exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously, or unreasonably. Now the concept of the Rule of Law entrenched within the matrix of Article 12 demands that the State must act reasonably and fairly at all times in the contractual sphere as well, irrespective of whether it is at the threshold stage of entering into a contract or after it has been executed.
A democratic form of constitution demands that it should be built on theoretical formulations which considered essentials for ensuring achievements of democratic goals and fulfilling aspirations of the people. However, due to vast powers concentrated in the Executive Presidency encroaching on and suppressing all three branches of the State, there has been a severe debilitation in the area of the rule of law affecting good governance liberties of individuals.
The fact that out of 40 years of the operation of our second Republican Constitution of 1978 the country had been ruled under emergency regulations proclaimed by the Executive President for a period of 25 years, thereby naturally poses the question whether this Constitution is the supreme law of the country which guarantees the rule of law. With the virtual abolition of the 17th Amendment by the 18th Amendment the powers of the Executive President had been virtually unchecked. Today the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which abolished the 18th Amendment restoring the rule of law to some extent is a landmark in Sri Lankan democratic governance.

Hambantota green gram cultivation spans 1,000 acres
Under the National Food Production Programme initiated by the Presidential Secretariat, green gram has been cultivated in an area of 1,000 hectares, in the Hambantota district. Seven hundred and fifty hectares have been cultivated in Lunugamwehera and 250 hectares have been cultivated in other areas of the district, the district agriculture director said.
Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry has provided subsidy funds for green gram cultivators in the Ridiyagama and Badagiriya areas.
The director said that the target for this season with regards to green gram cultivation, has already been achieved. He said the target was 6,000 hectares and added that to prevent cattle from destroying green gram cultivations, steps have been taken to set up electric fences in 30 places in the district.
State lands that remained barren for decades would be brought under mango and other fruit crop cultivations.
Farmers in the Hambantota district have been provided with paddy-planting machines and invasive plant-clearing machines. Steps have also been taken to train farmers on new farming technology and as such, it has been targetted to train 240 farmers.
Another 25 farmers would be trained on growing of grass suitable for cows, in order to boost milk-production, the Hambantota assistant agriculture director said.

The poorest are the least able to adapt to these climate change scenarios and thus are the most vulnerable.
The hardest battle of all time -  climate change
The most important line in this planet is the coastline. But things are changing now. We have to see this new reality and we need to separate fact from fiction. Through a quagmire of politics, emotion and belief, we have lost sight of what is happening to our shoreline and it is time that we all face our real threat - that of climate change (see www.HighTideOnMainStreet.com).
All over the world, the danger is similar: glaciers are disappearing from Alaska to South Africa. This is the reality, the ice is melting and sea levels are rising. This has resulted in the shoreline beginning to move inland. This is obvious, but the ratio of occurrence is incredible: for each foot of rise in sea level, the average global shoreline moves about 300ft inland. For some countries this ratio could be different. These changes are a result of the Earths temperature being 1.50F warmer than it was just a century ago. This may not seem like much, but if you consider that the heat from human emissions is roughly equal to 400,000 atomic bombs exploding across the planet every single day, it is significant. Ice melts at 320C and it does not care for your political party or if you believe in climate change or not.
Carbon emissions and rising sea levels
Sea level rises; global temperature fluctuations and greenhouse gas emissions have had a regular pattern for over millions of years. As it is shown in the CO2 emission pattern (Figure 1), the concentration at present has steadily reached up to 400ppm. Consequently, it is now predicted that the amount of CO2 concentration could increase up to 1,300ppm by 2100.
This realization has created the need for us to pursue alternative energy sources to cut down our use of fossil fuels that contribute to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Models very confidently predict that this could result in an increase in the global surface temperature between 2.50C and 7.80C over pre-industrialized levels. This means that we will not be able to stop the rise completely, but we can slow it down.
Green technology, energy and switching onto sustainable practices can no longer impede the inevitable rise of our sea levels, but the right practices can slow down this impending doom. Further, we need to start adapting to rising sea levels and the possibility of a future with a more unpredictable climate.
Understanding climate change
Climate change has invariably brought out new topics of discussion in the lives of academics to understand this new phenomena. Research carried out in Bangladesh has found that, whichever adaptive strategy proposed for climatic changes, the strategies would not be effective if the victims of its impact do not understand climate change. The concept of environmental migration in the meantime has been mostly discussed in the West Africa region with special reference to forced migration. These studies related to West Africa have revealed that climate change alone is not the cause for migration out of the region. Moreover, when the consequences of climate stresses coincide with economic and social stresses, the probability of forced migration increases significantly (see Brown, O., 2009, Migration and Climate Change, IOM Migration research series). The poorest are the least able to adapt to these climate change scenarios and thus are the most vulnerable. So how can we enhance the resilience of the most vulnerable communities It should be done through a holistic approach, rather than addressing the systems of social, environmental and economical separately.
Climate change like any problem has its positives and negatives. The most promising fact is that the globe will have to work together with a common goal of mitigating and adapting to climate change. The worst case scenario would be the collapse of food chains and increase in world hunger. When considering sea level rises, most climate change discussions point towards the disappearance of many of the greatest cities. This begs the question of what would happen to the poorest of the poor and the shoreline communities; especially that of the fishing communities in developing and least developed countries. The only hope left now is to have strong action taken by governments and civilians to change our reality.
China, the worlds largest greenhouse gas emitter has given its consent to move towards a green economy. Thus it is up to us, ordinary citizens to continue demanding that our political leaders tackle climate change, the hardest problem that humanity has ever faced. We also need to adapt to a shoreline which is shifting inland for the first time in human civilization and these changes need to be done sooner than later.

## Title: Hedley Verity vs Don Bradman

## Section: Sports
## Date: Tuesday, March 6, 2018 - 01:00
Hedley Verity vs Don Bradman
His ideal physique and his lovely, economical, run-up were coordinated to put him in a perfect delivery position with a superb command of length and direction.  Don Bradman on Verity
Don Bradman was in terrific touch as he thrashed three successive fours off Englands slow left arm spinner, Hedley Verity, in his first over during Australias first innings of the 1934 Lords Second Test. It was 23rd June and a sunny Saturday states Roland Perry in his book BRADMANS BEST ASHES TEAMS.
Australia one-up in the series, reached 1 for 141 chasing Englands 440.With Bradman in such murderous touch in partnership with a set Bill Brown, Australia looked likely to lead in the first innings. Bradman had started the series poorly at Nottingham scoring just 29 and 25.
His steel trap mind was programmed to concentrate as only he could do for a big score - something in order of his last effort at Lords in the second Test in 1930 when he made 254. Australian skipper Bill Woodfull, who had been dismissed for 22, was in the dressing room fretting about Bradmans terrible power and splendour, as writer Neville Cardus described it recalled Perry. Woodfull remembered Veritys dismissal of Bradman at the notorious Adelaide Test in 1932-33 Bodyline series
It was in that Adelaide Test that Bradman, in a similar mindset of unrelenting aggression and brilliance, had seen off Harold Larwood and had celebrated by hitting Verity for a six. Bradman was going for another boundary when he was caught and bowled for 66, just when an innings of 266 was needed from him.
Woodfull was at the other end when it happened and annoyed at Bradmans rush of blood. Woodfull thought that it cost Australia a Test and never forgave his charge for it. Now he was having nervous premonitions of Bradman, who had already hit seven fours in an innings of 36, being again impetuous against Verity and getting himself out. He sent a message out to Bradman, imploring him to be less aggressive.
He [Woodfull] thought Bradman was going to throw his wicket away, and he was under instruction to calm down. It threw his concentration. The very next ball he restrained himself when his natural inclination was to keep attacking. In so doing, he checked a shot against his better judgment and was caught and bowled.
Australia still had most of the final session to play in the sun on Saturday. Bradman felt that he had been allowed free rein, Australia would have saved the follow on by reaching 290, despite the storm that hit London on the rest day, Sunday, and the subsequent rain into Monday morning. Bradmans disgruntlement had some merit, but it was merely conjecture. The scoreboard showed the hard fact that Verity had removed him again at a critical point in a Test, noted Perry. Australia was two for 192 at stumps on day two.
At the teams London hotel Verity awoke on Monday morning and was delighted when he looked thru his window on to the street. It was bleak and damp, just the way he loved it. The pitch would be wet after being left uncovered (as they were then). He drove team-mate Charlie Barnett to Lords at St Johns Wood for the game and, on the way, had the misfortune to run over and kill a black cat. To Barnets amazement, Verity parked the car and went on knocking on doors on both sides of the street until he found the cats owner and apologised.
A couple of people recognised Hedley, Barnett recalled, and they were stunned that a famous English cricketer should be so concerned moments before he was due at Lords. But it was typical Hedley. He was humane and humble to the bootstraps.
That dead black pussy was an omen not for Verity, but for the Australians. He was so confident of the conditions he was about to bowl in that he could let himself be distracted in such a bizarre way, moments before a big occasion.
When play resumed under overcast skies, Bill Bowes removed Bill Brown, caught at the wicket for 105 with the score at 203.Then Verity continued the rot by having the dangerous Stan McCabe (34) caught by Hammond at slip. Australia was four for 205. Len Darling didnt last long. He was caught by Sutcliffe off Verity for a duck. Five for 204.
Australia still 86 short of avoiding the follow on. Bradmans dismissal the day before now seemed like the games turning point. Veritys figures were 36 overs, 15 maidens, seven wickets for 61 runs.
He was known in England as the master of sticky wickets. Debate ensued about how bad the Lords wicket was, an indication that Verity conjured problems for the batsmen by playing mind games with them by using calibrated changes in pace, spin and direction, along with adjustments on the field. Verity played on the fact that most batsman thought he was easy to hit because he was a slow bowler. He left gaps in the field, inviting them to take him on.
The great and the not so great fell for this more often than not, and Verity walked away with wickets by the bucketful in first class cricket, added Perry.
Now at Lords at the age of 29 and near his peak, Verity had demonstrated his subtle skills against top international opposition. England skipper Bob Wyatt enforced the follow-on. Australia began its second innings just before 3 p.m. They soon lost Brown caught for two. In came Bradman at 2 for 43. Subdued again by his skipper, the state of the game and the wicket, Bradman was cautious.
He took 30 minutes to score 13. He became restless. Verity cunningly left cover open and deep behind it unoccupied. Bradman took the bait, jumped down the wicket and mishit. The ball flew high straight above the wicket. Seven players could have taken it. Bradman stepped aside. Keeper Les Ames moved under the ball and caught it. Bradman always stood between England and victory. By 6 p.m. Verity had obliterated the Australians (all out 118), taking 8 for 43.

Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera
His lifework revered and alive
The collective Sri Lankan soul suffered a benumbing shock, just a couple of weeks ago. This was brought on, by the sudden and tragic demise of Ven. Prof. Bellanvila Wimalaratana Anunayaka Thera, Chancellor, Sri Jayawardhanapura University.
Before those tears could have the time to dry up, destiny was poised to deal the Sri Lankan mass mind, yet another shattering blow. It fell on the elitist Buddhist Missionary Monk, Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera, whose name had entrenched itself in popular memory indelibly. It was widely known that he was ailing for quite a while and that Mara (death) was not at all in a mood, to relax his stranglehold. But, when the Ven. Monk's life came to an end early on Saturday, his fervent devotees could not help but feel vastly devastated.
I have known him for quite a long while and have been profoundly impressed by his phenomenal dexterity to be innovative and to organise institutions and events, displaying skills that are rare.
When he took over the monastery which has now become a centre for ceaseless spiritual activities it was a fairly austere place of worship. The late prelate, Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera, transformed it into a Buddhist shrine with a spiritual personality of its own.
He metamorphosed the Sambodhi Vihara, he found, into a glowing gem of spirituality, that emanated a serene glow of religiousness, exerting an overpowering fervour on the visiting devotees.
Buddhist programmes
One major factor that determined this transformation, was his own unique character. The subdual tone of voice, in which he presented his sermons and recited the price and the verses of Buddhist texts, held a special allure for the ardent devotee. He organised discussion sessions, both in Sinhala and in English and took an initiative in introducing Buddhist programmes that had an intimate relevance to the daily lives of the devotees.
He organised a solid campaign to sensitize the people to the social threat posed by contaminated food.
He conducted authoritative discussions, on this theme, inviting experts to participate in them.
Taking a further and pragmatic step, he organised stalls, for those who had uncontaminated food items to market.
He initiated Dhamma teaching in the English medium, for the benefit of those children who were more familiar with that language than with Sinhala.
He was fully aware of the appeal of the spectacle to the average devotee. He organised pageants and processions, and fabulous forms of mass religious rituals in the holy cities, with hundreds of thousands of devotees, participating.
The 24x7 Buddhist TV Channel he founded, has led to an impressive Buddhist Resurgence.
His influential Buddhist Channel has become strongly integrated into the Sri Lankan ethos as a steady and unshakeable destitution and a social force, to be reckoned with.
Buddhist missionary monk
As an exceptionally active Buddhist missionary monk of our day, he supervised a system of two-way pilgrimages.
On occasion, the Ven. Monk would lead a team to a selected destination abroad. When the country that is focussed on becomes China, the modern Sri Lankan pilgrim has to play a reverse Fa-Hsien role - as it were. As is quite extensively known, the Chinese pilgrim monk Fa-Hsien came over to Sri Lanka, about 400 PD with the specific intention of studying Buddhist texts and rituals in our land.
Reversing this Fa  Hsien role, Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera would lead an occasional Sri Lankan Buddhist team to China, enabling them to familiarize themselves, with the status of Buddhism in modern China (The ancient Cathey Empire). Such visits, which were considered valued cultural gestures, received due reciprocation by the teams of Buddhist leaders, who came over from China to Ven. Kusaladhamma's spiritual centre  now and again.
As an extension of his missionary work, Ven. Kusaladhamma, established a branch in London, to spread the eternal Buddha word.
I had the good fortune to travel with him to Mysore in India and to Thailand.
While visiting the fabulous Palace of the Maharaja of Mysore, the Ven. Monk observed that the grandeur of the Mysore Palace is solid proof that the stories of the three places, constructed by the doting father  King Suddhodana, for his son Prince Siddhartha, were not at all exaggerations.
In Thailand, we visited the temple from which Ven. Upali Thera began his voyage to Sri Lanka, to revive the weakening Buddhist practise in Sri Lanka, by re-introducing higher ordination to our land.
These instances are quoted, merely to indicate the many-faceted personalities of the late prelate, Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera. He set up the state of the art printing equipment, to help his envisaged publications project.
When I visited him, when he was ailing, his longtime devotee, associated and friend, Sashi Jayatilake, who had been at his site for quite a long while, presented to the Venerable, a copy of my Sinhala translation of the great Buddhist epic The Light of Asia authored by Sir Edwin Arnold. I did this authoritative translation at the request of Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera.
Buddhist cultural initiatives
He was immensely pleased to see the completed work. He stroked my hand in appreciation, as words would not come to him. He wrote a little note: Please show this to the President. I was profoundly moved, though I did not know, that this was the last time we would meet him.
When he passed away, at 54, he had a well thought out agenda, for the restoration of the fading glory of Buddhist cultural initiatives, in this sacred land. The fulfilment of his noble dream will have to be the holy duty and spiritual responsibility of those who would inherit his tradition.
With all that, he possessed a quiet disarming sense of humour, as well. He is, to my mind, a re-incarnation of Ven. Anagarika Dharmapala.
When death, sadly prevented the continuation of his spiritual mission, we are filled with an immense sorrow.
But, once again, relief comes to us from the timeless words of the Supreme Buddha:
There is no device, by which, one who is born can escape death.
While wishing the Great Buddhist Leader and outstanding spiritual communicator, Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera, the Eternal Bliss of Nibbana, we cannot but, selfishly hope, he will be reborn here, to complete his unfinished mission.

'Impressive 12% of Indian pilots are women'
Heard about Avani Chaturvedi the first Indian woman fighter pilot is how Air Indias Captain Kshamata Bajpai begins her conversation, reflecting her passion for flying.
The 50-year-old has been flying commercial planes with Air India for two decades and is the first captain to command an aircraft with an all-woman crew on the longest direct flight from Delhi to San Francisco.
Bajpai discovered her passion for flying serendipitously when she enrolled herself into National Cadet Corps Air Wing while in college. It took her some time to convince her parents as commercial flying wasnt the most obvious profession for women back in the day.
Flying since 1997 She became the first captain to command an aircraft with an all-woman crew on the longest direct flight from Delhi to San Francisco
Nivedita Bhasin was the only woman in her batch of 20 at the Flying Club in Bihar in 1981. I was treated like an outsider. Some took time to get used to the idea of a woman pilot, others took it as a challenge to ensure I dont achieve what I set out to, recalls the 52-year-old Allahabad-born and Delhi-based captain of Air India. A year after joining the airline (then Indian Airlines), she didnt know how to broach the topic of her 4-month pregnancy with her male instructor because there was no formal maternity leave policy for pilots in India until 1987.
Flying since 1984 third female pilot to join Indian Airlines, was Nivedita Bhasin who paved the way for the airlines maternity leave policy formulation in 1987. At 26, she became the youngest woman pilot in the world to fly a jet aircraft in 1990. Her son and daughter are captains in Air India and Indigo respectively
Bhasin changed that and went on to become the youngest woman pilot in the world to fly a jet aircraft in 1990. Much has changed since Bajpai and Bhasins era of struggle. Today, 12% of Indias over 10,000 commercial pilots are women. Its among the highest percentage in the world and significantly better than the global average of 5.4%.
Even inside the cockpit, your gender does not affect your growth prospects because everything is driven by the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), says Captain Anushree Verma. The 32-year-old has been a commercial pilot with SpiceJet since 2010.
She feels its not the people in aviation but the world outside that still cant fathom how a woman can command an aircraft. Be it a cab driver or a passenger who spots you at the airport or inside the plane - if youre a woman in a uniform, they assume youre a crew member or a co-pilot; you cant possibly be the Pilot-in-Command (PIC), she says.
Flying since 2003 A small-town girl from Punjabs SAS Nagar district, Captain Jaswinder Kaur, (35, Air Asia) spent four years travelling 135 km every day from Kharar town to Karnal in Punjab Roadways buses just to get her CPL (commercial pilot Licence). Started her aviation career with Air Deccan and was with GoAir before joining AirAsia. She had a brief stint with Kingfisher Airlines and is still cross about the several lakhs in salary that it owes her.

Intellectuals at war
Intellectual Property rights are not just for lawyers. For many, Intellectual Property (IP) would bring to mind counterfeit mobile phones, fake labels in clothes and accessories and pirated films sold on streets of Colombo.
Perhaps one might recall the cases giant corporations or famous artists filed in Court to claim ownership over an idea, trademark or a brand. Like when Apple successfully obtained a patent so that nobody can ever make a product that is rectangular with rounded corners or when US pop star, Taylor Swift trademarked certain song lyrics from her bestselling album 1989.
Those of you wanting to get slogans such as party like its 1989 and this sick beat on your T-shirts or even in a removable tattoo, you will have to ask Taylor Swifts permission first.
In short, IP can seem like a technical, legal thing that scares off anyone who is not a lawyer or an IP expert but companies may have IP assets that can make a lot of money. IP's role in the global economy is becoming more significant and the most innovative companies at present are those that trade not goods but services, ideas, technology and data. Economies that create, preserve and disseminate IP well are the ones that will turn out to be innovative and competitive.
Thus it is vital to understand that IP is of strategic importance to all business not just to protect, enforce and ring fence, but to grow, acquire and become bigger. Many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are ignorant that they possess assets of their own, which could be their IP and that they could make money from them more than they can imagine.
Protecting your works
If you are starting up a business, writing a book, creating new design or composing music having the right type of intellectual property protection helps stop people stealing or copying:
* the names of your products or brands
* your inventions
* the design or look of your products
* things you write, make or produce
Protecting a potentially lucrative idea can be exciting and unnerving in equal measure. By defining and demonstrating the original aspects of your idea youll be able to stop a third party from legally developing an identical product and ruining all your hard work.
Copyright, patents, designs and trademarks are all types of intellectual property protection. You get some types of protection automatically, others you have to apply for.
Copyright
Copyright (or authors right) is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings.
There are two types of rights under copyright: economic rights, which allow the rights owner to derive financial reward from the use of his works by others; and moral rights, which protect the non-economic interests of the author.
Most copyright laws state that the rights owner has the economic right to authorize or prevent certain uses in relation to a work or, in some cases, to receive remuneration for the use of his work. The economic rights owner of a work can prohibit or authorize:
* its reproduction in various forms, such as printed publication or sound recording;
* its public performance, such as in a play or musical work;
* its recording, for example, in the form of compact discs or DVDs;
* its broadcasting, by radio, cable or satellite;
* its translation into other languages; and
* its adaptation, such as a novel into a film screenplay.
Examples of widely recognized moral rights include the right to claim authorship of a work and the right to oppose changes to a work that could harm the creator's reputation.
Patent
A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application.
In principle, the patent owner has the exclusive right to prevent or stop others from commercially exploiting the patented invention. In other words, patent protection means that the invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed, imported or sold by others without the patent owner's consent.
Patents are territorial rights. In general, the exclusive rights are only applicable in the country or region in which a patent has been filed and granted, in accordance with the law of that country or region.
The protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years from the filing date of the application.
Trademarks
A trademark is a sign capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from those of other enterprises. Trademarks are protected by intellectual property rights.
At the national/regional level, trademark protection can be obtained through registration, by filing an application for registration with the national/regional trademark office and paying the required fees. In principle, a trademark registration will confer an exclusive right to the use of the registered trademark. This implies that the trademark can be exclusively used by its owner, or licensed to another party for use in return for payment.
Industrial designs
In a legal sense, an industrial design constitutes the ornamental or aesthetic aspect of an article. An industrial design may consist of three dimensional features, such as the shape of an article, or two dimensional features, such as patterns, lines or colour.
Industrial designs are applied to a wide variety of products of industry and handicraft items: from packages and containers to furnishing and household goods, from lighting equipment to jewellery, and from electronic devices to textiles. Industrial designs may also be relevant to graphic symbols, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and logos.
Geographical indications
Geographical Indications is a name or sign that is used on goods to showcase a special quality, character or reputation because they are originating from specific place (country or a place of a country) for example; Ceylon Tea, Ceylon Cinnamon, Ceylon Sapphire, Nuwaraeliya Tea and Ruhunu Curd.
As they serve as a symbol of quality, character or reputation of a particular product, it helps greatly commercialize the goods.
The law protects GIs by prohibiting the use of it for the goods that are not actually originating from the respective place. The court can issue injunctions to stop such use. In Sri Lanka GIs are protected without registration. GIs can also be protected under the laws of unfair competition and certification marks and collective marks. The misrepresentation as to GI is an offence too.
Success story of a global giant
Apple Inc. the American multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services has used IP to grow into what it is today. The company's hardware products which include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker is a popular inventor who fights to protect the fruits of its genius from a shameless imitators.
The companys fixation with intellectual property dates back to the 1980s when it confronted clones that copied the operating systems of Apple II computers.
Apple made history in 1982 when it won an appeals court verdict declaring for the first time that companies could use copyright to protect the software embedded in chips.
For Apple, this was just the beginning of an effort to push out the legal boundaries protecting its products. By the 1990s, Apple lawyers had developed a strategy of wrapping layer after layer of legal rights around each gadget. These layers can include one of its dozens of i-related trademarks or some of the thousands of patents in Apples portfolio.
In practice, this means that any Apple product, from basic headphones to a 16 GB iPad is bristling with utility patents, design patents, trade secrets, trade dress, copyright and other legal spikes designed to keep its competitors far, far away. The companys obsession with intellectual property is also reflected in its refusal to prune its patent portfolio. Typically, companies let some of their weak patents lapse rather than paying thousands of dollars in maintenance fees to hold onto them. Not Apple. According to the Patently-O blog, Apple never abandons a single patent. And the company is still at it. Apples most recent coup is what appears to be an unprecedentedly broad design patent for the wedge shape of its Mac Book Air laptop.
World Intellectual Property Organization
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a self-funding agency of the United Nations, with 191 member states is the global forum for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation.
It aims to lead the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property (IP) system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. The organisations mandate, governing bodies and procedures are set out in the WIPO Convention, which established WIPO in 1967.
In Sri Lanka
The current Intellectual Property system in Sir Lanka is governed by the Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003 which makes provisions for a variety of Intellectual Property rights and their acquisition, management and enforcement. The National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka established under this law is the government department, which is responsible for the administration of the Intellectual Property System in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka too encourages its people to use intellectual property protection through several policies and programmes designed to enhance innovations. Last year the country saw the increase in Patents registrations from 124 in 2016 to 183. Registrations of Industrial designs for the year 2017 were 330 while the trade mark registrations increased to a staggering 10,622 compared to 3,312 in 2016. As the country moves forward it is high time for businesses and innovators to get over the simplistic understanding of IP. It will create a safer environment for businesses to enter Sri Lankas economy. If more awareness is created on IP, it may not be too long before IP becomes the next hot trend in business.

Just as  I am..!
Billy Graham is dead. The man who was revered by every American president, who vied to have him at their Inaugurals, died two weeks ago at the grand old age of ninety-nine. Two years ago, visiting Chicago, I had gone over to the Billy Graham Museum, and with all the humility within me, tears welling up in my eyes, I had seen exhibits revealing the story of the simplest, yet most powerful preacher of all time. I saw his weather-beaten briefcase, his old Bible, and did not dare touch the wooden, worn out pulpit, from where hed quite often delivered his powerful messages.
And then I heard the strains of, Just As I Am Without One Plea.
It was a hymn sung after every message he delivered, and as choir voices rose in crescendo, thousands upon thousands in the audience, stepped out onto the aisles and walked down, just as they were, to welcome God into their lives.
They suddenly knew it was just as they were that God wanted them, not with all the degrees that went after their names, not with all the good theyd done, nor bad theyd inflicted, just wanted them, dirty, filthy, lying, maybe cheats, bad husbands, flirting wives, however, whatever, whoever, just as they were!
Hey Bob, God calls, You dont seem to want me around you
Youre too holy! I shout back, When I become clean and good, Ill come to you!
I dont need you clean and good!
What! I shout back, Then how will you have me
Just As you are Bob! He whispers, And then as we walk together, youll get clean!
Somehow the idea of not having to work towards holiness appeals to me, because I know however much I try Ill never succeed, whereas if He above, works in me, theres a pretty good chance, a change can happen.
Its like theres a river in spate and we have to reach the other side. A strong swimmer stands up and says he will swim us across, But please dont struggle or swim by yourself, Ill do the swimming! he says with a smile of confidence. Everybody is taken to the other side and Mr Swimmer turns around, Anybody remaining he asks and then sees me, Whats with you Bob
Im practicing to swim like you! I tell him, So you wont feel bad when you carry me!
Bob! says the swimmer, as he gently takes me and starts to swim to the other shore, I want you to be just as you are! Im the one getting you across!
It was two years ago in Chicago, that I walked through the Billy Graham museum, and as I walked out into the dark night, tears glistening in my eyes, I heard again the strains of that same tune, and saw thousands walk down the aisle, Just as they were..!

Justice prevails over alleged fraudulent and corrupt awards
The Presidential Appeals Board (PAB) on procurements made recommendations to award the Retrocession Program to cover 30% Compulsory Reinsurance Cession for the Period from January, 1 2018 to 31 December 2018, to Strategic Insurance Brokers, overturning the earlier decision by the Cabinet Approved Procurement Committee (CAPC).
This award was conveyed to the Cabinet, which has approved the recommendation by the PAB and sent word on the award of the tender to Strategic Insurancebrokers (Sib), to the National Insurance Trust Fund, the Procurement entity (NITF).
This decision of the PAB comes close on the heels of the District Court of Colombo making interim injunction that the overseas illegitimate company which was presented with an intent to award on the above program by the NITF, is not entitled to and cannot hold themselves out as an insurance broker or function as a reinsurance broker in Sri Lanka. This order was made subsequent to an initial enjoining order issued earlier this year.
The PAB decision establishes incontrovertibly that Strategic Insurance Brokers bid for the above retrocession program was the best and the most competitive, and most responsive bid. The PAB overturned the decision of the CAPC affirming Sibs position that the recent decision not to make the award in the program to Sib was arbitrary, capricious, and "tantamount to constructive fraud and corruption.
Strategic Insurance Brokers has offered the best premiums and the most responsive bids for national programs on the past several years and on the last two occasions with regards to this retrocession program that covers all catastrophic and all risks of all insurance companies in Sri Lanka, and is the incumbent broker.
Among other things Sib offered the best terms given by the best panel of reinsurance companies in the international market. The cover among other things indemnifies against natural calamities which is a very important national issue since the 2004 Tsunami and 2016 flood calamities etc.
The successful company SIBs Reinsurance Business is ably supported by a majority of the worlds leading underwriters and International brokers including Brokers at Lloyds, thus demonstrating a greater success in all the business placed by them in Sri Lanka.
More importantly and significantly, in all the tenders of the NITF, for instance, their bids contained the best terms and were the most competitive. This is mainly due to the skills and due diligence practiced by them, along with carefully selected international partners and leading brokers in their respective regions.
The CAPC was wrongly misinformed and disregarded the fact that Strategic Insurance Brokers offered the most responsive bid and that the intent to offer was to an overseas company not even a registered broker accredited with the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka.
Colombo District Court Judge Sujeewa Nishanka issued an interim injunction essentially forbidding any foreign company that is not registered as a company, or as insurance broker, from offering any insurance related services in the country. The complainant in this case, Strategic Insurance Brokers (Sib) sought the order against an overseas company J B Boda and Co from holding itself out as an insurance broker.
Romesh de Silva, PC Chanaka de Silva appearing for the complainant Sib, in his submissions before court stated that the defendant Company had been making bids for major tenders on insurance related matters. The plaint filed states that the defendant is been awarded tenders illegitimately by state statutory bodies such as the National Insurance Trust Fund.
Meanwhile Indrajith Fernando Director Sib revealed that National Insurance procurement programs have had to be renewed as at 1st January 2018 and have not been extended after expiry, due to what can only be called irresponsible behavior, and the malefide attempt by officials to award tenders to illegitimate Overseas companies.
Though Sib as the incumbent leader had offered lower premiums with almost the same panel of underwriters, the intent for new awards were to be made at excessive exorbitant premiums to the overseas companies, he stated.
The Line Ministry namely The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, vigilant to these unauthorized activities, had requested the local brokering company Sib Insurance Brokers to avail themselves of their right to appeal.
The National Procurement Guidelines exist for just such purposes to prevent companies being given awards pending appeal, with alleged fraud and corruption when tenders are granted at excessive premiums compared to the bids offered by the competition, Fernando added.
Industry sources added that if foreign companies are appointed to take up national reinsurance brokering assignments, it leads to corruption as amply demonstrated in this instant, as there is zero accountability regarding these companies operations, as the legislation with regard to insurance regulation suggests.
Section 79 of the Regulation of the Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 (as amended) provides that; No person shall act or hold itself out as an insurance broker unless such person is a holder of a certificate of registration as a broker granted by the Board and is a member of an Association of Insurance Brokers approved by the Board.
In Section114broker means the placing of insurance business for or on behalf of an insurer, for insurance or reinsurance, with an insurer or reinsurer.

2019 Cricket World Cup qualifier
Khan bemoans conditions after Scotland stun Afghanistan
HARARE, Sunday  Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan bemoaned having the worst of the conditions, after Calum MacLeod struck a magnificent 157 not out to lead Scotland to a surprise seven-wicket win in their opening 2019 World Cup qualifier at Bulawayo on Sunday.
Afghanistan, one of the pre-tournament favourites to qualify, made 255 all out batting first, but MacLeod hammered 23 fours and a six in his blistering 146-ball knock to lead Scotland to victory with 16 deliveries remaining.
"The wicket was difficult to bat on, it wasn't coming good onto the bat," said 19-year-old Khan, the first-ever teenager to skipper a men's international side.
"Later on when the sun came out, it was totally different and it was quite easy to bat on. The toss is really important in these games, but that's not in our hands, there's nothing we can do about that."
Hosts Zimbabwe lead the early Group B table, though, after their 116-run thrashing of Nepal, while the United Arab Emirates and Ireland got off to winning starts in Group A against Papua New Guinea and the Netherlands respectively.
The 10 teams in Zimbabwe are fighting it out for only two places alongside the world's top eight ODI sides at next year's World Cup in England and Wales.
A famous Scotland win looked unlikely when 16-year-old Afghan leg-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman dismissed openers Matthew Cross and Kyle Coetzer inside the first six overs.
But Richie Berrington joined MacLeod at the crease as the pair put on a 208-run stand to see off Afghanistan and gain a measure of revenge for their narrow defeat by the same opposition at the 2015 World Cup.
"The standout (performance) for us today is MacLeod," said Scotland captain Coetzer.
"It was an unbelievable effort from him. It's a great start to the tournament but we will take every day as it comes."
Rising star Khan was attacked by MacLeod and conceded 68 runs from his nine overs.
The leg-spinner finally ended the partnership by trapping Berrington lbw, but by then the game was gone and Afghanistan will have to bounce back against Zimbabwe on Tuesday, with only the top three teams from each group to reach the Super Six stage.
"We needed some wickets in the middle and we didn't do that," added Khan. "They played really well, had a good partnership and that took the game away from us."
Earlier, Afghanistan had recovered from 71-4 to post a challenging total thanks to 92 from all-rounder Mohammad Nabi and the big-hitting Najibullah Zadran's 67.
Elsewhere, Zimbabwe restored some confidence after their 4-1 series defeat by Afghanistan last month by crushing Nepal as both Sikandar Raza and Brendan Taylor hit hundreds.
Wicket-keeper Taylor managed an even 100, but the headlines were grabbed by all-rounder Raza's 66-ball 123 that featured nine maximums.
Nepal battled bravely in reply but never threatened Zimbabwe's massive total of 380-6, as Raza added 3-48 with his off-spin in a virtuoso individual display.
Ireland, who have beaten Pakistan, England and the West Indies over the last three World Cups, got off to an impressive start with a comfortable 93-run win in a weather-shortened game against the Dutch.
Andy Balbirnie's 68 led the Irish to 268-7, before Tim Murtagh took three wickets as the Netherlands slumped to 149 all out in pursuit of 243 from 41 overs.
The UAE, who gave two-time world champions the West Indies a scare in a warm-up match earlier in the week, had little trouble in brushing aside Papua New Guinea to edge ahead of Ireland at the top of Group A on net run rate.
The Windies get their Group A campaign underway against the UAE on Tuesday.

Lalith Wickramaratne appointed CMC Acting Municipal Commissioner
Lalith Wickramaratne was appointed Acting Municipal Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) with immediate effect, yesterday.
Wickramaratne received the letter of appointment as Acting Municipal Commissioner from Western Province Governor K.C. Logeswaran yesterday.
Responding to the Daily News, Eng. Wickramaratne said the CMC will fully support and provide all relevant and available information to authorities who will conduct an inquiry into the Meethotamulla tragedy, following the recommendations provided by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry which investigated the matter.
Engineer Wickramaratne served as the Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Engineering Services) at the CMC before his appointment.
Former Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura was removed from the position of Colombo Municipal Commissioner, last Friday (2). CMC trade unions yesterday protested against his removal. The report of the Presidential Commission appointed to investigate into the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump was handed over to the President on February 6.
President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a one-man Presidential Commission of Inquiry last year to investigate the Meethotamulla dump collapse.
The Commissioner was retired Appeals Court Judge Chandradasa Nanayakkara.
According to an article published on the Presidents Media Division Website, the Commission report noted, Even though the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) had paid Rs. 64 million to dispose of waste in 2014, that amount had increased to Rs. 183 million in 2015 and in 2016 to Rs. 232 million.
The report had also noted that the incompetence of the CMC in waste removal and its refusal to implement solutions offered had exacerbated the garbage problem and led to the collapse of the Meethotamulla dump.

Lanka looking to carry Bangladesh momentum into Nidahas tri-series
Sri Lanka will try to continue their recent upswing of fortunes in international cricket under new coach Chandika Hathurusingha when they make their first appearance at home under him in the Hero Nidahas T20 tri-series that commences at the R Premadasa Stadium at 7 pm today.
Sri Lankas recent success in Bangladesh across all three formats has renewed interest in the game if one is to go by the number of fans who had queued up at the RPS yesterday to purchase tickets for todays lung-opener between Sri Lanka and India. Bangladesh is the third team in the competition.
A new look Indian side sans several of their key players like captain Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni under the leadership of Rohit Sharma will find Sri Lanka a different proposition when they confront them.
India dominated in all three formats both at home and in Sri Lanka in back to back series recently but a resurgent Sri Lanka came back to their own in Bangladesh showing the dominance that they are generally renowned for.
If you go by the ratings, India is the no. 1 team, so they always start ahead of the other teams, said Hathurusingha at the end of Sri Lankas practice session yesterday.
Whoever comes for India is a very strong team. We have to start well because we havent been doing well at home. With Bangladesh, because of the last series, we probably have a little edge over them mentally. But still India is the no. 1 team, he said.
Although India are without some of their big stars Hathurusingha said that he was not taking any side lightly.
We cant control their selection. We are playing the Indian team so whoever they play on that day we prepare for them. If the stars are there its good for the spectators, but unfortunately at this stage theyve come with a different team. It doesnt mean that we are favourites, said Hathurusingha.
There is no such thing as a big match or small match. It is just another match for us. We prepare the same for every game. The only difference is we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the other team.
Hathurusingha admitted that the wins in Bangladesh had brought back the confidence into the team.
Its definitely given us confidence to repeat what we did. The players probably understand their roles much better than they used to before. As long as they try to play to their potential, well be competitive.
Our preparation has been satisfactory. We got good conditions. In the last few days we also had the T20 tournament - our players participated in that. There arent too many changes either. I think were shaping up well, Hathurusingha added. Sri Lanka experimented by opening the batting with Kusal Mendis in the two T20 internationals in Bangladesh and the exceptionally talented young batter responded with two brilliant half-centuries that contributed towards his teams 2-0 series win. Mendis two innings did not go unrecognised for he picked up the Man of the Match award in both games and topped it by winning the Player of the Series award.
Kusals mentality is really good these days. He knows his game and understands himself better. Our coaches have worked very closely with him, and explained those things to him. He has clarity about what he does now. I think its the mental stat thats the biggest factor in his regaining form, said Hathurusingha.
Whether Sri Lanka would persist with Mendis to open the innings Hathurusingha didnt explain. We will open with whoever we feel will play the best. Well also look at the other teams strengths and limitations before coming to that decision also.
The national selectors decision to ignore veteran pacie Lasith Malinga for the series had evoked a lot of comment on social media about his exclusion.
Hathurusingha however didnt specifically elaborate Malingas future as a player in the team but responded by saying: Lasith Malinga is a wonderful player - someone who has a global reputation, not just in Sri Lanka. Hes an icon player for the game.
Like in basketball they have Michael Jordan; Malinga is like that with cricket. In terms of form, he has done well in the recent past. I cant talk about what was talked about at the selectors meeting, but I think he can contribute to Sri Lankan cricket in the future.

Make peace,  make jazz
Wow! Just wow! Wycliffe Gordon was recently in the island! I mean this guy is as big as Beyonce! He is an American jazz trombonist, arranger, composer, band leader, and music educator. He also sings and plays didgeridoo, trumpet, tuba, and piano. Daily News managed to catch up with Gordon and spoke all about his love for music.
When I visited Germany in October 1989, the wall that stood between West Berlin and East Berlin, it was still there. So I went to one of the check points, to learn about the history. So I could appreciate what we as the human race have had to endure throughout history in many different cultures. And I was in Germany for around five days. So we were staying in the hotel and I felt the discrimination. I mean if looks could kill!! I thought they hated me because of my brown color. Later on in the tour I came to understand that that was not it at all! They were simply not happy with the relations they had with America! So it was an American thing and not a black and a white thing! Then when I played at a concert, some of the same people were there and they were not frowning! They were smiling! They were laughing and singing! They were dancing! And to this date I have never forgotten that image. I saw firsthand how music can make everyone happy! And how it can make us celebrate! The same people who seemed to be disgusted with me and who looked like they did not want me to exist  they were smiling!, said Gordon.
And that was a day Gordon never forgot! He feels that one important issue when it comes to music is how you reach the people. When you reach people they come to your concert and feel better about life. Gordon pointed out that the music they have shared gives them a wonderful feeling.
I am here with my band to celebrate 70 years of Sri Lankas independence and the great relationship Sri Lanka has with the United States. So I was called over here to basically to do what I love to do and that is make music. As many have before me, I am here as an ambassador playing jazz from the United States. So this is all about promoting world peace which is basically what jazz is about. It is something that unites people. So I was called by the US embassy to come over here. And I was really elated about coming here, said Gordon.
Gordon grew up in a household with music. His father studied classical piano and performed in Church. So his family heard a lot of classical music such as Piano music. And Gordon attended church and heard a lot of gospel music. Gordon listened to the radio but did not hear Jazz until he was 13 or 14 years old.
I took an interest in jazz in 1980 when I was thirteen, while listening to jazz records inherited from my great-aunt. The collection included a five-LP anthology. I fell in love with the music of New Orleans. That was what kind of caught my ear. A lot of my colleagues listened to the popular jazz of that time. I was listening to the classics such as Louis Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson. That was my introduction to jazz and little did I know it would consume my life and become something I loved doing, said Gordon.
Gordon loved music but also loved to do sports. But given the choice between playing football and doing band in High School, he discovered he loved music much more.
I was introduced to it by my father who always had music in the house. At age 12 I started playing my first band instrument  the Trombone. So this continued throughout junior high school, high school and college. I am a former star of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Wynton Marsalis Septet. Then I pursued my own career as a soloist and I taught at universities and brings me to where I am today, explained Gordon.
Gordon still performs, teaches, compose, arranges and has his own publishing company and record company.
Learning about music has been great and learning about the business side of music is also great. So now I am in Sri Lanka with my own band, and I am having a great time. I have always performed alongside some really great band members. I have really received a lot of encouragement in life by the people that matter. So there was nothing I thought I could not do. First and foremost in the beginning of my formative years, as a teenager I was really influenced by people who touched my life. You may get moments where you will be discouraged by anything  things you see in the world. I have always kept my mind open and when I was growing up in music I never thought there was anything I could not do. When I left the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, it was difficult at first, but I wanted to try everything I learnt as a composer. I did not have anything to feel anxious about. I have had very supportive parents, and my band director always told me that I could do anything I put my mind to, and those words never left me. So I have just kept on going, pointed out Gordon.
Gordon spoke of music as a Universal language. He loved sports and playing football, but at an early age he saw the effect music had on people. He is thrilled that now he is traveling to places that he had only read about.
Making music is a wonderful feeling. It is never about the applause. We love music because we also like people to enjoy what we are doing. I am always trying to read my audience keeping in mind  Berlin. When it comes to music, you see people at war, suddenly unite and sitting side by side, listening to music. So I thought to myself  Wow! This is the power of music. You are welcomed! Now music is a part of who I am and what I do, added Gordon.
Gordons message to any young person is to find out what you love to do and just do it. Gordon wakes up each day just loving the fact that he is going to do what he loves to do. There is something great about that. Coming to Sri Lanka he was well received by us. And that really makes him positive. And that comes out in the music. He has gotten a really great vibe by Sri Lankans.
I love it here in Sri Lanka and I have been here before and coming here again gives me a really different perspective and it is a good feeling I get. So you just need to seize the opportunities you get in life. I just like dealing with people. The music that came from that humanitarian Louis Armstrong was just full of love. He had a great influence on me. That was why people loved Louis Armstrong. He knew the people did not know any better because there was a lot of racism at that time. He gave everything and did not hurt anyone, stated Gordon. Gordon believes the best of people. He believes in us. They will remember Sri Lanka for a long time to come.
The great Wycliffe Gordon and his International All Stars toured Sri Lanka in February staging performances and master classes in Colombo, Galle, and Matara, bringing the best America has to offer.

Addressing the media after meeting Minister Samarawickrama at World Trade Centre yesterday morning he said that the medical students of state universities did not receive Mahapola Scholarship for several months due to ignorance, miscommunication and well planned conspiracies of certain state officials.
According to Alwis, Minister Samarawickrama did not know the actual situation and the background. The UGC Chairman did not do his duty towards the medical students of state universities and only work full time to save SAITM.
We wish to make a request from President Maithripala Sirisena to beware of certain state officials who do their best to tarnish the image of the President and the Government by causing severe difficulties for the public and creating hatred in the public towards the Government, he added.

Director Rob Cohen helmed some iconic movies like The Fast and the Furiousand xXx in the early 2000s, but since then, he has not been a part of something as remarkable as his previous works. With Hurricane Heist, the director clearly aims to replicate his past fortunes, which is quite a tough feat to achieve given his earlier body of work.
The plot of Hurricane Heist revolves around two brothers, Will and Breeze, played by Toby Kebbell (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Warcraft) and Ryan Christian Kwanten (True Blood) respectively. Joining the two is treasury agent Casey, played by Maggie Grace (Lost, the Taken trilogy).
These three are the only ones standing between a group of robbers who have their eyes set on the town of Gulfport, Alabama, where the Federal Reserve stores its old money before shredding it.
At this particular moment, the facility holds $600 million.
The robbers have planned their heist in accordance with a category five hurricane, which is about to hit the town and will be the perfect cover for their escape.

Midsummer Madness Hits India!
The wild fairies are back to tickle, tease and titillate theatre enthusiasts! Pyramus & Thisby, Jehan Aloysius hilarious adaptation of Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream is crossing the Indian Ocean once more to entertain theatre lovers from all around the world.
These mischievous fairies are busily preparing for their spectacular show at the Theatre Olympics 2018 in India. Over 25,000 artists from 30 countries will participate in the Theatre Olympics which is being held in India for the first time. Pyramus & Thisby, a play that brilliantly combines Shakespeare with local Sri Lankan traditions has been invited to perform at the eighth edition of this theatre extravaganza. Pyramus & Thisby boasts a stellar cast of prominent English theatre personalities as well as professional dancers, acrobats and musicians.
Jehan Aloysius, the shows creator states that, the first five runs of Pyramus & Thisby were a phenomenal success. The cast had worked so hard through months of gruelling pre-work and rehearsals devising the show at workshops, while also learning acrobatics and various styles of Eastern dance. It was humbling that the audiences were unanimous in their appreciation of the work that had gone into the show.
The plot revolves around a group of artisans, headed by Quince, as they rehearse a play titled Pyramus & Thisby in the forest. A battle between the armies of the Fairy King and Queen over the mystical Indian boy, and the machinations of the mischievous Puck, lead to chaos in the human world. Meanwhile, Bottom, the weaver, becomes the unwitting victim of a magical transformation which leads him into the arms of the mesmerised Fairy Queen. In all this mayhem, the artisans wonder if they will ever be able to stage their tragicomedy - Pyramus & Thisby!
The cast features Jehan Aloysius as Bottom the weaver, supported by Dion Nanayakkara, Kavishka Perera, Dushyantha Hettiarachchi, Harshana Rathnayaka, Prabhath Devindra, Roshni Guneratne and Upekha Daniel in the lead roles. The shows lighting is by Thushan Dias.
Pyramus & Thisby will be performed for local and international audiences of the festival on March 11 and 13 in Delhi and Kolkata.

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is talking about forming government suddenly, had received only close to 40 percent of the total votes.
The Minister went on to say that political parties which came together to defeat Rajapaksa at the last election under the Swan symbol had received 51 percent of the votes at the recent polls. The result shows the people had not distanced themselves from the mandate given to the present government at the January 8, 2015 election, the Minister noted.
He said the need of the hour was for an accelerated national programme to further strengthen the bonds between the two main parties while ensuring there will be no conflicts with other parties which supported the 2008 change.
In a media release, the Minister pointed out that media institutions when calculating the percentages obtained by the political parties had only taken into account the votes obtained by the major parties, the SLPP, UNP, SLFP, UPFA, JVP and the TNA, which came to a total of 11,069,417.
The Minister pointed out that the total votes calculated with the votes obtained by other minor parties and independent groups should come to 12,214,901.
The minister said the SLPP has only received 40.66 percent and not 44.65 percent as stated by some media channels.
The Minister said the UNP has obtained 29.40 percent, the SLFP and UPFA 12.38 percent and JVP 5.8 percent.

N-Able celebrates two years of partnership with RAMIS
Led by CEO Peter DAlmeida, N-Able, a prominent and skilled technology services company in Sri Lanka, recently marked the completion of their second year of partnership with the state Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS).
RAMIS is the largest IT project undertaken by the government to-date, allowing individuals and corporates to file their taxes online, which is a significant leap forward for the country both in terms of technology and development.
Every year, extensive man hours and thousands of rupees are needlessly wasted as a result of the manual filing process. RAMIS was therefore specifically targeted and designed to eliminate this, offering Sri Lanka a more globally synchronised platform for its tax purposes. This is one of many positive movements seen mobilised after the end of the 30 year long civil war, which will in turn have long-term benefits elevating the country as a whole.
This support service was awarded to NCS, an organisation in Singapore, a subsidiary of Singtel. As the prime solution provider, NCS was in search of the most competent technology partner; in order to build, run and maintain a system as extensive as this, unparalleled expertise and exceptional knowledge were core requirements, and thus N*Able was sought out as the infrastructure architect for RAMIS.
The customer support centre has a dedicated team of service agents who assist customers with using the RAMIS system, and provides timely, accurate and dependable backing to assist with the increased adoption of RAMIS. Some of these services include dispensing taxpayer guidance for E-services & other tax services, dealing with business and technical issues, and troubleshooting complications that arise in an efficient, effective manner.
Since launching the new electronic system, there have been significant improvements in tax collection overall, such as the total revenue collection in 2016 amounting to Rs. 641,547, effectively marking an increase of Rs. 81,123 or 14.47% over that of the previous year. New registrations have also been made under different types of taxes, further effectively streamlining an otherwise complicated and tedious process.
We at N-able (PVT) Ltd are proud to have been sought out for this project, and to be entrusted with the task of managing the back-end operation, whilst further providing efficient services to our end customer, the IRD (Inland Revenue Department) and partner NCS, via this National Platform RAMIS for the last two years. This initiative has allowed us to directly contribute to the second largest government revenue/income source, thereby shouldering the development of public infrastructure and facilities for the people of Sri Lanka, said Chaminda Welikanna, Head of Service Support & Managed Services Operations.
N-Able is a technology services company that sells business outcomes. Over the past 10 years, it has established itself as a unique provider of solutions and technologies that enables businesses to create unprecedented value for their customers and stakeholders in telecom, banking, government and large enterprises.

Further, coast guard teams had been deployed near the island for the safety of the general public.

NBA star Kobe Bryant wins Oscar for best animated short
Hollywood, Monday: Retired basketball superstar Kobe Bryant -- once the toast of Los Angeles for the Lakers -- is now a Hollywood A-lister with an Oscar.
Yes, you read that correctly.
Nearly two years after leaving the NBA, the 39-year-old Bryant won the Academy Award for best animated short on Sunday for "Dear Basketball," a collaboration with artist Glen Keane and legendary composer John Williams.
"Thank you, Academy, for this amazing honor. Thank you, John Williams, for a wonderful piece of music," Bryant said.
In a sardonic reference to an attack by Fox News presenter Laura Ingraham against basketballers expressing their political opinions, he said he thought NBA stars were "really supposed to shut up and dribble."
"I'm glad we do a little bit more than that," he added.
Awards prediction website Gold Derby had Bryant as the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for best animated short, but his triumph is unlikely to please everyone.
In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, it will be a reminder that Bryant was arrested over the suspected rape of a 19-year-old hotel worker in Colorado in 2003. AFP

Neymar leaves hospital by helicopter for recovery
Belo Horizonte: Brazilian superstar Neymar left hospital by helicopter on Sunday, a day after a successful foot operation, to begin his recovery ahead of a possible World Cup return.
The 26-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward went to the airport in Belo Horizonte by helicopter, from where he was expected to head on a private jet to his luxury villa at the Mangaratiba beach resort around 100km from Rio de Janeiro.
According to Brazilian website Uol, Neymar's entourage have already prepared his recovery "headquarters" at his villa, which includes a gymnasium and a machine capable of producing 300kg of ice a day, similar to those used by modern football clubs.
His recovery will be monitored by Brazil and PSG physiotherapist Rafael Martini, who has been working alongside Neymar since he started his career at Santos in Sao Paulo.
The whole of Brazil is holding its breath while waiting to see if their star player, who captained the country to Olympic gold on home turf in 2016, would be fit to play in Russia.
But while Brazil frets over his potential World Cup availability, PSG are keen to get Neymar back playing before the end of the season, although he will miss Tuesday's crunch Champions League last 16 second leg at home to Real Madrid.
Both Brazil and PSG hailed a successful operation on Saturday on the fractured fifth metatarsal in Neymar's right foot.
The world's most expensive player will not start training for at least another six weeks, the French doctor representing PSG at the Belo Horizonte hospital, Gerard Saillant, told journalists on Saturday. AFP

No country could develop without stability, unity: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that no country could reach development without stability and unity
The Prime Minister was speaking at a programme held by the Organizations of Professionals Association in Colombo under the theme of Future of Sri Lanka.
He said the country is yet to achieve that unity. The Prime Minister added that the incident that took place yesterday and the one that took place three days back demonstrate the importance of unity.
There is no single formula for unity and unity is key, he said He said India is the closest example where unity is ensured amidst various difficulties.
He stressed that there should be unity between all ethnic communities in the country as unity leads to stability.
The Prime Minister said the country needs to make maximum use of its human resources, and more employment avenues should be created as ageing population is on the rise.
He said that many people are worried about Free Trade Agreements, but the country will certainly benefit by them.
We have GSP+ with the Europe, and We are deepening our FTAs with India into Economic Technology Cooperation Agreement, he said

No favourites in a game of T20 - Rohit Sharma
Indian captain Rohit Sharma played down the tag of tournament favourites and said that in a game of T20 cricket there were no favourites.
T20 is such a format that you will have to play good cricket any team can beat anyone. There are no favourites because it is such a short format the game can slip or change in a span of one or two overs, said Sharma at a media conference held at Taj Samudra Hotel ahead of todays Hero Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series that commences at the R Premadasa Stadium.
I dont like to be tagged as favourites because on any given day any team can beat anyone, you just have to be good on that particular day. T20 is like say the English Premier League soccer.
The Indian team is sans several top players who have been rested after a hectic international schedule and comprises several youngsters who have performed exceptionally well in Indias domestic cricket.
Since the 2015 World Cup we have put up a good performance at home and it gives confidence to the team. It is always important to know your bench strength with quality players sitting and waiting for opportunities. They have been consistently performing in whatever opportunity they have been getting in domestic cricket, said Sharma.
It is prime time to try all these cricketers and we also need to see what we are capable of. When you play ICC tournaments it is important to check and see the standards of these players during series of this nature and in bilateral series. You dont want to be taken by surprise when the World Cup arises to see those players have not had enough exposure. This is the right time to give opportunities to these guys.
Being given the task of captaining a side sans top players does not bother Sharma too much.
I dont feel that way I am quite happy wearing the hat and leading my country, said Sharma. With the amount of cricket we play we have to manage our players so there are times when you need to rest your top cricketers. It is an opportunity for others on the bench to perform and it also gives us the chance to test our bench strength. Ever since Chandika Hathurusingha departed as head coach Bangladeshs fortunes have dipped and they are still hunting for a proper replacement. For the present tournament former West Indies fast bowling great Courtney Walsh is standing in as interim coach. On top of it Bangladesh are also without the services of their outstandingly talented all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan who is nursing a finger injury.
I have the greatest respect for Chandika Hathurusingha as coach. He was an asset to Bangladesh cricket. Losing Shakib is a big loss for us but at the same time it gives a good opportunity for other guys to make a statement for themselves. It depends on the individual how he gets about it given the opportunity, said Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah.

No interest rate hike - CBSL
Central Bank (CBSL) says that they are not expecting to raise domestic interest rates in the period ahead.
The bank in a release said that there was speculation created that the CBSL was considering raising interest rates with the expectation on decline in reserves, higher than expected imports and increased interest rates on government securities. The Central Bank emphasizes that based on its current projections; an increase in market interest rate is not expected in the near term.
The recent movements in headline inflation, core inflation, inflation expectations, broad money growth, credit expansion, and expansion in economic activity as well as the international reserve position do not justify the view that a rational market would also expect an increase in interest rates.
With the decline in food inflation, headline inflation has reverted to mid single digit levels faster than expected, while core inflation, which is an indicator of demand driven inflation, has remained subdued. Inflation expectations, as measured by the Inflation Expectations Survey of the Central Bank, have moderated. Economic growth has remained below potential, implying that there is space for aggregate demand to expand without fuelling inflationary pressures. Both broad money expansion and credit expansion have decelerated to expected levels by end 2017.
Some fiscal sector indicators, such as the primary balance and revenue collection, have shown improvements.
With regard to the external sector, official reserves are currently estimated at around US dollars 7.9 billion compared to US dollars 6 billion at end 2016. The improvement in reserves is recorded on both quantitative and qualitative aspects, with the Central Bank purchasing US dollars 1.7 billion from the domestic market on a net basis in 2017 and US dollars 284 million so far during 2018. Although recent global market developments and domestic uncertainties attributed to non-economic factors have generated some volatility in the domestic market in the month of February, such volatility is expected to be short lived. In fact, the foreign exchange market has already stabilized while speculation in the government securities market has also moderated substantially.
As such, the general public is advised not to be misled by false media reports on the Central Banks expectations on future behaviour of interest rates.

Plans afoot to create dynamic agriculture sector
The Agriculture Ministry has taken several steps to ensure food security and national prosperity through vibrant and dynamic agriculture, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said.
He was speaking at the inaugural session of the International Forum on Strengthening Food Safety Standards, held at Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute, yesterday.
Generally, we consider an individual, a household, a community or a country is in large secure with food when they have availability and adequate access at all times to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life. Therefore, as far as food security is concerned, food safety has become an inseparable part, said the State Minister.
He said the Agriculture Ministry had been working on different aspects of the crop production sector.
Promoting and investing in research and development, providing subsidies, implementing crop and agrarian insurance schemes, input supply, technology and knowledge dissemination, and involvement in marketing are some areas where the Agriculture Ministry and institutions under the Ministry have made an impact.
Under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister, the government initiated a crop production drive called the National Food Production Programme two years ago. Due to the adverse impact of climate change, we couldnt achieve that target. But there are many positive outcomes, the State Minister added.
Agriculture Ministry Secretary B. Wijayaratne, Secretary to the Agriculture State Ministry D. V. Bandulasena, HARTI Director K. W. E.

Black Panther
Refreshing chapter  to the  Marvel  universe
Marvel starts 2018 with a refreshing chapter as it introduces its first black superhero in the form of the Black Panther. Penned by writer and director Ryan Coogler Black Panther has the inevitable task of matching up the hype created by The Avengers  Infinity War which is to follow later this year.
With such a mammoth task before him Coogler tries and succeeds beautifully in proving his mettle as a filmmaker. A list of fascinating character sketches  each of them embodying their own unique traits, eye catching and creative visuals, gripping action and an engaging storyline is what Black Panther boasts of.
Though Black Panther follows the typical storyline of saving the world from evil, it is more centered around the theme of identity and maturity. T'Challa returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.
A significant feature of Black Panther is that though the protagonist takes time to retian his full strength, the female characters of the production stand out for their strength and bravery. Two such characters  Shuri, TChallas sister and Nakia as TChallas love interest and undercover spy stand out. Letitia Wright makes a memorable Shuri and Lupita Nyongo is marvelous as Nakia. Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the all female special force of Wakanda, too is superb. All these characters are aimed to inspire and empower women.
The music too with its foot tapping drum beats and infectious melodies add a different spin to the Marvel production. Breaking away from the Marvel mould, this unusual production embodies a lot of heart and is engrossing and through provoking.
Though Chadwick Boseman has played the character of the Black Panther for a limited screen time in 2016s Captain America: Civil war, he carries his role with vigor and ease in the 2018 movie. It is amazing how Marvel seem to find just the right actors to fit their characters and this is wonderfully portrayed in Black Panther.
Black Panther is screening at Savoy 3D cinema, Majestic Cineplex, Liberty by Scope Cinemas and Liberty Lite cinema.

Moscow: Russia is overruling fearful big business owners and looking to shut down dozens of gigantic factories to avert accidents and the threat of terror attacks during this year's World Cup.
The halt in production highlights the financial sacrifice Russia is preparing to make when it hosts football's showpiece event for the first time from June 14.
But it also betrays concerns that something will go awry and a readiness to use heavy-handed tactics that could see thousands of workers going unpaid for at least five weeks.
Security analysts warn that shuttering chemical plants and other high-risk enterprises is simply dangerous.
The move is "a typical top-down order to make things look pretty that has nothing to do with actual safety," said veteran security analyst Pavel Felgenhauer. "This is traditional Soviet showmanship."
China closed polluting plants and coal mines for two months across swathes of the country in 2008 to ensure the smog cleared over Beijing for the Summer Olympics.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision appears to stem from a fear of industrial accidents and the threat of plants being attacked or blown up.
"The threats of an accident and terror are closely related," Moscow's FBK Grant Thornton consultancy director Igor Nikolayev said. AFP

Schools with over 1000 population to get Managers
Managers will be appointed to all schools having a student population of over 1000 in future to facilitate easier administration, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Addressing the gathering at the annual sports meet held at the Kurunegala Maliyadeva (Boys) Vidyalaya recently, Minister Kariyawasam said he hoped to appoint a Manager to each school having over 1000 students and a Manager and an Assistant Manager to schools with over 2000 students, after gaining Cabinet approval to the proposal.
The Managers would be able to intervene in the school administration enabling Principals to devote more attention towards the education matters of the students by acting as the head of the school, the Minister said. Minister Kariyawasam said he also hoped to implement the National Teacher transfer policy steadfastly to ensure quality of education by favourably responding to the requests made by the majority of teachers.
This would be done through an effective strategy taken through teacher transfer Boards with the active co-operation of the membership of Teacher Trade Unions, the Minister added.

Social media restricted for Army Personnel
All Army personnel have been restricted from posting any content in their Social Media accounts that carries information on national security or insulting remarks on politicians or public officials.
A series of restrictions on using Social Media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin has been issued to all Army personnel by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
Accordingly, all Army personnel are barred from posting, uploading, forwarding or sharing any content that relates to national security, military affairs or political affairs. They are also not allowed to post or share insulting remarks on politicians or public officials, or anything that create racial or religious disharmony. Commenting on such posts is also not allowed.
Army Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapatthu, confirming to the Daily News that a set of restrictions on using Social Media is in operation, said its objective is to maintain the good name and image of the Sri Lanka Army and avoid leaking of military information.
He said the restrictions were imposed about eight months ago and a reminder letter was issued last Thursday by the Army Commander asking all army personnel to strictly abide by the newly imposed regulations.
Army personnel have been asked not to reveal their military ranks or identity information in their Social Media accounts and not to post any photos in uniform. Posting photos with military armaments in the background is also not allowed.
The Army Commander in the reminder letter has emphasised that disciplinary action would be initiated against anybody who does not follow the above mentioned guidelines. The Army Spokesman said the IT division of the Army is receiving various observations on those who contravene the guidelines.
These restrictions apply to all army personnel in general. Military officers cannot reveal anything and everything as they desire and they are expected to maintain certain standards.
Lately, some ex-Army officers, who retired from the service a long time ago, could be seen using their pictures in uniform abundantly in the polls campaigns to market themselves. Some of the restrictions came in to being due to such misuses, the Brigadier added.

Spotlight on Got Talent
The Simon Cowell reality show series Got Talent is the biggest and most successful reality TV show worldwide.
Originally, started as Americas Got Talent, it soon captured and enthralled the British audiences with its Britains Got Talent version just a year later. Today, it covers 64 markets including countries such as Ecuador and Croatia.
Sri Lanka will become the newest market to showcase its talent to an international standard, as Sirasa TV has just announced that it has obtained the local franchise for the Got Talent show.
Have you got what it takes to be a star
The stage is now set for local singers, dance troupes, impressionists, performing dogs, magicians and other professional or even extreme and whacky acts to audition for an elite panel of judges, hoping to beat the buzzer. Auditions will be held across the country in order to give equal opportunity to our talented youth or even a senior citizen who dares to take the challenge.
Internationally, the show has been the springboard for countless new acts around the world, including Susan Boyle from Britains Got Talent, who has gone on to sell over 20 million records worldwide. Nine-year-old singer Amira Willighagen for Hollands Got Talent, whos winning performance of Puccinis Nessun Dorma received more than 50 percent of the television viewers vote, and 10-year-old classical singer Jackie Evancho from Americas Got Talent.
The initial audition for singing sensation Paul Potts, (a mobile phone salesman!) Britains Got Talents first winner, has had over 121 million views on YouTube and his story was made into a major motion picture, One Chance.
The true gift of the Got Talent series to local performers will be the opportunity to propel themselves in to the limelight in just one night! With so much talent in our performing arts industry, Sirasa TV is confident that it will play the role of a game changer to these aspiring artists. TV audiences too will play a big role in driving the destiny and dreams of these artists as they cheer them on towards celebrity status and individual glory.
Will they win the judges
Of course, every act will have to get past some of the most famous judges in the country.
Sounderie David needs no introduction as she is an accomplished singer and is also the Founder and Music Director of Sri Lankas premiere female ensemble, Soul Sounds, the first choir in Sri Lanka, to perform and win awards internationally over the last four years; Jackson Anthony, winner of 46 major awards in television, film, theatre and directing.

Tense situation in Digana: Army called in
The Army was called in to control the tense situation in Digana yesterday as crowds pelted stones at the Police trying to bring the prevailing situation under control. Military Spokesperson Brigadier Sumith Atapattu speaking to the Daily News said the Police had requested assistance from the Army and that around 200 troops would be sent to Digana (One hundred troops deployed and 100 troops on standby).
The Sinha Regiment has one of its camps located in Digana.
Trouble erupted in Digana yesterday afternoon when a large group of people marched into the city and set fire to a religious place, several shops and houses.
The Police had used tear gas to disperse the crowd but the people had started to pelt stones at the Police and continued to damage property and vehicles in the vicinity.
The riot had resulted in the suspension of vehicular traffic on the Kandy-Mahiyangana road via Digana.
As the Police failed to control the situation, using powers vested in them, they had to declare police curfew in the Kandy administrative district until 6.00am today (6), Kandy Division SSP Sisira Kumara said.
The protest had erupted as a result of a father of two, in the village of Ambaale, Teldeniya, being beaten to death by a group of people.
He has been identified as 40-year-old M.G. Kumarasinghe. The incident had taken place on February 22 next to the Teldeniya petrol station and the victim passed away on the night of March 2.
When the body was being taken to Ambaale on the night of March 2, villagers had burnt tyres in the Udispattuwa area in protest and thus the Police had taken steps to deploy additional security in the area.
The Police fearing that this could result in racial riots had taken steps to deploy 1000 STF officers to the areas of Moragahamula, Udispattuwa, Teldeniya and Ambagahalanda.
A group of people protesting his death however had burnt two shops in Moragahamulla and Udispattuwa on Sunday (4) night. The Police had arrested 24 persons suspecting to be involved in these incidents.
The Police have arrested three suspects connected to Kumarasinghes murder and presented them before courts where they were remanded. The suspects happen to be Muslims. The final rites of Kumarasinghe were held yesterday evening. He was a lorry driver who had been beaten up by these three suspects who had come in a threewheeler.
The drivers assistant who was also beaten up was admitted to the Kandy General Hospital and discharged having been treated.
The Daily News learns that Intelligence officers had warned the Police that this incident could be used to instigate racial tensions in the area but residents questioned as to why the Police failed to act until two shops in the area were already on fire.
Further, a petrol bomb had been thrown at a shop in Kengalle yesterday (5) but it had not exploded, as a result the group had left having pelted stones at the shop.
Journalists reporting the incident on the ground were also prevented from doing so by a few protesters.

Those empty benches
Whenever I see an empty bench I remember the Simon and Garfunkel song, Old Friends. It painted a vivid picture of old people, men. I first heard it when I was 16 and thoughts of old age and aging were the farthest from my mind. It took me to the impossible; that of being 70, to which I am closer now than I am to 16.
I dont feel the fears of a seventy year old yet, but I can imagine it all much better now. I dont wait for the sunset in the ways a 70 year old would, but I can imagine the waiting.
Lets visit bits and pieces of the song, like old newspapers blowing by us, like words and silences blowing our minds away.
Sat on a park bench like bookends. Sounds of the city sifting through the trees settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends. Old friendsmemory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears. Long ago . . . it must be . . .I have a photograph; preserve your memories theyre all thats left you.
A park bench or any bench for that matter is of course not the preserve of the old. They are temporary residences to all kinds of people. Lovers, for example.
Something about benches makes me think of waiting. Someone with someone and someone waiting for someone else. What goes through the minds and hearts of those who wait, I ask myself. Do benches have memories of those who sat on them, the words they said and the words they should have said but didnt for whatever reason, I ask myself.
There are benches everywhere, I feel. Bus halts are benches. Beaches, a random restaurant or coffee shop, a verse, a book of verses, a napkin on which someone scribbled something, a fragrance, a melody or a flavour; all these are benches if you think about it.
No, they are not dismal places, for not all conversations or moments are melancholy and about (impending) absences. Theres delight and even if the delighted move on to other delights or oblivion, their places are often taken by those as enchanted by special moments and togethernesses.
There is, therefore, another way of looking at empty benches. Places soon to be inhabited by young lovers, carefree friends, random musicians, radicals plotting rebellion, kids playing chess, random strangers discovering commonalities and who knows who else What they hear I do not know; what silences brush their senses, I do not know; what songs they heard or missed, I do not know; where they came from and where they will go, I do not know.
Its just lovely that they are there, these benches and these people, both nondescript but so very identified at and by the given moment.
There is a breeze thats washing this bench. Some leaves gather and move as they have done before and will do tomorrow too. Theres music and most likely its not been heard by many, those who have been here and those who are yet to arrive. From across the lane there wafts the fragrance-mix of incense and flowers blending with the chanting of the thun sutra. Theres a number written on these things, but I cant read it clearly. Perhaps it says 16, perhaps 70, or maybe if I were to de-code it the legend ageless might surface.
I sense that among the emotions that have tarried awhile in this place there must have been love and fear, sorrow and a sense of the endless and ending. I sense theyll revisit one day.
If I close my eyes (which I havent and will not) and then open again, I might see an ordinary bench. Nothing romantic about it. But then again, who knows, just as it invites me to sit, it might whisper sit if you wish, but remember, this is sacred territory simply because it is made of memories, love and poetry that will never get written.

TotalCare Employment Services, a Sri Lankan owned foreign domestic worker employment agency at Selegie Centre in Singaporean will host a seminar in Beliatta on March 11, 9 a.m. onwards Beliatta Mami Hotel.
Director of TotalCare Services Nadeera Jayasingha said that with the signing of the Sri Lanka Singapore FTA there is a greater focus to get more man power from Sri Lanka. While the demand for house maids, beauticians and other labor intensified employment opportunities are there is demand for Care Givers as well.

USA eager to expand open, fair and reciprocal trade with SL
Stephen Renna, Director of the Advocacy Center at the U.S. Department of Commerce, recently met with government leaders and U.S. companies in Colombo to discuss opportunities to increase U.S. exports to Sri Lanka. The United States is eager to expand open, fair and reciprocal trade, stated Stephen Renna during his visit.
American companies are some of the most dependable business partners anywhere in the world. Ambassador Keshap emphasized, U.S. companies produce the highest quality goods and services with the highest standards for ethics, corporate social responsibility, employee benefits, and environmental awareness. Further, when selling goods and services to foreign governments, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for U.S. firms and American citizens to pay bribes or otherwise violate the law. The values, practices, and international standards that American companies bring to the table make them the finest partners for improving standards and quality throughout business ecosystems. Trade and investment are the engines of growth and employment, and the United States is Sri Lankas largest trading partner, purchasing around $2.9 billion in Sri Lankan goods in 2017, sustaining tens of thousands of jobs in Sri Lanka. Those exports not only create employment, they bring nearly $7 million per day of hard currency into Sri Lanka, hard currency the Sri Lankan economy relies upon to lubricate the gears of commerce. Last year the United States exported $337 million of goods to Sri Lanka. There is tremendous opportunity for that figure to grow. American firms provide Sri Lanka with top quality, fair and reliable solutions Sri Lanka needs to expand transportation infrastructure, improve agricultural output, attract more tourists and provide and improve services for its citizens.
The U.S. Embassy economic and commercial team is available at any time to help Sri Lankan companies do business with the United States, and can be reached via [emailprotected].

Wiggins vows to hit back as lawmakers accuse him in drugs report
London : British cycling great Bradley Wiggins said it was "so sad" after he and his former team were accused by MPs of manipulating drug rules before major races, including Wiggins' 2012 Tour de France victory.
A report by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee of the House of Commons published Monday, accused Wiggins and other Team Sky riders of using the drug triamcinolone not for its recognised purpose as an asthma treatment, but because it helped them lose weight without compromising their power in the saddle. Russian computer hackers revealed three years ago that Wiggins had applied for therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which allowed riders to have injections of otherwise banned drugs, permitting him to take the powerful corticosteroid.

World Bank lauds Sri Lankas healthcare system
Sri Lankas healthcare system has a good track record. For about 50 years, it had achieved positive outcomes in maternal and child health, and infectious disease control than predicted by its income level, Universal Health Coverage Study Series Number 38 published by the World Bank states.
The publication adds that the health financing indicators show that the healthcare system is both pro-poor and efficient. There are few, if any, other low or middle-income countries that had achieved strong health outcomes, good financial protection and low cost. Many countries are lauded for achieving two out of three, but a few can claim to have done as well as Sri Lanka on all fronts, especially considering that it is still classified as a lower middle-income country, the report states.
According to the publication, the objective of this case study is to describe the main features and achievements of Sri Lankas high-performing healthcare system and to provide lessons to the rest of the world.
The cornerstone of Sri Lankas Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda had been supply-side efforts to ensure strong service delivery. It had provided universal and free access to government healthcare services to its population since the 1930s. Preventive healthcare services are provided through a well-planned network of facilities across the country, each of which is led by a Medical Officer of Health. Their responsibilities include maternal and child health and infectious disease control. The separate curative care network offers comprehensive services but is less well-organized, the report states.
As there is no referral system, many patients bypass lower-level facilities in favor of secondary and tertiary care. The private sector also plays an important role in Sri Lankas healthcare system, especially in the context of outpatient curative care, where government doctors can supplement their salaries during off-duty hours and patients willing to pay out-of-pocket can receive more convenient and personalized care, the publication states.

A writ petition seeking an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the Director of the CID to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012, resulting in the death of 27 prisoners, was yesterday dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne decided to dismiss the petition citing that there is no basis to proceed with the petition since the reliefs pleaded by the petition have already been succeeded.
Senior State Counsel Madawa Tennakoon appearing for the Attorney General informed the court that the CID had commenced an investigation into the incident and the progress of the investigation into the Welikada prison riot had been reported to the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court through B reports.

The petitioner stated that he wishes to bring to the attention of the court what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining the reliefs.
On November 9, 2012, at about 1 pm, the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that personnel from the Army and STF were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that there was an argument between prison officials and a contingent TID, STF waiting at the gate of the prison on the procedure related to the search operation, the petitioner stated.
The petitioner has added that the prison was in the control of the Army until 10 am on November 10, 2012, and by that time, 27 of the prison inmates were killed by STF/Army/TID/Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015.
The petitioner stated that although four years had elapsed since the incident, no action has been taken by the police or the Attorney General yet to conduct investigations and prosecute the offenders.
The petition was filed through Senior Counsel K. S. Ratnavale and Counsel Senaka Perera. Senior State Counsel Madawa Tennakoon appeared for the Attorney General.
