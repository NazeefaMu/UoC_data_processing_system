Welcome the ICC Test Champions AUSTRALIA
Sri Lanka will be privileged to have the number one ranked Test-playing nation in the world Australia making a full tour playing a series of three Tests, five One-Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals.
Australia will be arriving in Sri Lanka today with their tails up after being awarded with the ICC Test Championship mace as well as a cash prize of US$ one million in acknowledgement of their top ranking.
Steve Smiths Australians will try to emulate what all past teams from Down Under to Sri Lanka have done by trying to win the Test and ODI series which they have done so successfully on their last two tours here in 2004 and in 2011.
Australia are touring Sri Lanka after five years, the last tour in 2011 saw Michael Clarkes men win the three-Test series 1-0, the ODI series 3-2 but fail to repeat that success in the T20I format losing to Sri Lanka 0-2.
Ricky Pontings side in 2004 made a clean sweep of the Test series 3-0 and won the ODI series 3-2.
So dominant has Australia been both at home and away that Sri Lanka has beaten them only once in a Test match in 26 outings with Australia winning 17 and the rest ending in draws. The one rare occasion was in 1999 when Sri Lanka won by six wickets at Asgiriya Stadium in Kandy and went onto win the three-match series 1-0.
The upcoming Test series will be the fourth to be played for the Warne-Muralitharan trophy which was inaugurated during the 2007 series in Australia honouring two of the greatest spinners the game has ever seen Shane Warne and Muthiah Muralitharan, the only two bowlers to take more than 700 Test wickets in their careers.
Australia has held onto the trophy since its inauguration winning by margins of 2-0, 1-0 and 3-0.
The chances of Sri Lanka laying their hands on that wonderful piece of craftsmanship in the upcoming series will be asking a lot from a team that is in transition. Sri Lanka have just returned from a disastrous tour of England where they were beaten across all formats and had only two wins against associate members Ireland to show for their efforts.
Although they have home advantage past records show that Sri Lanka even at full strength (2004 and 2011) has not been able to ward off the challenges posed by the Aussies.
Thus it is a gigantic task for Angelo Mathews inexperienced line-up to try and topple the number one Test side unless the batsmen put enough runs on the board which is something they have fallen short of following the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, the two most prolific run-getters in the countrys cricketing history.
It is not easy to fill those big shoes and Sri Lanka although having a talented side are short of experience to give established teams like Australia a tough contest. Maybe with time they will.
Sri Lankas current Test ranking at number seven is a clear indication of where the team is at present.
Since the retirement of Jayawardene at the end of the home series against Pakistan in 2014, Sri Lankas fortunes as a Test playing nation has been on a downward trend  losing five of their last six Test series (only win being against West Indies at home in 2015). Overall they have lost 10 of their last 15 Tests (winning four).
Since Smiths permanent ascension to the Test captaincy last year Australia have won three series (two against New Zealand and one against West Indies).
The Lankan tour will be a real test of skill and nerve for the 27-year-old from New South Wales who like Sri Lanka captain Mathews has a high Test batting average as captain  87.46 from 11 Tests compared to his overall Test batting average of 60.18. Mathews averages 57.48 as captain and has an overall batting average of 48.70.
The most startling fact is that Smith who made his Test debut in 2010 and has represented Australia in 41 Tests has never played a Test match against Sri Lanka. The upcoming series will see him make his debut in the first Test at Pallekele starting on July 26. The main question that arises when teams like Australia tour the subcontinent is how quickly they can adapt to the conditions and the pitches. Australia is one team that has done so successfully on past tours of Sri Lanka as the results show.
As reports from Australia have revealed the Aussies are not leaving any stone unturned in trying to gather as much information on Lankan conditions having roped in former Test batsman Thilan Samaraweera to provide them with some inside information and on the type of pitches they are bound to encounter and how they could tackle spin on slow and spinning tracks.
Using the expertise of past cricketers on areas of concern has now become a new fad with touring teams. Past Sri Lankan greats like Muralitharan, Chaminda Vaas and Mahela Jayawardene have been used by teams like Australia, New Zealand and England in recent times with success.

He said some people were trying to gain political mileage out of the VAT issue.
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said the Bill has been scheduled for July 20, but added there were reports that some parties were planning to go before the Supreme Court over its provisions. He said if so the date would have to be changed again. As of the Bill, the wholesale and retail supply of goods has been exempted from the VAT till May 2, 2016.

A special committee has been appointed on the advice of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to mitigate VAT related issues and make the people aware regarding the VAT, UNP Parliamentarian Nalaka Colonne said.
He made these comments addressing a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.

Revised Standing Orders to be implemented in August - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced in Parliament that the revised Standing Orders would be distributed among the Party Leaders next week.
He said those would be implemented in August. He said as of the revised Standing Orders, it is compulsory for the relevant subject Ministers, Deputy or State Ministers to remain in the House to reply to the questions asked by MPs.
He made this observation when Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella brought the attention of the Speaker that the relevant subject Minister or Deputy Minister was not present in the chamber to respond to a question by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
MP Dissanayake had raised a question under Standing Order 23 (2) from the Petroleum Industries Minister. Neither Minister Chandima Weerakkody nor Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage were present in the chamber to respond to it.
Leader of the House Kiriella said that he had not received a reply to the question from the Ministry. I have only got the question. If the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister is not present, there is no point in raising the question.
This is an insult to the House. Not even the shadow minister is present, he said.
At this point, Joint Opposition MP Wimalaweera Dissanayake said that he could manage the shadow Cabinet Ministry of the Petroleum Industries. Kiriella said if the MP is ready to crossover, the Government could bestow him a ministerial portfolio.
Trial-at-Bar systemto be used for fraud andcorruption cases - Ajith P Perera
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera yesterday in Parliament proposed to reserve three to four High Courts to hear cases of corruption and fraud using the Trial-at-Bar system.
He was participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday. He said the Government was duty bound to come up with some acceptable and fair mechanism to speed up the legal activities with regard to allegations on corruption and fraud.
Nobody would obstruct to this proposal. However, we have to assure a fair trial. The Law of a Jungle could not be operated, he said.
Commenting on the shadow Cabinet appointed by the Joint Opposition, the Deputy Minister said the number of Cabinet Ministers that could be appointed after the next General Election would be limited to 30, as of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. We regret that the JO is unaware of this basic fact. The shadow cabinet consists of 52 members. The list of names amuses us very much, as we are well aware of their past conduct and how they managed their previous portfolios, he said.
Hybrid Courtsconcept not possible in Sri Lanka - Dilan
State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said in Parliament that the concept of hybrid courts was not possible within Sri Lanka.
He was participating in the debate on the Order under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, Regulations under the Judicature Act and Mediation Board (Amendment) Bill.
As of my opinion, foreign judges cannot hear court cases in our country. They could aid various commissions and provide technical assistance. The concept of hybrid courts would not be realistic. It cannot be done as of our Constitution, he said.
Justice Minister Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe said the initial proposal of the UNHRC was revised to remove the clause to include foreign judges after negotiations with the Lankan team. He said the clause was then revised as mechanism with participation of foreign experts.
Other than that, there had been no pressure for Sri Lanka in this regard. Various foreign actors may utter various things, but we are not bound to do all what they utter, the minister explained.
Earlier, taking part in the debate, MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake too queried as to whether there was any legal provision for foreign judges to hear court cases within the coutnry.
No threat tojudiciary frompoliticians - Kiriella
Judiciary is not under threat from politicians today, but from educated professionals, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday, participating in the debate on Order Under Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Mediation Board (Amendment) Bill.
You all might have noticed in newspapers during the last couple of weeks that doctors were staging demonstrations near the Supreme Court. They have even threatened that if the government goes ahead registering graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, they would stage a countrywide strike, which was clearly an insult to the judiciary and also attempting to influence the judicial process.
It was not we who started the SAITM, but the previous government. Degrees offered by the SAITM have already been recognized. The SAITM BSc in Medicine was recognized by the previous government. Now the problem is whether SAITM degree holders could be registered in the Medical Council.
The Medical Council did not register the SAITM and the SAITM students went before courts. While the SAITM students are seeking for justice from courts of law, the Medical Council and the doctors threaten to bring the country to a standstill. Is such actions right Is it not trying to manipulate the court procedure I call upon the court to take action against this, he said.
He said the country needed private education as the government lacked resources to provide all those who get through the Advanced Level examination with tertiary education opportunities. Look at England. All students who get through the A Levels have a university to enter and continue their education. But in our case, around 80 percent of those who pass their A levels, were unable to enter universities. Students with good qualifications from Colombo, Kandy and Galle were also unable to enter universities, he commented.
Ministry to re-gazetteessential food items andmaximum prices - Bathiudeen
Industries and Trade Minister Rishad Bathiudeen told Parliament yesterday, that the ministry would take immediate measures to re-gazette essential food items and also hope to publish the maximum prices later after having discussions with the Cost of Living Committee Chairman Malik Samarawickrema and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Minister also said that the present pricing formula of essential food items which was implemented by the Consumer Affairs Authority must be republished and a proper monitoring mechanism be introduced district wise, since an issue has been raised recently with regard to the price of consumer goods as the prices of essential commodities are been significantly different from one district to another.
This was happening due to transport costs and the number of middle men involved in the supply chain. At present, consumers are of the view that this was happening due to the increase of VAT. Therefore, these concerns should be addressed positively in order to maintain the cost of living in the country, while ensuring the delivery of quality goods at the lowest price, the Minister said.
He also said that though the VAT applied to certain goods, it did not apply to essential food commodities such as white rice, sugar, dhal, onions, potatoes, red onions, milk powder, wheat flour, dried chillies, green gram, chickpeas, canned fish, sprats, chicken and pharmaceuticals. Especially in Sathosa outlets, we are selling VAT free essential food items as mentioned earlier. Even vegetables and dried fish are sold without the addition of VAT.
We will also strengthen the market raiding mechanism. Hereafter, action would be taken to telecast the prices of essential food items through the electronic and print media. Consumers could lodge their complaints on the prices of essential food items via Hotline number 1977. he added.
He further added that the government had decided to subsidize essential food items such as sugar, dhal, big onions, sprats, dried chillies, potatoes, canned fish, milk powder, fresh milk, gas and many more items.
The Prime Minister has also advised to convene a Cabinet subcommittee to submit a weekly report on essential food items every Tuesday, he added.
Treasury allocatedfunds for relevant taxes,imported dates - FM
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayke yesterday said in Parliament that there was no need to exempt taxes imposed on imported Dates since the Treasury allocated enough funds to pay the relevant taxes to release the bulk of Dates donated by Muslim countries.
He was responding to a question raised by MP Douglas Devananda as to whether the government Would be able to exempt taxes imposed on Dates presented by Muslim countries to be distributed among local Muslims during the month of Ramazan.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake also said that the taxes on imported Dates were imposed under the Special Commodity Levy Act No. 48 of 2007.
According to that a tax valued, Rs. 60 have to be paid for a kilo of Dates.
Accordingly, the Treasury has allocated funds to the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Ministry and the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry to pay the total tax of Rs 22 million for a bulk of 27 metric tons of Dates distributed by Muslim countries for the use of this years Ramazan period, the minister said. This was done because it had been the tradition for many years. But this time we formalized it following a request made by the Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs Department.
We did not want to provide Dates duty free.
We imposed the tax on religious affairs and we paid it more transparently. Any other area which would be a similar significance for any religion, would certainly be looked at. But it was done concerning religious harmony and not with any other intention, the Minister said.
He further added that any imports arriving would not be tolerated. It has to be done only during Ramazan period only.

A special court must be established to expedite the cases on corruption and fraud charges, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He was participating in the Parliamentary debate yesterday.
Dissanayake said establishing a special court for this purpose was an election pledge of the President and his government. The on-going investigations and court cases are nothing but a drama. Those proceed very slowly and the culprits know that those wont finish any sooner. This government will drag these cases for years, he said. He said the legal action on completed investigations of the FCID must be fast tracked. Observing that the PRECIFAC had concluded the investigations on ITN and Negambo Lagoon Development project cases, he asked why delaying legal action on those responsible for them.

No Rio ticket for high jumper Manjula Kumara
Sri Lankan high jumper Manjula Kumara's last effort to qualify for the Rio Olympics ended in disappointment when he fell short of the qualifying mark on the opening day of the 94th National Athletics Championship worked off at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Diyagama, Homagama yesterday.

Education Minister gives directive to play final before July 12
In a bid to resolve the ongoing crisis involving the Milo Presidents Trophy knockout final between Royal College Colombo and Isipathana College Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has given a directive to the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA) to play the final on or before July 12.
The Minister had spoken to both the Royal College and Isipathana College committees and instructed the principals of the respective schools that the match should be played on or before July 12.
The Minister cited the reason for the deadline of July 12 because some of Isipathanas players are scheduled to leave for Hong Kong with the Sri Lanka under 18 team and hence their practices will start immediately.
However it is learnt that Royal College want to play the final on July 16 and not earlier than that.
Isipathana College rugby committee Media Manager told the Daily News: We have requested SLSRFA only for a venue change and not a date change. Hence as Isipathana had informed early we are definitely not willing to play the final on June 16.
Meanwhile the Daily News reliably learns that the SLSRFA which has been unable to resolve the matter amicably over the past five days has to-date not booked a venue for the final other than the Royal Sports Complex.

Andy Murray stormed into his third Wimbledon final as the Scot crushed Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 on Friday to set up a title showdown with Milos Raonic.
Murray gave a majestic performance on Centre Court and needed just under two hours to ensure his return to the All England Club final three years after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936.
The 29-year-old made just nine unforced errors, in contrast to 30 by the befuddled Berdych, who was powerless to halt Murray's progress to an 11th Grand Slam final appearance -- a milestone which took him ahead of Perry as the British man with the most major finals on his CV.
I'm very happy. To make the Wimbledon final is a good achievement. I've got one more to go on Sunday, Murray said.
The older you get you never know how many chances you will get to play in a Grand Slam final.
It helps to have experience to deal with the nerves. You learn from those matches in the past against some of the best players of all time. With Canadian sixth seed Raonic in his first major final after a shock win over Roger Federer, world number two Murray will be strongly favoured to clinch his second Wimbledon crown and third Grand Slam title in Sunday's final.
But Murray said: Milos is playing some of the best grass-court tennis of his career. I'm aware I'll have to play very well to win. AFP

Former Pakistan Test player and umpire Javed Akhtar dies
Javed Akhtar, the former Pakistan spinner and international umpire, died in Rawalpindi on Friday. He was 75.
Akhtar, an offspinner, made his international debut as a 21-year old against England at Leeds in 1962. He went wicketless in the match that Pakistan lost by an innings and 117 runs. It would be his only Test in a first-class career that spanned 17 seasons, from 1959-60 to 1975-1976.
He returned to the international arena as an umpire in the same year he retired, when he first officiated in an ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand in Sialkot.
Overall, Akhtar, who served on the ICC panel from 1997 to 1999, officiated in 18 Tests and 40 ODIs, the last of which was at the 1999 World Cup in a league fixture between England and India.
