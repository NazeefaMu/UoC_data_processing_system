Cater to Eastern Province progress with vigour
Since all duties and responsibilities of the Eastern Provincial Council have devolved on Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama with the expiry of the Councils term of office, Governor Bogollagama has requested all public servants in the province to carry out their duties well with the same enthusiasm as before to cater to the progress and welfare of the people in the province.
Addressing the Secretaries of Provincial Ministries and all departmental heads in the province at the Chief Secretarys auditorium, Bogollagama said he would do his best to render a people-centered service in the province.
He said two prolonged programmes would be undertaken to promote unity and reconciliation in the province.
One of them would involve a 90-day programme to complete all ongoing development programmes by obtaining necessary funding and the other would involve the promotion of communal harmony and reconciliation.
All people would be treated alike during this endevour by eschewing communal bias or other considerations.

Another batting  collapse hands  Pakistan series 3-0
Wednesday: Sri Lanka suffered an all too familiar middle order batting collapse losing six wickets for 61 and their last nine wickets for 106 runs to hand to Pakistan a seven wickets win in the third ODI and with it a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Wednesday.
It was Sri Lankas seventh ODI series loss since beating Ireland 2-0 in 2016.
Batting first for the first time in the series Sri Lanka failed to capitalise on a fine start from 102-1 to collapse to 208 all out in 48.2 overs.
Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali who destroyed the Sri Lanka batting with career best figures of 5 for 34 celebrates with his trademark signal as he claims the wicket of Niroshan Dickwella in the third ODI played at Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
Pakistan buoyed by an opening stand of 78 by Fakhar Zaman (29) and debutant Imam-ul-Haq, the nephew of Pakistan legend and present chairman of selectors Inzamam-ul-Haq who went onto score an excellent century cruised home with 7.3 overs to spare.
Bespectacled Imam 21, playing with the flair of his famous uncle struck five fours and two sixes in a risk-free knock of 100 off 125 balls to become only the second Pakistani in two decades after Saleem Elahi to score a century on ODI debut and the 13th overall. Strangely Elahi also scored his debut hundred against Sri Lanka at Gujranwala in 1995.
For a few seconds Imam had his heart in his mouth when at 89 he was given out caught behind off Dushmantha Chameera and he as he walking back to the pavilion despondently the umpires stopped him to check the validity of the catch. To Imams relief he was recalled to resume his innings as television replays showed the ball falling short of Dickwella before he grasps it with his gloves.
Apart from their batting disappointments the Lankan bowlers showed they lacked the penetration to exploit the conditions and put pressure on the Pakistani batsmen. As it was Pakistan simply cruised towards their target with not so much pressure on the run rate which was a mere four runs an over at the start of their run chase.
Skipper Upul Tharanga who made a century in the second ODI was once again the top scorer for his side with 61 off 80 balls (5 fours) and the next highest scorer was Thisara Perera with 38 off 37 balls (5 fours).
It was a rather spineless display of batting by the Lankans as they failed to use their feet against the spinners and moreover to rotate the strike constantly that led to their downfall once again.
The way things stand Sri Lanka will continue to go through similar collapses until their middle order can be stabilised.
They badly need to get Kusal Perera, Angelo Mathews and Asela Gunaratne (all recovering from injuries) up and running as early as possible to lend some solidity to the middle order
Sri Lanka dropped the out of form Kusal Mendis and brought in experienced Chamara Kapugedera but he could not contribute much dollying a return catch to Hasan Ali who ran through the Lankan batting to finish with career best figures of 5 for 34 and in the process became the quickest Pakistani to reach 50 ODI wickets playing in his 25th match.
Sri Lanka didnt have luck running their way either when Lahiru Thirimanne one of the top order batters was dismissed caught off his boot by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed who ended up with four catches.
The fourth and fifth ODIs will take place in Sharjah on October 20 and 23..
Niroshan Dickwella is bowled by Hasan Ali for 18

Brilliant De Villiers blows away Bangladesh
Paarl: AB de Villiers blasted a career-best 176 to set up a series-clinching 104-run win for South Africa in the second one-day international against Bangladesh at Boland Park on Wednesday.
South Africa posted an imposing 353 for six after being sent in to bat, while Bangladesh made a spirited start to their response before being bowled out for 249.
De Villiers raced to his 25th one-day international century off 68 balls with ten fours and a six. He added another five fours and six sixes off the next 36 deliveries in a display of dazzling footwork, precise placement and some audacious strokes, particularly after he reached his century.
Even so, De Villiers said he felt quite nervous at the start of his first international innings in four months. But he said batting partner Hashim Amla was a calming influence as he embarked on a sensational 104-ball innings which included 15 fours and seven sixes.
Already the holder of the records for the fastest 50, 100 and 150, De Villiers was on target to beat Chris Gayles record of 138 balls for the fastest one-day international double century before he hit a low full toss from Rubel Hossain to deep midwicket with 14 balls remaining in the innings.
It did cross my mind, he said of the possible double century, but thats not something I play for. It was all about how many balls I could face at the end of the innings to get as many runs as I could for the team. If it all worked out I would have got there but Im happy with the 176.
The ease with which De Villiers found the boundary was in complete contrast to his teammates, who managed to hit only five fours and a six between them, struggling to time the ball as it rose slowly off the surface, while the outfield was unusually slow after three days of rain.
Something good was coming
De Villiers dominated stands of 136 off 111 balls for the third wicket with Hashim Amla (85) and 111 off 70 balls for the fourth wicket with JP Duminy (30).
I had a net in Kimberley, one of the best nets Ive ever had, so I could feel something good was coming, said De Villiers, who wasnt required to bat during South Africas ten-wicket win in the first one-day international at Kimberley on Sunday.
Mashrafe Mortazas decision to bowl first was justified as there was some early movement for his seam bowlers  but he and his fellow new ball bowlers were unable to separate the in-form pair of Quinton de Kock and Amla until they had put on 90 for the first wicket.
Then Shakib Al Hasan took two wickets in three balls, which brought De Villiers to the crease. Shakib bowled really well but AB came in and took the game away from us. Hes a destroyer, said Mortaza.
Rubel Hossain took three wickets in his last two overs to finish with four for 62.
Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes put on 44 off 46 balls for Bangladeshs first wicket, with Kayes going on to make 68 off 77 balls. Mushfiqur Rahim followed up his century in the first match with 60 off 70 balls. Kayes was third out with the total on 162 in the 29th over and the innings lost momentum.
Medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo had career-best figures of four for 40.
South African captain Faf du Plessis praised what he termed an ABD special. He said with the series won, there would definitely be some changes to give fringe players an opportunity in the third and final match in East London on Sunday. AFP

California hepatitis A outbreak death toll climbs to 19

The death toll from California's hepatitis A outbreak has reached 19, one week after the state's governor issued a health state of emergency. 
More than 500 people in California have contracted the viral disease since November, many of whom are homeless. 
Hepatitis A, which attacks the liver, is usually spread through faecal matter, transmitted through sex or by touching contaminated food or objects. 
It is the second-largest US outbreak of hepatitis A in the past 20 years. 
Nearly 500 of the diagnoses have been reported in San Diego, where officials have taken steps to combat the outbreak by disinfecting city streets with bleach and setting up hand-washing stations. 
A local city councilman has called for state environment researchers to test San Diego's drinking water for faecal contamination, which causes the liver disease. 
The outbreak has taken a severe toll on the state's large homeless populations, which are most at risk as they do not have access to basic hygiene and sanitation, experts say. The virus is transmitted from faeces to mouth, which means it is most likely to spread in unsanitary conditions. 
More than 5,000 people are sleeping unsheltered in San Diego - a 10% increase from the year before - according to a recent study by the Regional Task Force on the Homeless. 
Cases have also been reported in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties as well as in San Francisco in northern California, where officials say they have vaccinated thousands of homeless people. 
Typically only one out of every 100 patients die from Hepatitis A, according to officials, but the disease has killed at a higher rate in California due to the vulnerable populations it has affected. 
Symptoms include fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. 
Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes, is also a possible symptom. On 13 October, Governor Jerry Brown issued a state of emergency in order to ensure that vaccines reach medical clinics who are working with the homeless. 
Health officials have advised that it may take months or years before the outbreak tapers off.

Cap on campaign expenditure - How
At long last, legislation is to be introduced to place a ceiling on campaign finances at elections. President Maithripala Sirisena has received Cabinet approval to draft legislation to control election expense, according to our main story in yesterdays edition. The legislation will ensure that there is an environment for free and fair elections and will apply to Local Government Provincial Council. Parliamentary and Presidential elections, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said at a media briefing, according to the report. He said it was inevitable that large amounts of money showered upon voters would sway his or her vote and the proposed law will put a stop to that. It will also minimise election violence and corruption, which grew from the root of all evil-money, he noted.
Of course, the need to place a cap on election expenses have been brought to the fore from time to time. But nothing, so far, had come out of it.The last time the subject was broached was in 2016, where, in fact, a consensus was reached between Secretaries of all political parties and the Elections Commission for introducing laws to curb campaign expenses, but up to date no concrete action has been taken in this respect. According to our report, the proposed legislation will also empower the Election Commission to inquire into the finances of candidates, the source of their funding and what they spend on.
But there is more than one way to skin a cat. Candidates can always outsource their election campaigns to the drug barons and the mudalalis, with the Election Commission being none the wiser. How will the Commission keep tabs on election expenses, all the way through the duration of the campaign, of a candidate, particularly when the campaign heats up How will the Commission monitor the campaigns of thousands of candidates at a General or PC election We say this, since, campaign financing does not come only in the form of cash. It can take various other forms, a campaign financier providing various other inducements to get voters to vote for their man. The sil redi episode is the best example of how voters received inducements to vote for a particular candidate, outside the scrutiny of the Elections Commissioner. Had the supporters of the Common Candidate not cried foul, the matter would have been under the wraps, and the perpetrators gone scot free. Hence, it is important that the proposed law contains provisions to monitor the doings of candidates, all the way throughout the campaign, and promptly disqualify those candidates who had flouted the law. It is no use bringing such irregularities to the attention of the Commission, after the election, when the horse has already bolted. Had Mahinda Rajapaksa won the election, no court of law could have been moved on the sil redi issue, although it was an election offence.
What is discussed here is money spent on bribing voters and introducing laws to halt the practise. What about spending involving election propaganda Will there be laws imposing limits in spending on election propaganda, as well. Similar to the financial inducements mentioned by the minister, voters can also be swayed by dazzling propaganda of a candidate. If a level playing field is the whole intention of the proposed legislation, this aspect too should receive the attention of the drafters of the new law.
Here, definitely, the Commission can run into a grey area. How can one place limits on the extent and content of the maze of propaganda and who is to judge on the infringements We say this because propaganda, say, of a Presidential candidate, is often handled by PR firms, sometimes brought down from abroad. Are limits to be placed on the propaganda budget of a candidate, too, under the proposed law
With the visual media now playing a very crucial role in the election campaigns, certain media tend to focus on crowd participation at election rallies, of particular candidates. Like the monetary benefits, mentioned, showing massive crowds at election rallies, of certain favoured candidates, is also likely sway voters and influence their decision at voting time. This was witnessed at the last Presidential Election where Mahinda Rajapaksa was shown drawing massive crowds, compared to the Common Candidate, and, needless to say, a large number of voters would have been swayed by what was portrayed as a forgone victory for MR. How will the proposed law, which seeks to ensure a level playing field, deal with such situations How will the Commission be able to ascertain who is financing the transport of these crowds in a scenario where the campaign is outsourced
Hence, preventing voter bribing during an election campaign, by distributing cash, buth packets and liquor should not be the only object of the drafters of the proposed law, for ensuring a level playing field. There is a large gamut of other aspects too that needs to be considered by the responsible authorities, if the true intention is to rid the polity of corruption.

CITIZENS' Mail - (19-10-2017)
Make children comfortable with wordplay
How well children learn the word is influenced by many things, including the environment and the manner in which adults speak to them. Communication experts Dr Rebecco Frost, Dr Katherine Twomey, Dr Gemme Taylor, Professor Gert Westermann and Professor Padraic Monaghan explain that a language-rich environment helps children through the early stages of language development from identifying words in the speech to using them in sentences. But here, we look more closely at how children learn words, particular names for objects, and how they use their environment to guide this process.
Helping children to learn words at an early age is incredibly important because the number of words that a toddler knows predicts how well they will learn to read when they get to school. However, word-learning is enormously complicated, and there are two primary reasons for this.
First, children need to understand that some of the sounds that grownups make actually relate to things around them. For example, when we hear a lion roar, we tend not to assume that the lion is telling us anything what it had for dinner, for example. But children have to figure out that human speech is completely different from other sounds they hear, because it carries meaning.
The word learning is hard is because children have to link new words to their meaning. And there are many ways someone says: Look, a rabbit as a rabbit runs past, children cannot know for certain how this phrase relates to what they see. It could be to the rabbit itself, but it could also be the rabbits fur, the running motion, the beauty of the scene, or other aspects of the environment.
Fortunately, though, young children are extremely sophisticated word learners. By age two, children have started to learn the meaning of a word after hearing it only a few times. Children can even learn meanings without being explicitly told them, if they already know the names of other objects that are around at the same time.

Countrys needs to be converted to a production based economy - Lakthilaka
It has been planned to increase the entrepreneurship rate to 10 per cent from 3 per cent within the next five years through the Gramashakthi Peoples Movement, President's Coordinating Secretary Shiral Lakthilaka said.
He said that countrys economy should be converted to a production based economy. Accordingly, it is needed to promote entrepreneurship to bend towards a production based economy.
He added that the novel technology of the world should also be utilised to achieve economic prosperity. Information technology (IT) can also be well utilised.
It has been planned to train 100 youth representing all districts of the country to play in the IT sector by the pilot project. With the outcome of the pilot project, more youth will be trained he said.
He added that only 3 per cent of the population is entrepreneurs. It is badly in need of increasing this number at least to 10 per cent within the next five year period to strengthen the countrys economy, he said.
Lakthilaka said that Gramashakthi Peoples Movement project is carried out with a vision of Strengthened, empowered and formally organised Sri Lankan community active in path to progress overcoming poverty. The mission of the programme is to provide facilitation to people living in 5,000 Grama Niladhari divisions to fullfil the basic needs and the growing needs individually and collectively by providing information, decision making power and resources by 2020 and contributing to reach the national sustainable development goal of eradicating extreme poverty and halving all forms of poverty by 2030.

Crunch into Kings feast
Walking into the Kings at the Kingsbury, one is immediately impressed by the blend of its ambience. It is calming, soothing, comforting and restful and at the same time electrifying and exciting. This is because of Kingsburys new promotion where you can have the best of the best any day of the week in the evening. Daily news visited the Kingsbury to sample this unique experience in Colombo.
It is all about making the bar a happening place in Colombo. You see a lot of bars and restaurants coming up in Colombo with their own type of entertainment. What is offered by Kingsbury is indeed rare - seven different bands playing all seven days of the week!
When we say bands we are talking about the crme de la crme of Sri Lankan entertainment, the legendary bands. A lot of people are familiar with these names. They are fantastic musicians who have played great music to Sri Lankan and foreign audiences. So the band members are very well known, creating that nostalgia.
We are looking at is the best entertainment line up in Sri Lanka right now and it is happening right here at the Kingsbury. Kingsbury wants to offer its loyal clientele much more with this new promotion. They have gone for a scrumptious new menu with bites and beverages.
There is a well stocked extensive bar with friendly staff ready to serve you. The Kingsbury welcomes its patrons to come and enjoy and absorb the atmosphere. It will be an experience that is different and will make you want to make it your destination every week. You will definitely make this your venue where you can just chill out!
So the promotion has kicked off and this will be the standard scene and fixed line up at the Kingsbury. A great bar and a superb atmosphere is the desired purpose. The lighting is just right for the mood and ambience, and it is cozy and anyone can have a chat with the music going on. You can even sit yourself down in a corner and do some work. It has a classy upmarket feel about it. It is classic with modern touches as well. Come and enjoy and experience it yourself! You can relax after a hard day at work and sip a cocktail.
Band Leader of Mintarka and member of the band Wildfire Chris Dhason, said the setup is something new for them and the whole concept is something new for Kingsbury.
I dont think Kingsbury has bands like this performing. We are feeling our way around but there is an awesome set up of bands here. All the bands are very professional and each band has its own character and identity, so there is a wide variety of music. So we are enjoying it. So far the crowd reaction has been very positive. They like the music and it is something the crowd is enjoying and they are getting used to it. We hope more people will start coming here when they get to know about this, said Dhason.
Mintarka is predominantly a rhythm and blues, soul and funk band. They do a lot of soul classics and jazz. They have great vocalists that enable them to tackle quite a variety.

Draft Bill to replace PTA
The government hopes to bring a draft Bill in Parliament early next year to replace the PTA, said Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka in Parliament on Tuesday.
He said this in response to the adjournment motion by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan in Parliament.
We are doing this not because of international pressure but for the people of this country and to safeguard them from terrorism.
In relation to the new legislation to replace the PTA as per the Counter Terrorism Act, a draft was drawn up and the Cabinet approved it to be brought before the Oversight Committee.
Various people, local and overseas, gave their views. Now the legal draftsman is working on it. But there are still a few areas that require a simpler language. Some may feel its adequate and some may not.
However, we want to bring in an Act that will safeguard national security taking into account current threats of terrorism and current international standards.
The Law and Order Minister said by January 8, 2015, there were 108 detainees in custody under the PTA. Out of whom, 40 have been granted bail, 11 in remand, 27 have been released, 25 have been sent for rehabilitation and four have been passed guilty in their Court hearings. One had died of a heart attack while in custody.
While the serious cases are being handled by the AGs office, one issue is that we find that the Defence lawyers are not doing their part as well. Out of these High Court cases, 74 of the remaining detainees are those who have committed grave crimes.
Out of them, seven are Sinhalese, 63 are Tamil and four are Muslim. With regard to 18 cases that are pending action by the AG, we are working with the AGs department to expedite action, added the minister.
Responding to an issue raised by the Opposition Leader on the moving of some of these cases from Vavuniya to Anuradhapura, he said it was done in good faith even though it perhaps was not working out as hoped.
The reason for establishing two Courts, one in Colombo and one in Anuradhapura, was to hear only the PTA.

Enabling the disabled
She is someone who breaks stereotypes and defines stigma. Together with her colleague Janitha Rukmal, Krystle Reid formed Enabled Lanka, an organisation which works towards helping the needy by enabling them to become abled citizens. Her work gained recognition as she was named as the Commonwealth Young Person of the Year 2017. She was picked from over 200 entries for the title. This was the first time a Sri Lankan has won the overall prestigious award. It was also the first time an organization working with the mission of mainstreaming inclusion for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) has won the award.
Winning this award for our work at Enable Lanka meant that we have done something right and impactful. It also opened many doors for us to partner with other organizations/ individuals and to create an even bigger impact and to influence others to join in this mission, Krystle said.
The Commonwealth Youth Awards for Excellence in Development Work, an initiative of the Commonwealth Secretariats youth program, celebrates outstanding young adults aged under 30 who are leading initiatives ranging from poverty alleviation to peace-building. Charles Lipenga from Malawi (Commonwealth Africa Young Person of the Year), Jacqueline Joseph from Papua New Guinea (Commonwealth Pacific Young Person of the Year) and Tricia Teekah from Guyana (Commonwealth Caribbean Young Person of the Year) received the regional awards this year.
One of my biggest honours and privileges were to meet these three trailblazers in person, to share our common ideologies and to learn about the different innovative approaches in achieving our missions. I felt even more empowered when I met them for the first time. I was amazed by Charles ability to connect with anyone with his humor and style, Tricias strategic thinking patterns, and Jackies innovative ground-breaking ideas. I have still have a lot to learn from them, Krystle mused.
The award ceremony was held in March 2017 at the Commonwealth Secretariat in London. The awards were presented by Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland.
An old girl of Good Shepherd Convent, Colombo, Krystle was the schools English debate team captain and a member of the school athletics team - track and field events. She studied Finance/ Financial Analysis at the Chartered Institute for Securities and Investment. She is currently doing her M. Sc. in Applied Finance at Sri Jayewardenepura University.
When I met Janitha we had one thing that was mutual for both of us. We were from two different minorities which are still regarded by the society in very negative ways most of the time. I come from an ethnic group called Burgher. I always felt that I dont belong with the overall social fabric in the country from some experiences Ive faced. Janitha is from the largest minority in this country as well as the world at large which is the minority of persons living with disabilities. This mutual factor helped us to discover the social exclusion thats faced by many minorities. We worked together to empower persons with disabilities and ensure equality for them, Krystle recalled how it all began.
Krystle comes from a middle-class family. This moulded her to recognize the challenges and insecurities around her and helped her discover the inner potential in her to help another who has been facing many difficulties growing up as she did.
I am one of those girls that could have been stuck behind inequality. Most days I struggle but I try to be brave because I know at the end of the day, it always feels great knowing that Im able to make a difference in someones life. That is a blissful happiness that can never be bought by money. Every single person who stands up for injustice and inequality and doing it for the right reasons inspires me, she said.
Enable Lanka Foundation has been striving to mainstream disability inclusion. They have also been focusing on the 22 percent of older persons who would be in existence by 2030. The foundation has many successful projects to its name. The Enabled Election campaign was launched during the 2015 General Election under the guidance of the National Coordinator, of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence in Sri Lanka Manjula Gajanayake. This initiative helped to make a tangible change by availing the entire minority of Sri Lankans to realize their political and voting rights. Enabled Election campaign was one of the largest civil rights campaigns conducted in the country to provide sensitization and advocacy for the political and electoral rights of persons with disabilities in the nation. Senarath Attanayake was the first person with a disability in Sri Lanka to be an elected representative, a lawyer and the only person with a disability to hold a ministerial portfolio. He was a key driving force behind the campaign.
Another campaign titled Comic For Cause was designed and launched over a period of seven days starting from December 3, 2017. This was the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Since the event was a success we extended the #ComicForCause and published an Autism toolkit. This toolkit is available online and in print, as a collaborative effort of the Foundation and the Inclusion and Engagement Committee of the Commonwealth Youth Council. The inspiration and guidance for this toolkit was gleaned from the publication known as Autism in the Commonwealth which has been created by Jonathan Andrews from the UK. The said publication has been published by the Commonwealth Youth Council in tandem with the #iamABLE campaign. We are now looking in to translating this toolkit into Tamil. We are currently working on a similar project through this campaign and targeting to launch it on March 2018, Krystle said.
The team also launched a mobile application of audio books in 2016. Once again the Center for Monitoring Election Violence joined hands with the foundation to give life to this project. Around 200 out of 800,000 visually impaired persons in Sri Lanka get the opportunity enroll in state universities and obtain higher education annually. Even then, most of them could not perform up to their full potential and excel in their respective academic fields because information can only be accessed through books. Enable Lanka Foundation together with Samsung Sri Lanka, LISN the first mobile audio book production company in Sri Lanka and the America Centre introduced LISN Revolution, a fully accessible mobile application specifically designed to read audio books to local universities. The undergraduates were also provided with smartphones to access this assistive software.
We had about 10 passionate, young change-makers and zero funds with us when we started the project. 125Mn smartphones are disposed every year and only 14 to17 percent of those phones are recycled. We saw an opportunity to change someones life with anothers trash. We approached the right people at the right time we managed to pull off this large-scale project to provide these students with their basic requirements to fulfill their education. Thats how we managed to execute almost LKR three to four Mn project having absolutely no funding in hand. For me that is one of the most memorable and proud moments of Enable Lanka and the team behind it, Krystle said.
She says that Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries have a long tradition of treating PWDs as charity and looking at them with a sympathetic eye.
We need to break these existing attitudes and physical barriers and empower them to be self-sustaining and economically independent and not make them anyones social service. The other biggest challenge is accessibility. This does not mean only having ramps. There are people with neurological conditions, vision and hearing loss, psychiatric disabilities, and cognitive or learning problems. The lack of having accessibility to education, employment, on-line and off-line media, surrounding/ physical environment is another massive challenge we see as a country that has an aging population. Sri Lanka could quite possibly be one of the countries with a faster increase in aging population before it emerges as a developed country. This also means the number of people with disabilities would increase. We feel that the government or the respective authorities are not subtle enough to realize the urgent need to have sound policies and to take the required measurements to address this socio-economic challenge. We must realize that disability is a part of life. It is inevitable. This is not about us and them this is about us and us, she stressed.
The 28 year old is employed at Brandix Apparel Solutions Limited. She is the curator of the Global Shapers Colombo Hub - an initiative of the World Economic Forum. She is also the past President of the Chartered Accountants Students Society. Her parents are Michael Reid and D. B. A. Shilani Swarnamali. She has two sisters who are working in the field of marketing.
There are few projects in the pipeline for us at Enable Lanka. We will be looking at partnering with organizations working in different areas to make their programs, workshops and projects more inclusive to ensure no one if left behind in the process. I wish to continue in the field of finance and eventually be a part of the core business managing economic activities and efficiency in operations and hopefully become an influential person who would advocate for more women participation in the labor market, Krystle noted.Queried about her message to other youth and she quotes Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in. You will not see the benefit today but if your heart says that its the right thing to do, then do it now and leave no one behind! she concluded with a smile.

Exciting India - Sri Lanka  final today in Nuwara Eliya
Dhruv Sheoran salvaged some pride for India defeating Chalitha Pushpika 3 & 1 in the 1st semi-final yesterday to set up an intriguing India  Sri Lanka 36-hole final in the 130th Sri Lanka Amateur Golf Championship to be concluded today at the spectacular Nuwara Eliya Golf Club.
Chalitha made too many mistakes, hitting out of bounds on the 4th and 8th, in addition to several missed putts. Despite all these errors, Chalitha was just 1 down playing the 15th and a missed putt cost him the hole to be dormie 2 down. Dhruv Sheoran hit a brilliant tee hot on the Par 3, 17th to seal the match 3 & 1.
In the all Sri Lankan second semi- final, G P Sisira Kumara continued his steady golf to defeat team Mate, N. Amarapadma 3 & 2. Sisira Kumara reached his second consecutive Sri Lanka Amateur Golf Championship final, having been the runner-up last year to Namuangruk of Thailand. The 36-hole final commences at 7.30 a.m. and Sisira Kumara is expected to avenge his loss in the final last year and annex the Amateur Championship title for 2017. Nevertheless, Dhruv Sheoran of India is a leading Amateur who was the top qualifier in the 2017 PGTI Q-School, awaiting the opportunity to represent India in the Asian Games in 2018.

Exports exceed  US$1 bn again
Sri Lankas external sector showed a mixed performance in August 2017. Although export earnings increased in August 2017, higher growth in import expenditure resulted in an expansion of the trade deficit.
Despite the increase in tourist earnings in August 2017, the decline in workers remittances together with the expanded trade deficit dampened the performance of the external current account. However, the financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) was supported by the receipt of the second tranche of the foreign currency term financing facility to the government along with continued foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the government securities market in August 2017.
Surpassing the US dollars 1 billion mark for the second consecutive month, earnings from exports increased in August 2017, indicating the positive impact of the restoration of the GSP+ facility. Accordingly, earnings from exports increased by 15.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 1,001 million in August 2017 mainly due to an increase in industrial exports followed by agricultural exports.
Earnings from industrial exports grew by 13.1 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 740 million in August 2017 owing to the increase in exports of textiles and garments. Export earnings from textiles and garments increased by 10.1 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 433 million with improved garment exports to the EU market.
Accordingly, earnings from garments exports to the EU market increased by 12.2 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 186 million in August 2017 contributing more than 68 per cent to the growth of garment exports. Meanwhile, garment exports to the USA and non-traditional markets also grew by 4.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent (year-on-year), respectively, during the month.
In addition, the export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco increased significantly by 35.8 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 35 million while export earnings from gems, diamonds and jewellery (23.6 per cent), machinery and mechanical appliances (14.0 per cent), and rubber products (4.1 per cent) increased during the month compared to the corresponding month of the previous year. However, export earnings from base metals and articles, printing industry products and transport equipment declined in August 2017.
Earnings from agricultural exports increased substantially by 22.8 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 255 million in August 2017 reflecting improved performance in almost all sub categories. Export earnings from tea increased significantly by 20.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 131 million.
Reflecting the positive impact of the removal of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the EU market and the restoration of the GSP+ facility, earnings from seafood exports increased considerably by 38.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 18 million in August 2017, with a 81.9 per cent year-on-year growth in exports to the EU market.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports grew by 7.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 7,413 million during the first eight months of 2017 mainly due to increased earnings received from exports of tea, petroleum products, transport equipment, spices and seafood.
The USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy were the leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka during the first eight months of 2017, accounting for about 50 per cent of total exports.
Expenditure on imports increased by 12.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 1,857 million, recording the second highest import value so far during the year, owing to the higher expenditure incurred on intermediate goods, particularly fuel.
Expenditure on intermediate goods imports increased significantly by 23.9 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 1,021 million in August 2017, mainly due to the increase in expenditure on imports of fuel by 73.0 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 312 million.
This was largely driven by the significant increase in refined petroleum imports by 110.9 per cent to US dollars 233 million.
In addition, reflecting the impact of high crude oil prices in the international market, import expenditure on crude oil increased by 12.2 per cent despite a reduction in volume.
Accordingly, average import price of crude oil was recorded at US dollars 53.07 per barrel in August 2017 compared to US dollar 46.71 per barrel recorded in August 2016.
Meanwhile, expenditure on consumer goods imports remained broadly unchanged at US dollars 394 million in August 2017.
However, expenditure on food and beverages grew by 3.7 per cent (year-on-year) in August 2017, mainly due to higher expenditure incurred on the importation of rice.
Meanwhile, import expenditure on vegetables, dairy products and fruits increased during the month.
Import expenditure on investment goods increased by 2.1 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 439 million in August 2017 reflecting higher imports of machinery and equipment, and building materials.
With regard to the origin of imports, India, China, the UAE, Singapore and Japan were the main import origins during the first eight months of 2017 accounting for about 59 per cent of total imports. Tourist arrivals increased by 2.5 per cent, year-on-year, in August 2017, with 190,928 tourists arriving during the month. This provisional estimate may be revised once the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority releases its survey results on average stay period and average spending per day estimates for 2017.
During the first eight months of the year, foreign investments in the CSE recorded a net inflow of US dollars 328.3 million, including net inflows of US dollars 180.7 million to the secondary market and inflows of US dollars 147.6 million to the primary market.
Foreign investments in the government securities market continued to record inflows, registering a net inflow of US dollars 86.4 million in August 2017.
During the first eight months of 2017, the overall balance of the BOP is estimated to have recorded a surplus of US dollars 2,174.9 million in comparison to a surplus of US dollars 211.5 million recorded during the corresponding period of 2016.
Sri Lanka's gross official reserves as at end August 2017 amounted to US dollars 7.7 billion, equivalent to 4.5 months of imports, while total foreign assets amounted to US dollars 9.8 billion, equivalent to 5.7 months of imports.
The Sri Lankan rupee recorded a modest depreciation of 2.6 per cent against the US dollar during the period from end 2016 to 16 October 2017.
Furthermore, reflecting cross currency movements, the rupee also depreciated against the euro by 13.0 per cent, the pound sterling by 9.9 per cent, the Japanese yen by 6.2 per cent, the Canadian dollar by 9.7 per cent, the Australian dollar by 10.4 per cent and the Indian rupee by 7.2 per cent during this period.

## Title: Germanys Current Account Surplus  - Is it bad for the World
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Thursday, October 19, 2017 - 01:00
Germanys Current Account Surplus  - Is it bad for the World
The Economist of July 9 2017, in a detailed and probing study is critical of Germanys Current Account Surplus which is generated through her repetitively high export performances.
The internationally reputed news magazine says that though the surplus makes Germany content, it seriously affects some other nations particularly large nations which conduct trade with Germany.
How is it so bad
Given the present free trade climate in the EU and the U.S besides some other European countries German exports hurt the manufacturers in these countries. Particularly affected is the U.S.
On the other hand, the US is roundly criticized for its apparent likelihood to be protectionist. The U.S. President Donald Trump has been quoted a few times in this regard. He has stated that Germanys motor vehicle exports damage the US car industry and that employees in the manufacture of cars are losing jobs as a result of German exports to the US.
President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on steel and steel based products as a counter measure to thwart such imports.
Strangely enough it is the western nations championed by the likes of the U.S. that first ushered the concept and practice of free trade or trade liberalization. This was a key component of globalization that swept the world since the early i980s.
Apart from being the worlds leading proponent of free trade that Germany is, there are quite a few other nations who were early advocates of the benefits of trade liberalization, who talk now of curbing such liberalization. This would clearly be a protective measure that runs counter to free trade.
Economic advancement of Germany
In delving deep into the German economy, the Economist refers to her past achievements which contributed to make that nations economic miracle a reality. She began her post war resurgence not only through technological skills but also through the national will and urge to save. For long years, Germanys savings have exceeded her domestic investment.
Yet another contributory factor to her progress is industrial peace. Both these factors have enabled the country to reach a rare plane of all round economic stability.
Besides the above, a continuing accord between trade unions and the private sector have ensured that a state of wage restraint prevailed for decades. The overall aim was to maintain an export competitiveness of German products. These are difficult to achieve conditions rarely found in other countries .In combination they made Germany a haven for industrial harmony which is the envy of many other free trade nations.
As a result firms ventured into industry and invested freely without any worry that trade unions would stand in their way to give undue wage rises in the private sector.
Vocational training
To cite another contributory factor to Gemanys economic success during the last half century or more is her vocational training of the young on a nationwide basis
This program called dual training which begins at school level enables the continuous output of trained young men in the various vocations. Thus Germanys mighty industrial machine has rarely run short of trained staff (on a personal note this writer has had exposure to dual training that Germany provides way back in the 1980s under U.N auspices )
The flip-side of the coin
However, as the Economist observes there are serious side effects which are patently evident today of the super efficiency and the mastery of the German economic machine.
The magazine applies a rather newly coined term which is gaining ground in the lexicon of international trade-economic nationalism. The term implies that a nation needs to protect its own economy before protecting free trade.
The term was first used by President Donald Trump who came out with much touted America first. Could this mean an insular mantra or protectionist ideology that -seems to find favour with the hitherto free trade lobby.
In this context was not Brexit at least a shade of economic nationalism
Despite all its flaws, economic liberalization had a great impacton the development of nations. We could cite the progress achieved by two Asian giants  China and India in this regard.
China reached the rarified heights of being the second largest economy, as a result of her open economic policies which paved the way for foreign investment and exploitation of Chinas vast natural resources.
Instrange contrast to the above,it is the very same freedom of enterprise which brought about Germanys stupendous growth which todayhas led to her havingexcessive export surpluses. This makes the world trade dangerously unbalanced according to the Economist
We give below the reasons attributed by the Economist to the German trade surpluses.
A) A control of wages which had prevailed in Germany over the decades has led to a decrease in domestic spending and her imports.
B) Consumer spending in Germany is comparatively low and amounts to 54% of her G.D.P. In contrast it is 69% in U.S.A and 65 % in Britain.
C) Domestic Investments- There is little evidence in Germany to show that exporters who earned big profits invest such profits at home
A similar economic position also prevailed in some other European countries which had export surpluses repeatedly.
These countries are Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands Even during the depression that rocked the rest of the world beginning 2008, they never suffered but had trade surpluses.
Germany which had a current account surplus of 8% has caused a severe strain on the worlds trading system. Such surpluses also forced some of the nations to borrow money and spend it with abandon and this helped Germany to maintain her workforce ,as well as the demand for exports.
The result, a debt trapt to other nations. Particularly affected were Italy, Greece and Spain who suffered a series of economic setbacks,
Remedial measures proposed
How could the problem of severe imbalance of worlds trading system be corrected It could only happen the same way that Chinas surplus trading was eroded by a rapid rise in wages. In case of Germany a shrinkage in employment which is less than 4% of the working age population.
This is despite a rapid rise in immigration which Germany experienced in recent times. Also through increase in the purchase of houses.
The Economist cautions that Germany has a long tradition of controlling wages.
Wages rose by a mere 2.3% IN 2016 and that was even a lesser wage rise than in the previous two years.
All this means that German trade surplus may take years to reach a level of decline that would impact on the overall picture of global imbalance of trade.
The possible solutions
The Economist in conclusion is of the opinion that the German government could step in to correct the situation.
a) Firstly it could spend more .Its structural budget balance has slightly changed from a G.D.P. deficit of around 3% in 2010 to reach the level of surplus today.
Though this is considered prudent by the concerned German officials, theEconomist notes that it cannot be defended.As opposed to this the magazine states that there are plenty of areas within the country that could do with more public investment. Among the examples are:-
b) School buildings which are dilapidated which could be repaired using public funds.
c) Similarly public spending on roads which are reportedly crumbling.(This is due to the control of public spending and misguided fiscal rules)
d) Investment on digitalization in which Germany ranks as low as 25th in the world in relation to download speed
e) Germany also could do with a system of better care of the youngand provide for more on after school life. This would let more mothers work full time. In Germany, the participation of women in work is comparatively low.
Though these are some of the remedial measures suggested domestic expansion is considered almost impossible on account of factors like full employment. Above all, there appears a great need for Germany to realize that far too much savings is a weakness.
All in all, the legitimacy that Chancellor Angela Merkel champions in respect of free trade is threatened to a serious degree by her nations recurrent export surpluses.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will make an official complaint to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) in connection with the government pumping Rs. 900 million to Dr. Neville Fernando private hospital, in addition to the Rs. 3,500 million being pumping to the same hospital annually, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that the GMOA will also make a complain to the Right To Information Commission in connection with not providing the information requested from the University Grants Commission (UGC) on SAITM. 
According to Dr. Ananda, Health Ministry officially accepted the fact that it does not have any information, facts or details about Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital and the Higher Education Ministry officially accepted the fact that it does not have any information on SAITM obtaining the Compliance Certificate. Relevant officials of the two Ministries accepted those facts in writing, he said.
It is surprising that how three politicians fool the country's Executive President and the parliament and do what they want putting the lives of innocent poor patients in danger. People wonder where the Executive powers of the President and the two third majority in the Parliament because none of them use for the welfare of the people who face a grave danger in future because of the SAITM issue and the various hardships faced by the entire country is due to not solving SAITM issue. Nobody wants SAITM except three politicians, he added.

The Government is prepared to accept the solution to the SAITM problem proposed by the Mahasangha with due honour and it is hoped that the GMOA will be flexible enough to agree to the proposal to find a final solution, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Kiriella said the GMOA sticked to the position that SAITM should be abolished and it would be futile if it came in for discussions clinging on to the same position.
Both parties to a dispute should change extreme positions and come to a central point in order to resolve it.
Kiriella said framing education policy was the duty and responsibility of the government rather than doctors or undergraduates.
Since the GMOA and a minor group of university dons were trying to disrupt the education of university students by encouraging them to launch demonstrations, he would request university students to first attend lectures so their the problem could be solved through discussions.

Houses for 2,036 residents under Urban Regeneration project
Due to Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Projects
The government has decided to provide 2,036 residents who will lose their houses due to the Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Projects, houses under the Urban Regeneration project, launched by the Urban Development Authority (UDA).
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva received Cabinet approval on Tuesday to obtain funds for reserving 2,036 houses with a value of between Rs.4-5 million from housing projects implemented by the UDA within 2017-2019 under the Urban Regeneration Project. The Kelani Valley Railway Line Development Project aims to improve the line from Maradana to Padukka as a double track railway line and to rehabilitate the rest up to Avissawela.
The Urban Regeneration Project under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five storied condominium apartment complex consisting of 500 apartment units on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises. The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
Houses built by the project in Angoda however, were rejected by the low income families in Colombo as they had refused to move from the heart of Colombo to Angoda.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka thereafter obtained
Cabinet approval to sell these flats to members of the Tri-Forces, lower middle income government servants, artistes, small and medium businessmen and women and civil activists.
The units built at a cost of Rs.3.4 million each was to be sold for between Rs.4-5 million.

Lanka Hospitals partners with Sri Lanka Heart Association to mark World Heart Day
The internationally accredited, multi award-winning healthcare provider Lanka Hospitals Corporation joined the Heart Walk organized by Sri Lanka Heart Association, Held in commemoration of the World Heart Day on September 29 and the event is conducted annually in a bid to spread awareness on the importance of healthy living among the masses.
The event was held under the patronage of Sri Lanka Heart Association amidst large number of participants including school children, employees from public and private sectors and dignitaries.
Six distinct themes were highlighted during this years Heart Walk, encouraging the practice of positive habits to lead a healthy lifestyle. Under the main theme Share the Power, the Heart Walk focused on the importance of sharing healthy habits while inspiring millions of people around the world to be heart healthy.
A self-pledge was made to stop smoking, consume more fruits and vegetables, regularly check blood pressure, and lead an active lifestyle, the key determinants for reducing the risk of heart diseases.
People living in the contemporary times lead busy and stressful lives with minimal physical activity, and adopting unhealthy habits. As a result, an unprecedented rise in cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases have been observed in the world, as much as of Sri Lanka. Heart diseases are caused by a number of factors such as unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, smoking, alcohol abuse and drugs in addition to chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary artery diseases.
However, when it comes to detecting symptoms for heart diseases with precision, only a handful of hospitals in the country can facilitate such modern technology. Due to the lack of infrastructure and resources for conducting sophisticated tests, patients suspected or already suffering from heart ailments are compelled to remain in a long waiting list to undergo essential diagnostic procedures.
The Heart Centre of Lanka Hospital stakes pride in performing the highest number of heart surgeries and Cath Lab procedures in the private sector in Sri Lanka.It has also successfully completed more than 7500 heart surgeries, and is the only private hospital specialized in conducting Paediatric heart surgeries.

Madhuri for Marathi cinema
After ruling Bollywood for decades, Madhuri Dixit-Nene has finally veered her attention towards her mother tongue. After the announcement of her turning producer with a Marathi film, we have now learnt that the Dhak Dhak actress will make her acting debut in the industry. However, it wont be her own production.
The yet-to-be-titled project is a slice-of-life film that revolves around a womans (played by Madhuri) journey of self-realisation, laced with a dash of humour. It will go on floors by the end of this year.
Though Madhuri has always wanted to act in Marathi films, seems, she was waiting for the right script to come her way. The actress says, Marathi cinema is evolving beautifully and it makes me proud to see such incredible stories come alive on screen. I have received many scripts over the years, since I was always open to acting in Marathi films. However, no script excited me as much as this one. The moment I heard the story, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it.

Mane miseries
For decades women have taken pride in their crowning glory, so much so that they get worked up when there is a threat to their lovely tresses. If they note a few strands of hair in the comb, they hit the panic button. But keep your hair on. The answer may lie in it being a part of the normal hair cycle or a result of improper hair care.
Hair loss causes
Genetic cause: If your ancestors or family members or close relatives have a long lineage of baldness or thinning of hair, you can be assured of genetic cause of your hair fall.
Malnutrition: Hair is also integral part of our organic system and like any other cells of the body hair cells in our scalp also needs proper nourishment and nutrition. So a deficiency of a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrients can as well be the cause of hair loss.
Stress: Being under pressure is one of the major causes of hair loss. Our modern day life style affects the way our organic system functions. Our hair cells needs rest, relaxation and rejuvenation too.
Long and short term illness: Certain drugs and treatment can be very harmful for the condition of your scalp and hair.
Pregnancy and childbirth: Women become vulnerable to various kinds of mineral deficiencies at the time of pregnancy or child birth which causes hair loss.
Normal or unusual
Normally between 85 or 95 percent of the hair on your head is actively growing. The other 5 to 15 percent is in the resting stage. After the resting period this hair falls out often while brushing or shampooing. This hair is replaced by new hair growth. The average person loses between 50 to 100 strands of hair per day. It can even be up to 150 in some cases. You may end up with bald spots if you are a man. If you are a woman, you may find that the hair on the top of your head is slowly thinning.
Fine hair vs thin hair
Fine hair is a hair type whereas thinning is a symptom of a hair loss condition which can affect any hair type.
Hair loss after childbirth
Many moms are surprised to be shedding more hair than usual in the first few months after giving birth. However this is perfectly normal. There is no need to panic. Your hair should be back to normal around your babys first birthday.
During pregnancy an elevated estrogen level prolongs the growing stage. There are fewer hairs in the resting stage and fewer falling out each day. So you may have thicker, more luxuriant tresses.
After you give birth however, your estrogen level plummets, and a lot more hair follicles enter the resting stage within five months. It is likely that you will have more hair coming out in the shower or on your hair brush.
Bald spot concealers
I personally can see some possible situations in which bald spot concealers would be appropriate. However these are very limited and none of them involve up close and personal interaction.
These bald spot concealers work by colouring the scalp in the area of thin hair with a colour that makes the bald spot appear less noticeable. Some formulas include fibers either in spray itself or as a second step application that adhere to the existing hair and sort of fill on the hair, making it look thicker and fuller.
Age and hair thinning
A woman would not necessarily start to lose her hair at a certain age aside from the normal shedding of hair that occurs daily. It is determined by genetic and hormonal factors. It may start at early as your late teens or early twenties. However, almost 40 percent of women will experience some degree of hair loss by the age of 35.
Hair extensions
In most cases a clients hair simply needs some added volume. While the enhancer can be designed to add volume, it can often be the case that hair extensions would be the ideal solution.
Shave it for thicker hair
When the hair is shaved off, all the hairs are made the same length, and the ends are blunted. This often causes the hair to feel thicker. Incidents where you think multiple hairs have suddenly begun to grow where there was previously only one hair are more likely cases where nearby follicles reentered the growth phase at approximately the same time as your shaving.
Going for the bangs cut
Adding a fringe is a distraction to the fact that the hair is fine. People who have hair like this should opt for shorter styles that are styled to be side swept and into wispy tresses.
Shampoo for a fuller look
Use shampoo which will give volume to the hair. The right shampoo can make thin hair appear lush and full. A good conditioner can provide necessary hydration without weighing it down.
Styling thin hair
A very short layered haircut can suddenly make the hair seem much thicker. Short styles are good for fine thin hair. If you have fine long hair, dont let the layers get too long. You get more volume if you have soft layers framing the face.

My Fair Lady at Lionel Wendt: Amazingly Fair
A tour de force at the Wendt, My Fair Lady met, and indeed exceeded Colombos expectations, playing from October 6-15, with two matinee performances thrown in for good measure.
There were weeks, if not months of anticipation, from theatre-hungry city folk, from the time the Workshop Players announced in May, the celebration of their 25th year with this time-tested Broadway musical. For six decades, the songs from Lerner and Loewes adaptation of Shaws Pygmalion have been favourites with children and adults alike.
Not the least why the musical was much looked forward to - and didnt disappoint - particularly on account of its strong lead actors - Jerome L. De Silva (Colonel Pickering), Kanishka Herat (Professor Higgins), Amarsha Tissera (Eliza Doolittle) and Sulakshana Dias Amaratunga (Alfred P. Doolittle). With very professional sets and costumes that matched the original, not to mention their able supporting cast, they transported lovers of England and of all things English to a heavenly three-and-a-half hours in Edwardian London.
Young Herat was impressive in that he took on the role of an older man with aplomb, his acting a perfect foil for his excellent singing. His youthful good looks made him a better Professor Higgins than Rex Harrison, it seemed.
A seasoned actor in his company, he tackled the role of confirmed bachelor and eccentric phonetician superbly, displaying a maturity beyond his years. Pretty young Tissera with her elfin figure, sharp features, skillful management of the Cockney and husky voice rendered an evocative performance as Eliza. Unlike the other lead actors, she's debuting on the professional stage and Cockney Covent Garden apart, her 'I Could Have Danced All Night' lent the romance the moment called for, while she skillfully played a winsome Eliza in the post-ball scenes.
Herat and Tissera were evenly matched, played out especially in their waltzing in 'The Rain in Spain' and the scenes leading up to the finale.
Of the maestro, De Silva, need anything be said except that he continued to excel His dancing in The Rain in Spain was simply splendid.
Engaging indeed was Amaratunga as the portly Alfred P. Doolittle, who did justice to his role as 'the most original moralist in England', the only fault perhaps being that he looked rather youthful for the part. His two rapscallion henchmen complemented his role very well. Dinushka Jayawickreme as Mrs. Pearce was the most matronly of all housekeepers, while Harin Amirthanathan as the lovelorn Freddy Eynsford Hill rendered a very good 'I've Often Walked Down This Street Before'.
Surein De S Wijeyeratne's skilful directing showed how much more exciting a stage play and a live production is than a movie.
The attention to detail paid to costumes enhanced the quality of the production - shawls, straw baskets and posies adding to the charm at Covent Garden. Group dances, particularly those at Covent Garden, were feisty with much clicking of heels and a rustle of skirts. Minute attention had been paid to the sets  Covent Garden with a place to warm cold hands, the narrow London streets with their old fashioned flats, Higgins study replete with gramophone and period furniture that included a comfortable armchair where Pickering ate strawberry tarts in the afternoon, all of which lent the Edwardian London feel. Kudos again to De S Wijeyeratne and his team.
One was forewarned of the three-and-a-half hours but time just sped when it was wished it would stand still and it was with regret that one stepped outside the theatre doors. Judging by the enthusiastic applause throughout, which ended in a well deserved standing ovation at curtain call, it seemed the rest of the audience felt the same. Like Oliver Twist, may we ask for more

NO means NO
The fight to end gender based violence received overwhelming support from Sri Lankan cricketing legends Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara this week as they chose to tackle the subject with the most susceptible of minds - school boys and girls.
The cricketers speaking to an awe struck audience explained that the best way to end violence against women and girls was to prevent it from happening in the first place - we all needed to get to the root cause of the problem, starting from our schools.
The cricketing legends in an interactive dialogue with 100 school children at the Education Ministry on Tuesday, stressed on the need to empower our girls as a first step towards ending violence.
The sessions which started off on a positive note, reached their climax and most revelatory point when a 17-year-old boy from a reputed school in Colombo informed the duo that a womans dress code was a reason that they faced harassment in the hands of men and added that women should wear appropriate clothes to prevent harassment.
This age old argument received surprise and condemnation from Sangakkara and Jayawardena who informed their fans that not only men but even women have the right and freedom to wear what they want.
Even if a woman walks naked on the road, a man should be able to control himself. We should first stop blaming women for what they wear and how they talk. Questioning the dress code and character of a woman is a lame answer and men do it to get away from the real problems, said Sangakkara.
Jayawardena said we should stop judging a person from the dress they wear or the way they present themselves.
You cannot call Lasith Malinga a thug just because of his coloured hair and his earring. He is a well-educated person with good qualities. Every person has the right to decide on what they want to wear, he said.
Pointing out that there were very few mixed schools in the country, Jayawardena said that boys and girls do not have many opportunities to mingle and associate with each other. As a result, each party becomes easily prejudiced towards the other.
We dont even provide them with an opportunity to be friends before anyone thinks of getting into a serious relationship, said Jayawardena.
This meeting of cricketing celebrities with school children was part of the National Action Plan to address Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) which was officially launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) last year.
The National Action Plan was developed on the vision of creating a violence free life for women and children with Zero Tolerance for Sexual and Gender-based Violence in Sri Lanka, was significant as it was formulated using a multi-sectoral approach with engagement from key ministries representing nine sectors and the Education Ministry was also a part of it.
The National Action Plan
Minister of Education, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Ambassador for the Delegation of the European Union, Tung-Lai Margue, and Gender Specialist Sriyani Perera and Director, Ministry of Education Badra Withanage also joined the discussion to speak about the continuing levels of violence directed against women and girls in everyday life.
Minister Kariyawasam and Ambassador Margue introduced a video, featuring Mahela and Kumar, which will be circulated to schools in the country to increase awareness of the problem. The video was produced by the European Union (EU) Delegation to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
Minister Kariyawasam said the government of Sri Lanka was strongly committed to the elimination of violence against women and has taken significant steps to combat its prevalence.
We require consistent and concerted efforts to challenge and change attitudes and behaviours that normalize and reinforce violence against women, added the minister.
We were delighted when Sangakkara and Jayawardana agreed to become our envoys for womens rights.Its really important that Sri Lankan men hear from such role models about this serious and deep-rooted issue, said Ambassador Margue.
Need to promote genderequality among men
Studies have shown that more than half the women in Sri Lanka have experienced some form of violence, but there is a dearth of open public discussion around the problem. A study conducted by the United Nations, which covered 2,500 women between the ages of 15-35 from every district, found that 90 percent of women and girls in Sri Lanka have suffered some form of sexual harassment while on public buses and trains. Of those, only four percent sought help from the police. Given the overwhelming effect gender based violence has on women, efforts were mainly focused on responses and services for victims.
In response to the issues based on gender violence, Ambassador Margue said prevention of violence against women and girls started with better education and making children aware in schools.
This initiative is part of our long-term commitment to fight gender discrimination and to raise awareness of gender issues both in Sri Lanka and in the wider world. I believe that education is the key element to curb this problem and it has to be dealt in a multifaceted approach. Girls and women should be made aware that they need to break the silence and speak out for themselves, he said. He added that violence was not linked to economic class or ethnic group and added that Sri Lanka needs to strengthen its response systems and promote positive behavioural change.
Sangakkara said men by supporting the cause would give a sense of the magnitude of the problem that women face at the hands of men who are against them.
He said the traditional method of life that we have been practising all these years have taught us to differentiate between what what boys and girls can do.
At several instances, girls are restricted from doing what they love with the argument that it is not a suitable thing for a girl to do. And boys are taught that crying is a weakness. People have a right to express their feelings and lead a life they love. Women have equal rights as men to live a life they want, he said.
Sangakkara further explained that our society has given men more power and they tend to consider it as their privilege and added that the wrong version of masculinity was imprinted in the minds of our boys and men.
Sangakara emphasized that the initiatives for change should involve boys and men equally.
He said men should get over their traditional thoughts about women and added that masculinity was all about confronting the wrong.
Talking about these issues is very important because all these years it was hidden within our communities. Women are also made to believe that they are considered less important compared to men, he said.
Jayawardena speaking about social media and the role it played in the lives of young and old today, said that social media was the easy platform for men to objectify women.
If you see a person involved in any such activity, you should speak against it without extending your support. Media promotes negative thoughts and he advised the students to learn things from talking to others, as all that is shown on social media is not true, he said.
Girls should be taught to say NO
According to Gender Specialist Sriyani Perera, girls and women are conditioned to say yes to everything and taught that girls are not supposed to say no to anything.
She stressed that traditional culture that stopped girls and women from making their own decisions had to be changed.
Perera said that the girl children should foremost learn to say NO when someone forces something on them against their will.
Speaking about love affairs in schools and extreme problems faced by the students as a result of it, she said girls are taught to adhere to males at home and they easily become victims of rape and harassment at the hands of other men.
Young people should keep in mind that a love affair is different from a physical relationship. NO means NO and both men and women should be made aware of it, she said.
Perera said that relevant authorities should take immediate measures to combat the problem and added that cyber laws need to be further strengthened to ensure that wrongdoers are punished.
Speaking on domestic violence, Perera noted that children are adversely affected by the activities of their parents.
People do not want to talk about what happens within their houses. Its kind of a rule set by themselves. They think that it is their private space and they can do whatever they want. Many parents fail to understand that it directly as well as indirectly affects their children,she said.
Perera warned that the children might not get involve in the discussions of their parents, but they are silent observers and they internalize the characteristics shown by their parents.
She further said that domestic violence is not restricted to women but at times, men also undergo similar experiences.
Perera advised the children not to remain as silent observers any more and to talk to their parents openly when they have an issue.
She said students can contact the following numbers if they need any support. Sumithrayo 011 2692909, Women in need 011 2671411, Prevention of abuse of children and women 011 282 64 44 and CERT 011 2691692, for problems involving cyber crimes.
School level initiatives beingtaken to combat the issue -Director Ministry of Education
Director, Ministry of Education Badra Withanage said the Ministry of Education has commenced several programmes to create awareness among students on gender based violence.
Children from their younger age should be taught to respect each other and to refuse if someone forces them to do something against their will, she said.
She said that students from the North Central province, Monaragala and Ampara districts face extreme problems.
There is a huge problem involving physical and mental harassment that we have been deaf and dumb to all these years and added that we need to create more platforms to talk about these issues. Equality and respect for the opposite sex is included in the text books of students but no practical measures have been taken to implement it at school level, she said.
Withanage emphasized that whilst taking measures to solve the issues, we also should take initiatives to prevent it.
Educational policy changes might take some time, but we can take immediate measures to change the perspective of the people, she said.
One of the school principals who was present at the discussion highlighted the need of counsellors in schools.
She said students were not willing to talk either to teachers or their parents if they have any issue, but if there were counsellors at schools, the students can easily reach out to them when they come across a problem that they cannot deal with on their own.
One of the student counsellors attached to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs said students could contact their hotline if they had any issues and added that even though some principals like their involvement at school level, many principals have expressed their objection to the idea.

Number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in N Eliya district increased
The Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas will be divided into six Pradeshiya Sabhas, increasing the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya district by another four, Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the Secretary said a collective decision was reached in this regard on Tuesday at a meeting chaired by Minister Faiszer Musthapha and attended by the JVP, Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) led by Minister Mano Ganesan and other upcountry political parties.
He said the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha which has a population of about 210,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas and the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha, which has a population of about 190,000 would be divided into three Pradeshiya Sabhas.
However, the Secretary explained that the current number of members in those respective areas will not increase as a result of the formation of new LG authorities. That was the agreement reached, he said.
He said the political party representatives who took part in the meeting gave their verbal agreement to this arrangement, adding that those political parties were asked to make their recommendations in writing to the Ministry by next week.
He pointed out that the upcountry Tamil Parties were insisting that those new local government bodies must be included in the upcoming LG polls.
We held the Gazette indicating the number of members in each LG body due to this reason. It will be issued soon after we receive the written recommendations of the Political Parties, he noted.

One third of NCDs to be controlled by 2020
Steps have been taken to control one third of the Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Sri Lanka by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, the initial step to control the use of tobacco has been taken by President Maithripala Sirisena without considering the income generated through tobacco.
His main objective was saving lives. That is how I was able to increase the tax on tobacco to 90 percent, the minister stated, addressing the World Health Summit held in Berlin, Germany from October 15 to 17.
Minister Senaratne had also stated that 60 percent of Sri Lankan patients who are admitted to hospitals die due to NCDs.
After coming to power in January 2015, the government has increased the tax on tobacco to 90 percent and implemented 80 percent of pictorial warning on cigarette packets.
The sale of cigarettes has gone down now, he said.
In the near future, the government will ban the sale of single cigarettes and also ban selling cigarettes around a radius of 500 metres from schools.
The sale of sweetened drinks has gone down after the introduction of the traffic light system and companies have reduced the amount of sugar added to their sweetened drinks, the minister had stated.
Dr. Sujatha Senaratne, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Germany Karunasena Hettiarachchi and others were a part of the Sri Lankan delegation.
The session was chaired by Princess Dina Mirad of Jordan and Financial Times Editor Andrew Jack.

Kadugannawa postal bomb case:
POSTED TO DEATH
That love, in such abnormal and perverted cases, can turn to terrifying hate, was tragically and dramatically demonstrated in the sensational Kadugannawa Postal Bomb Case. Some poets describe the thwarted love as hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and others as, Heaven knows no Hell like Love to Hatred turned.
This was an unusual case, as it was not between a man and a woman, but between a man and a man. That brilliant and revered Judge, the late Walter Thalgodapitiya, described this foul deed: For sheer diabolical cunning in the conception, planning and execution of the foul deed, this case is without parallel in the annals of crime in this Island.
The victim was S M Samarasinghe, a Kandyan lad who was attending Dharmaraja College, Kandy. This was in 1944, one year before the World War II ended. The man who took a passionate liking to this young boy was Lenaduwa Lokuge Jayawardene, who had migrated to Kandy from the Southern Province, and set himself up as a Tailor in an establishment called Jayasiri Tailoring Mart in Trincomalee Street.
Homosexuality was hardly known in the villages. This relationship developed when the boy Samarasinghe was boarded at the tailor Jayawardenes. The boy did not relish the amorous advances of Jayawardene. So, in 1946 he told his parents that he will not continue to stay with Jayawardene. Thereafter he was boarded at Buwelikade at one Alwis Appuhamys, and in 1947 went to reside at the Tarzan Bus Company, which was then situated at Kadugannawa.
Jayawardene made desperate efforts to get the boy back, but when all his efforts were of no avail, he decided that enough was enough and hatched a diabolical plan. His uncontrollable hatred was boiling over. Therefore he was determined to destroy this boy for whom he had developed such an all-consuming passion. Not only the boy, Jayawardena plotted to kill the boys family as well.
Parcel bomb
On January 20, 1948, two parcels were handed in at the Havelock Town Post Office: one was addressed to the boy S M Samarasinghe living at Kadugannawa, at the Tarzan Bus Company, and the other, to his sister one Seneviratne at Nelundeniya.
In both parcels, the senders name was stated as A M Seneviratne of the Training College, Colombo. Seneviratne was the boys brother-in-law, who denied at the Trial that he had sent these parcels. On the same morning, two other parcels were handed in at the General Post Office, addressed to Podi Nilame and one Miss Dissanayake. The senders name was stated as W B Wickremasinghe School, Galapitamada. Miss Dissanayake was the boys girlfriend and Jayawardene thought that she had weaned the boy away from him. That is why he decided to destroy her as well.
One of the ablest prosecutors then in the Attorney Generals Department was A C M Ameer, who later was appointed Attorney General and conferred Silk. Ameer in his address to the Jury stated: His plans should not miscarry and therefore the names of the senders of the parcels had to be selected with care, so that the recipients will be disarmed of suspicion by mere reason of the senders names.
The man who posted the bombs at Havelock Town PO and at the GPO was not identified.
On that fateful day, the boy came after school and on seeing the parcel, opened it. The parcel bomb was of such magnitude that the roof of the Tarzan Bus Co was blown sky high, and the boy was blown to smithereens. Fortunately, the other recipients of the parcels acted with caution and did not open them.
The Police took charge of all unexploded parcels. They forthwith arrested the tailor L L Jayawardene, as there was overwhelming evidence against him.
The case came up at the Midland Assizes, on May 8, 1949, (Monday) before Puisne Justice Dr R F Dias (LLD) and an English-speaking Jury. A C M Ameer appeared for the Crown. Aelian Pereira, a flamboyant and a first class Jury lawyer, was the leading counsel for the Accused. Incidentally, Aelians father Walter Pereira (Kings Counsel) was acting Attorney General in 1906. He, along with C M Fernando, appeared for the prosecution in the Francis Attygalle Murder Case, in which John Kotalawela Sr was charged with the murder of his brother-in-law.
Ameer had woven the web in which the Accused L L Jayawardene, was well and truly cornered. The only hope now lay in Aelian Pereiras powerful advocacy in his final Address to the Jury. He had been known to wrest a verdict in his favour from a reluctant Jury, by the power of his Address alone. It was not unthinkable that he would not repeat this feat in Jayawardenes Defence. Aelian concluded his Address by quoting Sir Edward Marshall-Hall KC. Marshall-Hall KC was the ablest Criminal Lawyer in the British Empire, in the 19th Century.
Gentlemen, in the hands of Justice are held two scales and you are the people who watch and decide, as the blind figure of Justice holds those scales aloft. It is you who decide what is the result of the weighing. One scale is the Scale of the Prosecution, the other is the Scale of the Prisoner. The prosecution comes under your careful and acute scrutiny as they begin to put into the scales of the Crown, the bits of evidence which are to weigh and make the scale go downwards to a lower level than the other, and convict the prisoner of the crime of which he is charged.
Prisoners scale
The other scale is empty when they begin. You must take away from your eyes any faulty vision which you may have, caused by prejudice or suspicion. You are sworn to do your duty according to the evidence and upon your oaths, you must give your verdict. And you must not let any faculty lie dormant in the most minute examination of the line, the balance of those two scales. But remember this, the other scale is not empty. The Prisoners scale has something in it, invisible to the naked eye, invisible to anyone who examines it, however skillfully, however scientifically, because on that scale is a thing called the Presumption of Innocence, which if the scales go level is to bump the Prisoners Scale down and outweigh the scale on the other side.
Sir Edward Marshall-Hall was a fearless defender of men. Apart from Aelian Perreira, the other famous Jury lawyer was H Sri Nissanka QC, a batchmate of SWRD Bandaranaike at Oxford University.
Incidentally, the Trial Judge of the Case under review Dr R F Dias was the father of Felix Dias Bandaranaike, one time powerful Cabinet Minister in the Sirima Dias Bandaranaike Cabinet. Dr R F Dias was, I believe, one of the five Doctors of Law, Ceylon produced. The first and still the youngest was Sir Lalita Rajapakse (LLD, QC), the first Minister of Justice in the D S Senanayake Cabinet. Sir Lalita was awarded the LLD from the London University back in 1925, and even after the lapse of 88 years, he is still the youngest Sri Lankan to have achieved this highest academic qualification. His portrait hangs in the London University.
The other Doctors of Law are Dr H W Thambiah QC (Judge of the Supreme Court), Judge Dr C G Weeramantry of World Court fame and Dr J A L Cooray who for many years continued as Lecturer in Constitutional Law at the Law College.
Crown Counsel Ameer analysing the evidence for the Crown addressed the Jury, You will remember that no one of the 40 witnesses for the Crown has told you that any of them saw the Accused make a bomb or send a bomb. They have each spoken to certain facts and circumstances, the Crown invites you to draw the inference that it was this Accused and no one else who, either, sent the parcel to the boy or caused it to be sent to him in order to kill him.
Of that era, the ablest Prosecutor was A C M Ameer. Of recent times, the ablest Prosecutor in the AGs Dept was Presidents Counsel Tilak Marapone, later elevated as Attorney General.
Before the Prosecution concluded this Case, an unusual and unexpected thing happened. The Prisoner made a request that his Counsel should call on him at Bogambara Prison. When Aelian went to meet him, he saw papers scattered all over the cell. The Prisoner was well versed in hieroglyphics. He informed Aelian that according to his horoscope if the verdict came before 11 am on a particular day, he had to be acquitted! If the verdict was after 11 am, he would surely be convicted and sentenced to death.
At 9.30 a.m. on this day, two witnesses were called and Aelian, abiding by the instructions given to him by his client, said No questions in any event they were formal witnesses. Just then, to the amazement of those present in Court, and the hundreds outside, Justice R F Dias said to the Jury: Gentlemen, we must do Justice as we conceive it.
This Case is based on circumstantial evidence and owing to the brutal nature of the killing of this boy, our minds have not been free of a considerable degree of prejudice as well. If prejudice is allowed to cloud the issue it is not a thing that will enhance the accuracy of our reasoning and ultimate judgment. In his restricted charge to the Jury, he said, No human eye saw this Accused make the bomb, no human eye saw the Accused post the bomb. Consider Gentlemen whether you would want to go on with this case or whether you would not prefer to stop it at this stage. The Judge put it as strongly as that.
According to Aelian, his eyes and the eyes of the Accused were glued to the clock in the Court. As the minutes crept by, it was 5 to 11, 4 to 11, 3 to 11, 2 to 11 and 1 to 11. Still, the Jury had not returned. The Accused had then told Aelian, Now Sir, I am doomed. I will be sentenced to death. At 5 minutes past 11 am, the Jury returned and indicated that they would prefer to go on with the case.
As usual, Aelian addressed the Jury in his inimitable style. The Trial Judge commenced his Final Charge to the Jury. He was scrupulously fair. He commenced his Charge in VERSE, by describing the making of the bomb:
Little sticks of dynamite, torch-like cells acquire,
Ceiling wax will them unite, to a copper wire.
Insulated switch now fix, make a parcel neat,
Detonator cap affix, and your bombs complete
He went on and on, and wound up with another VERSE;
Criminals their arts employ and their foes entrap,
Sure the Law will them destroy, in their toils enwrap.
Circumstantial evidence gleaned from here and there,
It is the way how Providence, malefactors snare.
On May 20, 1949, the Jury by a unanimous verdict found the Accused L L Jayawardene GUILTY. Therefore the Judge had no alternative but to sentence him to death.
Finally, the Accused appealed to the Privy Council. The Petition for Leave to Appeal in forma pauperis came up before the Privy Council on January 30, 1950, but the Application was refused and the appeal was Dismissed.
The Prisoner thereupon made a last request that the place of execution be changed from Bogambara Prison in Kandy, to Welikada Prison in Colombo. The authorities granted his request. He was hanged on March 18, 1950.
Thus ended the most sensational case of that era. All those who figured in this Case were colourful personalities: Justice Dr R F Dias, Defence Counsel Aelian Pereira and Crown Counsel A C M Ameer.
Several people are said to have travelled all the way to Kandy to witness this Case which evoked so much of public opinion.

Prehistoric Portuguese fortress discovered
An abandoned fortress dating back to the Portuguese period was found within thick wilderness in Madagammana, Panawala, Dehiowita in the Kegalle district on October 17 following information provided by the public in the surrounding area, Director General of Archaeology P. B. Mandawala said.
It is believed to have been built between the period 1515 to 1540 after the Seetavakapura invasion to gain easy access to Sabaragamuwa, he said. Mandawala said Portuguese features including insignia were found unscathed within the fortress premises. The fortress had been built to cover three sides. The location seemed to belong to the prehistoric period.
Even though historical records stated the existence of such a fortress it could not be discovered until now. Since it had historic value urgent steps would be taken to conserve it.

President supports Pakistan to host  20th SAARC Summit
President Maithripala Sirisena has extended his support to Pakistan to host the 20th SAARC Summit meeting there.
Pakistans Foreign Secretary, Tehmina Janjua addressing the media at an event to launch the Sri Lanka-Pakistan Alumni Association yesterday thanked the President for his support and added that Pakistan looked to further strengthen ties with Sri Lanka over a vast area.
The visit of the Foreign Secretary to Sri Lanka came a day after Pakistan scored an important victory in the UN by securing a seat at the UN Human Rights Council. Being one of the 15 countries to be elected to the Council, Janjua once again thanked Sri Lanka for its support and vote to secure such a victory.
Another crucial win for Pakistan-Sri Lanka relations came in the field of sports with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) deciding that the national team will play in Lahore on October 26. This will be their first visit to Pakistan since being subject to a terrorist attack in 2009.
We are delighted that the Sri Lankan team is visiting Lahore. Pakistanis will cheer the Sri Lankans as much as their own team. There are no security issues to be worried about, Janjua said.
The events this week thus mark a closer relationship between the two countries and a win for Pakistani diplomacy. Sri Lanka opted out of the 19th SAARC Summit citing security reasons last year, other SAARC countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan soon followed suit. Tensions between Pakistan and India had led to India calling for a boycott of the Summit which was later indefinitely postponed.
This year however, the newly appointed Pakistani Foreign Secretary, Janjua chose Sri Lanka as her first foreign visit since being appointed.
This first visit is very important. It is evident from the fact that she selected Sri Lanka to be visited as her first country after taking assignment, said the newly appointed Pakistani High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Major General (Rtd) Dr. Shahid Ahamed Hafmat speaking at the event.
Janjua said education was an important mechanism for friendship and understanding which improves people to people relations.
No developing country can provide advanced educational facilities to all its citizens, therefore it is in their interest to use the educational facilities available in all friendly countries, she said.
Pakistan has been offering student scholarships to Sri Lankans since 1976 and the areas of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, engineering, management and sciences have featured prominently in this.
During the visit of former Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Shariff in Janurary 2016, Pakistan offered to develop a Knowledge Corridor for Sri Lankan students and military personnel through scholarship and training in university and institutes, said the Foreign Secretary.
The Alumni Association thus will be an important channel which will add to the scheme and build existing relations within the two countries.

Probe into swindled  millions at Rupavahini
An attempt made to swindle Rs 70 million out of a total of Rs. 180 million provided by President Maithripala Sirisena to the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation to launch a reconciliation channel on behalf of the Tamil people has now come to light.
This matter and other alleged financial misdeeds running to tens of millions of rupees which occurred during the Rajapaksa era are now subject to an internal probe carried out in the Corporation under the direct supervision of the Corporations Director General Thusitha Melewwethanthri.
Severe deterioration of discipline had caused these misdeeds. Strict legal action will be taken against the culprits if they are proven, the Director General said.
The four main alleged misdeeds involves purchasing of character generators, a proposed satellite TV project, transmission equipment and Bar Code scanners.
Investigations revealed that the Corporation had spent Rs. 18 million in October 2014 to purchase five character generations. Due to their malfunctioning, millions of rupees had been spent to import spares, but the equipment had still been out of Commission and discarded.
Another Rs. 3.4 million had been released to an Italian agent to open a satellite telecast channel without a proper agreement and the project had not got off the ground.
Another Rs. 12 million had been issued to an institution in Italy to purchase two transmitters, but the equipment thus obtained are not operational.
The Corporation had also spent Rs. 9.5 million to purchase several Bar Code Scanner machines but the machines had been laid off as they are not functioning properly.
Machinery imported at a cost of several millions by the former administration to upgrade telecasts are still lying idle in their encasings without being put to use.
Members of the joint committee for the protection of the Rupavahini Corporation have said investigations into these alleged misdeeds were prevented in the past as a certain interested group within the Corporation prevented others from disclosing them.

## Title: The purge has begun!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, October 19, 2017 - 01:00
The purge has begun!
Finally, the whip has been cracked and the purge is on. After just over two years of prevaricating, negotiating and observing with watchful expectation, President Maithripala Sirisena dispensed of three key electoral organisers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) last week, signalling a sea change in his policy of accommodating and appeasing the Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the party led by his predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Dismissed from their posts as electoral organisers were Kumara Welgama, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Piyankara Jayaratne and Sarana Gunawardena for the electorates of Mathugama, Nawalapitiya, Anamaduwa and Attanagalla respectively. They have been replaced by former MP Sumitha Priyangani Abeyweera, H.A. Ranasinghe, Ananda Sarath Kumara and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
It is noteworthy that both Aluthgamage and Gunawardena had corruption charges levelled against them. On the other hand, Welgama is a die-hard SLFPer, having joined the party when Sirima Bandaranaike was its leader. That he was removed from his post indicates a strong resolve by President Sirisena to act decisively against the dissident faction.
Piyankara Jayaratne too is a loyal SLFPer with strong family ties to the party: his father, S.D. R. Jayaratne was Minister of Fisheries in the government of Sirima Bandaranaike. Piyankara Jayaratne himself held the office Deputy Speaker in the previous Parliament when Rajapaksa was President and was also Minister of Civil Aviation. He too had been charged with bribery earlier this year.
The reaction to the Presidents decision has been muted, at least from the mainstream SLFP. The only minister to speak out was Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne. Seneviratne stated that it was sad that some party organisers who had served the party for a long time had been expelled without even giving them reasons for their dismissal.
Party hierarchy
Minister Seneviratne claimed these organisers had been removed because they had allegedly neglected to work for the party in their electorates. However, he said the party cadres were overwhelmingly against the current state of affairs, and therefore the organisers had no way of working in the interests of the party. If they have been dismissed because they did not work in their electorates then they should be given the chance to explain their stance, he has argued. The party hierarchy has not responded so far to these comments.
It was known that Seneviratne was among the Old Guard in the SLFP who had, time and again, tried to broker a peace deal between the two factions of the party. Last weeks decision meant that any such agreement was now highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.
If the sacking of these organisers came as a surprise, the appointment of Chandrika Kumaratunga as SLFP organiser for Attanagalla raised even more eyebrows. Kumaratunga had, for all intents and purposes, retired from active politics after serving for eleven years as Sri Lankas fourth Executive President. She still serves the party in the capacity of patron.
It is common knowledge that Kumaratunga was instrumental in convincing Maithripala Sirisena, then serving as Minister of Health and General Secretary of the SLFP, to quit the government headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa and run for President against him. Kumaratunga, along with Mangala Samaraweera, also played a key role in enlisting the support of her erstwhile political rival Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United National Party (UNP) for the Sirisena campaign.
Since then, the former President has been content to take a back seat, although she has made her opinions known from time to time in her characteristically candid manner, particularly with reference to Rajapaksas style of governance. When rapprochement with the Rajapaksa faction of SLFP has been discussed, Kumaratunga has vehemently made it clear that she is against the concept, stating it will lead to handing back the party to the Rajapaksa family.
Therefore, Kumaratungas re-entry to active politics is the final nail in the coffin for any plans to reunite the partys two warring factions. While the appointment as organiser for Attanagalla sends a powerful signal to the Rajapaksa faction, there was also speculation about the former Presidents own intentions in accepting this position.
Attanagalla has always been a pocket-borough of the Bandaranaike family and remains very much so despite the swinging of political fortunes elsewhere in the country. Kumaratunga did not have to dabble in electoral politics too much because she had a mercurial rise to power when she returned to the country in 1991 after a self-imposed exile in London following the assassination of her husband, film star turned politician Vijaya Kumaratunga.
Local Government elections
She very quickly graduated from being Chief Minister of the Western Province to Prime Minister and then President within a period of less than two years. Who represented Attanagalla for the party has not been a major issue since then because parliamentarians have been elected on the proportional representation (PR) system where candidates are not elected to constituencies.
Now however, that is about to change. For the upcoming Local Government elections, the system of elections will be a mix of the first past the post Westminster system as well as the PR system and there will be members representing specific areas. If proposed constitutional reforms are successful, the same hybrid system of elections- with suitable modifications- will apply to Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections as well.
The next parliamentary elections are not due until 2020 at which time Kumaratunga will be 75 years of age. It is unlikely- but not impossible- that Kumaratunga will run for a mere seat in Parliament at that time, having been Head of State for nearly a dozen years. Hence the speculation that Kumaratunga is holding the seat until the current storm in the SLFP subsides.
Even if Kumaratunga does decide to make a comeback to Parliament in three years, that wouldnt be unprecedented: her successor, Mahinda Rajapaksa did much the same, returning to Parliament from the Kurunegala District. He is now content to sit in the legislature as a backbencher.
Belatedly though it was, President Sirisenas decision to crack down on SLFP dissidents comes at a significant time. It is now highly likely that Local Government elections will be held in January 2018 and January 20 is being discussed as a possible date for the polls. By sacking party organisers with only a few months to go before an election, the President is indicating that he is willing to take on the Rajapaksa faction of the party.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)
Already, the sabre-rattling has begun in earnest. Basil Rajapaksa, former Minister and the de-facto head of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party which will officially be linked with the JO faction, has stated that the SLPP will sweep the local polls winning over 200 local councils. SLFP stalwarts are also making similar claims.
SLFPers loyal to the party are witnessing the current blood-letting within its ranks with dismay. However, most agree that the Rajapaksa faction has also painted itself into a corner, attacking the President personally, thereby leaving little room for compromise and forcing him to act. In fact, some question as to why President Sirisena did not act sooner to discipline the dissidents.
The coming weeks will likely see several other organisers being replaced by Sirisena loyalists, so the purge is set to continue. It is make or break time for the SLFP, but at least now, a decision has been taken by the party leadership and it is being followed through. As to whether this calculated gamble is the correct decision, that verdict can be reached only after the conclusion of the Local Government elections early next year.

Reconciliation delayed, harmony denied
The resolution 30/1 co-sponsored by Sri Lanka in October 2015 prescribes some essential steps that the Sri Lankan government should take for bringing about reconciliation between the two communities, the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities, and durable peace that will ensure the non  recurrence of a state of civil war. I have mentioned below some significant measures the Sri Lankan government has already taken in the process of implementing the Resolution 30/1.
The government has taken all steps to establish the Office on Missing Persons. The relevant bill has been passed by Parliament and relevant gazette notice too has been published. This is a very important step taken by the government because, according to the TNA about twenty thousand people have gone missing and the relatives of missing persons are constantly expressing their mental agony by staging demonstrations against the government demanding the establishment of a mechanism to find out the truth as to what happened to their loved ones.
Bill on Prevention of Disappearances
Another pivotal step that the present government has taken is the drafting of the Bill on the prevention of disappearances. The objective of this Bill is to ensure the freedom of life for every citizen born in Sri Lanka without fear of forcible abduction, disappearance and imprisonment. Sri Lanka has already signed the International Covenant on Convention for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance on December 10, 2015 and the government ratified it on May 25, 2016. For the purpose of giving legal validity to this, the relevant draft bill was gazetted on May 09, 2017 and submitted to Parliament. However, it is unfortunate that the debate on this bill has been postponed, perhaps due to the objections raised by the Joint Opposition stating as the ground that the war heroes will be affected by the implementation of this law.
The government has already drafted the necessary legislation for repealing the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act and substituting this law with necessary legislation conforming to the international standards acceptable to the democratic states.
Framing a new Constitution
The Interim Report of the Steering Committee tasked with framing a new constitution was submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the Constituent Assembly on September 21, 2017. The national unity government which is an alliance of the two major political parties in Sri Lanka, the SLFP and the UNP, has been able to obtain the cooperation of the Tamil National Alliance representing the Sri Lankan Tamil community. After the submission of the interim report in Parliament, the leader of the TNA, R. Sampanthan, expressed his support for making a Constitution within the framework of a united, undivided and indivisible Sri Lanka.
He made reference to the fact that the national unity government deviated from the earlier practice of political parties in power making or amending Constitutions unilaterally ignoring the demands and aspirations of the Tamil community. He said that no constitution has thus far been framed for Sri Lanka on the basis of a substantial bi  partisan consensus amongst its deferent people, in particular the Tamil people, or on the basis of such bi  partisan consensus between the two main parties and other political parties.
The present exercise in Constitution making presents the first such opportunity. A Constitution based upon such a reasonable consensus, would give the Constitution, the basic and supreme law of the country, a legitimacy and credibility which the country direly needs.
Hybrid Courts
Resolution 30/1 also demands from Sri Lanka the establishment of hybrid courts comprising foreign judges for investigating allegations of serious violations of humanitarian law and human rights amounting to war crimes.
The establishment of such courts has become a serious political issue in Sri Lanka since there are some retired military officers who openly support the Joint Opposition stating that this move is an anti-national campaign to insult the war heroes, who have brought peace to the entire country after defeating the most ruthless terrorist outfit in the world. But the United Nations insist that such an investigation is necessary and therefore there is no option but to establish a tribunal for investigating these allegations. However, if the Sri Lankan government takes necessary steps such as including necessary provisions in the new constitution for strengthening the independence of judges and upholding the rule of law and thereby convince the international community that Sri Lanka is capable of holding a credible domestic investigation acceptable to the community of democratic states, there is a possibility of the United Nations waiving the requirement for including foreign judges.
The International Community showing an interest in the reconciliation process should appreciate the extremely difficult task the present government has undertaken specially in view of the propaganda campaign a powerful section of the opposition both within and outside Parliament led by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has launched to topple the whole reconciliation process by toppling the government. This opposition group is projecting the entire reconciliation process as a project designed by the USA and other western states supporting the Tamil diaspora for dividing the country and establishing the Tamil Eelam. They have engaged in a despicable political campaign exploiting the nationalist sentiments of the Sinhala Buddhist community for recapturing power.
They argue that the implementation of the resolution of the UNHRC in Geneva co-sponsored by the Sri Lankan government should be opposed and prevented by toppling the government. The moderate thinkers can understand that the Sri Lankan government adopted the diplomatically rational attitude of co-operating with the International Community after the change of government in 2015, because the leaders of the national unity government realized the harmful repercussions of continuing to adopt a confrontationist approach to the resolutions brought before the UNHRC in Geneva against Sri Lanka. It appears that there is a need for enlightening the average citizens of this country regarding the actual reasons for bringing the resolutions before the UNHRC.
The UN desires genuine reconciliation between the Sinhalese community and Tamil community in Sri Lanka because unless the steps that should be taken by the Sri Lankan government for genuine reconciliation are unnecessarily delayed or ignored for political or any other reasons, recurrence of the state of civil war between the two communities cannot be prevented.

Royal College, Colombo edged out their traditional rivals S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia 3/2 and walked away with the E F C Pereira Challenge Trophy as the 13th traditional tennis encounter between the two schools concluded at the Royal College tennis courts recently.
Now the tally moves to 9/4 in favour of Royal. Royal had won the trophy continuously the first 7 years, before STC recorded their first win in 2012. STC were able to retain the trophy consecutively for two more years until Royal claimed it back in 2015. Last year, once again STC were able to regain some of their lost pride in a closely contested match to grab the victory 3/2.
Victorious Royalists were captained by Mihindu Samarasinghe this year while Avindra Perera, who is the present national junior champion and Davis Cup poolist led the Thomians.
Despite bad weather conditions, the tie got off with the first singles between Davis Cup poolist Avindra Perera (STC) and Junior Davis Cup player Kavisha Ratnayake (RC). The first doubles played between Avika Kelegama and
Dhilvan Herath (RC) against Rakesh Ratnasingham and Akira Perera (STC) ended in a draw.
Avindra pulled off his singles match to push STC into a 1 nil lead at the onset but Royal made it 1/1 with Avika and Dhilvan winning their doubles match.
Both teams were trying hard to break the tie by winning the next two matches, however that too ended in a deadlock with a 2/2 tie with the RC pair Mihidu Samarasinghe and Senal Hemakumara getting the better of Dulitha
Ellawala and Vihan Herath (STC) in the doubles match, while Avindras brother Shivendra (STC) winning a hard-fought battle over the Royal vice-captain Nadil Silva in their singles encounter.

Running Wild in Lanka
An episode of Running Wild featuring Mike Horn and Matt Pokora was filmed in the Samanala Wewa region in Sri Lanka with Eco Team as the official logistics provider. The area which is more than 10km away from human inhabitancy meant that the cast and crew had to trek with all their equipment. The film crew also camped in the great outdoors in close proximity to wild elephants and other animals. To ensure that the smooth operations of filming this episode, Eco Team put together a logistics crew of close to 75 members.
Speaking on this significant feat Eco Team Founder and Chief Experience Officer, Anurudhdha Bandara said efficiency is of high importance in such situations as time and resources are very limited. Food and drinks had to be provided for the crew from a distance of more than six km away, merely on foot and this is no easy task but Eco Team was equipped with the labour, facilities and equipment needed to complete this challenge. In creating an adventure programme watched by millions around the world, Eco Team had an adventure of our own making sure that the team truly experienced Sri Lanka, he said.
First broadcasted in the year 2014, featuring famous High School Musical movie star Zac Efron, Running Wild with Bear Grylls is a survival skills reality television series. It stars world renowned British adventurer, ex SAS and French Foreign Ligonier Bear Grylls who is also known for his television series Man vs. Wild. Throughout the many episodes of the show, Running Wild has featured celebrities such as former US president Barack Obama, Titanic movie star Kate Winslet and award winning actress Julia Roberts.
During their expedition the episodes host Mike Horn, the guest celebrity Matt Pokora and the crew consisting of over thirty members were all in Sri Lanka for the production of this episode.

Loving Vincent: How the worlds first fully-painted feature film took six years to make
Six long years
The animated film of Vincent van Goghs final days in which his portraits come alive meant living Vincent for its painters
If the word unique is overused, particularly when it comes to film journalism, it can genuinely be applied to Loving Vincent. An immersive animated portrait of Vincent van Gogh, the film is set a year after his 1890 death as Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth)  a one-time sitter for the artist  reluctantly peers into the mysterious circumstances surrounding his demise. Was it suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Or something more sinister Like an amateur sleuth, Roulin talks to those that knew the Dutch painter, many of whom featured in his work.
Yet its not this period detective yarn that makes Loving Vincent unique. Using 130 of Van Goghs paintings, sewn together tapestry-like to form the films backdrops, its an ever-morphing canvas that shimmers in front of your eyes. The directors didnt want to make up Van Gogh paintings, says Booth, the young British actor from The Riot Club. They wanted it so all the action happens in the paintings that he painted. Imagine Starry Night or The Night Cafe come alive; its every bit as revolutionary and remarkable as watching, say, your first Pixar movie.
The co-directors in question are British animator Hugh Welchman and his Polish-born wife Dorota Kobiela, a trained painter who first envisaged making an animated short using paint as her source material. After she met and married Welchman  the founder of the Oscar-winning BreakThru Films  they decided to tackle the idea as a full-length piece. Thus, the worlds first fully-painted feature film was born. In essence, the idea was simple: an artist would render a full oil-on-canvas image. That could take between half a day and three days, says Welchman, and then for twelve times for every second [of the film], youre moving the paint.
What this means in practical terms is nothing short of painstaking. For a character, say, who may be turning their head, the head and maybe shoulders will be scraped off the main painting and redrawn  twelve different times per second to simulate movement. Compare that to the relatively simple task of re-modelling a piece of clay, as seen in stop-motion animation, and you begin to understand the mammoth task faced. To give it some numbers, 65,000 individual frames were painted, with 125 artists beavering away across a production that took six years from beginning to end.
Simulating Van Goghs instantly recognisable brushstrokes was also crucial. Its a real dedication, says Booth. They spent hours and hours in the Van Gogh museum studying the application of the paint, the drying times, the texture. The actor shot his scenes two years ago, on rudimentary sets; the basic footage was then used by the artists. They projected every single frame onto a canvas and then they painted over that frame, explains Booth. The artists didnt just come in and trace everything. What they had to do was interpret Vincents style. So you almost feel the texture of the paint. Its so alive.
The filmmakers wanted to concentrate on being in a world full of his words and full of his paintings
Using hundreds of letters written by the painter as a basis for the story, Welchman and Kobiela always felt Van Goghs unconfirmed last days was where their focus should lie. Once we decided to bring his paintings to life to tell his story, then we were bringing to life portraits of people who knew him in his final years, says Welchman. And it turned out that many of these people had conflicting views of him. So it felt more natural for them to be talking about him immediately after his death, because that tends to have the most impact on a group of friends.
The real challenge was to present a different side to Van Gogh, beyond the suffering artist who struggled with his sanity, famously cut off his ear and died in relative obscurity, at the age of 37. The thing that was dramatic for me, notes Welchman, was that in his last year, even his last seven months, hed just started to get the kind of recognition that could give him hope. Hed sold his first painting for a decent sum of money. His work was finally being appreciated by the painters around him, like Toulouse Lautrec, Monet, Gaugin it was obvious that he was going to succeed. It was a matter of time. It just seems so tragic. -Independent.co.uk

SL fast losing competitiveness in regional shipping hub status quest
Sri Lanka is fast losing in competitiveness in the quest for regional shipping hub status as the delay to kick start several development projects in the Colombo Harbour, said Julian Michael Bevis, Senior Director, Group Relations, South Asia, Maersk Line India Pvt. Ltd.
A veteran in the shipping industry for over four decades he said that two years ago government called for expressions of Interest (EOI) for the construction of the Colombo East container terminal (CET) and they too made a bid joining John Keells and an Indian company. We were made to believe that we were a successful bidder but two years later we understand that the EOI in this regard has been disregarded.
Now we understand that the government is going ahead with the Sri Lanka Pots Authority to build the CET but still it is to take off. He said that the development of the CET has to take off soon or Colombo competitiveness in the region would drop.The shipping industry has no loyalty ports in their agenda for transshipment purposes and as soon as there is a better port they will abandon the current port and move in to the next best Port. The delay in building ECT would reduce the competitiveness of the Colombo harbour resulting in delay in clearing which would result in operators moving to other regional ports.
He also said that building the ECT would also create more opportunities for the local logistics sector and create wealth and more employment to Sri Lanka.
We are still ready to invest provided the right cards are laid on the table.
Commenting on India he said the present government has identified Shipping and logistics as a major economic driver and are investing heavily to reap benefits.
He said that they are not keen to move in to Hambantota as they are still unclear about the politics that are going in there. Its a good investment for China since its in their proposed Silk Route initiative.
He said that the Maersk Line, with a presence in Sri Lanka for more than 25 years, continues to invest in Sri Lanka and contribute to its economy by bringing some of the latest and largest ships to Colombo.
As such, Milan  one of the worlds largest ships, will arrive in Colombo on October 17 at the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT). We fully support the vision of the Government of Sri Lanka to develop the country into a maritime hub and are keen on lending a hand to ensure its success. It is with this vision, that we are bringing one of our largest ships into the port of Colombo,he said.

SLFPers  need to unite to face future  elections - Minister Seneviratne
Members and supporters of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) wonder whether the SLFP can establish its own Government in 2020 with the existing differences within the party, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Minister Seneviratne said there is no point of blaming the Joint Opposition because they operate with the permission of President Sirisena. There are a lot of disciplinary inquiries going on against them and there is a possibility that they will not receive nominations. Therefore they will look for another political party to contest future elections. Seneviratne was addressing the SLFP District Convention held in Ratnapura recently.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that every time the SLFP had internal conflicts, it was defeated in the past and the SLFP had to languish in the Opposition for 17 years due to those internal conflicts and issues. Therefore the party is important than individuals and families, he said.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the SLFP should get ready to face LG Polls and all like to see unity within the party. But we cannot wait expecting unity to establish. All decisions in the Joint Opposition are being made by Basil Rajapaksa. No matter who wins the upcoming LG polls, the remote control is in our hands,Amaraweera said.

Sri Dharanee Performance Theatre  - SL's first arts centre for tourists
Sri Lanka's first-ever dedicated performance arts center for tourists is to open on the banks of the historic Diyawanna Oya on the outskirts of Colombo next month.
The state-of-the-art Sri Dharanee Performance Theatre fills a huge vacuum in Sri Lanka's cultural entertainment sector, where tourists will be treated to high quality performances of traditional Sri Lankan dance forms on a scheduled basis.
Located in a scenic spot ideally suited to the arts, the massive facility has been constructed on the lines of similar attractions in cities such as Bangkok, Singapore, and Tokyo.
Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga who was the Chief Guest at a media conference to announce the opening of the performance theatre, noted that it would help "place Sri Lanka's tourism product offering on par with international standards."
Combined with the charm and scenic beauty of the historic Diyawanna Oya, the Waters' Edge Recreational Complex, restaurants and adjacent shopping attractions, Sri Dharanee Performance Theatre will help create a tourism enclave in close proximity to Colombo.
"Today tourists have very few evening entertainment options in the city of Colombo. Other than casinos and a few clubs, there is no quality, wholesome entertainment on offer for tourists. Therefore the Sri Dharanee Performing Arts Center has come in at the right time. I'm sure the quality entertainment lineup that seeks to highlight our ancient history and dance forms will be appreciated by the tourists who visit the city," said Minister Amaratunga.
The Minister observed that the new venture was in line with the Prime Minister's vision to add value to Sri Lanka's tourism product portfolio. "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed that every effort must be made to develop tourism. The fact that this facility will be operational by the end of this month is an added benefit in projecting Colombo as an entertainment hub for tourists," he said.
The Sri Dharanee Center is capable of accommodating more patrons than both the BMICH and Nelum Pokuna and therefore is well placed to host large MICE events. It will provide a platform for local artistes to perform and earn a livelihood while also portraying Sri Lanka's rich culture, history and traditions to foreign visitors.
"I want to thank the Minister of Megapolis for his cooperation and encouragement in making this project a reality. The owning company of this venture must also be commended for showing the way for tourism development in a meaningful and sustainable manner," Minister Amaratunga said.

St Anthonys Kandy looking forward to a good season
A school which has been a major force in school cricket is St. Anthonys College, Kandy. They have not only produced several champion teams but have also produced some of the finest cricketers who have done the country proud by their achievements. One is undoubtedly Jack Anderson who had the unique distinction of scoring five centuries in less than seven games in the 1918 season. He scored a mammoth 291 against S. Thomas College, 157 against Wesley College, 109 vs St. Benedict's College, 189 with Royal College, and 111 against Trinity College. The period of 1916 -1920 can be called the golden era of Antonian cricket. Besides Anderson the other cricketers who have shone brightly in that period were M. Victor Fernando, R.A de Silva, V.

Sri Lanka A meet WI A in second test today:
Stick to the plan to reap success says Ambris
FLORENCE HALL, Jamaica  Sunil Ambris urged his Windies A teammates to stick to the plan when they face Sri Lanka A in the second Test, starting today at the Trelawny Multiplex here.
Ambris hit his fourth first-class hundred of 106 to anchor Windies A to 364 for eight declared in their first innings and pave the way for an innings-and-13-run victory in the weather-affected first Test which ended last Saturday.
We stuck to the task very well and we played as a team in the first Test, he said. The guys were very focused all the way through and it was a total team effort. We just need do the same thing in this game, as we did in the previous match.
We just need to continue to stick to the game plan. Play as a team. Everybody plays the role that they have been given. Do what they know they have to do and have been doing throughout their careers and I think we will be good.
Ambris said there was motivation for every player to want to give of their best in this match, since Windies A lead the three-match series 1-0 and will be looking to wrap up the series with a victory over the next four days.
It would be good for all of us, he said. I have seen articles where the selectors have indicated there are spots in the Test side up for grabs, so if the guys do well, it will be good not only for us a collective group of players, but also individually going forward.
On his performance in the first Test, he said: It was a good innings, but it was not my best first-class hundred.
It was good in the context of the game. I was able to score at a good clip and most of the other batsmen in the match were not able to accomplish the same thing and that helped to set the tone for our solid first-innings total.
On the key reason for his success in the first Test, Ambris said: Just being myself.
I was just trying to be positive and put away the bad balls. Try to play the ball on each merit and score in the right areas. There were times when I had to be patient and grind hard and there were times when I was scoring easily, freely.
On conditions and the challenge of facing up to the Sri Lanka spin attack, he said: t was a good cricket pitch. There was something there for the bowlers, and you bat comfortably on it and trust the bounce, so you could easily put away the bad balls. Once you were prepared to work hard for success, you could achieve it on this surface. Facing up to their spinners was not something that was too hard.
I am accustomed playing spin bowling in our regional competitions. The quality is not too much different. We have good quality spinners in the Caribbean. The key was being patient.
On his preparation and mindset for the second Test, Ambris said: I am always a confident person.
Scoring a hundred in the first Test could only boost my confidence more going into the next Test. I will just try to stay positive, respect the good bowling and put away the bad balls. I take practice very seriously.
I do a lot leading up to games. I practice very hard so it becomes easier for me when I get into the game, so I put in a lot of effort and hit a lot of balls and I plan do the same for the next game.

Tillerson calls for India ties to counter China

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the US wants to deepen co-operation with India in the face of growing Chinese influence in Asia.
He described India as a "partner" in a "strategic relationship", adding the US would "never have the same relationship with China, a non-democratic society".
He said Beijing sometimes acted outside international conventions, citing the South China Sea dispute as an example.
His comments come ahead of his visit to India next week.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump will visita number of Asian countries including China, in November.
Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington,Tillerson said"the United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China's challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighbouring countries and disadvantages the US and our friends".
He also described the US and India as "increasingly global partners" who "don't just share an affinity for democracy. We share a vision of the future."
The secretary of state's remarks came hours after Chinese PresidentXi Jinping's speechat the Chinese Communist Party congress, where Xi signalled that Beijing intended to play a greater role in world affairs.
Xi said that China had now "become a great power in the world", and that the Chinese growth under Communist rule had given "a new choice" to other developing countries.
However, in his speech on Wednesday,Tillerson criticised "China's provocative actions in the South China Sea", saying they directly challenged "the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for".
"China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly, at times undermining the international, rules-based order," he added.
He called on India to play a greater security role in the region, saying "India and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty... and have a louder voice in a regional architecture that promotes their interests and develops their economies."
Following Tillerson's speech, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement that Beijing "will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion, never pursue development at the expenses of others' interests".
It added that China "contributes to and defends the rules-based world order".

Trio offer contradictory and misleading statements: After surrendering to Police
The two girls and a young woman, who had gone missing from Kolonnawa since October 14 surrendered to the Welampitiya and Gampaha Police yesterday, however much remains to be known of the exact reasons they left home, since the trio have been giving misleading statements. Police say they will have to rely on substantial evidence to ascertain their whereabouts.
Based on what we know so far, we can say with certainity that they were not kidnapped nor were they kept against their will during the last five days, said Sampath Sanjeewa, the Officer- in-Charge of the Wellampitiya Police Station.
The two girls surrendered to the police station following the arrest of a 14-year-old boy who had an affair with one of the girls.
Yesterday, 14-year-old Lakshan was arrested by Wellampitiya Police after family members of the girls suspected that he may be involved in the girls disappearance. He was questioned for several hours during which he revealed that he had spoken to the girls on one occasion and knew of their whereabouts. He however denied having any role in their disappearance, citing that he knew them personally and that he had been home during the last five days.
OIC Sanjeewa said that while Lakshan was being questioned, 19-year- old, Malithi Wathsala who is also a mother of an infant and 15-year-old Yasanthi Madushani came to the Wellampitiya Police in a three-wheeler. Upon questioning, Yasanthi told Police that she left home after being chastised by her mother for having an affair with a boy who lived in their flats. Meanwhile, Malithi Wathsala had not provided any conclusive statement of her reasons to stay away from home but added that they were not harmed.
Police say that the duo surrendered after finding out that the boy who was arrested maybe reprimanded by his family or the Police. It is difficult to believe the girls contorted statements as they have cited many reasons, none of which seems sequential or valid.
Fourteen-year old Charithri Chandrasekaram also fondly called Sweta hails from the same neighbourhood and surrendered to the Gampaha Police. She was escorted to the Police station by a woman, whose family members and relatives claim not to know.
Sanjeevi, the mother of Yasanthi said that the girls had not returned home because their captor had confiscated a gold chain that Malithi had been wearing. According to Sanjeevi, Yasanthi and Malithi feared returning home since the captor had pawned the chain. Yasanthi is the sister-in-law of Malithi.
Yasanthi does not own a cellphone and neither do we allow her to leave home unaided. We have a family function next week and since the three girls insisted, we let them go, Yasanthis mother said. They had boarded a train bound for Gampaha from Dematagoda on a joy ride but did not return home. They called us a few times and phoned Lakshan saying that they were safe and we need not look for them. Police were able to trace the numbers which lead them to Gampaha.
Meanwhile, the mother of 14-year-old Sweta who had gone from pillar to post in search of her daughter said that she couldnt comprehend as to why the girl had left home.
We are glad that she is alive and well, she told the Daily News adding that there were many times the families and police feared the worst. The trio were close friends and both Sweta and Yasanthi are schooling. We had no inclination to believe they wanted to drop out from school, elope or run-away from home. Sweta had also contacted Malithis husband saying that they need not search for the trio who were safe.
Police have so far arrested two suspects, the 14-year- old boy from Salamulla and a woman who brought Sweta to the Gampaha Police station. The Womens and Child Bureau of the Gampaha Police on their way to the Wellampitiya Police station yesterday visited a few places to collect CCTV footage since Sweta claimed that they were residing there during the last few days.
Police say that before charge sheets are filed, they will need to rely on substantial evidence to ascertain where they girls had been and the reasons why, since each of them provided contradictory statements.

Trumps fortune slides by $600 m
US: America's richest may be getting richer but President Donald Trump's fortune has slid by $600 million to $3.1 billion, according to a list of 400 billionaires released by Forbes magazine on Tuesday.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates topped the list for a 24th consecutive year on a net worth of $89 billion with Amazon's Jeff Bezos, worth $81.5 billion, number two.
But Trump, the first US president to come solely from the private sector, is ranked 248 -- sharing the spot with 27-year-old Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, the youngest person on the list.
Forbes attributed Trump's decline to a weakening New York retail and office real estate market, and new information about his assets. The Manhattan tycoon ranked 156 in 2016, the year he was elected to the White House. - AFP
Forbes said those on its 36th annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans have a record-breaking, combined total net worth of $2.7 trillion, up from $2.4 trillion in 2016. Entrance to the exclusive club cost a record breaking $2 billion.
There were 22 newcomers, including Netflix cofounder and CEO Reed Hastings. Twenty-six people dropped off from last year, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
There were only 50 women on the list. Alice Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, was the highest ranked at 13. Unlike her brothers, she has focused on curating art rather than working for Wal-Mart.
The biggest gainer in dollar terms was Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, chalking up a $15.5 billion increase in net worth to retain his number four ranking at $71 billion.

## Title: Try Again, Fail Again, Fail Better!
## Supertitle:

Try Again, Fail Again, Fail Better!
Confession: I failed the Year Five Scholarship! I didnt study. I was too enthralled reading all the books on my fathers bookshelves to bother about learning how to solve difficult maths problems especially the ones that said Sunil bought fifty mangoes for five rupees each, how much did he pay for them (I was too busy imagining why Sunil would want fifty mangoes to juggle with the numbers). But the F I got didnt deter me from doing well in all the other exams I sat thereafter, nor did it affect my career (no one at a single interview I faced ever asked me if I passed the Grade 5 scholarship). And so, I figured it really is okay to fail sometimes, so far as like how Abraham Lincoln said, you are ready to rise again.
Especially when most of the influential people in our lives have also cemented their legacy through their failures. When asked about the many thousands of failures he had gone through when he was trying to create the light-bulb Thomas Alva Edison famously said, I have not failed. Ive just found 10,000 ways that wont work. Expelled from high school for being a rebel and a dunce, Einstein went on to become one of the smartest people who ever lived and changed the way scientists - and the rest of us - understand the world. Steven Spielberg was repeatedly rejected by the University of Southern Californias school of theatre, film and television, so he just got on with the job of becoming one of the most successful and important film-makers of all time instead.
Despite being dyslexic, dropping out of school at 16, Richard Branson is worth around four billion dollars today. JK Rowling herself said she was the biggest failure I knew and credits a lot of her success to her failure.
Failure. The word most of us dread. We want to be a success. We want to be admired. But that dreaded word keeps popping up.
According to Joshua Becker in his article, A Positive, Encouraging Effort to Overcome Failure, this is so because life is not always a comedy. At times its a tragedy. To be human is to fail. We know this to be true from almost everything we do. We fail in the small things: staying on a diet, keeping New Years resolutions, or controlling clutter in our homes. We fail in the larger things: overcoming an addiction, finding employment, or holding on to an important relationship and of course, failing exams. And sometimes our failures negatively impact the rest of our lives: keeping a marriage together, persuading a child to make better choices, or giving up studying a subject we love because we failed the first exam.
But in each setback-whether small or large-we find opportunity for growth. And as long as a glimmer of hope remains, we survive.
As far as newly published research goes, telling children that it is perfectly normal to sometimes fail at school can actually help them do better academically. The results of three experiments by French researchers are not definitive but they are intuitive; kids who dont feel overwhelming pressure to do well all the time are more likely to feel free to explore, take academic chances and not fall apart if they make a mistake.
Heres how the experiment was conducted. 111 sixth-graders were all given very difficult anagram problems. A sub-group of the students who were told that learning can be hard and that they should expect to sometimes fail did better on a test measuring working memory capacity than students in two other groups who did not have the same failure-is-okay discussion.
So, being open to the possibilities of failure is not all that bad. Which is why one primary school took the step of sending a letter out to all the pupils receiving their transfer test results - the results that would decide which secondary school they would get into in the new term. Harmony Hill Primary School in Lisburn asked each pupil to read their letter before opening the enclosed test results. Inside the envelope is a score, the letter began. Its a score youve been waiting for, but it might not be the score youve been hoping for. If thats the case, it read, its only natural that you will feel disappointed. We will feel disappointed for you too - but we wont feel disappointed in you, the letter went on to explain. Unfortunately, in life, things dont always work out the way we want them to and it can take a little time to sort out the feelings and thoughts we can have when that happens. We know that each of you has worked very hard and with a great attitude. No score can ever take that away from you. In fact, we believe that your attitude and who you are as a person is much more important than any mark on a test.
Yet, in spite of such comforting words, we all know failure represents the low points in the volatile, messy progression of our lives. This, however, is precisely how life goes. Life is not a nice, linear curve going steadily upwards as time goes by. Instead, its a chaotic progression of successes and failures. Peaks and valleys.
So the best thing to do when we encounter failure would be to process our weaknesses. Socrates once said, The unexamined life is not worth living. This holds true in both success and failure. When failure occurs, which it always will, the wisest of us journey inward to determine the cause and intentional steps we can take to learn from the experience. And in time, we learn to champion humility, says Becker.
Another benefit of failure is that we grow through pain. The way Becker puts it We live in a society passionately committed to avoiding pain. But there is benefit to be found in discomfort. While I would never encourage anybody to intentionally seek pain through failure, it will arise. And when it does, it will be okay. In fact, it will teach us things we could never learn elsewhere: patience and perseverance for example.
So whenever we fail, be it an exam or a relationship lets begin by admitting we failed. Despite the universality of failure, our world goes to great lengths to hide it. People always have and people always will. Our default position too often is to downplay our weaknesses, but if we are to find growth in failure we should begin by simply admitting its existence in our lives.
Once we do this, we will realize failure is common. Because we know all of us experience it, we can find comfort knowing we are not alone in it.
The mantra to remember is that failure is never the end. It is instead, a necessary part of our journey.
Michael Jordan said it best. Ive missed more than 9000 shots in my career. Ive lost almost 300 games. 26 times, Ive been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. Ive failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.  [emailprotected]
-------------------
How to Overcome Failure
1. First, just accept how you feel.
When you have just failed it will most likely hurt. Sometimes a bit. Sometimes a lot. Thats OK. Dont try to push it away by distracting yourself or by trying to push the responsibility onto the rest of the world (if you deep down know that this ones on you partly or fully). And dont try to paint it over with a smile. Because when you let it in and accept it then it will go faster and in the long run be less painful to process what has happened. If you reject how you really feel then those emotions will pop up at unexpected times later on and can make you moody, pessimistic, angry or sad.
2. Remember: youre not a failure just because you had a setback. When youve had a setback its very easy to start thinking that you will always keep failing in this area of your life. Its easy to start thinking that YOU are indeed a failure. Dont fall for such a destructive and sometimes seductive self-fulfilling prophecy.
3. Be constructive and learn from this situation. See it more as valuable feedback and something you can use to improve rather than only a big blow and setback.
4. Remind yourself: anyone who wants to do things of value in life will fail. We often mostly just hear about peoples successes. But the path to those milestones tends to have many setbacks.
5. Move forward again, dont get stuck in mulling this situation over for too long.

Addressing the forum as the keynote speaker and at the backdrop of the IMF reaching a staff-level agreement on the third review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility, the Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that the... ...macroeconomic stabilization of the economy is broadly on track and that the structural reforms implemented over the past two years are showing signs of gaining traction.
The Governor added that the Central Bank is well advanced in putting in place a flexible inflation targeting regime and added, the narrative is that the macroeconomics are improving, you have a tremendous location, you have a shift to a growth model which is capable of giving you more sustainable growth and the policies are being put in place to support that growth model.
The growth framework is being strengthened through action in terms of the investment climate, investment promotion, trade facilitation and trade policy complemented by a pipeline of very ambitious projects. Sri Lanka has raised its ambition because it is now getting support from all corners of the world.

Yaswanth creates history becoming 1st Lankan FIBA delegate
A well known basketball personalty, Yaswanth Muttettuwegama did Sri Lanak proud by becoming the youngest Asian to be appointed as a FIBA Technical Delegate recently. Yaswanth, 32 is the youngest appointee among 20 Asian Technical Delegates appointed by the world basketball governing body. Yaswanth's appointment will go to the annals of local basketball as the first Sri Lankan appointee to hold a high title in the Federation of International Basketball (FIBA). FIBA recently appointed 103 new Technical Delegates worldwide.
An old boy of S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, Yaswanth possessed a star studded school cager career before he entered basketball administration. He was a pioneering member of Hambantota District Basketball Association and serves in the capacity of its vice president from the inception to-date. He was also instrumental in forming one time local cager stronghold, Hambatota Sports Club (HSC) 'Blues' Basketball Club and carries out duties as its vice president from 2010 to-date.
Reaching another significant achievement in Yaswanth's basketball career, he was appointed as the vice president of the local governing body for cager sport, the Sri Lanka Basketball Federation in 2013. He discharged his duties in SLBF until 2015 to uplift the standard of the sport. He has been a committed administrator who worked hard to popularize basketball through out the island and initiated many training programmes aiming at rural schools.
