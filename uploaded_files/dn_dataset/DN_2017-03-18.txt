All AS records should be in electronic format within next five years
Members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service should shift to keep all their records in electronic format within the next five years, adviser to the Media Ministry Piyathisss Ranaweera, said yesterday.
He was addressing the 34th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association held at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa performing Art Theatre delivering a special lecture on the role of the executive offices in implementing the Right to Information Act
He said the executives of the public authority has a major role to play when the Right to Information Act is implemented as they have to guarantee the people's right to information.
He said the executives will have to preserve all the existing records for 10 years and the new ones for 12 years.
"This is not an easy task," Piyathissa said. "The digitalisation is the best option.
Therefore, all have to shift to the electronic format for keeping records within the next five years," he said.

Agreement on main policies needed
There is turmoil in the country, in the political arena. As far as the new constitution is concerned they have appointed six sub committees and a main committee. Reports have come from these sub committees. But in the constitution making, it appears that everything has come to a standstill. Two years have passed but still there are doubts about the new constitution and the devolution of power as the solution to the Tamil national problem. Yet, people have their hopes with the government.
There are so many practical problems in making a Yahapalanaya reality, which people can understand. At the same time they have some suspicion that high ups in the new government are interfering in certain investigations which are going on. They believe that there are deals with the Mahinda groups. They want politicians to keep away from those investigations so that justice can be meted out very soon. That is what the pro government people expect from the government. They hate to see the government doing things in an extremely arbitrary manner.
Development strategy
When there is a lot of criticism about the development strategy, leaders are not ready to discuss them. They say that the government is not willing to listen to the people who brought this government into power. However they say Toppling the government is not possible because constitutionally you need to win the support of the majority in parliament. Therefore we dont see any big obstacle for them to continue until the next election.
However they agree that the government is now not popular among the populace. They are not popular among the Southern Sinhala Buddhist constituency. The Tamils in the North, though not so happy, dont mind this government in power because they cant afford to create a situation where the Rajapaksas come back. Many believe that the government is still at an advantage as its dissenting forces are divided. But the demerits of the government, they say that the people involved in corruption and who were holding high authority were not penalized, but were instead retained in office.
Social political reforms
Many complain The government does not have a good communication strategy. So the positive actions they take are not communicated to the public. Most private media are not favouring the government. They were linked very closely to the previous regime and they continue to support them. Since the government is a coalition of two main parties positives and negatives will have to be experienced.
But there should be agreement on the main policies. It is natural that in both sides there are people who want to have their own government instead of a coalition. That is seen in many aspects. However the President and Prime Minister should be committed to push the main social political reforms together. But that is not seen in the recent period. For example, Land and Police powers should be given to the people of the Northern Province, and in general to all provincial governments. But still there is no general commitment within the government.
MP Athuraliye Rathana Thera said recently We, too, agree on giving Land and Police powers to the Northern community. A national policy should be adopted before the lands are given, as the poor deserve the lands, not the politicians nor any other wealthy men who claim them, he said.
He also said that the armed forces should be kept under the Central Government and administrative powers could easily be transferred to the North. Instead of the khaki uniformed colonialist police personnel in High Security Zones, we could simply deploy police officers clad in white uniforms in the Northern areas without firearms. The war is over. Therefore we can give the Tamil people a police force with civil administrative powers, he said.
In the mean time the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) recently threatened to resort to major trade union action if the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the SAITM issue does not give its final decision within one week.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following a unanimous approval of its Central Committee. He said they also decided to make a written complaint to the President against what they called the political-insanity of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and former Higher Education Minister S. B. Dissanayake on this issue.
Private medical education
He added that they were expecting a justifiable decision on the questioned-standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malambe from the committee appointed by the President.
He said the Health Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry still hold the responsibility of the medical educations standards and stressed that the SAITM was not an institute that has been accepted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). This is an improvement, because earlier they were speaking on private medical education, irrespective of standards. However they did not protest about the medical college at Kotalawala Defence University, which sells education, similar to SAITM. In reality this protest is motivated by Sinhala Buddhist hegemony in education rather than anti private education.
In 88/89 period, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), at the time led by late Rohana Wijeweera, launched a pitiless attack on the NCMC since its inception. Wijeweera had the full support of the chauvinist political parties in Sri Lanka at the time and this issue of the NCMC was a sharp weapon in his hand and Wijeweera used it in his failed attempt to topple the government. Though this time JVP is not involved, breakaway group is using chauvinist mobilization in the present anti government struggle. Hence our democratic revolution too, is closely connected to the national problem.
In fact Russian revolution is a revolution of nationalities. The main problem that separated Bolsheviks from others is the national problem. Hence it is not an over simplification. The greatest contribution of Lenin in this period is his interpretation of imperialism, no doubt. However, in relation to the Russian revolution, most valuable is his thesis on national problem. Same is true for Lankan revolution too.

The US government helped us to get through to the President of Puntland, the semi-autonomous region of Somalia and his Chief of Staff Abdinasir Sofe. We were informed that the gun fire took place on the orders of the President of Puntland. We requested them to stop the gun fire and emphasised that we need to safeguard the lives of the Sri Lankan crew. They agreed to it and within a few minutes we got a call from the ship that the shooting had stopped. We also requested the President of Puntland to remove their boats from that region, but they finally agreed to move the boats a bit far from the ship and to observe the situation, he said.
The Deputy Minister said that the government wanted to ensure a smooth discussion between the ship owners and the pirates.
We were in constant touch with Puntland Presidents office through WhatsApp. They were in continuous communication until the Sri Lankan crew was released, he said.

Geneva and the message of transitional justice
Europe is very much part of the political debate in Sri Lanka just now, not because of the important election result in the Netherlands this week where the far-right candidate who was expected to give a big boost to populism was given a push back, and is the subject of interest in all major democracies. Our interest is in Geneva and the resolution on Sri Lanka in the UNHRC in October 2015, which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, and provided guidelines for peace and reconciliation in this country, with proposals on facing the issue of alleged war crimes in the final stages of the fight to defeat the LTTE.
While Sri Lanka has made some progress on the matters of reconciliation, peace building and understanding among the communities here, there remains much to be done, which is why we have sought two years more to reach finality on the matter. While there are good indications that Sri Lanka will get these two years, the government is now faced with major opposition to its initial co-sponsoring of the relevant resolution, and especially the provision there for the likely presence of foreign judicial personnel on probes into alleged war crimes.
The opposition has got louder than when the resolution was originally passed in 2015, with the emerging signs of divisions within the government, and different views stated by leading members of the unity government on the presence of foreign judges, as suggested. President Maithripala Sirisena has clearly stated he is opposed to the presence of any foreign judges, while the Prime Minister has stated the presence of such judicial personnel is not practical in the current circumstances. The Joint Opposition has been very vocal stating that although such opinions are mentioned today, original resolution was indeed passed with co-sponsorship by this government, and showing that the government is now in a position of not being able to get away from the trap it has taken the country into.
They are wholly silent on why the government had to co-sponsor such a resolution, and take the message of peace, understanding and reconciliation that Sri Lanka was engaged in to the world, in the context of the isolation, the country had faced internationally due to the policies of the Rajapaksa Regime, which failed to build on the success of Sri Lanka in the first UNHRC resolution immediately after the war with the LTTE, and instead was making the country isolated and possibly facing sanctions and other responses by the Western-led international community.
With Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera being the voice of Sri Lanka at the UNHRC sessions in October 2015 and last month, much of the criticism of the government on the original resolution, and the new call for an extension of two years to carry out the work undertaken by Sri Lanka has been directed at him. This criticism seeks to make a bigger picture of the differences within the government, which remain a coalition of the two leading parties, and an effort to show that Sri Lanka remains wholly under the control of Western powers, and unable to carry out any independent policies on the matters of peace building after the defeat of the LTTE.
Mangalas response
The strongest criticism of Minister Samaraweera and the policies with regard to the UNHRC resolution came from Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement titled Constitutional and legal reforms to destroy the nation, which took on the key positions stated by Minister Samaraweera about the need for Constitutional and legal reform to take the country forward towards the goal of peace and reconciliation.
Minister Samaraweera did in fact make a very strong response to this, where he stated the core thinking on the policy of transitional justice, which is the main target of attack by Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO. I quote from his response, which is the most substantial comment by any in the government on the issue of the UNHRC resolution, and also exposing the contradictions of the Rajapaksas, the JO and other critics too on the matter of transitional justice. As he says it:
We believe that we will overcome a painful past by examining it, not by hiding it. We are convinced that we need to put a stop to the cycles of recurring violence that have hitherto hindered our progress as a proud, united country and a united people. We know that truth, reparation and justice are essential, and further, that international jurisdiction over serious crimes only applies when national jurisdiction fails. We are declaring our vision in a resolution before the world to demonstrate that, as an independent, sovereign, and responsible nation, we are fully able to pursue accountability, with our national capacities, and in cooperation with our friends and partners in the international community, thus restoring credibility to our judicial processes and building capacity.
Let me be very clear: the transitional justice mechanisms to be implemented will not benefit one group or community above others, and will certainly not single out and target the armed forces. The former President manipulates the respect that the Sri Lankan people have for the armed forces to hide his own responsibilities. This is opportunistic, and especially ironic, coming from the person who imprisoned the commander who led the armed forces to victory.
Everyone paid a heavy price during the conflict, including our soldiers, with patriotic devotion. It is fitting that all of us Sri Lankans enjoy the benefits of reconciliation including the families of more than 5,000 missing military personnel, and the families of missing policemen whose whereabouts will be sought by the Office on Missing Persons.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, especially as a lawyer, is very well aware that the issue of foreign judges is mere exaggeration on his part, and he does this on purpose to mislead the public. Let us not forget that it was under his leadership that multiple transitional justice processes were initiated, and international prosecutors were engaged. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) established by him engaged foreigners invited by him, and also nominated by Australia, Canada, the European Commission, UK, Japan, the Netherlands, USA, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and a Cypriot nominated by the Government of Sri Lanka. International prosecutors were also engaged in connection with the Paranagama Commission. Moreover, implementation of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution was for the first time made into an international pledge under his leadership through the much touted victory resolution S-11/1 sponsored by Sri Lanka and adopted on 27th May 2009 by the UN Human Rights Council. The resolution welcomed the reassurance given by the President of Sri Lanka that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution, as well as his commitment to a political solution with implementation of the thirteenth amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
Indian Ocean safety
The capture of a foreign ship, flying a flag of the Comoros, with a Sri Lankan crew on it, has raised the issue of security in the Indian Ocean, which is becoming a matter of increased importance to the Asian region. President Sirisena, who participated in the Indian Ocean Rim Summit held recently in Indonesia, would have been apprised of the need for increased joint action by countries of the Indian Ocean region, to ensure the safety of the important sea routes that impact on global trade.
The latest piracy in Somalia gives much weight to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe proposition to hold an Indian Ocean maritime security summit to address emerging threats and consider action against maritime terrorism. He made this proposition during his recent visit to Australia, when delivering the Deakin Law Schools annual oration; he said Sri Lanka was willing to hold such a summit in order to establish ways to promote peace and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.
It was his view that the proposed summit should have the participation of countries located around the Indian Ocean, member countries of the United Nations Security Council and major maritime organisations. He also proposed the introduction of a code of conduct should be for warships sailing in the Indian Ocean.
There is the encouraging news that the Sri Lankans who are held in the pirated vessel are safe, and that the military forces of Puntland in Somalia have initiated action to release the vessel and crew. But, there is also the fact of ransom being demanded by the pirates for the release of the vessel and crew, which makes this a matter for careful negotiation that may take some time, as seen in other such piracies in by Somalians in recent years.
Closer home, the importance of security in the Indian Ocean region assumes increased importance with the increase in international trade, and Sri Lanka is faced with another issue in these waters over the continued entry of South Indian fishermen to Sri Lankas territorial waters, causing much loss and damage to the Sri Lankan fishing community. Any discussions on Indian Ocean security will also have to take up this matter, which has to bring out the best response from both India and Sri Lanka.

Government engaging with minorities to promote reconciliation: Ravinatha
Sri Lankan permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Ravinatha P. Aryasinha said on Wednesday that Sri Lankan government has been engaging with minorities in order to ensure national unity and reconciliation.
Delivering a statement during the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues, Rita Izsk-Ndiaye, Ambassador Ariyasingha said such steps would improve good governance and development while promoting and protecting human rights.
The first ever National Integration and Reconciliation Week was observed from January 8 to 14 2017, with all public officials as well as school children taking a pledge, resolving to work together, hand in hand, respecting the richness of our diversity, to foster peace, understand, and mutual trust, for a new Sri Lanka that is united in its diversity, Aryasinha said.
He noted that the government views culture as an important stepping stone for promoting national reconciliation.
Culture is viewed in the conceptual framework of building peace as well as national development. Efforts are made to protect and preserve the culture and tradition of all communities and to foster inter-cultural understanding.
But more work must be done, he said, and added that, since the government has released land and reconstructed over 11,000 houses, there is an array of issues that the government must tackle.
There are a number of socio-economic issues that need to be addressed such as housing, sanitation, water supply, and other basic facilities and infrastructure including access roads, schools, hospitals and so on to provide durable solutions to the people, he said. Aryasinha concluded his remarks by thanking Rita Izsk, the Special Rapporteur for Minority Rights, for vising the country.
Sri Lanka considers its engagement with Special Procedures as an important component of its reconciliation efforts and steps being taken to uphold the human rights of all her citizens, he said.

Former Minister and MP C.B.

Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Rathnayake said it was an utter lie to claim that they were being sold due to their inefficiency and losses. The CPC earned a profit of Rs.9 billion last year while the Sri Lanka Ports Authority earned a profit of Rs.10 billion.
Therefore, why does the government want to sell these profit earning institutions
The government should be held responsible for any losses incurred by government institutions. We know most of the state institutions are inefficient at present. Are they going to sell them too Rathnayake asked.

Japan holds first civilian missile evacuation drill amid fears of North Korea ballistic tests

Sirens blared and loudspeakers broadcast warnings in Japan's first civilian missile evacuation drill, conducted in a fishing town by officials wary about the threat of North Korean missiles.
The exercise came just overa week after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles into the sea off the country's northwest coast, with one rocket landing about 124 miles from the town of Oga.
Friday's drill played out a scenario in which North Korea had fired a ballistic missile on the Japanese islands.
"The missile is seen to have landed within a 20-km (12-mile) boundary west of the Oga peninsula," a speaker blared during the evacuation. "The government is currently examining the damage."
Residents of the largely rural peninsula jutting into the ocean about 280 milesnorth of the capital, Tokyo, made their way to a designated evacuation center equipped with emergency kits and protective gear.
Schoolchildren in another part of town crouched down to the ground before hurrying inside a gymnasium.
"I've seen missiles flying between foreign countries on television, but I never imagined this would happen to us," said Hideo Motokawa, a 73-year-old who participated in the drill.
Officials said the exercise was prompted by growing concern about the regional security situation.
"Anything can happen these days, and it's even more true when we cannot anticipate the behavior of our neighboring countries," said Osamu Saito, a security supervisor in the prefecture of Akita where Oga is located.
North Korea is also developing nuclear-tipped missiles, in defiance of UNSecurity Council resolutions and sanctions, and conducting nuclear tests in what USSecretary of State Rex Tillerson described during a visit to Japan as an "ever-escalating threat."
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters thatthe missile drill was worthwhile, to help educate the public.
Some Oga residents worried about how they would react in a real attack.
"It's a scary thing," said participant Emiko Shinzoya, 73. "If it did actually happen, I don't think we can do what we practiced today. We'll just be panicked."

Nearly 85 percent of Rajapaksa govts financial needs fulfilled through Treasury Bonds: Minister Gamage
The former Rajapaksa government which levels allegations against the present government over the Treasury Bond issue, had fulfilled its financial needs through issuing Treasury Bonds, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
He said that 85 per cent of the financial needs of the Rajapaksas government had been fulfilled through Treasury Bonds. However, under the present government the Central Bank has issued Treasury Bonds to receive funds only for 7 to 8 per cent of financial needs. He was addressing a media briefing at the Export Agriculture Department, Gannoruwa, Peradeniya recently. The Minister added that the investigations into the Treasury Bond issue is being carried out impartially under the the President Commission.
In line with the ongoing investigations, it will consider whether the process of issuring Treasury Bonds is not profitable to the country anymore and the measures taken to prevent it,Gamage said. He added that unlike the former government, the present government imposes a tax on the vehicles issued for Parliamentarians. Under this, such a vehicle costs Rs 7.5 million will be subjected to tax.

Smoking among Sri Lankans have increased by 15 per cent despite the introduction of pictorial warnings and price increase by the government. What is most amazing is that tax revenue to be paid to the Government by the Tobacco Company had decreased to Rs. 52 billion from Rs. 125 billion even though smoking had witnessed a 15 per cent increase, said Board of Investment Chairman Upul Jayasuriya, speaking after handing over medical equipment and drugs valued at over Rs. 1.5 million to the Maharagama Apeksha hospital yesterday.

The link between politicians and members of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) should be strengthened for the speedy implementation of development projects, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President also said that due to poor coordination between public servants and politicians, most of the funds allocated for various development programmes is sent back to the Treasury at the end of the year.
President Sirisena added that this phenomenon affects the countrys development and regular meetings need to be held tio irin out various issues.
President Sirisena was speaking at the 34th Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Performing Art Theatre. The President also said that mostly the monthly, quarterly and progress review meetings of public institutions, Provincial Development Committees, District Development Committees are not often held due to the difficulty of fixing a day that the politicians could attend.
Therefore, an annual calendar should be prepared fixing the days which do not clash with Parliament and Provincial Council sittings, the President added.
When these problems are overcome, development projects could be implemented and the public will stand to benefit the most, the President said. President Sirisena also said that the government has set up independent commissions introducing the Right to Information Act, Audit Act and many other laws strengthening the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. The President added that governments have provided the SLAS members with the knowledge and experience to render an efficient public service.

Sri Lankan products promoted in Bahia-Brazil
Sri Lanka Embassy in Brazil organized a series of promotional activities in Salvador, the capital city of Bahia, from March 6 to 9 to popularise Sri Lankan products. The GDP in Bahia is estimated to be over US$ 95 billion, the 7th largest regional economy of Brazil.
Sri Lankan Ambassador in Brazil General Jagath Jayasuriya and his team had an exclusive meeting with Governor of the state of Bahia Rui Costa and the key officials of the State Government where discussions were held on ways and means to enhance bilateral relations especially in the trade and industry.
Rui Costa said the importance of exchange of tourism delegations to exploit the untapped potential in the industry.
As an initial step, I wish to visit Sri Lanka with the leaders of tourism industry of Bahia and we would indeed be happy to receive such delegations from Sri Lanka also Costa said.
Ambassador Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka tourism witnessed a robust growth after the defeat of the LTTE terrorist group in 2009.
We had over two million tourists in 2016 but only 1,400 from Brazil. This is due to lack of awareness, Jayasuriya said.
He said several Sri Lankan tour companies would participate in the ABAV International Tourism show to be held in September in Sao Paulo.
Jayasuriya said Bahias emerging middle income market with a GDP per-capita of over US$ 6,000 and a population of 15 million would certainly be an attractive destination for high quality Sri Lankan products such as apparel, specialty food, spices and porcelain andceramic ware.
Association President Luiz Fernando said Bahia was a fast developing state in Brazil due to its strong industry base.
Being the oldest business association in Brazil, we are capable of helping the Sri Lankan companies to get into the market here, Luiz said.
Sharing his views at a high-tea business meeting at the Federation of Commerce and Services (Fecomrcio), which was attended by over 25 businessmen, Jayasuriya said, I am really impressed with the great enthusiasm the business community in Bahia is showing to know about Sri Lanka and its products.
I invite you all to visit the Sri Lanka Pavilion at the APAS Trade Show to be held from May 2-5 in Sao Paulo where more than 10 Sri Lankan companies are expected to display a range of products including Ceylon Tea and Coconut Products.
The main product promotional programme held at the Hotel So Salvador was attended by over 30 identified leading businessmen based in Salvador. Commercial Counsellor Premathilake Jayakody enlightened the gathering on the Sri Lankan export products using product specific videos and presentations.
The array of product samples displayed at the venue provided an ideal opportunity for the businessmen to feel a bit of the outstanding quality of Sri Lankan products and also to taste Ceylon Tea.
Speaking at an investment promotion meeting organised by the Federation of Industries of Bahia, Jayasuriya said, You consider whatever the prerequisite you would think of for your investment - be it the location, infrastructure, ease of doing business or even the access for utilities and services for that matter - we are the number one in South Asia.
He highlighted infrastructure, food processing, tourism, technical education and logistics as few of many highly potential sectors in Sri Lanka for investors in Bahia.
Ambassador Jayasuriya and his team paid a visit to the Industrial Park of Camaari, which is the home for many leading industries in Bahia. Sharing his views with the industry people, Jayasuriya said many industries in the industrial park provided promising opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters who were engaged in export manufacturing, especially auto parts.

A wise decision
The decision taken by Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to place a cap on the age for Driving School instructors, at 60, is a welcome move. So is the decision that henceforth only those driving instructors approved by the Department of Motor Traffic would be allowed to train learners. The Minister, speaking to Driving School owners, the other day, also observed that it would be ideal if politicians too retire at the age of 60. If that be the case, none of those now in the saddle of power, or those aspiring to come to power, would have to bow out. Why, even the Minister, himself, who once entertained Prime Ministerial ambitions would have to call it quits.
Addressing the annual conference of Driving School owners, at the BMICH, the Minister said it would be compulsory for all driving school instructors, to henceforth, possess a license issued by the Department of Motor Traffic. This was after it was found that many driving instructors did not possess a license to train learners and also that those who had undergone training at the hands of these unlicensed instructors were found to have been involved in serious road accidents due to their lack of knowledge of road rules and signals. Today, with the heavy volume of vehicles entering the country, and the increase in the mobility of people, driving schools carry on a thriving business. What is more, with the mushrooming of these driving schools, almost at every street corner, there is fierce competition for custom. In the process, standards have been thrown overboard, with profit, the driving force of these driving schools. In addition, the competence certificates issued by these driving schools to obtain driving licenses are suspect and of a dubious nature. Hence, as per the new directive, an instructor who has the endorsement of the Department of Motor Traffic will be a safe bet and as a result hopefully the rate of road accidents could be cut down and valuable lives saved.
The Minister should also devise a method to ensure that those behind the wheel are fit for the task. Today, most accidents occur due the drivers not being medically fit or having reached an age where their reflexes are found wanting. A majority of the vehicles involved in accidents are the long haul ones, travelling from interior of the country to the city, most often the night and the tendency for the driver to fall asleep during the trip has led to a number of major accidents, with these heavy vehicles sometimes plunging down ravines or onto houses. Hence it would be advisable to lay down a maximum age limit where a driver could sit behind a wheel.
True, most drivers work well into their old age to support their families and sometimes are the sole breadwinners of their families. Hence imposing such restrictions could create other problems and could also draw protests. However the larger picture should be gone into, taking into consideration the mounting incidences of road accidents, that, more often than not, snuff off lives and render families orphan. Of course, driving under the influence of liquor is a matter outside the Minister's scope and is dealt by the law enforcement. But the Minister has the power to rein in the private buses who have today become a law unto themselves. The President of the Private Bus owners Association Gemunu Wijeratne is on record stating that there is a large proportion of private bus drivers who are drug addicts and obviously are stoned while at the wheel. The Minister should try to ascertain who these addicts are and withdraw their licenses. If the Minister is driven by the responsibility of saving lives by ensuring that only those who are competent by official endorsement can be driving instructors, by the same token, he would be saving a lot of lives by ensuring only those who are truly fit , in every sense, are allowed behind the wheel in the private buses.
The Minister should not be intimidated by the strong arm tactics of the private bus mafia. He should also comedown hard on overcrowding and rude behaviour of private bus crew towards passengers. Some time ago, a hotline was given to the public travelling in private buses to report speeding and uncouth conduct by the bus crew. We are not aware if this scheme is still in operation. He should also take steps to improve facilities at stopover spots by private buses, for the convenience of the passengers. Presently, there are complaints that the eateries that cater to the exhausted passengers are squalid and food served unhygenic. Even the toilet facilities are much to be desired. He should also take steps to renovate main bus stations, some of which are crumbling from neglect.
The Minister, known for his no-nonsense stance, recently won the praise of the travelling public for resisting the disproportionate fare hike demanded by the private bus operators and hopefully he will not be a victim in the contemplated Cabinet reshuffle that is being bandied about these days.

Writ petition filed seeking legal action against KP fixed for support
A writ petition filed by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian Vijitha Herath seeking an order to institute legal proceedings against LTTEs former Leader of International Wing Shanmugam Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP was yesterday fixed for support on August 10 by Court of Appeal.
The Attorney General had earlier informed Court that the Terrorist Investigations Division (TID) has commenced a comprehensive investigation against KP under three Acts including the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Penal Code, and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act over his alleged terrorist involvements.
In his petition, JVP MP Vijitha Herath sought an order for KPs arrest and the institution of legal proceedings against KP, who was appointed LTTE leader in 2009.
The Court was informed that there are about 193 serious allegations against KP in the writ petition including arms procurement and money laundering charges. The Court of Appeal had asked the AG to announce what kind of legal action had been taken against the former LTTE arms procurer.
The Police Chief, the Defence Secretary, the Controller of Immigration and Emigration, the Army Commander, the Kilinochchi Security Forces Commander, the TID Director, the Attorney General, and Kumaran Pathmanathan were cited as respondents.
The petitioner sought an interim order directing the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent KP from leaving the country until the final determination of this application.
Herath said KP also known as Kutti Master was chief international arms procurer for the Tamil Tigers and was appointed as the head of the LTTE by its elusive leader Velupillai Prabhakaran just before he was killed by army troops in 2009.
He said Indias Central Bureau of Investigations (CIB) had named KP as a key suspect in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by a Sri Lankan Tamil suicide bomber during an election rally in Tamil Nadu.
Mr. Herath said KP was responsible for equipping the LTTE with modern-day arsenal which enabled them to challenge the Sri Lankan military and to fight an intensive war.
He said he had learnt that KP was operating a social service organisation  the North East Rehabilitation and Development Organisation (NERDO) and the Sencholai Childrens Home while being under protection of the Sri Lankan Army.
Herath said, in terms of the information provided to the public by the Sri Lankan Government, KP has committed offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Penal Code, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Emigrants and Immigrants Ordinance.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana appeared on behalf of the Attorney General. Senior Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma appeared for the petitioner.
