Attack on Walallawita DS unacceptable
It was reported that the Walallawita Divisional Secretary, who had investigated the allegations of illegal sand-mining in the area, was assaulted by a suspect, Kalutara District Development Committee Chairman and Ports and Shipping Affairs Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said the incident had allegedly taken place in the presence of three police constables
He was replying to a query raised by Kalutara ASP Upul Nilmini Ariyarathna at a District Development Committee meeting organised by Kalutara Government Agent U. D. C. Jayalal, which was held at the Kalutara District Secretariat auditorium, recently.
"All sate officers should have the freedom to carry out his or her duties, without being influenced by any person. I consider this incident an attempt made by certain elements, to disrupt the services provided by the government," the minister said.

Lanka among top five fastest growing tourism markets
GlobalData has ranked Sri Lanka as the fourth fastest growing tourism market in the world. Iceland, Japan, Hungary, Sri Lanka and Chile have been listed as the top five fastest growing tourism markets in the world for the period between 2017 and 2021.
GlobalDatas Tourism Potential Index provides a ranking of 60 major developed and emerging markets around the world to assess potential growth opportunities in the tourism sector.
The list is compiled using a ranking based on forecast average annual growth in international arrivals and the forecasts are based on factors such as capital investment, GDP and disposable income in main source markets.
Sri Lanka, which came fourth on the list, has obtained a score of 52.8 while achieving a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.7%. The score of Iceland Iceland, which topped the list, stands at 39.1 with a CAGR of 11.7%.
GlobalData has also assigned star ratings to each of the 60 nations surveyed, ranking them in terms of tourism potential from very low to very high.
The star rating is based on four elements of potential: significance (20%), competitiveness (20%), attractiveness (35%), and convenience (25%) to give an overall percentage score out of 100. No country achieved a five-star rating this year, an accolade awarded to Singapore and Switzerland last year, which were both said to have very high potential with few barriers to expansion or demand.
Sri Lanka is the only four-star rated country in the top 10. GlobalData says Sri Lanka is expected to experience fast growth in the future. GlobalData adds that Sri Lanka is investment-friendly and has improved its road and air infrastructure significantly.

Prisons intelligence unit failed to control narcotics use in prisons
Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorala said she had decided to disband the prison intelligence unit as it had failed to control the use of narcotics inside prisons and inmates coordinating crimes with the use of mobile phones.
The continuation of prison intelligence unit cannot be justified if inmates have access to narcotics and mobile phones in the prison and continue to engage in crimes she said speaking to Journalists after a UNP council meeting in Ratnaputa recently.
The Minister said she had received a number of complaints about the intelligence unit and added the department too had failed to take action at times based on the units findings. While noting that the intelligence unit of the prison has been unable to control the wrongdoings inside the prison, the minister said she no saw reason to continue with a unit which has failed. The minister said she will soon take a decision whether to continue with the prison intelligence unit or not. On implementing the death penalty, the minister said the government has not arrived at a final decision. She said more information was needed to arrive at a final decision on inmates who have continued their illegal drug business after being sentenced to death for drug offences. First we have to compile a list of prisoners who have been sentenced to death for drug offences. Then we need to get records with regards to their cases from the Attorney Generals Department. After this we will decide about the next step she said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the recruitment of a hangman to the Prisons Department, the minister said several individuals had come forward for the job and some have said they are willing to do it even without any payment.

SL key component of Belt and Road Initiative
Sri Lanka is a key component of Chinas 21st century Maritime Silk Road with the Hambantota Port and Colombo Port City as the two flagship projects of cooperation between China and Sri Lanka under the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said.
In a statement released by the Chinese Embassy in Colombo on Friday, Cheng said the Belt and Road Initiative was a major initiative proposed by the Chinese government and was aimed at upholding the global free trade system and an open world economy.
He said under the consensus reached by leaders of the two countries, China-Sri Lanka economic and trade cooperation will inject new vigour to Sri Lankas economic and social development and enable development initiatives to better benefit its two peoples.
Cheng further said that in November, China will hold its first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, which is the worlds first import-themed expo and a major measure of China to further open its market to the world.
He said Sri Lanka attaches great importance to this event and will send a high-level delegation to China.
Sri Lankas black tea, rubber, gems textiles and other products will come to Shanghai, exhibiting the charm of Sri Lanka to the huge Chinese market. We believe that our traditional friendship will continue to deepen on this new platform, the ambassador said.

Tourism marketings future based on online marketing
The future of tourism marketing would be based on online marketing said Chairman Sri Lankan Tourism Promotions Bauru, Kavan Ratnayake.
Speaking at the launch of the e-marketing platform for travelers from all around the world last Thursday in Colombo he said that in Sri Lanka too this trend is spreading.
He said that more emphasis should be given to capture business from this online screen.
Managing Director, World Travel Centre, Sudharma de Silva said that presently 25% to 30% of incoming tourists to Sri Lanka and outgoing tourists from Sri Lanka make their bookings online. We believe these figures would be 70% online and 30% offline in about three years time and as such it is important to prepare ourselves to face the future demands by offering more online options.
This is why we introduced another innovative travel product e-marketing platform for travelers, (www.pickmyjourney.com) from all around the world and one of the specialties in this system is the availability of all travel products to the online user, be it air ticketing, worldwide hotels, worldwide tours, transport. The most important uniqueness in the system is availability of Seat in Coach Tours and sports tours.
Though Seat-in-coach tours is fairly new concept in Sri Lanka these tours are operated all over the world including countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand and they are supposed to be Sri Lankas main competitors and nearly 50% of their tours are operated on SIC basis also due to many reasons Sri Lanka has a huge potential to develop the tourism industry by combining with sports.
Pick My Journey (PMJ) will be an essential tool in future to travelers as the concept is most likely the cloud - platform containing private and fixed holiday packages.
The system will help to sustain and up growth the tourism industry of Sri Lanka as the concept to make a Sri Lanka a business hub in the tourism industry.
He further said they have introduced this system to use as a tool to mitigate the risk of losing existing business and business opportunities.
Whilst targeting the individual online users, PMJ also focused on agent markets by providing special agent platform, where the agent can tailor made package according to customer need.
As the product from Sri Lanka and owned by a Sri Lankan, the product will be valuable to Sri Lanka tourism. (SS)

Amazon delivers record quarterly profit
Amazon has reported record quarterly profits helped by a rise in online sales and demand for its cloud services. Profits hit a record $2.53bn (1.9bn) in the three months to the end of June - about 12 times more than it made during the same period last year.
Sales rose by 39% to $52.89bn, slightly less than analysts had been forecasting. Amazons shares jumped more than 3% in after-hours trade.
It was a strong quarter, said chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky. What I attribute it to is continued strength in some of our most profitable areas.
At the firms lucrative cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, sales were up nearly 50% year-on-year to $6.1bn. Amazon is also starting to attract more money from advertising.
Revenue from the firms other category, which includes advertising, more than doubled to about $2.2bn.
Retail sales in North America were healthy as well, rising about 44% to almost $32.2bn.
Recruitment slowed in the quarter. Amazon is also starting to reap the benefits of previous infrastructure investments, allowing for less rapid spending growth, Olsavsky said.
Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer at GBH Insights, said Amazons profitability appears to be accelerating faster than expected.
That, he wrote, will be music to ears of investors who have stood by Amazon and its famously long-term approach to deferring profit in favour of reinvesting in the company.
Amazon is expected to account for roughly half of online sales in the US this year, according to research firm eMarketer.
The company told investors that it expects third quarter sales in the range of $54bn- $57.5bn, growth of 23% to 31%. BBC News

E. A. Ariyapala
An asset to community
I learnt the sad news of the passing of my former colleague E. A. Ariyapala recently.
We had worked at the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (previously named the Ceylon National Chamber of Commerce) for 28 years. He had joined the Chamber before me as a teenager and when I left in 1996, he was still in service.
I believe that throughout his 40 years of service, he worked with dedication, manning important income-generating services of the Chamber, along with other activities.
I felt it was my duty to see him finally depart, but had difficulty in finding his residence in the interior of Pannipitiya.
When I finally did reach it, I was fortunate to have been able to participate in the last rites, while offering him a silent prayer. It was an emotional farewell for me.
Ariyapala looked peaceful, calm and prepared to make his last journey to the undefined beyond.
He had apparently had a premonition of his mortality. At the get-together the former staff of the Chamber had held in June, 2017, he had told the organiser of the function that he would not be around for the next get-together.
Ariyapala had reason to be contented with the life he lived as it was a blameless one. He was a devout Buddhist, a loyal family man, a good friend and colleague, as well as a dedicated officer. He was indeed, an asset to the community.
Ariyapala and I met for the first time in 1969, when I joined the Chamber as an Assistant Secretary. From the outset of my employment, I felt that he was well-immersed in the work of the Chamber.
We then had a small secretariat at the head of which was John Rodrigo, an intellectually-inclined and able official who was a part-time political activist. He was also the Mayor of Negombo at the time.
Given the post-independent liberal atmosphere, the private sector showed commendable progress. As a consequence, the Ceylon National Chamber too, gained strength.
Throughout those early times and during my career there that ended in 1996, we had the fortune of having some outstanding leaders of private enterprise at the helm of the institution, in the form of its office-bearers and the council.
It was the combination of the former and a professional secretariat, that guided the destinies of this great institution.
However, back in 1970, both Ariyapala and I watched with concern, the country's political developments. We witnessed a strident cry against capitalism and its concomitant private enterprise system. This ultimately won mass appeal and led to the electoral triumph of the socialists.
We feared that the private sector, especially the segment that genuinely contributed to the country's growth as well as its pivots such as our Chamber, would face tough times ahead.
However, what followed was somewhat of a deviation from the above.
The new government at the time, despite being anti-private sector, was also aware of its efficiency and its role in areas such as export trade and industry. Thus, it could not be dispensed completely. The private sector also had an able defender in the form of John Rodrigo, who was elected to the National State Assembly in 1970.
At the stage of the Chamber's history, it reached a status of high importance. John had powerful ministers as friends who called at the Chamber and sought economic data.
It was at this point that he frequently requested Chamber staff to ferret out such data from the library. In this task, Ariyapala played a useful role.
During the following years, the Chamber initiated new services and further expanded its areas of operations such as measurement certificates on export cargo, issuance of customs statistics, while expanding its panels of surveyors.
Ariyapala had a hand in all these areas of work.
In order to meet the needs of a diversifying base, the Chamber recruited fresh staff. All of them were university graduates, and some of our work went into economic research.
John Rodrigo left the Chamber on being appointed Ambassador to Italy in 1973. Theo Seneviratne then succeeded him as the secretary. In 1983, I took over from Theo for 13 years as the Head of the Secretariat.
It was during that period that I became fully aware of the excellent qualities, including the loyalty and faith in the system of administration demonstrated by E. A. Ariyapala.
By that time, he was well into the intricacies of Chamber work and had proven to be a capable assistant who intermingled with his superiors with the ease of a seasoned player, which indeed, he was.
Before I end this appreciation, I need to mention that on my return to the place where I had parked my vehicle after the funeral, I realised that Ariyapala had lived his last years in idyllic surroundings. As far as the eye could see, it was a vast sheet of greens, ideally suited for a man of peace such as Ariyapala.
May his sansaric journey be peaceful and short.

Dr. Malcolm Mendis
Gentleman par excellence
It is with grief that I pen these few lines about Dr. Malcolm Mendis, who was a good friend of my father Mervyn Perera. It has been 28 years since he entered eternal glory to be with his maker. His death anniversary fell on July 15.
Dr. Mendis hailed from a respectable Catholic family in Moratuwa. He was the elder son of Maurice Mendis, a reputed lawyer of high integrity. His brother Derrick gave up a lucrative career as a chartered accountant to don the Jesuit garb, while his only sister Charmaine, joined the religious order of the Sisters of Perpetual Succour.
Dr. Mendis, after completing his education at St. Sebastian's College, Moratuwa, entered the Ceylon University from where he joined the Ceylon Medical College. He then passed out as a dental surgeon and served the public for over 30 years in various dental clinics in the island.
His last station was his hometown, Moratuwa, at the De Soysa Memorial Hospital.
Dr. Mendis carried out his professional duties with meticulous care, in a spirit of self-sacrifice and dedication. He treated both the poor and rich alike and had an abiding interest in the welfare of all his patients.
At dental clinics, he was sought after by patients who were confident of his painless extractions.
His genial qualities and winsome ways were endearing to all. He always stood for truth, justice and charity, and was a man of peace who always strove to diffuse goodwill, harmony and amity to everyone around him.
He was a gentleman par excellence and was a genius at making friends. He was always cultured, bright and cheerful. He always played the role of a good Samaritan to the underprivileged.
His outlook on life was broad and philosophical. His noble thoughts transcended the barriers of caste, creed and religion.
May hosts of angels lead thee to paradise!

Rita Perera
Devout Catholic
It is with profound sorrow that I write a few words in appreciation of my mother Lidamulaga Rita Catherine Perera (nee De Silva), who passed away peacefully on July 10, 1998. She was 63 years old at the time of her death. This year was her 20th death anniversary.
My mother was the youngest in a family of three that hailed from Polkotuwa Road in Rawathawatta, Moratuwa. She was the daughter of Gradiyawasam Lidamulage Elarian John de Silva and Annie Margret Fernando.
Her only brother, L. Francis Joseph Silva (Chandra), later retired from the local government service. My mother and loku amma were more friend than sisters.
My mother married K. Joseph Mervyn Perera (my father) of Frazer Avenue, Moratuwa, late in life. He retired as a timekeeping clerk at the Colombo Port Commission (now the Sri Lanka Ports Authority).
After my fathers' death in 1987, when my siblings and I were still young, my mother took much interest in providing us with a sound education.
The last time I saw her; in December, 1997; was at my brother Ranjan's wedding. She was a devout Catholic who always prayed at the nearest church. She never failed to carry out her daily religious observances, while attending Holy Mass at St. Sebastian's Church, Moratuwa.
My mother's demise was a big loss to all of us, particularly to her only daughter and loving sons.
May her soul rest in peace, is my humble prayer.

Argentine Heras found guilty of match-fixing
BUENOS AIRES, Friday: Argentine tennis player Patricio Heras has been found guilty of match fixing and suspended until his punishment is confirmed at a later date, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) said on Friday.
The 29-year-old, who reached a career-high ranking of 269 in September 2013, was found to have contrived the outcome of a match at the ATP Challenger event in Barranquilla, Colombia in 2015.
Following an investigation by the TIU, Heras case was considered by independent anti-corruption hearing officer (AHO) Jane Mulcahy QC at a hearing in London on April 6 this year.
Having now been found guilty of the charges, he will be sanctioned at a future date to be determined by AHO Mulcahy, TIU said in a statement.
The TIU added that Heras had also failed to report corrupt approaches in August and September 2015.
It said details of the decision on Heras sanctions will be made public when received.
Until that time, and with immediate effect, Heras is not allowed to compete in or attend any sanctioned events organised or recognised by the governing bodies of the sport.
Heras is currently ranked 306 in singles.
Two other Argentine players  Federico Coria and Nicolas Kicker  were also found guilty of breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program in May.  Agencies

ASPI fails to retain momentum
The Bourse ended the week on a negative note as the ASPI decreased by 37.18 points (or -0.60%) to close at 6,153.99 points, while the S&P SL20 Index also decreased by 40.06 points (or -1.18%) to close at 3,360.37 points.
Turnover and market capitalization
JKH was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 0.21Bn or 18.97% of total turnover value. Hemas Holdings followed suit, accounting for 17.42% of turnover (value of LKR 0.19Bn) while Central Finance contributed LKR 0.08Bn to account for 7.23% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 1.10Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 2.14Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.28Bn (-35.63% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.43Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.60% W-o-W (or LKR 17.40Bn) to LKR 2,881.71Bn cf. LKR 2,899.15Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 41.46% (or LKR 0.46Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Hemas Holdings & Richard Pieris which accounted for 91.95% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 28.74% (or LKR 0.32Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Central Finance, Commercial Bank and Sampath Bank which accounted for 66.89% of the sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 11.84% (or LKR 0.13Bn) to the market driven by Distilleries, Lion Brewery and Nestle which accounted for 82.43% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 30.98% (or 13.42Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 0.46Bn.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 22.62% to total turnover volume as 9.80Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 0.32Bn of total market turnover value.
The Hotels & Travels sector meanwhile, contributed 5.47Mn shares (or 12.62%), amounting to LKR 0.01Bn.
Top gainers and losers
Adam Investments was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 50.0% W-o-W from LKR0.20 to LKR0.30 while Blue Diamonds [NV] (+33.3% W-o-W), Tess Agro [NV] (+20.0% W-o-W) and Nation Lanka (+14.3% W-o-W) were also amongst the top gainers.
Hunas Falls was the weeks highest price loser; declining 21.9% W-o-W to close at LKR70.20 while Sathosa Motors (-18.9% W-o-W), Paragon (-17.0% W-o-W) and Horana Plantations (-15.9% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.

In terms of volume Richard Pieris & Central Finance led foreign purchases while Distilleries & Hemas Holdings led foreign sales.
In terms of value Central Finance & Commercial Bank led foreign purchases while Hemas Holdings & Distilleries led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets reversed two-consecutive weeks of positive momentum as the broad-share Index slipped ~37 points while average weekly market turnover declined 36% W-o-W to hit a 14-week low.
Index losses stemmed largely from greater selling pressure, but improved foreign buying helped avert steeper losses on the Index.
The foreign equity sell-off that has persisted for 6 consecutive weeks eased this week, helping stem losses on the benchmark ASPI. Net foreign inflows to the CSE totaled Rs. 23Mn this week, relative to the net outflows of Rs. 105Mn last week and Rs. 221Mn the week prior.
Despite this weeks net foreign buying, foreigners have consistently sold off domestic risky assets over the month of July, resulting in a net foreign outflow of Rs. 1.2Bn for the month.
Inflows to domestic equity markets have been volatile this year, tracking the broader global theme of waning risk appetite for EM/FM assets since Feb18 as global financial market volatility has heightened amid worsening US-China trade tensions, the cooling Chinese economy, foreign currency volatility and tightening global market liquidity.
The YTD net foreign outflows from the Colombo bourse has consequently amounted to Rs. 2.8Bn, a stark contrast to last year when net foreign inflows for the comparable period totaled Rs. 25Bn.
Equity market performance over July meanwhile, continued to remain sluggish for the 3rd consecutive month, losing 0.7% over July to add to the loss of 4.4% recorded in Q218.
The losses over Q218 and the month of July are in contrast to the gain of 1.7% recorded over Q118, and the 6.6% gain recorded in the comparable Jan-July period in 2017(ASPI has lost 3.4% between Jan-Jul18).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues both from global market developments and results from the June quarter corporate earnings releases.
National inflation rises amid fuel price increases
National inflation levels in June rose in line with urban inflation levels, with headline NCPI rising to 2.5% Y-o-Y from 2.1% Y-o-Y in May 2018.
While urban inflation levels in June (4.4% Y-o-Y in Jun18 cf. 4.0% in May) were driven mainly by non-food inflation (5.0% Y-o-Y in Jun18 cf. 4.2% Y-o-Y in May18), urban food inflation levels declined 2.9% Y-o-Y from 3.3% in May18. June inflation levels at the national level however were driven by both food and non-food inflation, with higher NCPI levels in June primarily attributable to the 0.5% Y-o-Y increase in food inflation (0% Y-o-Y in May18).
Higher transport costs on the back of the upward administered price revisions to petrol, diesel and bus fares meanwhile, increased non-food inflation which rose 4.2% Y-o-Y in June18 relative to 3.8% Y-o-Y in May18.
Despite headline national inflation rising on a point to point basis, NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased from 5.7% in May 2018 to 5.3% in June 2018.
However, NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, increased marginally to 1.8% Y-o-Y in June 2018 from 1.7% Y-o-Y in May 2018.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas external sector performance in May18 was modest, with the trade deficit (although expanding over the month), expanding at a slower pace as export growth outpaced import growth.
In terms of current account service inflows meanwhile, although Tourist earnings continued to increase, workers remittances declined during the month.
Inflows to the financial account of the balance of payments (BOP) meanwhile moderated, with net outflows from G-sec markets and a reduction in net inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Sri Lankas gross official reserves at the end May 2018 consequently stood at $8.8Mn while the LKR depreciated by 3.3% by end May 2018 and 4.5% YTD.

Baker dazzles in 100m backstroke at US swimming championships
IRVINE July29, 2018: Kathleen Baker sliced more than half a second off her personal best to win the women's 100m backstroke at the US swimming championships in a world record of 58.00sec on Saturday.
Baker had been gunning for the Kylie Masse's world record of 58.10 ever since she finished runner-up to the Canadian at the World Championships in Budapest last year.
That was another silver medal performance for Rio Olympics runner-up Baker, and just more motivation for a swimmer who now has her sights set on breaking through the 58-second barrier.
I put a goal on my phone so it reminds me every day and right now it's a 58.10, Baker said. I just broke that, so now I'm going to put 57.99 down. Baker, who shared 200m backstroke gold with 16-year-old Regan Smith this week, led a podium that featured three women under 59 seconds with 50m back winner Olivia Smoliga second in 58.75 and Smith third in 58.83.
Hers was the first world record of the five-day championships, which serve as a qualifier for both the Pan Pacific Championships next month in Tokyo and the World Championships in South Korea next year.
Baker said she fed off the energy of Katie Ledecky -- who stirred up the crowd as she briefly pushed world record pace on the way to a 400m freestyle victory in 3:59.09. But it took her a moment to realize what she'd accomplished.
I was looking to see if I won first, and then I realized I went 58.0 and I was shook, she said. I was like 'Oh my gosh I just broke a world record!' While there was no world record for Ledecky, her distance dominance was on full display as she shredded 400m field. On pace to break her own world record of 3:56.46 through the first 250 meters, Ledecky professed herself satisfied with a time under four minutes, with expectations she'll improve at the Pan Pacs coming up in less than two weeks.
It's always good to go under four (minutes), said Ledecky, who touched 3.12sec ahead of runner-up Leah Smith. Haley Anderson was third, 8.12sec behind.
Ledecky 'in a good spot'
I wanted to put myself through some pain tonight, said Ledecky, who added the 400m free title to convincing victories in the 200m and 800m freestyles.
She was skipping the 1,500m free on Sunday, opting instead to get back to training for a few more days before heading to Tokyo for her first major international meet since turning pro in March. I haven't really had an off swim, Ledecky said of her season so far. I feel like I'm in a good spot. World record-holder Lilly King won the 100m breaststroke in 1:05.36, with Katie Meili finishing second in 1:06.19 and Micah Sumrall -- the surprise 200m breast winner -- third in 1:06.34.
The men's 100m breast went to Michael Andrew, the former age group sensation who says his first goal in the senior ranks is to dominate the sprint distances in all four strokes.
Andrew, 19, was fifth at the turn but powered home to win in 59.38sec.
It's huge, said Andrew, whose victories in the 50m breast and 50 fly hadn't secured his Pan Pacs berth.
In a duel of the past two Olympic champions, Ryan Murphy edged Matt Grevers in the 100m backstroke.
Murphy, double gold medalist in Rio in 2016, completed a sweep of the 50m, 200m and 100m back in 52.51sec. Grevers, the 2012 100m backstroke gold medalist was second in 52.55. AFP

Becoming a breastfeeding friendly nation
The National Breast Feeding Week will take place from August 1 to 7 island-wide with several programmes. This year's theme will be `Breast feeding; Foundation of Life'.
According to Health Experts, among evidence based interventions to reduce child morbidity and mortality, breastfeeding is an important intervention which also significantly improves nutritional status, health and cognitive development of infants and young children and protects children and mothers from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs).
According to UNICEF Health and Nutrition Officer, Dr. Dhammika Rowel, breastfed infants develop confidence and their IQ level increased over 10 points. The brain of a child grows during first three years in his/her life and breast milk helps them to become confident, energetic and healthy adults.
According to the Consultant Gynecologist, Dr U.D.P. Rathnasiri (MBBS, MS, FRCOG (UK), breastfeeding reduces the risk of developing Postpartum Depression (PPD) in mothers and not breastfeeding can lead to various complications when the milk get collected in breasts. Breastfeeding also cuts down the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers.
According to the Consultant Neonatologists attached to the Neonatology Units of State Maternity Hospitals in Colombo, infant formulas available in the market have several negative impacts on infants who consume them. Infants who are fed with milk powder have a higher chance of facing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and have a lower IQ and cognitive development.
According to them, the risks of developing childhood cancers, asthma, ear infections, respiratory infections, dental problems and malocclusions, digestive problems, sleep apnea, iron deficiency anemia and allergies is high for the infants fed with milk powder. The infants fed with milk powder have a higher risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity when they become adults.
But the infants fed with breast milk get the chance of having milk that change day by day week by week, month by month according to the requirements of their bodies, the medical experts said.
****
Expressed breast milk can be kept in the room temperature for 6 hours, in the lower compartment of the refrigerator for 24 hrs and in the deep freezer for one month. Small cups with lids can be used to store breast milk. Before storing the cup should be labeled with the date and time of collection. A wide mouthed cup can be easily cleansed with soap and water. Stored breast milk should thaw in a pot of warm water before feeding the baby.In order to maintain her lactation, breastfeeding mothers should put the baby to the breast whenever she is with the baby and night feeds should be continued. While she is at work at least every 3 hours mother should express breast milk.
****
Early initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour is very important to the baby as it provides many benefits. It has been found that about 25 per cent of newborn deaths can be averted by early initiation of breastfeeding.The baby will get much needed colostrum when fed early and colostrum provide perfect nutrition, immunity that protects from infections and factors that help in maturation of the gut. For the gut maturation, the growth factors secreted with breast milk is essential.
****
The mothers who do not breastfeed their babies are at risk of developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, hypertensive and cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, overweight and obesity.

Bernardo Silva scores twice as Man City rallies to beat Bayern
MIAMI July29, 2018: Pepe Guardiola finished Manchester Citys US tour with a deserved 3-2 victory over former club Bayern Munich, but his evening was soured with an injury to new signing Riyad Mahrez.
Two goals from substitute Bernardo Silva helped Manchester City come from 2-0 down to end a run of two defeats in this International Champions Cup campaign with youngster Lukas Nmecha scoring in between.
Mahrez, however, went down twice with what looked like an ankle problem. He was eventually forced off after just 27 minutes and looked in discomfort.
With the traditional English season opener - the Community Shield - taking place next Sunday at Wembley against Chelsea, coach Guardiola will assess the Algerians fitness as the start of the Premier League campaign looms into view.
Meanwhile Guardiolas squad flew back to Manchester at the end of the Saturday match.
Citys opening games against Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool had both ended in narrow defeats, but with Guardiola opting for familiarity -- eight players in the starting lineup here had begun all three games of this US tour -- it was another young side full of running.
We analyzed our mistakes in the previous games and did it better against Bayern Munich, said Guardiola. We were able to play good and overcome the situation when we were 2-0 down. Bayerns main men Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery looked dangerous on the ball, yet with Mahrez afforded plenty of space in midfield the English champions dominated the early stages and really should have opened the scoring.
Mahrez, who had already spent a few minutes getting treatment after being challenged, sent German-born City striker Nmecha through only for his shot be saved by Sven Ulreich.
It wasnt long before Nmecha had the opportunity to make amends as another classy through ball from Mahrez set him free, but this time he was denied by the post.
That was to prove a costly couple of misses because on 14 minutes, Bayern were ahead.
Finds space
The lively Rafinha found space on the right and his cross was headed in by Meritan Shabani.
It was a good team goal and on 23 minutes, Ribery and Robben combined for number two. The French midfielders lofted through ball found the Dutchman in the area and his two touches - one to control and one to expertly lift the ball past Claudio Bravo - were top class.
And all of a sudden, a difficult evening for Guardiola darkened on 27 minutes when Mahrez was forced to leave the field with an injured ankle.
We will see, maybe it is not a problem, said Guardiola.
The Algerian limped off to be replaced by Portuguese midfielder Silva, who scored the goal his teams display had deserved on the stroke of half-time.
The former Monaco star ran unchallenged 25 yards out and produced an excellent low, curling finish leaving Ulreich with no chance.
The Bayern keeper was being kept busy and on 51 minutes, he was picking the ball out of the back of the net once more after Silva fed Foden and when his curling shot was parried, Nmecha was on hand to steer home from close.
No-one could begrudge this young City side a share of the spoils, but the game was turned on its head with 20 minutes remaining.
A first City appearance for 17-year-old Spanish attacking midfielder Adrian Bernabe quickly resulted in a third goal for Guardiolas side. The former Barcelona youngster teed up Silva who wriggled clear in the area before drilling low past Ulreich for the winner. AFP

Beruwala receives pre-stressed concrete tank
With the aim of upgrading and improving the water supply to the surrounding towns in the Beruwela area, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) extended assistance to construct a Pre-Stressed Concrete Tank (PC Tank), which was opened recently.
The tank was inaugurated by City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem and Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Kenichi Suganuma.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne also participated in the event. Others who participated were JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Fusato Tanaka, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary D. G. M. V. Hapuarachchi, National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Chairman K. A. Ansar, NWSDB General Manager Deepthi Sumanasekara and officials attached to the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
JICA supported the construction of the PC tank at Beruwala by leading Japanese private company Abe Nikko Kogyo Co. Ltd. The companys experience and unique technologies, and proven track record in the construction of over 5,000 PC tanks in Japan, had earned a high reputation.
Abe Nikko Kogyo had developed the technology of PC tanks in 1957 and is the pioneer of PC tanks, currently possessing 60 percent of the share of PC tanks constructed in Japan.
Utilising funding provided by the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL), the National Water Supply and Drainage Board had also implemented the project component, that is, the upgrading of transmission mains from the Kethhena Water Treatment Plant and the upgrading of pump houses in Beruwala and the Darga Town, in parallel with the PC tank construction.
These interventions have now improved the service level of over 40,000 existing water supply connections by ensuring a reliable 24-hour supply. Additionally, these interventions also enable another 20,000 new water supply connections in both the Beruwala and Darga town areas.

Better air connectivity will boost Eastern Province economy - PM
Better air connectivity was needed to boost tourism and the Eastern Province economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday, predicting that the East will soon get a new domestic air service.
Already, four companies have voiced interest in setting up a domestic air service in the east, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of several new buildings for the Batticaloa Manmunai Pattu and Eravur Divisional Secretariat offices. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that a domestic air taxi service will be a tremendous boost to tourism in the area and added that hotels and other facilities too will have to be expanded in order to meet the growing demand.
The Premier said the government has identified transport as a major obstacle to further improve tourism in the East and added that with the development of the Mattala airport and a domestic air service in the East, this can be overcome.
Presently, tourists mainly visit the East from June to October. With the expansion of transportation and other facilities, we can make East a tourist hub throughout the year, the Prime Minister said.
While recalling that in 2015, the government had to take over a debt ridden economy due to the economic mismanagement of the previous regime, the Premier said the government was compelled to increase taxes to pay the massive loans taken by the previous rulers.
The Prime Minister said the countrys economy was on a better footing now and the government was able to spend money on development.

Brightest stars of silver screen
Names call to mind people, bring in associations and waft in memories. The Sarasaviya Film Awards is a familiar setting for many of the seasoned stars of the past and a dream and a vision for raising young artistes in the cinema industry. Spearheaded by Sarasaviya, The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limiteds cinema weekly, the only surviving cinema tabloid in the country, the Sarasaviya Film Awards not only spell glamour and grandeur but also boasts of quality for its selections.
This year Cargills has stepped forward as the main sponsor of the 34th edition of the event. Titled as the Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards, the event will unfold at the BMICH on August 3 at 6 pm, setting the stage for a starry night.
Throughout the years many figures have born the responsibility of putting the star-filled event together. The responsibility of seeing the success of the awards ceremony till the end mostly rests on the Sarasaviya Editors shoulders. The glittery night that many a film fan has witnessed has been the result of tireless hours of hard work and dedication. We spoke to some of the former editors of Sarasaviya magazine on making memories in the movie scene.
****
Aruna Gunaratne (2010  present)
This is the second Sarasaviya film Awards that I will be staging as the Chief Editor of the magazine. I joined the Sarasaviya editorial in 1989.
The biggest challenge that we face this year is in staging a film awards under an individuals name. This year Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards has been dedicated to the globally renowned filmmaker and doyen of Sinhala cinema the late Dr Lester James Peries. Dileepa Abeysekara is in charge of the script of the film festival.
Since we will be presenting awards for 2018 and 2017 separately, a large number of awards will be handed over at this years event. We will also be presenting the Most Popular film, the Dr Lester James Peries Award for the best mainstream film, the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Award for film criticism, and two Rana Thisara Lifetime Achievement Awards.
The Sarasaviya Film Awards returned to the stage after a seven year hiatus in 2016. Due to the long break between the festivals we had to change certain aspects linked with the event to suit the present setup.
The past Sarasaviya Awards Festivals has recognized the contribution of foreign artistes who have worked to enrich our film industry. The Best Actress Award was won by the leading lady of Prasanna Vithanages Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka Anjali Patil in 2016. Mike Wilson won the Best Director award for Getawarayo in 1966 and Dylan Okada won the award for the best cinematography for Janelaya in 1985. Indias Shaker Prasad and Tapas Nayak have won the award for best sound design.
Film is one of the prominent media in the world which does not have any social, ethnic or regional boundaries. Even though these artistes are not Sri Lankan born, they have contributed in enriching our film industry. They have gone to win international awards later in life. In such instances they will also be recognized as recipients of the Sarasaviya awards. The Sarasaviya award will be embedded in their cinema history.
We want more young filmmakers and artistes to make their presence at the Sarasaviya Film Festival. The Sarasaviya Film Awards is already on par with international film festivals. My wish is to see it going global and making its presence in foreign soil as an international festival some day.
****
Gamini Samarasinghe (2006  2010)
I was the Chief Editor for two Sarasaviya Film Festivals. One of my main goals was to give life to the Sarasaviya Film Awards because the awards ceremony has not been functioning for many years. We also wanted to present a function par excellence.
The Sarasaviya Film Awards is considered as the peak event in the countrys art calendar. Artistes are so eager to take part in it. One of the significant events which occurred during my time was that we were able to take some of the film included in the Sarasaviya Film Week out of Colombo to areas such as Kurunegala, Matara and Kandy. The Acting Chairman during that era, Sarath Kongahage, and Deepthi Fonseka, Minoli Subasinghe and Hemali Wijeratne who were in my editorial staff helped me tremendously in organizing the 31st Sarasaviya Film Awards in 2007.
Another noteworthy fact about the Sarasaviya Film awards is that we do not have any contact with the jury after they have been named. Unlike other awards functions which host dinners for the jury, we only meet the jury again on the stage of the awards function. Therefore the decisions are made purely by them without any influence from outside.
I have many happy as well as a couple of sad memories linked with the festival. Susil Gunaratne took part in the show in Kurunegala just before his death. Nilmini Tennakoon too met with her tragic accident while she was taking part in the Sarasaviya Film Week.
I managed to lead the arrangements for the 32nd Sarasaviya Film Festival in 2010 based on my previous experience. Ashirvadini Hettiarachchi and Champa Warushapperuma supported me a lot in this task. Many prominent artistes like Malani Fonseka, Swarna Mallawarachchi, and Prof Sunil Ariyaratne called and congratulated me on holding a successful awards ceremony in such a short span. Many journalists dream is becoming an editor in a cinema magazine. I was privileged to turn that dream into a reality. It is a great responsibility. Artistes are particular about certain matters  even the seating arrangements. So we have to organize it in a manner to please everyone.
I took part in the 33rd Sarasaviya Awards Festival. One of the highlights of that event was when they invited the past editors of Sarasaviya to present the awards. I believe that is one of the good qualities in the present Sarasaviya editor Aruna Gunaratne.
There are two memorable moments for me linked with the Sarasaviya Film Awards. One is when Uresha Ravihari won the award for Best Female Playback Vocalist back to back for three consecutive years. Only Nanda Malini had achieved this feat before her. I can still remember the joy I witnessed in Ureshas face when that announcement was made. Sangeetha Weeraratne won the Best Actress and the Most Popular Actress awards for Uppalawanna in 2007. She had won both these awards before for acting in Aswesuma. Only Malini Fonseka has won both awards together twice before.
I remember meeting Padmasiri Kodikara at one of the film shows we held for Sarasaviya Week in Kandy. There was a good looking youth with him. Later when Kodikara was searching for a face to take on H R Jothipalas character for Sada Adara Jothi I remembered that youth and proposed him for the role. He is Kodikaras son, Vishwanath, who has become a star today.
****
Deepthi Fonseka (2003  2005)
I have seen two Sarasaviya Film Awards being staged during my stint. I joined Lake House at the end of the 1980s as a journalist in the Sarasaviya editorial. Later I was promoted to the deputy editor post and then I became its editor.
We staged one of the most glamorous Sarasaviya Film Awards in 2003. Indian director Mani Ratnam was the guest artiste. Adoor Gopalakrishnan was the guest artiste for the event held in 2004.
I was in charge of the first Sarasaviya Film Awards which was held outstation in 2005/2006. We held a cinema discourse for school children. It was a challenge to stage the same kind of awards ceremony we have held in Colombo in Kandy. However there was a lot of hype about it and people flocked to see the artistes coming to take part in the event. Some were even brought to the venue on elephant back!
I am grateful to Sunil Horesh, Ranjith Kumara and Thilakaratne Kuruwita Bandara for all their help. I am also thankful to my husband, Upali Fonseka, who was the official photographer for Sarasaviya. He has taken pictures of the most number of Sarasaviya Film Festivals.
One of the sad memories I have linked with the festival is the untimely death of our freelancer Sunil Horesh. He was equipped with immense knowledge about the industry. Another is the death of Susil Gunaratne.
I coordinated the artistes for the 33rd Sarasaviya Film Festival. I also coordinated them for the programme on the Sarasaviya award winners that we shot. I was also the coordinator for the jury for the Sarasaviya Film Festival held in 2016 and this year as well.
I was the first female editor of a cinema tabloid in Sri Lanka. Around 20 years of my career was spent in Sarasaviya and one important thing I noted was the unity in our team. The staff organized the Sarasaviya Film Awards A to Z.
****
Anura Bandara Rajaguru (2000  2003)
I was a sub editor at Sarasaviya before I became its editor. We relauched the festival after about six year by introducing some new awards: the Ranapala Bodhinagoda Award for film criticism and an award for the best comic act. We also hosted a film festival without the participation of a single politician during my time. All the invitees were artistes. Stars performed live on the stage first time for an awards function at the event too. Sangeetha Weeraratne and Bandu Samarasinghe took part in one of the acts. This concept has become popular today as they hold shows like Ridee Reyak.
The situation of the industry was totally different then. Today at a time when the Sri Lankan cinema industry is at the brink of crisis it is encouraging to see that an awards festival of this caliber is going to be held again.
****
Thilakaratne Kuruwita Bandara (1994  2000)
I headed four Sarasaviya Film Festivals when I was the editor of Sarasaviya magazine. There was a high respect for the jury even then because the credibility of the festival rested on their shoulders. The Chairman of the first jury was Wimalasiri Perera, the founder of Sripali. M J Perera, Piyasena Nissanka, Charles Abeysekara, and Nandadeva Wijesekara comprised the rest of the judges. I wanted to introduce new faces to the jury so we brought in Punyasoma Hettiarachchi, Nandasena Ratnapala, Prof Nandadasa Kodagoda, Upeksha Chitrasena, Kusum Dissanayake etc. I also felt that some of the newer artistes have been chosen to be given the Rana Thisara Award over the veterans. So I managed to felicitate artistes like Herbie Seneviratne, G S B Rani Perera , Ruby de Mel and Titus Thotawatte during my time.
The Sarasaviya film festival is the oldest ongoing film festival in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan cinema is facing a crucial stage today and the industry needs the full backing of a tabloid like Sarasaviya.
****
A D Ranjith Kumara (1989  1994)
I joined Sarasaviya in 1969 as a senior sub editor. However I was one of those who were privileged to witness the first Sarasaviya Film awards at Asoka cinema in 1964 from the gallery. We were schooling then and we went to the film week not only to watch films but see the stars as well. All the shows were housefull. The stars would come to the venue on the red carpet. We used to reach out just to touch them because we were so enchanted by their sight.
The celebrities arrived for the awards night on an open stage constructed in the back of a truck. This was called Tharaka Yanaya (Star Vehicle). I can still remember Jeevarani, Udula Dabare, Florida Jayalath, Clarice de Silva in their glamorous attire waving at the fans. A film magazine bumper issue was handed out for free during the occasion.
I used to dream of having a job in a cinema magazine. So as soon as I have done my G C E Advanced Level examination, I went to meet Ranjith Wijewardena. I was put in the Dinamina editorial first but I made a request to be a part of Sarasaviya.
Sandya Kumari won the most popular actress award during my time and we carried her love story in one of our issues. Joe Abeywickrama used to reply to the questions posed by his fans. We had drawings on the cover of the magazine too. I wrote many middle page articles. Whenever an artiste had something new to tell the public they would tell it to Sarasaviya first.
Sarasaviya and another Lake House magazine called Janatha was in charge of organising the festival then. We carried coupons asking the fans to select which films should be screened during the film week. Gamperaliya, Sikuru Tharuwa, Ran Muthu Doova, Suhada Sohoyure and Suvineethala Vani were selected to be screened. We also played the Sarasaviya song which was penned by Chandraratne Manawasinghe and sung by Pandit Amaradewa. A special Sarasaviya Film Magazine consisting of photos from the awards was also issued after the event. Bollywood stars like Sunil Dutt, Meena Kumari, Nutan and the editor of Filmfare magazine have graced the event. Joe Abeywickrama, Irangani Serasinghe, and Sarasaviya editor Wimalasiri Perera too took part in the Filmfare Awards later.
I have taken part in 19 Sarasaviya Film Festivals in my life and had been the organizer of some of them. I feel blessed to have been a part of it.

Chocolate milk - best for post workout recovery
From protein shakes and BCAAS (branch chain amino acids) to electrolytes, many gym buffs are adamant about taking special sports drinks to help them recover from their workouts.
But a new study has confirmed that there may be a much simpler, more effective and delicious option: chocolate milk.
In fact, according to the research from Shahid Sadoughi University in Yazd, Iran, chocolate milk not only allows exercisers to work out for six minutes longer than the average sports recovery drink, but also improves heart rates and lactic acid levels, which causes cramp.
Chocolate milk contains carbohydrates, proteins and fats, as well as water and electrolytes, all of which are crucial when it comes to post-exercise recovery.
The researchers analysed 12 existing studies in which about 150 total participants had drunk chocolate milk after completing exercise tests such as running or cycling. The participants were then measured for various markers such as heart rate, lactic acid level and tiredness.
It was found that chocolate milk was either more or equally effective as placebo or other recovery drinks, although the researchers note that further studies need to be undertaken to draw definitive conclusions.
Chocolate milk contains carbohydrates, proteins, fats, flavonoids, electrolytes, and some vitamins which make this drink a good choice for recovery in athletes, said study author Dr Amin Salehi-Abargouei.
The take-home message is that chocolate milk is a low-cost, delicious and palatable option for recovery and provides either similar or superior effects compared with commercial drinks.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (30-07-2018)]
Think twice before executing
This is in sequence to the letters of Cat Kumarage and R.M.B. Senanayake and sensible contributions made by the other citizens to this column. Please let our President to decide to do it purely on a trial basis for two years for murder committed in the future from a given date. In absence of positive results we can withdraw it.
As a form of mitigation, if the victim has been unarmed and innocent, capital punishment should be carried out. Best example is the present day self-styled rape and murder and gang shooting in robberies.
Our government owes an explanation and a justification to the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, European Union and the six nations openly raising their objections. We should solicit forbearance from all of them as we want to do it only in the case of killing innocents and not for contributory participation and that too on a tentative trial basis. Surely all of them will withdraw and prudently uphold our view.
If the victim too has contributed to a certain extent, say by involving in a quarrel or heated argument and not avoiding when he could have apparently done so, it should be viewed differently. Contributory participation does not make the victim totally innocent. Nevertheless, the tendency is there to fabricate false evidence to transform an active participant into an innocent artificially. Therefore, so much caution should be exercised to prevent such misrepresentation.
It was reported in the daily press (Sinhala) on July 7 that during past six months 214 murders have been committed - more than one murder a day!
It is all commonsense that if a man knows that if he kills another man, he too will have to pay back with his own life, he will think twice before plotting to kill. There is definitely a deterrent effect and no sane and honest person can deny it.
Killing a man is as simple as cutting down a tree. People are killed for simple reasons like jealousy, land disputes, personal and political grudges, non-payment of a personal loan, robbery etc. This issue has come up to the most dangerous proportion warranting much more severe punishment than now.
Those who are objecting keep their eyes closed until the crime is committed and then open their eyes only after the killer has accomplished his deadly mission. Then they start talking in sympathy with the murderer but not a word about the innocent dependants. This issue should be viewed in the correct perspective of a constructive step in the direction of preventing a deadly crime. Please let our President explain all these facts very clearly and emphatically to everyone opposing and present a motion to the Parliament to implement death penalty for killing unarmed innocents, taking case by case and not if the victim has contributed to the act of murder as stated above. Video recording clips and graphic presentations of gang shootings are shown on the TV screen and they look like cow-boy pictures and should be shown to the aforesaid international organizations as well.
It looks as if killing so fancifully is also a Human Right in our beautiful country.
The killer knows that even if a few dozen people are killed and then judgment is given for him to be hanged until dead, he has a guarantee from one side that he will be facilitated to live his full span of life with free food and lodging and Jail Guards protection at state expense. On top of it, they also get sympathy from international and local organisations. Some of our politicians are there to shed Crocodile Tears in public.
Please let the intellectual citizens put due pressure on the government collectively to promote this motion.

Does facebook need a Constitution
In a lengthy interview, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attempted to explain to Recodes Kara Swisher why his platform wouldnt ban Holocaust deniers:
[A]t the end of the day, I dont believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I dont think that theyre intentionally getting it wrong, but I think 
Swisher: In the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.
Its hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly. Im sure you do. Im sure a lot of leaders and public figures we respect do too, and I just dont think that it is the right thing to say, Were going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times. What we will do is well say, Okay, you have your page, and if youre not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive.
I wont impugn Zuckerbergs intent here, even if I dont quite understand it, but its worth nothing that Swishers question was really just a more contentious version of the question posed last week by CNNs Oliver Darcy, in an on-the-record meeting between the megaplatform social network and a group of media reporters: Given Facebooks stated commitment to ending its misinformation problem, why hasnt it banned the extremely popular official page of Alex Joness notorious conspiracy clearinghouse Infowars As Facebook put it in a tweet a day after the meeting: We believe banning [pages like Infowars] would be contrary to the basic principles of free speech.
This answer (like Zuckerbergs riff on Holocaust denial) wasnt particularly satisfying to people. In a hearing on Tuesday, congressional Democrats posed more or less the same question: How many strikes does a conspiracy theorist who attacks grieving parents and student survivors of mass shootings get Representative Ted Deutch asked.
Its hard not to be sympathetic to Deutch here, and not just because his district includes Parkland, Florida. Infowars has, among other things, claimed that the Sandy Hook shootings were a staged false flag event, that Democrats were planning on launching a civil war on July 4, and that the government is putting chemicals in the water that are turning frogs gay. At the very least, setting banning aside, it seems less than ideal to allow a publication like that to represent itself on Facebook as a News & Media Website.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based Lion Brewery (Ceylon) PLCs National Long-Term Rating at A+(lka). The Outlook is revised to Stable from Negative. Fitch has also affirmed the National Long-Term Rating on Lions outstanding senior unsecured debentures at A+(lka).
The Outlook was revised to Stable because we expect Lion to be able to maintain leverage (defined as lease-adjusted debt net of cash / operating EBITDAR) at less than 3.0x over the medium term. Lion was able to improve its net leverage to 2.7x as of March 31, 2018 (FYE18) from 6.3x at FYE17, helped by the recovery in sales volume and operating profitability. The recovery was underpinned by a revision in excise taxes, which was announced in the Sri Lankan governments budget on November 9, 2017. The revised regime taxes alcoholic beverages with lower alcohol content at reduced rates compared to spirits. Fitch rates Lion on its standalone strength due to weak linkages between Lion and its ultimate parent, Carson Cumberbatch PLC, in line with Fitchs Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria.
Lions A+(lka) rating reflects its leading market position in the domestic beer industry, which is protected by stringent regulation, a well-established brand and extensive retail coverage.

GMOA bracing for another strike
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will strike on next Friday (August 3) if they do not receive a positive reaction from the President before Friday, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing the media at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening.
He said the GMOA did not receive any response from the President for the letter they sent to him for the second time stating their 10 demands.
Dr. Aluthge said the copies of the letter were sent to all ministers and officials including the Prime Minister, Health Minister, Education Minister, Higher Education Minister, Finance Minister, Public Administration Minister, and International Trade Minister.
The GMOA will educate people on their demands from today (30) through awareness programmes and joint committee meetings, he said.
Not updating DAT allowance as promised, not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education, not responding to the proposals by doctors to ammend tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of them reasons that are leading to the strike, he said. Signing Singapore FTA, delaying holding elections for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMC's functions, not solving grade promotions issues of doctors, not granting schools for doctors' children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service overlooking Public Service Commission and ignoring relevant rules and regulations are the other reasons, he said.

Govt. doctors DAT allowance increased
The government has decided to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance paid to government doctors from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 50,000 in respect of MBBS qualified doctors and to Rs. 60,000 in respect of Consultant government doctors,
The decision was made following discussions a GMOA delegation had with Finance and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, a Treasury spokesman said.
Accordingly, all 18,000 government doctors will be entitled to receive this allowance.
The increased spending on this item would pose additional challenges for the Treasury to find revenue to meet its cost, he said. However, there has been no proper transparent procedure in the payment of the allowance so far, he said.
A spokesman for the health sector said that even though the allowance is paid to all doctors at present, there is no proper system available to ascertain whether a doctor had engaged in call service.
The allowance was warranted in the past due to the war situation in the country, he said.
The Treasury which denied GMOA allegations that the new Inland Revenue Act would be detrimental to government doctors said only a doctor earning over Rs. 350,000 per month would be required to pay the 24 er cent tax on the earnings.
A doctor would have to engage in private practice to earn over Rs. 350,000 per month. Government doctors not engaged in private practice will have to pay a maximum of 14 per cent tax under the new Inland Revenue Act.
A government doctor gets a Rs. 3.6 million tax free vehicle permit. A doctor entering government service at the age of 30 years and retiring at the age of 60 would have received tax relief amounting to six times of Rs. 3.6 million.
It was the ordinary people who had to bear the cost of these tax relief measures offered to doctors, he said.
Moreover, the GMOA is only interested in minimum qualifications for entering private medical education without taking any interest in improving the quality of private medical education, he said.

Budapest, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton strengthened his push for a fifth world title by increasing his championship lead to 24 points on Sunday as he claimed a convincing victory for Mercedes in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
The defending world champion came home 17.123 seconds ahead of title rival and fellow four-time champion Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari after the German had survived a collision with Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes.
That came on lap 65, of the 70, when Vettel finally passed Bottas, the Finns right front wing touching his rear left tyre under braking, wrecking Mercedes hopes of a one-two finish.
Kimi Raikkonen finished third, his fifth podium finish in a row, in the second Ferrari ahead of Daniel Ricciardo who surged from 12th on the grid to fourth for Red Bull ahead of Bottas, who finished fifth after a late pit stop.
It was Hamiltons record sixth win in Hungary, his fifth this season and the 67th of his career.
"We came here knowing that the Ferrari would be really quick this weekend," said Hamilton. "But to come out with these points, we'll definitely take as a bonus. What a beautiful day and a great crowd  and a great job from the team." AFP

Heavy blow needed to halt horrific human traffic flow
Today is World Day against trafficking of persons. Established in 2013 by the United Nations General Assembly the event is marked globally on July 30. The observance focuses on raising awareness of human trafficking and the importance of stopping it.
Trafficking of persons is essentially the trade of humans. International conventions condemn it as a grave violation of human rights. The purposes of trafficking in humans include, but are not limited to, sexual slavery, commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, servitude, forced marriage, removal of organs among others. Almost every country in the world is involved in trafficking, whether as a country of origin, destination or transit for human trade victims.
Trafficking in persons involves an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving a person through the use of force, coercion, fraud, deception or other devious means, for the purpose of exploiting them. A recent report commissioned by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) states that in Sri Lanka men, women and children are trafficked primarily for labour, commercial sexual exploitation, including domestic child sex tourism.
There are also growing concerns about trafficking for employment to the Middle East, Singapore and other countries for jobs in domestic work, construction and factory employment. The demand for cheap labour for 3D jobs  Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning  fuels trafficking in countries such as ours.
Sri Lanka is primarily a source and to a lesser extent, a destination country, for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking. Certain Sri Lankan men, women, and children who migrate to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Afghanistan to work in the construction, garment, and domestic service sectors are subjected to forced labour.
Before leaving Sri Lanka, many migrant workers fall into debt to pay high recruitment fees imposed by unscrupulous labour recruitment agencies  most of them members of Sri Lankas Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies and their unlicensed sub-agents. Migrant labourers receive a monetary advance as an incentive to move abroad, only to be trapped in debt bondage upon arrival at their destination.
Some recruitment agencies commit fraud by changing the agreed upon job, employer, conditions, or salary after the migrants arrival. Some Sri Lankan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Jordan, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere.
Sri Lankas two million migrant work force has been a blessing for the economy of our war-torn nation. Indeed they are the heroic army battling on the economic frontlines providing significant support to the countrys balance of payments. Although our island nation receives a huge amount of foreign exchange from agricultural and industrial products, garments, tourism, gems and jewellery industries, the foreign exchange directly received from Sri Lankan migrant workers surpasses them all.
Last year alone, their remittances topped a staggering US$7.5 billion in foreign exchange to the countrys coffers. In essence, the government depends increasingly on resources that come directly and indirectly from migrant workers. But the cost in human terms seems horrific. Women represent roughly 60 percent of Sri Lankas growing migrant work force.
Most of them work in the Middle East as housemaids. Their problems are numerous and linked to their gender. In several host countries they face sexual and physical abuse as well as economic exploitation and in many instances with no access to judicial recourse or proper legal representation.
The International Labour Organization estimates that 21 million people are victims of forced labour globally. This estimate also includes victims of human trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation. While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently, there are millions of trafficking in persons victims in the world. Almost a third of all human trafficking victims worldwide are children, according to the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons released in December 2016 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Women and girls comprise 71 percent of human trafficking victims, the same report states. The UN plan calls for integrating the fight against human trafficking into the UNs broader programs to boost development and strengthen security worldwide.
The UN resolution also states that trafficking in persons, especially women and children, constitutes an offence and a serious threat to human dignity and physical integrity, human rights and development. Despite sustained measures taken at the international, regional and national levels, trafficking in persons remains one of the grave challenges facing the international community, which also impairs the enjoyment of human rights and needs a more concerted international response. According to the 2016 UN report, women and girls tend to be trafficked for marriages and sexual slavery, while men and boys are typically exploited for forced labour in the mining sector, as porters and as soldiers. It also states that refugees from war and persecution are particularly vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking.
Unlike the transatlantic slave trade, modern slavery is not the backbone of western civilization or in something easily recognized. But those who hold others captive and force them to work against their will are making profits off this crime. In fact, human trafficking is estimated to be a US$32 billion industry. Although slavery has been outlawed in nearly every country, millions of men, women and children are working as slaves in brick kilns, rice mills, garment factories, fishing operations and many other industries. It is one of the darkest and most revolting realities in the world today.
The tremendous advances in human civilization, in the sciences and technologies tempt us to think that slavery is a thing of a distant past. But when we examine the facts, we are shocked at how much slavery in all its modern forms is with us more than ever, albeit in a more submerged way.
Far from being a historical footnote and far from of diminishing or going away, this phenomenon of trafficking in persons is growing, provoked by conflicts and extreme poverty, and exacerbated by the present migration and refugee crisis.
Its hard to believe that real slaves, people forced to work long hours through threats of violence or coercion, are living in our midst. We must devote ourselves to never again letting a generation go by without forward progress.
Working toward a world without modern slavery is no doubt a bold proposition, but it is one that we must work toward.
Modern slavery is happening all around you and you can be part of the solution by raising your voice to end this shameful scourge.
The threat is real, and needs combined efforts to stamp it out. Human trafficking is modern day slavery which deprives people of their human rights and dignity. Given the huge stakes in ruined lives, the ongoing fight against modern-day slavery should be unyielding.

IAAF maintains ban on Russia over widespread doping
BUENOS AIRES, Friday: Russias ban from international athletics over widespread doping has been maintained by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the president of the sports governing body, Sebastian Coe, said on Friday.
Russia has been suspended from international athletics since November 2015 after the McLaren report discovered widespread doping.
The Russians had hoped to be reinstated but IAAF officials meeting in Argentina on Friday unanimously upheld the ban and said that although Russia had taken positive steps in the right direction it had not done enough to merit inclusion.
We have brought about change and its change that is very viable, said Coe. But we werent yet at that point where every element of that criteria had been met.
Russias political and sporting leaders have repeatedly denied state involvement in doping, a key sticking point in lifting the ban, although Russian athletes cleared by the IAAF were allowed to compete as neutrals at last years world championships.
Such athletes will again be allowed to compete as neutrals in the European Championships, which are scheduled to start in Berlin on Aug 7. - Agencies

Imran Khan will be sworn-in as Pakistans new Prime Minister before the countrys independence day on August 14, his party has announced as it is trying to reach out to smaller parties and independents to form the next government.
Though the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has emerged as the single largest party in the National Assembly after the July 25 elections, the party is still short of numbers to form its government on its own. Leader Naeenul Haq told media last night that consultations are on to complete the numbers game.
We have done our homework and he will take oath as Prime Minister before August 14, Haq said. According to the complete preliminary results announced by the ECP, the has obtained 115 general seats - 12 short of a simple majority - while the PML-N and PPP have won 64 and 43 seats, respectively. Pakistans NA - the lower house of Parliament - comprises a total of 342 members, of which 272 are directly elected. A party can only form the government if it manages to secure 172 seats in total.

Indo-Lanka Accord: 31 years on
It is now exactly 31 years since the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed in Colombo on July 29, 1987, between Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene amidst political turmoil in Colombo and military advances in the North.
The Accord was signed Attaching utmost importance to nurturing, intensifying and strengthening the traditional friendship of Sri Lanka and India, and acknowledging the imperative need of resolving the ethnic problem of Sri Lanka, and the consequent violence, and for the safety, well-being and prosperity of people belonging to all communities of Sri Lanka.
India always took a keen interest in the ethnic conflict and related developments in Sri Lanka, mainly because of the Tamil Nadu factor. The Tamil populations in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lankas North shared the same linguistic, cultural and religious heritage and it would have been naive to suggest that the Central Government in New Delhi as well as the Tamil Nadu administration would take no interest in developments in Sri Lanka.
It was no secret that secret training camps for Tamil militants in Sri Lanka existed in Tamil Nadu. There was a measure of support for the militants among sections of Tamil Nadu politicians and the populace. The Indian establishment was sensitive to the sentiments of these sections.
By this time, the Sri Lankan Security Forces were on the offensive in Jaffna, recording major successes against the LTTE. India decided to intervene at this stage, resulting in the infamous Air Drop of supplies over the Jaffna region on June 4, 1987. There were indications that some sections in India politics were against the ongoing military operations in the North.
Knowing very well that it would be futile to take on India in the military sense of the word, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to a diplomatic solution, which came in the form of the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord. Among its salient features were enabling the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act of 1987 along with the arrival of the Indian Peace Keeping Forces (IPKF) in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan troops were to be withdrawn to their barracks in the North and the LTTE cadres and other militant groups were to surrender their weapons. The Army offensive in the North was halted.
The LTTE later turned against the IPKF, which suffered more than 1,000 casualties. It returned to India in March 1990. By then, Ranasinghe Premadasa was in the Presidential seat and battling a Southern insurgency on the side, he made his displeasure over the IPKF known. Just one year later, the LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi at a campaign rally in Tamil Nadu, which turned the tide against the group in India, even in Tamil Nadu. The LTTE was banned and it was no longer fashionable to support the LTTE.
Final battles in May 2009
This was one of the turning points in the battle against the LTTE. India did not signal its opposition to any of the Sri Lanka Security Forces offensives from then onwards, including the final battles in May 2009. In fact, intelligence provided by India and several other countries contained vital clues that led to the destruction of LTTE floating armouries in the run up to the final battles.
Although the conflict ended in May 2009, the debate surrounding the Indo Lankan Accord still continues. Some argue that it is no longer valid, while others say that it is very much alive and embodied in our political systems. One point forwarded by the former camp is that Sri Lankan Courts have nullified the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces which was one of the clauses of the Accord.
Others say that Provincial Councils, introduced by the Accord in 1987, are very much a part of the local political fabric now and hence the Accord is still active. With the demerger if the Northern and Eastern Provinces, there are now nine provincial councils. Elections are due soon for most of the provinces.
The idea behind the provincial council system was that the devolution of power would address some of the grievances faced by people in the North and the East. Critics say that devolution of power has already been achieved through the local bodies which go right down to the Pradeshiya Sabha level and that there is no need for bigger provincial councils. They also say that it is a big waste of Government funds considering salaries, vehicles, telephone bills, power bills etc.
Proponents of the provincial councils say that enough powers have not been devolved to the PCs to make them work properly. One of the most controversial issues is whether police and land powers should be given to the Provincial Councils, as stipulated originally. This has stirred a hornets nest, since critics say it would be tantamount to Federalism (the F-word seems to be taboo in local politics) and the PCs could try to break away and seek independence.
However, supporters of the PC system say there are built-m safeguards to prevent that from happening. Besides, they point out separation has not occurred in any of the countries which practice devolution of power in a similar manner. The Governor, who is appointed by the President, has sweeping powers to ensure that PCs cannot break away. Interestingly, even the parties that initially opposed the PCs now participate fully in the PC process, signifying that all parties support the concept of devolution. The debate seems to be rather on the unit of devolution.
13th Amendment
This all comes back to the much-debated 13th Amendment which paved the way for Provincial Councils and several other features. It is very much a part of the Constitution, so the question does not arise whether it is dormant or not. The real question lies in its implementation. Some Governments have pledged to implement a 13th Amendment Plus, which means even greater devolution of power.
However, some said such an interpretation amounts to a betrayal. There is also a feeling among political circles that India is not overly keen on requesting the Sri Lankan Government to implement the 13th Amendment in full, given the current geopolitical realities. At the same time, it should be pointed out that neither India nor Sri Lanka have publicly disowned the Accord. The question also remains whether it is possible for one side to unilaterally abrogate a bilateral accord.
However, there are many who claim that if the 13thAmendment was implemented in full, instead of on a piecemeal basis, the conflict could have been resolved without the thousands of casualties on both sides. Another special feature of the Accord is the recognition of Sri Lanka as a multi - ethnic and a multi-lingual plural society, a reference that continues to have greater significance. Like everything else in life, the Accord has its good and bad sides and proponents and opponents.
Several Ministers and MPs mentioned it as one of the agreements which, if implemented, would have prevented the enormous loss of life in Sri Lanka in their addresses to the Sri Lankan Parliament on January 9, 2016 while speaking on the resolution to set up a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution for the country.
The present effort by the Government and many others to enact a new Constitution is the best opportunity to arrive at a broad consensus that can satisfactorily resolve this national issue and set Sri Lanka on the path to peace and reconciliation.
There is no doubt that they will be taking on board the lessons learned from the Indo Lanka Accord in this regard. Devolution of power is still a pivotal concept for resolving the national question but they should arrive at a viable unit of devolution. It is also vital to forge a truly Sri Lankan identity that shuns communalism.
Thirty one years after 1987, we are still searching for some of the answers to these issues. We have won the war, but the battle for peace must begin in earnest now if we are to avoid another dangerous slide down the path of discord and rancor.

JKH records Rs 2.91 bn PBT in 1Q
John Keells Holdings PLC Group revenue was at Rs.30.16 billion for the first quarter of 2018 which saw an increase of 12 per cent over the Rs.26.82 billion recorded in the previous financial year.

The transportation industry group PBT of Rs.842 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is an increase of 4 per cent over the first quarter of the previous financial year.
The increase in profitability is mainly attributable to the performance of the Groups Bunkering, and Ports and Shipping businesses.
The Leisure industry group PBT at negative Rs.278 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease over the first quarter of the previous financial year. Whilst the City Hotels sector recorded an improvement in average room rates, profitability was impacted by a decline in occupancies, primarily as a result of the increase in room inventory within Colombo in the calendar year 2017.
The Property industry group PBT of Rs.9 million in the first quarter of 2018/19 is a decrease over the first quarter of the previous financial year. The decrease in profitability is mainly attributable to Rajawella Holdings Limited, which is currently undergoing a relaying of the fairways.

Rabada, Shamsi destroy batting for 193
Lankan one-day woes continue  lose first ODI
DAMBULLA, Sunday: With the 2019 World Cup not too far away Sri Lankas one-day woes continued when they went down to South Africa by five wickets in the first ODI played at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday to give the tourists their first win on the tour and a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.
For South Africa who had been outplayed in the two-Test series the win would have been like sweet music to their ears. Having gone through a horrendous 2017 where they lost 23 out of 29 ODIs, Sri Lanka were looking to at least turn the corner in 2018 having won 3 out of 5 games - at least that is what skipper Angelo Mathews expected. But the way the Lankan batting crumbled for 193 inside 35 overs to the pace and left-arm spin of Kagiso Rabada and Tabraiz Shamsi, left room for too many questions to be answered before they can become a competent ODI unit that can win consistently.
The extra pace and bounce of Rabada and the tidy spin of Shamsi proved too much for the Lankans after they won the toss and chose to bat first on a pitch that didnt offer much for the bowlers.
Kagiso Rabada who ran through the Lankan top order to finish with figures of 4 for 41.Picture by Susantha Wijegunasekera
That Sri Lanka folded up for such a moderate total failing to last the 50 overs was due to a combination of poor shot selection and lack of footwork.
The rot started with Niroshan Dickwellas dismissal off a full toss which he chipped to midwicket in the third ball of the innings. From there onwards there was a series of dismissals for which the Lankan batsmen were answerable for.
Rabada pushed Sri Lanka onto the backfoot with the wickets of Dickwella and Kusal Mendis off his first two overs. By the time he finished his first spell of six overs Sri Lankas batting was in tatters at 36 for five.
Experienced Upul Tharanga only doubled the agony for his team when he tried to take on mid-off fielder JP Duminy with his score on 10 and tried to scamper a single only to be beaten by the fielders direct throw.
Skipper Mathews played a superb straight drive for four of Rabada but totally undid that effort in the next over when he offered catching practice to Amla at first slip edging a delivery from Ngidi without any feet movement.
Shehan Jayasuriya followed his captain in similar fashion offering De Kock a catch behind the wicket to be dismissed for a duck.
The slide was stopped by the two Pereras - Kusal and Thisara who came together in a face-saving partnership that produced 92 runs off 54 balls. It was the best batting of the Lankan innings and it clearly showed that there was nothing wrong with the pitch, but plenty wrong with the batsmen who were dismissed.
Thisara as is his nature bludgeoned his way to an entertaining 49 off 30 balls (8 fours) and Kusal also gaining in confidence at the other end looked like taking the team towards a 200 plus total.
With the partnership growing into dangerous proportions South African captain Faf du Plessis switched to spin and off his first over Shamsi obliged him with the prize wicket of Thisara.
Akila Dananjaya helped Kusal add a further 38 for the seventh wicket but further resistance was denied by South Africa who managed to grab the last three wickets for 27 runs including that of Kusals for a splendid innings of 81 off 72 balls studded with 11 fours and a six. Kusal who had played so well upto that point attempted a reverse sweep for the first time in his innings and eventually offered a catch to point. One could not blame him for attempting such a stroke for two reasons  one, South Africa had packed the leg side with seven fielders and two, he was running short of partners.
Rabada and Shamsi who was named man of the match shared the spoils with four wickets apiece.
With not so much pressure on the run rate South Africa began their reply steadily with Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock posting 31 in five overs. But Dananjaya raised some hopes in the Lankan camp by sending back both Amla and Aiden Markram off successive balls. Du Plessis not only survived the hat-trick ball but hung around long enough to stitch together a stand of 86 off 96 balls with De Kock that put South Africa on the road to victory.
Although both batsmen were dismissed for the identical score of 47, South Africa were never under any discomfort against spin. JP Duminy made certain that there wont be any major cause for alarm by stroking his way to his 26th ODI fifty to remain unbeaten on 53 scored off 32 balls (6 fours, 2 sixes) when victory was achieved with 114 balls to spare.
The second ODI will take place at the same venue on Wednesday (August 1).

Lego Hogwarts Castle is the second biggest Lego set ever
Harry Potter fans have got a lot of saving to do if theyre going to get their hands on what is a truly magical, and gigantic, Lego set.
A few weeks ago, Lego unveiled a new range of Harry Potter sets and figures. They all looked really good, including an impressive Hogwarts Great Hall that recreated the main section of the castle in minifigure scale.
But it turns out thats childs play compared to the new set theyve just announced.
Lego Hogwarts Castle is the second-biggest Lego set ever made, at a staggering 6,020 pieces. Thats still smaller than the Ultimate Collector Series Millennium Falcon but ahead of the 5,923 pieces of the Taj Mahal.
As you can imagine that number of bricks (and having to pay for the Harry Potter licence on top) doesnt come cheap but if youve got a spare 349.99 knocking around then it looks well worth it.
Of course, the real Hogwarts Castle is huge, so to ensure you dont need to buy a new house to display it in everything has been shrunk down to microscale.
That means instead of ordinary minifigures you get 27 non-posable microfigures for characters including Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, and the Dementors.
Its a trick Lego have used only a few times before, to portray really big vehicles and buildings (the last one was the now retired SHIELD Helicarrier) and as you can see it looks fantastic.
You do still get four regular minifigures anyway, of Hogwarts founders Helga Hufflepuff, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. And on top of that are fantastic beasts such as Aragog the Acromantula and a Hungarian Horntail (aka a dragon).
The castle itself features the Great Hall, Dumbledores office, Dolores Umbridges classroom, Hagrids hut, the Whomping Willow, and a microscale Ford Anglia. The completed castle measures over 22 (58cm) high, 27 (69cm) wide, and 16 (43cm). So, yeah its big. Its also suggested for children of 16 years and older, which as usual is secret code for being aimed more at parents than kids.
Hogwarts Castle is set number 71043 will be released from 15th August 2018 on the Lego online store, so youve got just enough time to apply for an evening job to pay for it.

Mangala wants wider job opportunities for university left outs
Since only a minute 25,000 students out of nearly 222,500 students passing the GCE Advanced Level Examination qualify for university admission, wider opportunities should be made available to the balance 200,000 or so to obtain employment in the technology field, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Accordingly, plans have been already formulated to set up four technological and vocational training schools in Badulla, Kandy, Trincomalee and Anuradhapura with German and Swiss assistance, during the next three years.
Minister Samraweera was speaking after inaugurating a new construction industry training course at the Talalla National Vocational Training Institute on July 29.
The Minister said the batch of 60 male and female youths selected from the South for this training course on that day would follow a four month training course in welding, carpentry and masonry.
The government would incur an expenditure of nearly Rs. 4 million to provide for their training while the German GIZ would provide them with the necessary equipment and tools, uniforms and other assistance, the Minister said.
According to the Vocation Training Authority, this programme would produce a skilled craftsman or woman within a short period of 120 days, he said.
At a time when there is an expansion in the construction industry, it would be most prudent to produce a group of skilled craftsmen within the country to cater to its needs, he added.
Minister Samaraweera said when only 25,000 students enter universities annually, another group either leaves for studies abroad or enters private education institutes. Another group enters society with deep frustration. As such, workshops of that nature would widen opportunities for the balance 200,000 Advanced Level qualified students to enter a technological profession. They would then be able to obtain an honourable profession and earn a considerable income.
Minister Samaraweera recalled that during his last budget speech, he emphasised on the need to launch training programmes and courses to produce skilled youth to cater to the needs of the job market. Germany and Switzerland had volunteered to assist such programmes. As a result, another technology institute had been opened with German aassistance and at Kilinochchi in addition to the one at Ratmalana.
Steps were underway to set up a technological university at Matara with German assistance. In 2016, German Foreign Affairs Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier paid an official visit to Sri Lanka. This visit provided an opportunity for the President of Sri Lanka to visit Germany for an official tour for the first time. Frank-Walter Steinmeier is today the President of Germany and they hoped to invite him to attend the foundation laying for the technical university, as the Chief Guest, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said Rs.1,000 million had been allocated from the budget to set up the proposed four technology and vocational training institutes.

Moodys affirms ratings of three Lankan banks
Moodys Investors Service has affirmed the local currency deposit ratings of Bank of Ceylon (BOC), Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) and Sampath Bank PLC at B1/NP.
The foreign currency issuer rating and deposit ratings of these banks are also affirmed at B1 and B2/NP respectively.
Moodys has also affirmed the Baseline Credit Assessments (BCAs) and adjusted BCAs of these banks at b1. As a result, their local and foreign currencies Counterparty Risk Ratings (CRRs) are affirmed at Ba3/NP. Their Counterparty Risk Assessments (CRAs) are also affirmed at Ba3(cr)/NP(cr).
The rating outlooks of the banks, where applicable, are maintained at negative.
The rating action follows the affirmation of Sri Lankas B1 sovereign rating and negative outlook on July 26, 2018.
The decision to affirm the bank ratings reflects Moodys affirmation of Sri Lankas sovereign rating and outlook, as well as the banks stable standalone credit profiles.
Moodys believes that there is high level of dependency between the creditworthiness of rated Sri Lankan banks and the sovereign mainly because of (1) the high extent to which the banks businesses depend on macroeconomic and financial conditions in Sri Lanka, with a low level of cross-border diversification in their operations; and (2) their significant direct and indirect exposures to domestic sovereign debt relative to their capital bases.
Sri Lankas credit strength is also a key input in Moodys deposit and issuer ratings for financial institutions in the country, because it affects Moodys assessment of the governments capacity to provide support in times of stress.
As such, the banks are not expected to be rated higher than the sovereign, and the outlook is usually in line with the sovereign.
The decision to affirm the sovereign rating at B1 reflects Sri Lankas progress in implementing the planned reform program, which entails fiscal consolidation and a build-up foreign exchange reserves buffers, ahead of the end of the IMF Extended Fund Facility program in June 2019, along with its moderate per capita income levels, and stronger institutions relative to many similarly-rated sovereigns.

Moodys affirms Sri Lankas ratings at B1
Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) has affirmed the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings at B1 and maintained the negative outlook.
The decision to affirm the rating at B1 reflects Sri Lankas progress in implementing the planned reform program, which entails fiscal consolidation and a build-up foreign exchange reserves buffers, ahead of the end of the IMF Extended Fund Facility program in June 2019, along with its moderate per capita income levels, and stronger institutions relative to many similarly-rated sovereigns.
This is balanced against Moodys expectation that the sovereigns fiscal strength will remain very low and government liquidity and external vulnerability risk will remain rating constraints. The decision to maintain the negative outlook reflects Sri Lankas ongoing high vulnerability to a potential tightening in external and domestic financing conditions, given relatively large borrowing needs, reliance on external funding and still low reserves adequacy.

## Title: NATIONAL AUDIT ACT FROM AUGUST 1

NATIONAL AUDIT ACT FROM AUGUST 1
The National Audit Act will come in to operation from August 1, 2018, fulfilling a key pledge given by the Yahapalana government in 2015.
President Maithripala Sirisena in an Extraordinary Gazette notification announced last Thursday (26) that the National Audit Act which was passed in Parliament with amendments this month will come into effect from next Wednesday (August 1).
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya ratified the National Audit Act on July 18, 2018.
By virtue of the powers vested in me by Section 1 (2) of the National Audit Act, No.19 of 2018, I, Maithripala Sirisena, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka do by this order, appoint August 01, 2018 to be the date on which the Provisions of Parts I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX of the aforesaid Act shall come into operation. The extraordinary Gazette Notification issued on July 26, stated. The Act provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Servicing Commission. It also provides for the establishment of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the Auditor Generals role over public finance as well.
The Bill was presented to Parliament on April 3, 2018.
Following the enactment, the Audit Service Commission, which has not been operative for over two and a half years, will come to life. The Audit Service Commission has powers to appoint committees to assist the Commission.
Under Article 153A (1) of the Constitution, an Audit Service Commission will be appointed to ensure the independence of the Audit Commission. This Commission will consist of the Auditor General and four other members appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council.
A new Audit Office is also sanctioned by the new Act, to assist the Auditor General to discharge his duties and responsibilities.
The Speaker has powers to appoint an independent auditor to audit the Audit Office.
The Audit Bill was revised over 23 times, mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision. The provision provides for a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to Government for which that officer is held responsible.
This provision has been diluted to vest the authority to impose surcharge back in the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries/Department Heads), and not the Auditor General. In cases where the CAO has been implicated, the power to impose the surcharge lies with the Treasury Secretary.
A Surcharge Appeal Committee, not less than five members, with experience in the fields of auditing, law, and public finance management, will be appointed by the Constitutional Council to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge has been imposed.
UNP MP Professor Ashu Marasinghe, responding to the Daily News with reference to the commencement of the National Audit Acts operations, pointed out that the Yahapalana government has fulfilled a landmark pledge given in the 2015 mandate.
This will magnify the fact that this Yahapalana government abides by its pledges to the people. We are trying to establish a political culture that is people-friendly. Our aim is to bring in proper and responsible public finance management to this country, Professor Marasinghe said.
Professor Marasinghe also said that a new Budget Office will soon be established as well. The Budget Office will monitor if the Audit Act is being implemented properly while also monitoring the utilization of annual budget allocations.

Navy initiates projects to preserve eco-system
The Navy carried out several projects of planting mangrove saplings in the lagoon areas of the Northern and Northwestern Naval Commands recently to mark the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem.
Accordingly, over 1,000 mangrove saplings were planted in the lagoon areas in the Northern Naval Command under the guidance of the Commander Northern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Merril Wickramasinghe. Officers and sailors attached to the Northern Naval Command participated.
Saplings were planted in the Modara Gam Aruwa region belonging to SLNS Barana in the Northwestern Naval Area as well.
The drive was joined by the Commander Northwestern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Sujeewa Perera, Naval personnel of SLNS Barana, students and teachers of Mullikulam Roman Catholic School, fisher folk in the area and several foreigners. Similar programmes were carried out in the naval establishments of Rapid Action Boat Squadron Headquarters, SLNS Thambapanni, SLNS Therapuththa and SLNS Vijaya as well. Over 2,170 mangrove saplings were planted in the North Western Naval Area. A key partner in conservation of land and marine environments, the Navy has thus far planted over 100,000 mangrove plants to promote mangrove ecosystems.

No show by MR leads to tense situation at temple
A tense situation arose at a Buddhist temple in Embilipitiya on Saturday when former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who was invited as the Chief Guest for an event, failed to show up.
Rajapaksa had sent his brother former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to attend on his behalf but a section of the crowd turned violent after hearing that the Kurunegala District MP was not coming.
After Chamal Rajapaksas arrival, two organisers had climbed up a tree and staged a protest. Meanwhile, Embilipitiya PS chairman S.Weerasinghe and Embilipitiya PS member Ruwan Pathirana rushed to Mahinda Rajapaksas residence in Tangalle as the crowd was getting agitated but had to return empty handed as they were told that the former President is unable to come due to a backache. The former Speakers attempts to calm the crowd too failed. The crowd began to act violently and the former Speaker left hurriedly without participating in the event, the unveiling of the new Buddha statue at the temple.

Now its the Tamils
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, it appears, is well launched on his campaign to woo the minorities. First it was the Muslims who were hosted to Ifthar. At the time we wrote in these spaces that the Rajapaksas were trying to make amends after having angered the Muslim voters by their indifference towards the Aluthgama incidents and mob attacks on Muslim businesses. Now the former Defence Secretary has turned his attention to the Tamils. On Friday Rajapaksa met Colombo based journalists of the Tamil print and electronic media at the Viy(p)athmaga office in Pitakotte. During the powwow he had stated that economic empowerment of all communities was his answer to reconciliation, as reported in an English daily on Saturday.
He also told the Tamil media persons that the Rajapaksa government undertook rapid infrastructure development soon after the conclusion of the war to improve the living standards of those directly affected by the fighting. Rajapaksa had also told the newspaper how glad and appreciative he was to have received the opportunity to have met the Tamil media and Tamil political parties.
If Gotabhaya Rajapaksa thought that by meeting Tamil media personnel he can influence the Tamil voters he is indeed due for an awakening. The Tamil community has not forgotten how they were made to feel a conquered race by the jingoistic conduct of Gotabhayas brother, in the immediate aftermath of the war victory. The former Defence Secretary told the Tamil journalists that the affairs in the North should be carried out by the Chief Minister in terms of the 13th amendment to the constitution. However, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a hectoring throne speech in parliament, in the first flush of the war victory thundered that although he was in favour of devolution for the Tamil people it will be devolution strictly on his governments terms and not that which had been planted here by outsiders, thus, effectively rejecting the 13th amendment. In any event Mahinda Rajapaksa was not a great fan of the 13th amendment and was in the forefront of demonstrations against 13A from the very outset.
This duplicity of the Rajapaksas are not lost on the Tamils.
When Gotabhaya says that the Rajapaksa government took prompt steps to develop the North and improve the lot of the war affected people soon after the conclusion of the war he certainly is seeing the wood for the trees. The Tamil struggle, from the very outset, centred on the determination of that community to look after their own affairs, which also means developing their own areas by themselves. It is for this reason that they had been keeping on demanding some form of autonomy which the Rajapaksas are still against granting them. This is clearly being reflected in the views expressed by persons of the calibre of Sarath Weerasekera and Kamal Gunaratne, the types who will call the shots if Gotabhaya becomes President. The likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, firm Gota allies, too does not miss an opportunity to describe 13 A as a sellout, which no doubt will be taken cognizance by the Tamil community.
The Northern Tamils too are unlikely to forget the state of siege they were subjected to soon after the war, with victory parades held ad nausm and war rhetoric thundered from political platforms by government ministers, giving the impression that the victory was against an alien army as against a set of misguided youth from ones own country, not to mention the marshal songs composed that added salt to wounds of the Tamil community. The Tamils of the North will also remember the insult they were made to endure when Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a sense of pique, at being denied the opportunity to address the Oxford Union, due to a demonstration by Tamis in London, issued a presidential edict banning the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil, in schools and government offices in the North.
Nor are they to forget the sentiments expressed by Rajapaksa soon after his election defeat that he did not consider the debacle as a setback since he was done in by the Tigers. parajayak hetiyata piliganne ne mokadha mawa peredduwe uthure koti, a clear message that to Rajapksa -and by extension Gota -what matters is only the majority community in the South, while the Tamils in North were a disposable commodity.
No doubt, the recently held LG poll results have caused Gota to grasp the dire need of wooing the minorities, if he, as a prospective presidential candidate, were to have any chance of victory. The Feb.10 poll results gave the pohottuwa only a 41% vote share and this, as the former Defence Secretary and the pohottuwites well know, is the furthest they can go.
With the government now getting its act together and an election oriented budget now being speculated in the media, things can only go downhill for whoever comes forward from the pohottuwa to contest the next presidential election. It is difficult to see the minorities, voting for Gota, or any other opposition candidate, in sufficient numbers to obtain the magical 50% + 1 vote.

## Title: The Office for Reparations
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, July 30, 2018 - 01:00
The Office for Reparations
The debate to approve legislation to set up the Office for Reparations is due soon. The Office of Missing Persons has commenced work. This piece is written at a time when Ben Emmerson QC, the UN rapporteur on countering terrorism has gone record saying, Sri Lankas progress towards reform has virtually ground to a halt and none of the measures so far adopted to fulfill Sri Lankas transitional justice commitments are adequate to ensure real progress and that progress towards reconciliation and a fair judicial system had virtually ground to a halt.
This writer is no apologist for this government or that matter the last one. However, I do have opinions. Hence the focus of this compilation on the soon to be established Office for Reparations.
What is the Office for Reparations
The Office for Reparation is an independent authority, created by the Office for Reparations Act, tasked with formulating, designing and implementing reparations policies aiming to redress victims who suffered violations in the course of past conflicts in Sri Lanka. The Office will receive applications from aggrieved persons and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers most effective forms of individual and collective reparations, including specialized policies on public education, memorialization and on children, youth, women and victims of sexual violence and persons with disabilities.
Why is such an office necessary
Sri Lankas Constitution clearly recognizes that every single Sri Lankan has the right to enjoy equal protection before the law. By this legislation the State, therefore, recognizes the dignity of all victims of past conflicts and that the respect for their right to an effective remedy will contribute to the promotion of reconciliation for the well-being and security of all Sri Lankans including future generations.
To respond to these obligations and needs, the Office for Reparations will need to formulate and implement policies to:
* Identify and address the needs of aggrieved persons who are eligible to request for reparations;
* Provide compensation to aggrieved persons in order to help them rebuild and restore their lives;
* Identify and learn from the failings of the previous reparation mechanisms when exercising its powers and functions;
* Act in the interest of the public as a transparent body independent from the government.
When will the Office for Reparations become operational
The Office for Reparations Act, approved by the Cabinet, awaits enactment by the Parliament. The law stipulates that the Constitutional Council will then propose five commissioners of the future Office for Reparations to the President, who will appoint them. President has 14 days to appoint the commissioners and chose the chairman of the Office for Reparations among them.
Who will choose the chairman and commissioners of the office
The five commissioners including the chairman of the office for Reparations will be appointed by the President based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Council.
What are the powers and functions of this office
As set out in Section 11 of the Act the powers and functions of the office are to:
* Receive recommendations and applications pertaining to reparations
* ldentify aggrieved persons who are eligible for reparations;
* Maintain a database containing information relating to previous/ongoing reparation programmes as well as information necessary to achieve the objectives of this office;
* Make rules pertaining to the Office for Reparations, recommend policies regarding granting of reparations and implementing such policies if approved by the Cabinet of Ministers;
* Provide information, support and protection to aggrieved persons and inform them about the status of their applications;
* Establish additional committees, divisions, or units to the Office or Reparations as deemed necessary and exercise disciplinary control over employees and staff;
* Request assistance from a state, government, provincial or local authorities when necessary, as well as facilitating the provision of assistance (in the form of restitution, rehabilitation, administration, and welfare) provided by other persons or body of persons;
* Manage funds used to provide reparations and for the operationalizing of the Office for Reparations.
How does the law distinguish between individual and collective reparations
The Act refers individual reparations as measures as are intended to recognize the right to an effective remedy and benefits an individual aggrieved person which may include monetary payments or loans, material benefit, education, training or skills development, administrative and welfare services, land and housing, etc. Collective reparations are referred to as measures intended to recognize the right to an effective remedy and benefits to the communities or groups of aggrieved persons and include means of remembrance, infrastructure and community development, etc. Specific reparations types and policies will be defined by the Office for Reparations within this framework, based on consultations with victims, affected communities and other groups and institutions.
Who is eligible for reparations
The Office for Reparations will not be granting reparations to individuals or groups because they belonged to a certain political party, movement, state institution or formation. Reparations will not be granted on the basis of ethnicity or religious affiliation. Reparations under this law are intended for all Sri Lankans, without discrimination, who the law defines as aggrieved persons who suffered the following violations:
* Persons who have suffered a violation of human rights or humanitarian law (as contained in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949), as applicable: in the course of, consequent to, or in connection with the conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces or its aftermath; or
* in connection with political unrest or civil disturbances; or
* in the course of systematic gross violations of the rights of individuals, groups or communities of people of Sri Lanka; or
* due to an enforced disappearance as defined in the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, No.5 of 2018;
* Relatives of a person deceased or missing as a result of such violations
Will the REPPIA programmes cease with the new law
According to Section 26 (2) (f) of the Act, all programmes commenced by REPPIA, shall be deemed as programmes commenced by the Office for Reparations upon its commencement and continue to function in that capacity be continued and completed.
If they accept reparations, will victims have to give up on truth and justice
Accepting reparations doesnt mean accepting injustice. Section 12 (2) and (3) of the Act states that reparations shall not prevent victims from pursuing legal remedy against violations and such victims-shall be advised by the offices outreach units of their ability to appear before any other appropriate authority, person, or body. Furthermore, the law is clear about the Office for Reparations working with other reconciliation bodies, such as the Office of the Missing Persons in pursuit of its mission.
Do victims have to come to come to Colombo to make complaints
According to Section 10 (2) of the Act, the Office for Reparations may set up number of (temporary or mobile) regional units as deemed necessary, to ensure that reparations are accessible to all aggrieved persons. Through these offices people will be able to submit applications, make complaints, follow up on the status of their applications, receive advice on their rights and due services, seek psychosocial support, etc.
The draft reads well, is liberal and is quite sophisticated in its formulation. There has been criticism elsewhere with in adequate consideration of the very political, vexed and emotive nature of the subject matter at hand. Legislation is as good as its implementation. It follows the Colombo circuit of the charmed and privileged with connections should not continue to monopolize and clamour for positions seen the past few years.

Over 15,000 village projects under Gamperaliya - PM
Every measure has already been taken to streamline the development of the village through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes will strengthen the economy of the village when every village receives funds through these two programmes, he added.
The Prime Minister made these remarks after opening two Divisional Secretariat offices in Eravur and Manmunaipattu in Batticaloa yesterday.
Addressing the gathering, he said the rural community will receive more money through the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes.These programmes will help strengthen the rural economy since villagers will receive more money from these programmes, he said.
The PM said around 15,000 projects will be carried out through the Gamperaliya programmes. Under the Gamperaliya programme, several development and infrastructure development activities such as roads, irrigations including small tanks will be carried out through the Divisional Secretariats. These projects will be completed on time in a proper and transparent tender procedure.
A committee comprising officials of the Finance Ministry has been appointed to select proposals. The secretary of the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry will inform the District Secretary of the selected development proposals which are carried out through the Divisional Secretariat offices.
These activities will be evaluated by a committee comprising Ministers Sagala Ratnayake, Eran Wickremaratne, Niroshan Perera and J.C. Alawathuwala.
The Ministers committee will monitor whether these projects are carried out efficiently. The committee will provide instructions if any project is behind schedule.
Cold-room facilities will be established with the assistance of the private sector centralising economic centres including Dambulla. Wastage to crops can be minimized by establishing cold storage facilities.

## Title: Prospects and constraints of off-season big onion production in Hambantota district
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Prospects and constraints of off-season big onion production in Hambantota district
In Sri Lanka, the subsidiary food crops (SFC) sector has been given prime importance by past and present regimes, as it directly deals with the food and nutritional security of the nation. The former governments policy objective was to achieve 50 percent self-sufficiency or 50 percent import substitution in big onion, dried chilies and potatoes by 2016.
The present government is also going along with the same policy direction by setting a target of 148, 000 mt of big onion production - an increase of approximately 50,000 mt from the current level - to be achieved by the end of the three-year National Food Production Plan (20162018).
Backed by these domestic production support policies, the Agriculture Department (DOA) was given the task of expanding big onion to off-season (Maha season, as Yala is the major season for big onion) with cultivation primarily in the Hambantota district due to its agro-climatic suitability for off-season production.
As a pilot project, off-season cultivation of big onion was introduced to Hambantota in the 2013-14 Maha season and was expanded to 350ha in the 2014-15 Maha season. Ascertaining the sustainability of off-season production is essential to realising the national target within the scheduled timeframe. It is vital therefore to understand not only the agronomic suitability but also the socioeconomic acceptability and financial viability to ascertain the sustainability of the off-season big onion production programme as a whole. Hence, a survey was carried out by the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) in 2015-16 to ascertain the prospects and constraints of the off-season big onion production programme in the Hambantota district.
Major findings
It was evident from the study that off-season big onion cultivation was more prominent in Beralihela, Weeravila, Ambalantota, Bandagiriya, Lunama, Yodhakandiya and Meegahajandura West agrarian services divisions (ASDs). Of the sample of 200 farmers who cultivated big onion, 62 percent had reaped the harvest in March, April or May, which is considered the optimum period for off-season harvesting. However, it was evident that the harvesting period of a quarter of the sample coincided with the major harvesting season of the country, from mid-July to mid-September.
In Hambantota, big onion farming was mostly practised in the uplands (78 percent) rather than in the lowlands (22 percent). The proper maintenance of soil moisture throughout the growing period is a prerequisite to obtain a good harvest. Among the five different modes of existing irrigation methods used in big onion fields such as major irrigation, minor irrigation, rain-fed cultivation, agro well and home well, major irrigation marked the most prominent method (55.5 percent) followed by minor irrigation (33 percent) method.
Farmers had largely replaced low-country vegetables (45.6 percent) and paddy (18.2 percent) with big onion as cultivation time of off-season big onion overlaps the Mahaseason (November - March) paddy cultivation. It was assumed that long-grain red paddy production in the Hambantota district will be threatened if targetted big onion cultivation (2,000ha) takes over about 50 percent of paddy lands in the same season. However, results of the sample survey show that big onion cultivation is highly unlikely to compete with long grain red paddy production. Of the surveyed sample of off-season onion cultivators, the most significant reason behind attempting the first trial was awareness programmes (92.7 percent) conducted by the respective agriculture instructors (AIs) of the area. The most impressive means of knowledge transfer was the special meetings (74 percent) called by the AIs of the area for introducing big onion. The rate of attendance for the training programmes was 87 percent and farmers level of satisfaction about the training programmes was as high as 99 percent.
Leaf twister, bulb rot and purple blotch were the common diseases found in onion cultivation in the Hambantota district. As per the AIs, poor drainage of soils rich in clay was one of the main reasons for the spread of these diseases in onion fields. Therefore, improving soil texture and structure by adding organic matter to the soil prior to transplanting is critical. Even though the recommended rate of organic matter addition was four to five tons per acre, only five percent of farmers have been able to apply the recommended level, mainly due to less availability.
During the survey, two main storage methods were observed: spreading on the floor and the hanging method. However, the most common method of storing onion in the Hambantota district was spreading on the floor (on bare concrete) in a thin layer, though the most desirable practice is hanging in a spacious hut, which enables high ventilation. Of the surveyed sample, the number which practised the hanging method was negligible (3 percent). The main reasons for not practising it were low quality of the harvest (premature or diseased) - not suitable for prolonged storage, farmers were more keen on immediate sale than storage, insufficient space, high labour requirement and inadequate knowledge and experience of the benefits of long-term storage.
Of the total production of big onion in the Hambantota district, 17 percent was sold as seeds, with the rest as bulbs for consumption purpose. Of the quantity sold as seed, a major portion was sold as seeds to the DOA at Rs. 100 per kg of bulbs. Officers from the Deputy Director of Agricultures (seed and planting material) office, Battaata, visited a selected number of farmers in the district based on the information provided by the respective AIs and purchased the diseased-free bulbs which met the quality standards stipulated by the DOA for production of onion true seeds. Of the quantity sold as bulbs, the highest share (29 percent) was sold at village fairs. In the Southern Province, the fair system is very popular so that farmers prefer selling at the fair whenever they have bulk production. The second most popular method was selling to the wholesalers (21 percent), followed by selling to retailers (13 percent).
The high susceptibility of big onions to extreme weather conditions was the main obstacle faced by the off-season growers. High susceptibility to fungal diseases, inconsistency in timing between water supply and water demand for big onion cultivation, insufficient experience in cultural practices, limited knowledge of disease control, unsuitability of selected land and soil condition, and high cost of cultivation than expected were the other problems faced by off-season big onion farmers.
Financial viability of off-season cultivation
As revealed in the study, the average yield from off-season cultivation in Hambantota was as low as 3,387kgs per acre compared to the average yield from the Matale peak season - 8,801kgs per acre. Early adopted off-season growers were provided with seeds and polythene approximately worth Rs 26,000 per 0.5 acre for nursery management, as an initial incentive. The calculated profit per acre of off-season big onion cultivation excluding imputed cost and including subsidies was Rs. 87,349 and the same value (without any subsidy) was Rs. 598,472 in Matale. Hence, the cost of production of a kilo of big onion excluding imputed cost was Rs. 53.60 in the Hambantota district as opposed to the value of Rs. 17 recorded in the Matale district.
The widest gap between cost of cultivation (CoC) values in the two districts (including imputed cost, without considering the subsidies) was observed under the component of transplanting, which recorded a value of Rs. 23,285. Further, a gap of Rs. 18,643 was recorded under the component water management and a gap of Rs. 13,064 was observed under the component of nursery management. In all the above instances, the value of labour cost in the Hambantota district was higher than that in the Matale district. Therefore, it is obvious that the CoC in the Hambantota district was higher than that in the Matale district mainly due to high labour cost reported in Hambantota. Further, the study found that the total labour requirement for big onion cultivation in Matale was approximately 130 man days, while the same figure for the Hambantota district was around 170. As discovered, the high labour cost is mainly attributed to less experience in big onion cultivation.
However, if Hambantota farmers could have achieved the expected off-season average yield of 6,000kg per acre, they could have earned profit (including imputed cost) amounting to Rs. 177,730 per acre, even at the current average selling price of Rs. 68.03 per kg, from off-season cultivation.
Therefore, findings of the survey support the fact that there is a possibility of continuing off-season big onion cultivation as a profitable venture with the following alteration to the current programme.
Recommendations
In the Hambantota district, the water distribution calendar of major irrigation canals was prepared by focusing on Maha paddy cultivation and third season cultivation of mung beans in paddy lands. As a result, the vegetative growth stage of off-season big onion cultivation is most unlikely to receive adequate water via major irrigation from February to April. Small-scale scattered big onion fields also caused water distribution to be even more difficult.
Therefore, it appeared that encouraging farmers to cultivate big onion in the most suitable spots (probably in Beralihela and Sooriyawewa ASDs) in large-scale concentrated manner and then negotiating with irrigation authorities to give priority to big onion cultivation in releasing water to that particular area remains a viable solution.
Ensuring that farmers take immediate pre and post measures to minimise the negative effects of inclement weather to the standing crop is another suggestion. Farmers need to be made aware of measures taken to reduce the rate of spread of diseases during an epidemic outbreak. More exposure visits to areas which have a long history of big onion farming such as Dambulla, Kimbissa and Sigiriya is vital.
One can assume that labour efficiency of onion cultivation in Hambantota might increase and the cost of a unit of labour might decrease to the level of Matale, if cultivation continued for a few more seasons. Therefore, it is recommended that the subsidy for seeds and polythene at least a period of two more consecutive seasons be extended to retain farmers interested in cultivation.
Farmers need to be made aware of potential benefits and encouraged to use the recommended rate of organic matter to the soil in order to reduce the threat of diseases and to boost the yield. In the meantime, measures should be taken to make organic fertilizer easily available for the small-scale farmers of the district.
A separate breeding programme should be initiated targetting off-season cultivation particularly to breed varieties producing around 6,000kg per acre under inclement weather conditions.
There is an avenue for a comprehensive onion seed production programme in the district, with selected resource-rich farmers by using a protected agriculture technique.
Providing assistance to reduce post-harvest losses through introducing improved methods such as ventilated cabins would be helpful.
The DOA needs to undertake a comprehensive follow-up programme to make necessary changes to the existing programme.

Malinda Pushpakumara takes 12/171
Proteas Emerging team falls foul to spin
The problems the South African senior team encountered in the two-Test series against Sri Lanka which they lost 2-0 seems to have affected their second side as well when their Emerging team suffered a four-wicket defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka Emerging team in the first 4-day unofficial test concluded at FTZ Sports Complex grounds, Katunayake yesterday.
The Proteas batting in the second innings collapsed to the left-arm spin of Sri Lankas Malinda Pushpakumara to be shot out for 109, which left Sri Lanka Emerging the task of chasing 310 for victory which they reached quite handsomely.
Pushpakumara who had captured six wickets for 126 in South Africa Emergings first innings of 394-9 declared was virtually unplayable in the second innings when he picked up a further six wickets for 45 runs off 23 overs to end with a match bag of 12 for 171. In Sri Lanka Emergings run chase Test discard Kaushal Silva captaining the side led the way with solid knock of 91 off 166 balls (10 fours).
Following his dismissal at 170-4 the run chase was continued by youngsters Shammu Ashan, Kamindu Mendis and Chamikara Karunaratne. Ashan scored 49 off 94 balls (7 fours, 1 six) and after he was out, Mendis and Karunaratne figured in an unbroken seventh wicket stand of 67 runs to see their team home.
Mendis struck 10 fours in his 94-ball innings of 67 not out and Karunaratne 32 not out off 43 balls with 2 sixes and 3 fours.
Scores:

Qatars World Cup bid used black operations: UK report
LONDON, Saturday: Qatar's World Cup team used a secret black operations propaganda campaign to undermine rival bids in violation of Fifa rules, a British Sunday broadsheet has reported.
The Sunday Times claims whistleblower emails show the bid team paid a PR firm as well as former CIA agents to disseminate fake propaganda concerning main rivals Australia and the US during their campaign to host the 2022 competition.
Qatar's strategy was to recruit influential individuals in order to attack bids in their native countries, creating the impression there was zero support to host the World Cup among the population, the paper said. One of the core criteria considered by Fifa, world football's governing
body, is said to be that the bids should have a strong backing from domestic populations.
Bidders are also prohibited from making any written or oral statement of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association under Fifa guidelines. But one of the leaked emails the Times claims to have obtained was sent to Qatar's deputy bid leader Ali al-Thawadi, and allegedly shows the state was aware of plots to spread poison against other bidders in the running before Qatar won the right to host the cup in December 2010. Such actions went as far as planning a resolution for US congress on the harmful effects of the American World Cup proposition during the week of the vote, as well as approaching and paying a US professor $9000 (7723
Euros, 6865) to compose a report on the economic burden the competition would present.
The Sunday Times claimed the documents were leaked to the paper by a whistleblower who worked with the Qatar bid on the World Cup campaign.  AFP

Recycle for sustainable gardening
Maintaining a Home Garden will cost you little or nothing. You wont even feel it. You can reap a bountiful, plentiful and abundant harvest and even have an excess by using items in your house that you plan to throw away. Green Thumbs speaks to District Agriculture Instructor of Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office K. N. K. Jayathilake on how one can have a completely self- sufficient life with minimal effort.
In maintaining an efficient home garden the planting material must be well prepared. If it is prepared in such a way then there can be a continuous supply of crops that can be harvested. Planting material can be divided into two. They are crops that can be directly planted in beds as seeds, and crops that can be planted/raised in nurseries and then planted in the home garden such as Chili, Brinjals, Tomato and Cabbage, said Jayathilake.
When planting in the nursery you can use items such as Yoghurt Cups, Ice Cream cans, Paper Bags, milk containers, plastic bottles and Coconut shells. These are items that are normally discarded in households. With these discarded items you can make an investment that will last you years.
You can grow a diverse amount of crops, which can be looked after well, and you can raise the required amount for the consumption of your family. However you need a good soil medium. The soil medium should consist of Top Soil and Organic Manure. The items of Yoghurt cups, ice cream cans, paper bags and Coconut shells can be filled with this medium. There should be also adequate sunlight in the nurseries. The seeds can be planted in these items and soon the plants will grow, stated Jayathilake.
However before planting the seeds in the nursery, the seeds must be dipped in water for about 12 hours and then planted. This will ensure that the plants come up quickly. After planting seeds the plants will appear in 3-7 days.
After seeds are planted in nurseries a covering can be used above the plants (Goniya). After the plants start to appear then that covering can be removed. Slowly these plants need to be exposed to the sunlight. After around three weeks the healthy plants can be planted in the home garden. The soil mound containing the plant is removed and planted in the home garden. If all of this is done correctly there will be no shortage of crops in your home garden, explained Jayathilake
Also if you have excess space in your home garden you can sell the excess harvest to the market. So in addition to your self-sufficient lifestyle you also have an extra income.
The items used  yoghurt cups, ice cream cans, paper bags and coconut shells need to have a good drainage system. After the plants emerge in the nursery it has to be irrigated with a water can. It is imperative that the roots of the plant are undamaged in the soil mound. So as you can see, in your home garden the nursery is an essential feature. Also, to protect the plants against insects you can use neems, pointed out Jayathilake.
For the more ambitious of home gardeners nursery trays can be used.
These can be rigifoam or plastic containers with holes. These holes can be filled with the soil medium and then the seeds are planted. Then the covering/ goniya is applied and the plants appear. The covering is taken off and then the soil mound containing the plant can be planted in the home garden, said Jayathilake
Just think you can buy a Yoghurt cup for Rs. 35. If you buy 10 yoghurt cups during one month that would cost you around Rs. 350 for that month! If you want some Coconut shells/ husks why not drive over to the village and pick up some coconuts which wont cost you a dime except for the petrol. Maybe even you can buy a few milk containers because one milk container will cost you Rs. 220.
Three will cost you Rs.660. And what about some ice cream cans/container One will cost you Rs. 350. Five will cost you Rs. 1750. All together this will all cost you around Rs. 2760.
But with a well organized home garden it is an investment for a year. Just remember we know that buying vegetables every week from the market place will cost you between Rs. 2000- 3000. But by spending Rs. 2760 for one month you are covered for the whole year. Incredible is it not Of course you will need to spend money on good seeds but then again it is all worth it!
And remember if there is an excess you can sell it. And get some additional income. Also since times are hard you can even be the model neighbor and give an excess if you have to your fellow neighbours. Maybe you can even encourage your neighbours to have home gardens themselves. Then you can have an entire local network of people operating home gardens. Think of the huge benefits - a whole self sufficient neighbourhood helping each other out, a whole network of families consuming healthy food and saving money. We may even see the transformation of an entire town. Home gardens are a wonderful experiment. The possibilities are mind boggling! Children will in turn learn about home gardens and entire generations can be transformed. Spending under Rs. 3000 you can save up on thousands. This will even take care of medical expenses. Visits to the doctor will be rare because there will be no health complaints.
What we have here is a unique way of living. Something that is futuristic. Think what this will mean to poverty If people can grow their own food then they can spend minimally. Then all they need to think of is electricity, water and Wi-Fi. It is a whole new world of opportunity.
Also think what it will mean for our lives We can have free time for ourselves without needing to go to the supermarket all the time saving on transport and time with fresh fruits and vegetables at your doorstep.

Rise of the mummy
A couple weeks back, archaeologists in Egypt discovered an unopened sarcophagus that was black in colour and mysterious in origin. Some reasonably worried if researchers opened the lid, a curse would be cast upon the land, and a plague of locusts (or some other sort of old-timey malady) would devour the earth.
Well folks, they opened the sarcophagus, and so far, so good on the curse front. What the archaeologists found instead were the decomposed bodies of three non-royal people and a whole lot of red liquid that looked somewhat cursed in its own right.
Now, 17,645 people (as of this writing) have signed a Change.org petition to drink the red coffin juice. Specifically, to drink it in the form of some sort of carbonated energy drink so we can assume its powers and finally die. Be the change you want to see in the world, I guess
According to the Egyptian Antiquities Minister, the Pharaoh Punch is not juice for mummies that contains an elixir of life or red mercury; its just sewage water that leaked into the sarcophagus. Your finest dead body-infused shit water, if you will.
In response, the petitions creator posted, Please stop trying to tell me the skeleton juice is mostly sewage thats impossible everyone knows skeletons cannot poop.And the signatures keep piling up.
For now, the sarcophagus is headed to a military museum and the dead bodies are headed to the Alexandria National Museum. As for the bone juice, it was presumably drained and disposed ofor at least, thats what some lucky archaeologists enjoying it all to themselves want us to think. Too bad. It wouldve made one hell of a Four Loko spin-off. NDTV

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Rs.50 billion has been allocated for the development of Kataragama sacred city.
He said the present regime inaugurated a mammoth development plan that was never inaugurated by any previous regime for the sylvan shrine area of Kataragama.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the Sella Kataragama sylvan shrine after inspecting work on the construction of the resting place and park.
He said that shops and retail outlets scattered all over Kataragama in a haphazard manner will be relocated under one roof according to a plan mooted by the Urban Development Authority. The Vedasitikanda sylvan shrine area also will be developed along with Kataragama sacred city. The chairman and opposition leader of the Kataragama PS have joined hands to make these development programmes a success.
The minister said that poverty exists in alarming proportions in the Moneragala district. As such, they have to focus their attention on that district. He said that Menik Ganga is a river of great importance and steps would be taken to stop the pollution around the river. The crocodiles in the river would be relocated to prevent devotees from attacks. Minister Ranjith Maddum Bandara was also present on the occasion.

Stable performance with momentum
According to the statistics released by Chinas National Bureau of Statistics, Chinas GDP growth rate in the first half of 2018 reached 6.8%. The national economy sustained the momentum of steady and sound development with its inner stability and coordination strengthened, outstanding achievements in transformation and upgrading, new growth drivers thriving and the quality and performance improving steadily. This is good news for the whole world.
Cheng Xueyuan
Ambassador of the Peoples
Republic of China to Sri Lanka
There were a few highlights in Chinas economic development. National economy performed within an appropriate range. The growth rate of GDP was 6.8% for the first quarter, and 6.7% for the second quarter, staying within the medium-high range between 6.7% and 6.9% for 12 quarters consecutively. Domestic demand was constantly increasing, and has become the main driving force of economic development. In the first half of 2018, the total retail sales of consumer goods were 18 trillion yuan, increasing by 9.4% compared with last year. Among them sales online were 4.1 trillion yuan, representing a year-on-year growth of 30.1%. The volume of the express business was 17.85 billion pieces, increasing by 28.3%. New growth drivers developed rapidly.
The value added of high-tech industry, equipment manufacturing industry, and emerging sectors of strategic importance increased by 11.6%, 9.2% and 8.7% respectively. A multitude of new forms of industry, new models and new technology was booming.
Financial and fiscal sectors
We have achieved relatively full employment and around 6.13 million new urban jobs were created in the first five months. The quality and performance were constantly improving. The profits of enterprises have sustained relatively high growth, with the total profits of enterprises above designated size reaching 2.7 trillion yuan, a year-on-year growth of 16.5%. The balance of payments has improved and trade surplus in goods in the first half of 2018 was 901.3 billion yuan. Risks in key areas were generally under control. Structural de-leveraging was advancing in order, the growth of macro leverage ratio slowing down and leverage ratio of enterprises continuing to decline. The financial and fiscal sectors were operating soundly on the whole. In the first half of 2018, the general public budget income exceeded 10 trillion yuan, increasing by 10.6% compared with last year.
Chinas economy is featured by great potential, strong resilience and much leeway. China has a vast territory, a large population and a huge market. It is hard to imagine the broad prospect of the Chinese market if one has not experienced the dynamism and potential of the Chinese economy personally. Especially, the 40 years of reform and opening-up have cultivated the largest middle-class group in the world. They have strong consumption ability and purchasing power, and a round of extensive and profound consumption upgrading is in progress.
With a vast national market and the tendency of consumption upgrading, both the potential and leeway of Chinas domestic market are huge. Meanwhile, China has accumulated abundant means and resources in its macro-regulation, and therefore is capable and confident enough in leading its economy to develop steadily in the medium and long term.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Chinas reform and opening-up and Chinas achievements in the past 40 years originate from reform and opening-up. In the new era, we will stay committed to advancing reform in all respects, stick to the problem-oriented principle, and focus on solving systematic and institutional problems obstructing economic development. We will unswervingly open wider to the outside world and constantly add new impetus to Chinas economic and social development through reform and opening-up in the new era.
It is good news for the whole world that Chinas economy registered a stable performance with good momentum. Contributing around 30% of global growth on average since 2002, China has become a key engine for world economic recovery and growth. Chinas modernization process has advanced rapidly, which brings about huge space for consumption and investment and creates more employment opportunities for the world.
Over the past four decades, more than 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty according to current UN standards, accounting for more than 70% of the global total over the same period and offering the highest contribution rate of poverty reduction to the world. China has become the worlds second largest importer and largest source of outbound visits. China ranks No.3 worldwide in terms of the annual flow of its outward foreign direct investment in 2017 and has remained as one of the top three investment destinations for many years in a row.
The world economy has already become a closely related and highly integrated global economic network. No single country could immune oneself from adverse developments casting aside the global economic system and everyone will benefit from a well-established and robust global economic system. Since China is the second largest economy in the world, the sound development of its economy could not only boost the confidence for global economic development, but also provide real opportunities and support for other economies, especially developing countries.
China International Import Expo (CIIE)
In November this year, we will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai. This is the worlds first expo themed on import and is a major policy measure of China to further open its market to the world. In the coming 15 years, China is expected to import 24 trillion USD worth of goods. CIIE will provide new opportunities for export, build new platforms for countries to share dividends of Chinas development and inject new vitality to world economic growth. Sri Lanka attaches great importance to this event and will send a high-level delegation to China. Sri Lankas black tea, rubber, gems, textiles and other featured products will come to Shanghai, exhibiting the charm of Sri Lanka to the huge Chinese market. We believe that China-Sri Lanka traditional friendship will continue to deepen on this new platform.
Though the world is complex and changing drastically, we should always stay focused and confident to accomplish great deeds. The Belt and Road Initiative is a major initiative proposed by the Chinese government. It aims at upholding the global free trade system and an open world economy, promoting coordination of economic policies for participating countries, and carrying out regional cooperation to create an open, inclusive and balanced regional economic cooperation framework which is beneficial to all. Its major goals include policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds. These five aspects form an organic whole which is the new public product offered by China to the world in the new situation. Sri Lanka is a key component of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, with Hambantota Port and Colombo Port City as the two flagship projects of the pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka under the Belt and Road Initiative.
We believe that under the guidance of the important consensuses reached by leaders from our two countries, China-Sri Lanka economic and trade cooperation will inject new vigor to Sri Lankas economic and social development, enable development achievements to better benefit our two peoples, and let ordinary people get more sense of gain.

## Title: Sun cream gives less than HALF the protection

Sun cream gives less than HALF the protection
Sun cream gives only 40 per cent the protection that manufacturers claim because people do not put enough on, experts have warned.
Tests by Kings College London show even when people used factor 50 sun cream their skin was damaged by UV rays because they had applied it too thinly.
Manufacturers base their SPF ratings on an application of 2mg of suncream for every square centimetre of skin.
But in fact people tend to put on just 0.7mg per square cm - dramatically reducing their protection.
Study leader Professor Antony Young, whose study is published in the Acta Dermato-Venereologica medical journal, said: The problem is when people read the label they assume thats the protection without thinking about the application thickness. Then they overestimate their protection, they stay out longer in the sun and they get sunburned.
Professor Young said to be properly protected people should put half a teaspoons worth on each arm and their head and neck area, and a teaspoons worth on each leg, their back and their front.
He added: If a typical woman wants to stay out in the sun all day, reapplying the sun cream three times that works out as 100ml of sun cream. For a man it is about 120ml that works out as just over half a typical 200ml bottle of sun cream per day.
You have got to slather it on reasonably generously - but its perfectly achievable, it is not over the top.
Professor Young advised people to put sun cream on each part of the body twice in succession to ensure they achieve the correct thickness and do not miss any areas.
He said the SPF system had taken years to agree and should not be changed - but said the instructions on bottles should be clearer.
Companies could do a better job of explaining how much is needed, or have a pump applicator that provides, say, an arms worth for each pump.
As part of the study the research scientists exposed 16 fair-skinned volunteers to different levels of UV rays on a sun bed, with different degrees of sun cream protection. They then examined the skin to check the damage. Those who put on the recommended sun cream thickness sustained far less damage than those who used the average amount normally used in real life.
Professor Young said: It also shows why we shouldnt rely on sunscreen alone for sun protection, but we should also use clothing and shade. -dailymail

Super productive gardening tips
Imagine harvesting nearly half a ton of tasty, beautiful vegetables from a 15-by-20-foot plot, 100 pounds of tomatoes from just 100 square feet, or 20 pounds of carrots from just 24 square feet. Yields like these are easier to achieve than you may think.
Here are seven high-yield strategies gleaned from gardeners who have learned to make the most of their garden space.
1. Plant in raised beds with rich soil
The fastest way to get that deep layer of fertile soil is to make raised beds. Raised beds yield up to four times more than the same amount of space planted in rows. Thats due not only to their loose, fertile soil but also to efficient spacing. By using less space for paths, you have more room to grow plants.
2. Round out the soil in your beds
The shape of your beds can make a difference, too. Raised beds become more space-efficient by gently rounding the soil to form an arc. A rounded bed that is 5 feet wide across its base, for instance, could give you a 6-foot-wide arc above it. That foot might not seem like much, but multiply it by the length of your bed and youll see that it can make a big difference in total planting area.
3. Plant crops in triangles instead of rows
To get the maximum yields from each bed, pay attention to how you arrange your plants. Avoid planting in square patterns or rows. Instead, stagger the plants by planting in triangles. By doing so, you can fit 10 to 14 per cent more plants in each bed.
4. Grow climbing plants to capitalize on space
No matter how small your garden, you can grow more by going vertical. Grow space-hungry vining cropssuch as tomatoes, pole beans, peas, squash, melons, cukes, and so onstraight up, supported by trellises, fences, cages, or stakes.
Growing vegetables vertically also saves time. Harvest and maintenance go faster because you can see exactly where the fruits are. Fungal diseases are also less likely to affect upward-bound plants s thanks to the improved air circulation around the foliage.
5. Pick compatible pairings
Interplanting compatible crops saves space, too. Consider the classic Native American combination, the three sisters: corn, beans, and squash. Sturdy cornstalks support the pole beans, while squash grows freely on the ground below, shading out competing weeds.
Other compatible combinations include tomatoes, basil, and onions; leaf lettuce and peas or brassicas; carrots, onions, and radishes; and beets and celery.
6. Time your crops carefully
Succession planting allows you to grow more than one crop in a given space over the course of a growing season. That way, many gardeners can harvest three or even four crops from a single area. For instance, follow an early crop of leaf lettuce with a fast-maturing corn, and then grow more greens or overwintered garlic  all within a single growing season. To get the most from your succession plantings:
7. Stretch your season by covering the beds
Adding a few weeks to each end of the growing season can buy you enough time to grow yet another succession crop  say a planting of leaf lettuce, kale, or turnips  or to harvest more end-of-the-season tomatoes.
To get those extra weeks of production, you need to keep the air around your plants warm (even when the weather is cold) by using mulches, cloches, row covers, or cold frames.

Ton-up Tamim leads Bangladesh to series triumph against Windies
Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis: Bangladesh held off a late charge from the West Indies to claim a series-clinching 18-run win in the decisive third and final match of their one-day international duel at Warner Park in St Kitts on Saturday.
After Tamim Iqbals second hundred of the series and a quickfire unbeaten half-century by Mahmudullah paced the visitors to a formidable 301 for six, the hosts were restricted to 283 for six in reply despite a rampaging unbeaten 74 off just 41 balls by Rovman Powell.
It was Bangladeshs first series win outside of Asia for nine years, set up by their highest total in an ODI against the West Indies.

With the series all square following the hosts thrilling three-run win in the second match under lights in Guyana on Wednesday, Bangladesh set the pace in this decider with their top-order batting justifying the decision by captain Mashrafe Mortaza to bat first after he won the toss for the third consecutive time.
Tamims confident 103 off 124 balls with seven fours and two sixes again provided his team with a solid foundation, his innings lifting his tally in the three matches to 287 runs at an outstanding average of 143.5.
He was the obvious choice as both man of the match and man of the series.
We put a lot of effort in this series after the disappointments of the Test matches, said Tamim.
I was required to bat long and was able to do it successfully. Patience is the key to get runs on the pitches we had in this series, especially in Guyana.
As in the first two ODIs, Tamim found a reliable partner in Shakib al Hasan, the pair putting on 81 runs for the second wicket.
They picked up the pace from a stuttering start in the manner of their previous second-wicket partnerships in the series before Shakib eventually departed off the bowling off Ashley Nurse, who together with fellow spinner Devendra Bishoo put a brake on Bangladeshs progress through the middle of the innings.
However they were able to cut loose over the final 20 overs as 150 runs were plundered in that period, thanks in the main to the unbridled aggression of Mahmudullah.
He had come to the crease when Nurse took his second wicket in bowling Mushfiqur Rahim and immediately went into attack mode, his adventurous knock of 67 not out occupying 49 deliveries and embellished with five fours and three sixes.
Tamim eventually reached his 11th ODI hundred in the 38th over but didnt get much further as a miscued sweep off Bishoo offered a catch to Powell at backward square-leg.
Big-hitting Mashrafe promoted himself up the order in a clear statement of intent, his frenetic 36 off 25 balls putting the West Indies under immense pressure during the final ten overs until his opposite number, Holder, dismissed him.
But with Mahmudullah still blazing away Bangladesh were able to cross the 300-run mark in the final over of the innings.
With a rejuvenated Chris Gayle anchoring their reply, the West Indies remained on course for the daunting target until the big left-hander fell for 73 off 66 balls, Mehidy Hasan taking the catch at long-on in Rubel Hossains first over.
From there the innings stalled fatally as Shai Hope occupied 94 deliveries in getting to 64 and by the time he fell, with the score at 224 for five in the 44th over, the West Indies had left themselves with too much to do notwithstanding Powells effort.
He struck four sixes and five fours in his hurricane knock but Bangladesh did not buckle under the assault with Rubel and Mustafizur retaining their disciplines in the final two overs to seal a famous match and series triumph.
I felt 300 runs was a par score because in these conditions because it was probably the best our bowlers could do, a disappointed West Indies captain Jason Holder stated.
We didnt progress at the rate we should have in the middle overs and left ourselves with too much to do at the end.
Both teams turn their attention to a three-match T20 series beginning in St Kitts on Tuesday and concluding at the weekend in Fort Lauderdale in the United States. - AFP

Top-ranked Johnson grabs share of Canadian Open lead
TORONTO July28, 2018: World number one Dustin Johnson, aiming to bounce back from British Open disappointment, fired a seven-under par 65 on Saturday to seize a share of the USPGA Tour Canadian Open.
Johnson, who missed the cut at Carnoustie, got off to a sizzling start at the Glen Abbey golf course Oakville, Ontario with birdies at five of the first six holes.
He cooled off with bogeys at the 10th and 13th before following birdies at 14 and 15 by ramming in a 23-foot putt for eagle at the par-five 16th.
The American was tied on 17-under par 199 with overnight leader Kevin Tway and South Koreans An Byeong-hun and Kim Whee.
I was playing well, said Johnson, who is chasing a third title of the season and the 19th of his career. I didnt drive it quite as well as Id like to today. It was a little bit windy today, so it made it a little bit tougher to hit fairways.
But I felt that when I was in the fairway I hit good shots and made a lot of birdies. Kim held a one-shot lead after rolling in a 31-footer for eagle at the 16th, but he dropped a shot at 17 -- where he was unable to get up and down from a fairway bunker.
An had six birdies in his six-under 66 while Tway had six birdies in his four-under 68.
I had a lot of up-and-downs today, like between holes seven to 12, said An, who birdied all three of the par-fives on the back nine. Its been one of those nice up-and-down days, and then I grinded pretty well and I stayed patient. Thats why I was able to finish with three birdies on the par-fives. Johnson did much of his damage on the front nine. Although he missed the fairway at the first his approach left him eight feet for birdie and he was off.
After a poor tee shot at the par-five second meant he couldnt reach the green in two, he pitched uphill to set himself up for a four-foot birdie.
A textbook birdie at the third saw take a share of the lead and he followed with two more birdies at five and six.
Despite the difficulties with his driver, and the fact that he played the three par-fives on the back nine in just one-under, Johnson was encouraged after his shock early exit at Carnoustie.
I felt like I was playing well going into the Open Championship and felt like I played well at the Open, I just scored really bad, said Johnson. I felt like my mental game wasnt there. So I came here and practised a little bit and got my focus back right and have played a little better this week. Tway, hoping to follow in the footsteps of his father, 2003 Canadian Open champion Bob Tway, had fallen off the pace before birdies at 15, 16 and 18 pulled him into the leading group. AFP

How do you compete with everyones breathtaking holiday pictures on Instagram Outdo them by posing with crocodiles, obviously.
Photographer Ken Kiefer had no qualms about organising a bold photoshoot with carnivorous crocs at Chinchorro Banks in Mexico.
He took a two-hour boat ride with his wife Kimber and model Melodie Trevino for the shoot, before she managed to keep a straight face and pose underwater just metres away from the formidable creatures.
The brave models held their breath as they came face-to-face with the deadly reptiles during the daring shoot.The team used bait to entice the American crocodiles and ensured safety divers were on hand to intervene if needed.Ken, 49, said, Kimber and I were thrilled to be able to finally get in and create images with these magnificent predators. It is one of those places whose sheer beauty and immensity is overwhelming. My favourite capture is the one of my wife with the boat, safety divers and friends all above witnessing the beauty of the crocodile.
In the images, the models popped a squat on the ocean floor next to the crocs all the while smizing and keeping calm.
Wearing fabulous red and yellow dresses, Kimber and Melodie kept their composure even as the crocodiles came near them.
The pair still posed looking straight into the creatures eyes. Metro

Walking the extra mile for a smile
Arrival of a new born baby is a dream come true experience to every parent. Filled with enormous hopes and promises, they begin to build their whole world in and around the child. Smiles and tears of joy would encompass them; new future begins to find its roots. However, their life would soon encounter with a miserable experience of diagnosing their child with a cardiac disease. There are hundreds of kids waiting to bloom into the world down with heart diseases and of course heart-broken parents. How treacherous it would be for parents to see their child (their whole world) shattered with hopes and dreams How agonizing it would be to see those children with faded smiles fighting for their breath We believe that being united as one family can wipe the tears of pain and hopelessness of these parents.
We firmly believe that we can make them hopeful again. It is in this firm belief that triggered in the hearts of students, teachers, parents, past pupils and well - wishers of Sri Lankan School Muscat, Oman made them to march forward (the walkathon) an extra mile to soothe their beleaguered breathing and bring back the lost smiles.
Therefore, on July 31 from 3pm onwards family of Sri Lankan School Muscat, Oman will walk the extra mile (in the walkathon) from the independent square to Ridgway hospital for children, Colombo in the hope of opening the hearts and minds of the public about the cardiac diseased children and find monetary support to LITTLE HEARTS FUND. The school has geared up for the task in keeping with ideal of education and to celebrate 30 years of Academic Excellence.
The school considers that it is essential to inculcate good values and inspire with highest form of discipline in order to create a holistic and humane student. Being with the less fortunate, feeling with the society and its needs, understanding the ground level realties of the world are new trends of educational formation that the school has adopted. We join hands not only to collect funds to support these kids who are deprived of childhood like other children, but also to inculcate in our students to be empathetic human beings.

What you (probably) didnt know about Roman women
How much is known about the lives of women in ancient Rome From breastfeeding to unusual beauty regimes, women who lived in the Roman empire would have faced many of the same pressures as women in the modern world. But what is known about the lives of the Roman empresses Were girls allowed to be educated And could women divorce their husbands
Alternative to breastfeeding
Wealthy Roman women did not usually breastfeed their own children. Instead, they handed them over to a wet-nurse  usually a slave or hired freedwoman  who was contracted to provide this service. Soranus, influential author of a second-century work on gynaecology, prescribed that a wet-nurses milk might be preferable in the days after the birth, on the grounds that the mother could become too exhausted to feed.
He did not approve of feeding on demand, and recommended that solids such as bread soaked in wine should be introduced at six months. Soranus also pointed to the possible benefits of employing a Greek wet-nurse, who could pass on the gift of her mother tongue to her charge.
Yet this flew in the face of advice from most Roman physicians and philosophers. They suggested that mothers milk was best  both for the childs health and moral character  on the grounds that wet-nurses might pass on servile defects of character to the baby.
These same men opined that women who did not suckle their own children were lazy, vain and unnatural mothers who only cared about the possible damage to their figures.
Growing up
Childhood was over quickly for Roman girls. The law decreed that they could be married at as young as 12, thus capitalising on their most fertile, child-bearing years at a time when infant mortality rates were high. On the eve of her wedding, a girl would be expected to put away childish things  including her toys.
These same toys might be buried with her if she were to die before reaching marriageable age. In the late 19th century, a sarcophagus was discovered belonging to a girl named Crepereia Tryphaena, who lived in second century Rome.
Among her grave goods was an ivory doll with jointed legs and arms that could be moved and bent, much like the plastic figurines that some little girls play with today.
The doll even came with a little box of clothes and ornaments for Crepereia to dress her in. But in contrast to the much-critiqued dimensions of a modern Barbie, Crepereias doll had wide child-bearing hips and a rounded stomach.
Clearly, the message this young girl was expected to internalise was of her own future role as a mother  the achievement for which Roman women were most valued.
Legal custody
Divorce was quick, easy and common in ancient Rome. Marriage was the grease and glue of society, used to facilitate political and personal ties between families. However, marital ties could be severed at short notice when they were no longer useful to one or other party.
Unlike today, there was no legal procedure to go through in getting a divorce. The marriage was effectively over when the husband  or more unusually, the wife  said so. Fathers could also initiate a divorce on behalf of their daughters, thanks to the common practice of fathers retaining legal guardianship over their daughters even after their marriage. This arrangement enabled the brides family to reclaim any dowry paid to the husband, thus keeping family fortunes intact. However, a few husbands tried to exploit a legal loophole that stated they could keep the dowry if  according to them  their wives had been unfaithful.
Women may sometimes have been dissuaded from leaving their husbands due to the fact that the Roman legal system favoured the father rather than the mother in the event of divorce. In fact, a Roman woman had no legal rights at all over her own children  the patrilineal relationship was all-important. Sometimes, however, if it were more convenient to the father, children would live with their mothers after divorce, and strong ties of affection and loyalty might remain even after the break-up of a household.
A famous example of this is the case of emperor Augustuss daughter Julia and her mother Scribonia, who was cast aside in favour of the emperors third wife Livia when Julia was a newborn.
When Julia was later also cast into exile by her father on account of her rebellious behaviour, Scribonia voluntarily accompanied her grown-up daughter to the island of Ventotene (known in Roman times as Pandateria), where she had been banished.
Education
The education of women was a controversial subject in the Roman period. Basic skills of reading and writing were taught to most girls in the Roman upper and middle classes, while some families went further and employed private tutors to teach their daughters more advanced grammar or Greek.
All of this was intended to facilitate a girls future role in managing a household and to make her a more literate, and therefore entertaining, companion to her husband. Although very little writing by women is preserved from antiquity, that doesnt mean that women didnt write. Letters between soldiers wives, discovered at the Roman fort of Vindolanda on Hadrians Wall, illustrate something of the busy social scene of life on the frontier, and we know that Neros mother, Agrippina the Younger, wrote a memoir, which  much to historians frustration  has not survived.

Why art is essential for democracy
One of the functions of art, Ursula K. Le Guin observed in contemplating art, storytelling, and the power of language to transform and redeem, is to give people the words to know their own experience Storytelling is a tool for knowing who we are and what we want. Because self-knowledge is the most difficult of the arts of living, because understanding ourselves is a prerequisite for understanding anybody else, and because we can hardly fathom the reality of another without first plumbing our own depths, art is what makes us not only human but humane.
That is what the philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch (July 15, 1919February 8, 1999)  one of the most lucid and luminous minds of the twentieth century  explored in a long, deep, immensely insightful 1977 conversation with the British broadcaster and philosopher Bryan McGee, which aired on McGees television series Men of Ideas. (That, after all, was the era when every woman was man.) The transcript was later adapted and published in the altogether revelatory collection of Murdochs essays and interviews, Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature (public library)
Philosophy and art
Murdoch begins by reflecting on the fundamental difference between the function of philosophy and that of art  one being to clarify and concretize, the other to mystify and expand. She observes:
Literary writing is an art, an aspect of an art form. It may be self-effacing or it may be grand, but if it is literature it has an artful intention, the language is being used in a characteristically elaborate manner in relation to the work, long or short, of which it forms a part. So there is not one literary style or ideal literary style, though of course there is good and bad writing.
A century after Nietzsche examined the power of language to both conceal and reveal truth, and several years before Oliver Sackss trailblazing insight into narrative as the pillar of identity, Murdoch considers how we, as storytelling creatures, use language in the parallel arts of literature and living:
Literary modes are very natural to us, very close to ordinary life and to the way we live as reflective beings. Not all literature is fiction, but the greater part of it is or involves fiction, invention, masks, playing roles, pretending, imagining, story-telling. When we return home and tell our day, we are artfully shaping material into story form. (These stories are very often funny, incidentally.) So in a way as word-users we all exist in a literary atmosphere, we live and breathe literature, we are all literary artists, we are constantly employing language to make interesting forms out of experience which perhaps originally seemed dull or incoherent. How far reshaping involves offences against truth is a problem any artist must face. A deep motive for making literature or art of any sort is the desire to defeat the formlessness of the world and cheer oneself up by constructing forms out of what might otherwise seem a mass of senseless rubble.
Echoing Hemingways admonition against the dangers of ego in creative work, Murdoch cautions:
We want a writer to write well and to have something interesting to say. Perhaps we should distinguish a recognisable style from a personal presence. Shakespeare has a recognisable style but no presence, whereas a writer like D. H. Lawrence has a less evident style but a strong presewnce. Though many poets and some novelists speak to us in a highly personal manner, much of the best literature has no strongly felt presence of the author in the work. A literary presence if it is too bossy, like Lawrences, may be damaging; when for instance one favoured character is the authors spokesman. Bad writing is almost always full of the fumes of personality.
Emotional infectiousness
In a sentiment bridging William Jamess landmark assertion that a purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity and Tolstoys insistence that emotional infectiousness is what separates good art from the bad, Murdoch considers the central animating force of art:
Literature could be called a disciplined technique for arousing certain emotions. (Of course there are other such techniques.) I would include the arousing of emotion in the definition of art, although not every occasion of experiencing art is an emotional occasion. The sensuous nature of art is involved here, the fact that it is concerned with visual and auditory sensations and bodily sensations. If nothing sensuous is present no art is present. This fact alone makes it quite different from theoretical activities Art is close dangerous play with unconscious forces. We enjoy art, even simple art, because it disturbs us in deep often incomprehensible ways; and this is one reason why it is good for us when it is good and bad for us when it is bad.
Expanding upon the ideas of the ancient Greeks, so formative to our understanding of art, Murdoch offers a definition: Art is mimesis and good art is, to use another Platonic term, anamnesis, memory of what we did not know we knew Art holds the mirror up to nature. Of course this reflection or imitation does not mean slavish or photographic copying.
