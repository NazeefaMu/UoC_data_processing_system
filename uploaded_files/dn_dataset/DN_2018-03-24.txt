Sri Lanka should be proud of big brother India
Top-level officials from Sri Lanka and India used the occasion of an International Education Day to highlight what they said were deep ties between the two countries.
The bond that exists between Sri Lanka and India, from time immemorial, always we should keep that bond alive, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said on Thursday evening.
He was speaking at an event commemorating Indias Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and International Students Day at the Taj Samudra Hotel.
This (day) is a celebration as much of our abiding faith in the role of knowledge and skills in development, as it is of the unique relationship between our two countries, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.
Sri Lanka is one of the largest beneficiaries of Indias technical assistance scholarship programme, he said, with 400 short-term and around 750 long-term scholarships for higher education in India.
We have helped Sri Lanka write her development story by training her scientists, economists, engineers, and policy-makers in world-class universities across India, he said.
High Commissioner Singh Sandhu said the Indian government is trying to strengthen the scholarship programme. Last year, for the first time, Indian university entrance exams were held in Colombo.
Minister de Silva said the rise of India and Indian institutions gave countries across the global East something to be proud of.
We had a mentality to look at the West all the time, to talk about Western scientists, Western doctors, Western professionals, he said. But now that era has changed, because Asia has produced the greatest scientists, technical people, professionals, and doctors.
He said some of the best doctors of scientists working in Western countries now are of Indian origin.
We can be proud, he added. We have our own big brother on the other side of the ocean, on whom we can depend.

Aloysius revision petition on March 29
A revision application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena seeking bail from the Court of Appeal was yesterday fixed for support.
Court of Appeal Justice Shiran Goonaratne fixed the matter for support on March 29.
They were remanded in connection with the Central Bank Bond issuance.
Arjun Aloysius states that by his application he was seeking Courts Jurisdiction to set aside the order dated March 9, 2018 of the Colombo High Court in Revision Application No. HCRA 22/2018.
The High Court refused notice in the said Revision Application for affirming order dated 16-02-2018 made by the Magistrates Court of Fort in proceedings bearing No.B/8266/18, refusing the grant of Bail and committing the Petitioner to remand custody.
Aloysius states that he was arrested and produced before the Fort Magistrates Court on February 4, 2018 and committed to remand custody by the Magistrates Court of Fort on February 4 and February 16 and thereafter, at the behest of and on the strength of further reports filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, in connection with an investigation commenced upon a complaint dated 25-11-2016, made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Filing this petition through Counsel Sanath Wijewardena, Arjun Aloysius said he was arrested at his residence at approximately 7.30 am on February 4 by officers of the Criminal Investigation Department, acting under the supervision of the Attorney General.
The Petitioner had not, up to his time of arrest, been notified or summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department, for the recording of a statement from him in connection with the said purported investigation or complaint made by the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
On February 4, 2018, upon the Counsel appearing for Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena moving that the matter be called on the morning of 05-02-2018, for making their legal submissions on behalf of the suspects with regard to their release on bail, the Magistrate made order that the matter be called before the said Court on 05-02-2018 and committed the petitioner and the other suspect to remand custody, Aloysius said.
The Magistrate made order that the written submissions of the Petitioner and the 4th suspect Palisena be filed on 07-02-2018 and proceeded to make order committing the Petitioner and the fourth suspect to Remand Custody, without making any order as to the grant or refusal of bail.

China not afraid of trade war
CHINA: China warned the United States on Friday that it was not afraid of a trade war as it threatened tariffs on $3 billion worth of US goods in retaliation over President Donald Trump's moves against Chinese imports.
Beijing unveiled a hit list of products that could face duties of up to 25 percent, from fresh fruit to pork and wine, though it stopped short of pulling the trigger as it indicated its readiness to negotiate an agreement.
The latest trade action sent stocks diving as fears rise that the US, which accuses China of mass theft of intellectual property and other unfair practises, could provoke a damaging trade war.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 700 points, while Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks sank at the open.
China does not want to fight a trade war, but it is absolutely not afraid of a trade war, the commerce ministry said.
Hours earlier, Trump signed an order that also could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the US, saying it would be the first of many trade actions.
We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on, Trump said as he signed the new trade order, which could include duties as high as 25 percent.
The action did not immediately impose any new tariffs, but within two weeks US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to publish a list of the products that could be hit with tariffs, which will be followed by a period of public comment.
As Trump has marched towards a confrontation, Beijing has repeatedly warned that trade wars benefit no one and that it would not stand by as Washington imposed new punitive measures.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday suggested the new measures on intellectual property were in fact a way of bringing Beijing to the table, telling CNBC they were the prelude to a set of negotiations. China's commerce ministry warned that a 15 percent tariff on 120 goods worth almost $1 billion -- including fresh fruit, nuts and wine -- would be imposed if the US fails to reach a trade compensation agreement within an unspecified timeframe.
In a second step, a 25 percent tariff would be imposed on eight goods totalling nearly $2 billion, including pork and aluminium scrap, after further evaluating the impact of the US measures on China, the statement said. The measures were specifically in response to US steel and aluminium tariffs, which were due to take effect Friday.
The list noticeably does not include soybeans, which Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times had suggested should be targeted by Beijing.
That would be a major blow to US farmers, as a third of their soybean exports go to China in a business worth $14 billion last year.
The political stakes are high: Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 10 top soybean-producing states in the 2016 election.
Betty Wang, an economist at ANZ bank, said China's reaction is relatively mild as it tends to seek solutions through negotiations.
From China's perspective, it absolutely does not want to see a trade war. Coming back to the negotiation table is a relatively good result, Wang said. While Trump hit out at China, he authorised the suspension of steel and aluminium tariffs on key trade partners -- including the European Union and six other countries -- until May 1.
The United States had a record $337.2 billion trade deficit with China last year.

Dinesh Karthiks epic and other last-ball finishes in T20Is
Dinesh Karthiks last-ball six off Soumya Sarkar on Sunday night has found pride of place at the top of the list of best finishes in Twenty20 internationals, because it was delivered against the odds in the final of a T20I tri-series. Held back in the order while the rookie Vijay Shankar was preferred at No 5  despite never having batted at international level  the experienced Karthik entered Indias chase after Mustafizur Rahman had bowled a stunning wicket-maiden 18th over.
India needed 34 off 12 balls, and Karthik summoned his deepest resolve  he was Man of the Match in Indias inaugural T20I in 2006  to hit 22 off the penultimate over. Back on strike for the last ball of the match, from which India needed five to win, Karthik kept his cool and drove Sarkar over extra cover for a flat six to cue sensational scenes at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. With that unbelievable hit, India had chased 167 to claim the Nidahas Trophy.
On that note, here is a look at five unforgettable last-ball thrillers in T20Is.
NETHERLANDS v ENGLAND, LORDS, 2009
It was a mismatch on paper, but the result was one that got the second edition of the ICC World Twenty20 off to a memorable start, if not perhaps in the manner that the host country had in mind.
At Lords  the home of English cricket  the underdogs Netherlands consigned England to one of their most ignominious cricket defeats of all times, hitting the final ball of the match for two amid scenes of incredible drama. Having done well to keep England to 163, Netherlands batsmen did well to keep up with the asking rate with Tom de Grooth playing the innings of his life. It call boiled down to the last over from which Netherlands needed seven runs with four wickets in hand. In the end, Stuart Broad missed two run-out chances and James Foster another, with the winning run coming when Broad turned and threw at the stumps  and missed.
Immediately the Netherlands dugout was cleared and Lords painted orange as a merry band of giant-slayers went delirious, backed by a 1000-strong Dutch contingent in the stands.
ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA, ADELAIDE, 2011
Shane Watson starred with 59 off 31 balls during Australias 157/4 and then claimed superb figures of 4/15 in four overs, but still ended up on the losing side. Watson was tasked with bowling the final over of the match, from which England needed four runs. The over began with Watson claiming Graeme Swann, followed by two dot balls to Ajmal Shahzad and then a single that got Chris Woakes on strike. Woakes, on international debut, held his head and dragged the scores level with a carve past point for two and punched Watson over midwicket for the winning run. Woakes unbeaten 19 off 15 balls took England to a record eighth consecutive T20I win.
ENGLAND v INDIA, MUMBAI, 2012
A stunning finish, with Eoin Morgan dumping the last ball over the sight screen to level the series for England. Chasing Indias 177/8, the visitors were given a good start from Michael Lumb (50) and Alex Hales (43) but Yuvraj Singhs three wickets stemmed the chase. Morgan, the captain, kept pumping between the wickets and collected a few boundaries with innovation. England needed 29 from 13 balls, which became 23 from 12 when Morgan creamed Ashok Dinda for six. Jos Buttler took a six and four off the 19th over bowled by Parvinder Awana, which left England to get nine from six balls.
Dinda did well to allow six from his first five deliveries, and when Morgan began a premeditated walk across the stumps as Dinda ran in to bowl the final one, the Wankhede Stadium was on a knifes edge. MS Dhoni used the moment to summon his players for a huddle, while Morgan wore a steely look. Dinda ran in again, and this time Morgan slammed the ball straight down the ground for six.
AUSTRALIA v SOUTH AFRICA, JOHANNESBURG, 2016
Needing a win to keep the series alive, Australia pulled off a record chase. In pursuit of 205, the visitors lost early wickets to slump to 32/3 but a stunning counter-attack from Glenn Maxwell and David Warner shoved South Africa onto the back foot. Warner led the way with 77 off 40 balls, with five sixes and six fours, and Maxwell thrilled with 75 from 43 balls with seven fours and three sixes. The records tumbled. The pairs partnership of 161 was the highest ever fourth-wicket stand in T20Is, and the fourth highest overall; it was the first time that two Australian batsman had scored 75 or more in a T20I; and South Africa became the first team to twice lose a T20I after setting their opponents targets over 200.
The end was excruciating. Maxwell departed off the penultimate delivery of the 19th over and Warner off the first of the last, and only some fumbles in the field allowed Mitchell Marsh and James Faulkner to scamper the required run. Before this, the biggest total that an Australian team had ever overhauled was 192 against Pakistan during the epic 2010 World T20 semi-final.
SRI LANKA v AUSTRALIA, GEELONG, 2017
In the preceding match of this best-of-three series in Australia, Asela Gunaratne hit a match-winning 52 off 37 balls to give Sri Lanka the lead against an admittedly depleted Australian side. The series was sealed on his might two evenings later, this time with a bigger score in a bigger chase and in a bigger situation. Chasing 174, Sri Lanka had been reduced to 40/5 before Gunaratne found some support from Chamara Kapugedera (32). However, a flurry of wickets left Sri Lanka needing 48 from three overs. It was then that Gunaratne hit two fours in the 18th over and then larruped three sixes and a four off Moises Henriques in the next, meaning the asking rate had been reduced to 14 off six balls. Andrew Tye removed Nuwan Kulasekara off the first, followed by a four and six from Gunaratne. A single meant that Lasith Malinga had to face. He managed a single to put the man of the moment back on strike with two runs required off the final ball, and Gunaratne cracked it over cover for four to finish on 84 from 46 balls.

Even Fifa arent that callous - ICC wrings the life from Hong Kong cricket
Cricket is truly for all, says the International Cricket Council in a video promoting the diverse nature of its game.
How right they are  anyone can play and you can play it just about anywhere. But heres the disclaimer  unless you qualify to play for one of the 10 best cricketing nations in the world, you can forget about competing at the highest level.
At a time when Fifa is expanding its World Cup to include a massive 48 teams, 10 seems to be the magic number for the ICC.
Ten teams made it to the Super 10 stage of the 2016 World Twenty20  the part where the big boys got involved  and 10 teams will take part in next years 50-over World Cup, down from 16 in 2007.
While depriving associate nations of the chance to take part, theyve also taken away the David v Goliath clashes that fans love  at a time when one-day cricket is battling to stay relevant in the wake of T20s dominance, the same games between the same teams that play all year round does little to excite.
The powers that be did just increase the number of test playing nations from 10 to 12, but for a budding Hong Kong player that would mean very little.
Inclusion is a huge part of cricket, says the video, but it seems the ICC are referring to stories like the Hong Kong domestic helpers that formed a team rather than the actual Hong Kong team who would give anything to take on the worlds best.
It is a time of great uncertainty for Hong Kong cricket despite their historic win over Afghanistan in the World Cup qualifiers.
The sport has been booted from the Asian Games, meaning in turn that Hong Kongs cricketers are getting the boot from the Sports Institute.
Their ODI status is up in the air and hangs on their performance at a tournament the ICC hold in such high regard that theyve hidden it away in Zimbabwe with minimal exposure.
In other words, unless its India v Pakistan in a one-dayer or the Ashes, the sports governing body doesnt much care.
To give some perspective to what Hong Kong are up against in their bid to qualify for next years ODI World Cup, they need to finish in the top two in a tournament that features test-playing nations Zimbabwe, the West Indies, Ireland and Afghanistan.
However, had the World Cup featured 16 teams like it did back in 2007  or even 14 like the last iteration in 2015  Hong Kong would be right in the mix.
If they do keep their ODI status, that entitles them to continue playing official matches against other associates with the same status, but still no matches against the best of the best. So while Hong Kongs national side are better than theyve ever been  and the territorys highest-ranked sports team  it seems they are no closer to reaching the real top level.
World Cups are supposed to be festivals, events that pit minnows against heavyweights and events that sometimes see those minnows bring down those heavyweights.
In fact, it is the very reason theyve trimmed the World Cup to within an inch of its life: when Ireland defeated Pakistan and Bangladesh knocked off India in the 2007 showpiece, the ICC lost its most prized possession  India v Pakistan.
Theres a reason the ICC tries to pool the two sides together in every international tournament and it doesnt take a rocket scientist to work it out.
Of course, the Indian market is crucial, but its not going anywhere.
So while the ICC focus on their bottom line and pedal their cricket is for all nonsense, teams like Hong Kong are left to sit back and ponder just how little the suits they trust to run the game actually want them strutting their stuff on the world stage.
Truth is, Hong Kong sportspeople are largely a realistic lot  decades of mediocrity has ensured that  but they need a dream to cling to.
However, it seems the ICC are destined to wring the life out of any team that isnt already in the games top echelon.
Even the corrupt mob over at Fifa arent that callous.

If there was an auction in Test cricket:
Five players who could get the highest bid
The IPL auction has always been a fascinating event in the cricketing calendar. Over the years, lots of unknown players have become overnight superstars by fetching big bucks for the auction. Since the IPL auction is meant for T20 cricket, it is sad to see a lot of veteran players who have played for their sides for years in Tests but not particularly suited for T20 format get ignored.
Let us assume a hypothetical situation of an auction being conducted for Test cricket on Indian pitches.
If it were to happen, it would be a different ball game altogether! Even though many of the players from the IPL would still fetch a decent amount at this Test auction, few will be left out and many seasoned Test cricket campaigners will attract huge bids. Here is a look at 5 players who would rock the auction if it were meant for Test cricket. Note: It is assumed that the players are up for grabs at the auction for an IPL-like Test tournament meant to be played in India. - SK
DALE STEYN
On his day, Steyn can destroy any batting line-up with his devasting pace
With 86 Tests and 419 wickets, the Phalaborwa-born pacer is arguably the best fast bowler in the modern era.
He is on the brink of breaking Shaun Pollocks record of most Test wickets by a South African fast bowler.
His ability to rattle batsmen with sheer pace is second to none. Other than that, he is a very good exponent of outswing as well. Steyn is a kind of bowler who does not need conditions to aid him. Not only he is devastating on juicy pitches at Durban and Cape Town, but on subcontinent pitches too, Steyns record has been impressive.
T20 may not be his preferred format, but if Steyn goes under hammer for a Test auction, he will have dollars raining all over him.

NATHAN LYON
Nathan Lyon has been the best off-spinner for Australia in their history of Test cricket
Nathan Lyon is the best off-spinner Australia have had in their 140-odd years of Test cricket. The New South Wales off-spinner has the ability to play both, the aggressive and defensive game with the ball.
On a pitch which does not have a lot of turn and bounce to offer, Lyon is quite happy to play the second fiddle to the fast bowlers. But come the turning tracks, he is as deadly as any! After almost 75 Tests, Lyon is closing in on 300 Test scalps. He will be the first Australian off-spinner to get there.
If Lyons name comes up at the auction, teams will not mind spending a big chunk of their purse, since by doing so they can feel assured about having a quality spinner in their ranks.
RANGANA HERATH
Crafty spinner Rangana Herath is Sri Lankas second-best spinner after Muralitharan.
The Sri Lankan spin wizard has been the pillar of the spin department ever since the retirement of the great Muttiah Muralitharan. For several years, Herath remained under the shadow of Muttiah Muralitharan. It was only in his 30s and after the retirement of Murali that Herath started to blossom at Test level.
With 415 wickets from 89 Tests, Herath has the most wickets by any left-arm bowler in Test cricket.
His orthodox style of bowling is not suited much for the abbreviated formats of the game. But in Test cricket, very few can beat Herath in perseverance.
Arguably one of the greatest spinners of contemporary times, Herath would certainly be a worthy inclusion on the list of million-dollar boys.
CHETESHWAR PUJARA
Pujara is Indias new Wall at No.3 after Rahul Dravid
This is not an exaggeration. You would put your money, property and everything to have a batsman like Cheteshwar Pujara in your side.
Very few batsmen show as much resilience as Pujara does when he is at the crease. Unlike many modern-day players, Pujara doesnt have a wide range of innovative shots and the power which are the basic ingredients in T20 cricket. Hence, Pujara is overlooked in this format of the game because of his low strike rate. But, he sure does have all the essentials of Test-match batting like patience, solid technique and ability to wear bowlers down. He is best equipped to weather all kinds of bowlers on any pitch.
If there were a Test auction, word would be spare 10 crores for this guy!
ALASTAIR COOK
Alastair Cook has been Englamds numero uno at the top of the order for the past ten years.
Alastair Cooks ODI numbers are unimpressive and T20I figures are dismal. But come Test cricket, the Essex opener is not only a cook, but the chef in all conditions.
12000 runs from 152 Tests with 32 centuries just dont come so easily to anyone. Cooks biggest strength is the ability to score daddy hundreds without breaking a sweat. This is evident from the fact that he has 11 scores of 150+ at Test level including 5 double hundreds.
If he was up for grabs, Cook would surely grab the eyeballs of spendthrifts, for he is an invaluable asset at the top of the order and perhaps the only one in modern day cricket who is looked upon breaking Sachin Tendulkars record.

The government is confident of defeating the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as it was signed only by 52 members of the Joint Opposition, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said on Thursday .
The Minister was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected UNP members of the Negombo Municipal Council.
"The motion would defiantly not pass since we already have a support of majority of 127 MPs. There was a no-confidence motion against me some time ago. But I defeated it," the Minister said.
"Therefore, we do not have to worry about this matter, he added.
He said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was still trying to come back to power raising various issues. "But his attempts will not be successful by any chance," he said.
The Minister said these members have to visit house by house in the area to listen to the grievances of the people and to provide urgent solutions for them.
"Newly elected members should work towards achieving reconciliation among all communities living in Negombo. Various communities and religious groups are living in Negombo and we have to create a conducive environment for all of them to live together peacefully. Negombo is one of the UNPs main bastions and it is our duty to protect it, he said.

The government's focus has been drawn to amend the law that enables some foreigners who invest USD 250,000 to establish an industry in the country, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister made this observation in response to a question made by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena on an Indian Company being allowed to set up a footwear manufacturing company in the Country. Minister Samarawickrama stated that each year approximately 3 million pairs of shoes are imported to the country and approval is granted to manufacture only two million pairs.
He added that due to this reason local footwear manufacturers would not be affected by this move.
Minister Samarawickrama said however, that according to the country's existing law, anybody who invests USD 250,000 in the country could establish a factory in Sri Lanka.

Harsha takes SEC to task
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva severely criticised the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its failure to bring to book any of the persons responsible for fraudulent practices at the Colombo Stock Exchange over the past years. The State Minister taking part in the Parliamentary debate on the Demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange Bill on Wednesday, pointed out that the SEC has not acted against anybody who engaged in pump and dump schemes at the stock market.
When I was an Opposition Member of Parliament, I persistently spoke in this Parliament as to how the Stock Market was being manipulated through pump and dump schemes. I exposed how the shares bought at Rs 35 were sold to the EPF after boosting the price to Rs 200.
Now where are those rogues Not a single culprit has been brought to book.
The investigations were not completed, Dr de Silva noted.
De Silva said an invisible hand was behind the inaction of SEC. If those currently holding office at the Commission are unable to complete those investigations and prosecute the culprits, we need to replace them with those who can. We must take legal action against those culprits within the remaining span of this Government, he stressed. De Silva also castigated the SEC for trying to interfere on Government affairs by using an Asian Development Bank Consultant.
We are brining legislation to demutualize the stock exchange, but we will do it on our own terms, not on the terms of some consultant who is sitting at the SEC and telling the Government how to run our affairs, he said.

New vistas in foreign policy
The world is vastly different than it was even 10 years ago, leave alone the days of the Cold War between the USSR (Soviet Union) and the Western bloc led by the USA. Traditional power blocs and alliances have fractured, new political entities have captured power in many countries and there are entirely new challenges such as modern day slavery and human trafficking.
There is one defining factor that can no longer be ignored or denied: The East is rising. Asia is fast becoming the new centre of political and economic power due to the rise of China, India and Japan. No country can ignore this development and Sri Lanka is no exception. Sri Lanka has always maintained friendly relations with Western and Eastern countries, except for the last few years of the former regime when the country was more or less internationally isolated over human rights issues.
A sound foreign policy should be a cornerstone of Government policy. It is in this context that Sri Lanka played a key role in the evolution of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in the 1960s. While many say that the NAM per se has lost its relevance in the modern world, those concepts are still cherished by many developing nations including Sri Lanka.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering what can be described as a masterclass in international relations at the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS) on Thursday, alluded to this global shift of power to Asia, saying Sri Lanka has to recalibrate its foreign policies to become a meaningful player in the Asian region. This is indeed a very pertinent observation in the context of modern foreign policy challenges. Sri Lanka has already repaired its damaged relationship with the West, regained trade concessions such as GSP Plus and strived to address the Human Rights concerns of the International Community. But there is a lot more to be done in terms of recognizing the shift of power to Asia.
The Prime Minister noted that it was vital to have good relations with China, Japan and India individually, but it would be disastrous if someone tried to play one of them against another. After all, these three countries talk to each other often and know what is happening. As the Premier explained, Sri Lanka has very good relations with the trio and indeed, there is hardly any other country in the region that has the same level of relations with India, China and Japan as Sri Lanka does.
Of course, it does not take a degree in international relations to realise that there is a healthy rivalry among these three countries in terms of economic and political clout. Countries such as Sri Lanka should not get caught up in this rivalry, the Prime Minister rightly cautioned. There is increased focus on China mainly due to two reasons: Recent political changes saw the strengthening of Presidential power and China has boosted investment in the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. The Prime Minister recalled that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to join the OBOR in 2013, which was subsequently reaffirmed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Referring to the controversy over Hambantota Port, the Prime Minister stressed that the security of both the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota Port lies with Sri Lankan Security Forces. There is no foundation to reports that Hambantota could become a Chinese naval base.
Apart from these three countries, the Prime Minister pointed out that countries such as South Korea and Vietnam were becoming key Asian players. South Korea is in the spotlight due to the ongoing efforts to set up a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump. Sri Lanka has developed good relations with these countries as well, he said.
Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe visit key world capitals from to time on official visits to further reinforce our relations with friendly countries. Right now, President Maithripala Sirisena is in Pakistan on an official visit, following his visit to Japan earlier. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe visited Singapore and a few countries recently where the leaders assured their fullest cooperation with Sri Lanka. Many top world leaders have visited Sri Lanka after this Government came to power. Several countries such as New Zealand which did not have embassy or high commission level representation here are now in the process of opening embassies.
While political links and diplomacy are very important, one should also look at developing trade and tourism ties with key countries. Trade not aid being the new mantra, Sri Lanka is signing free trade agreements with several regional countries. It is also vital to attract foreign investors to Sri Lanka. Air links must be established with more countries.
Today, the world has more or less become a village thanks to easier travel and instant communications. Therefore, an island mentality will not get us anywhere. No country can exist in isolation. It is time to look beyond our shores and further consolidate our gains on the foreign policy front.

Pakistan National Day celebrated in Colombo
The Pakistan High Commission and the Pakistani community based in Sri Lanka celebrated the 78th National Day of Pakistan with traditional fervour and resolve to make Pakistan a strong, vibrant, progressive and democratic welfare state, a press release from the High Commission stated.
The National Day of Pakistan is celebrated every year on March 23 to commemorate the outstanding achievements of the Muslims of the sub-continent who passed the historic Pakistan Resolution on this day at Lahore in 1940, which culminated in the creation of Pakistan after seven years.

The Acting High Commissioner, on the occasion, said Pakistan greatly values its relations with Sri Lanka which are based on mutual trust and understanding. It is a matter of great satisfaction that these mutually beneficial relations, rooted in history, have become truly multi-dimensional, covering fields of politics, economy, defence and security, culture, education and people-to-people contacts, he added.
The Acting High Commissioner also extended sincere greetings and best wishes on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan to the government and people of Sri Lanka for the continued progress, peace, national unity, reconciliation and harmony in the years ahead.

Vast improvement in Govt. revenue in last 18 months: Mangala
The Government over the past 18 months had witnessed a vast improvement in its revenue and in 2017 too, enabling the government to achieve a primary surplus in the budget for the first time since the 1950s. This fiscal consolidation process has enabled the Government to regain the confidence of markets and stabilize its economy. Market interest rates had begun to decline by prime lending rates falling by 144 basis points since July, 2017, which would pave the way for investment led growth, said Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Speaking as to why the country needs to improve on tax collection, he said from 2019 to 2022, the country would face external debt repayments of approximately $15 billion. This is an unprecedented burden that this government had inherited. This year too, we have to pay the highest debt repayment of Rs. 1.9 Trillion, while next year, there are foreign debt services of Rs. 4.2 Trillion and in 2020 Rs. 3.7 Trillion," he said, adding that most of it was for loans obtained by the previous government for projects with little or no economic returns.
Presenting to Parliament five Gazette Notifications issued under the Special Excise Provisions Act No. 13 of 1989, Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera speaking on the Governments tax policies, said the government tax policies had focussed on some key principles and objectives over the last few years, first of which was to increase the share of the Government revenue which had declined to around 11% of the GDP in 2014. This would enable us to better meet our debt repayments without compromising the government's expenditure, health, education etc., increasing the share of direct taxes which was one of the lowest in the world at 18% and our objective is to raise it to 40%, to create a more progressive and relevant tax structure.
The current 82% of indirect taxes, was a result in the burden of taxes being disproportionately borne by the poorer sections of the society. We need to rectify this situation as soon as possible, by broadening the tax base to bring the informal economy into the formal sector, thus creating a level playing field by ensuring that everyone compiles and shares the burden of taxes, reduce discretion in the tax policy and shift to a simple transparent rule based framework. This requires to minimize potential corruption and reduce tax leakages due to add hoc exemptions, he noted.
The new Inland Revenue Act which would come into operation on April 1, he said, ensures that tax holidays and tax exemptions could no longer be given on the whims and fancies of the Finance Minister. We have now created a rules based framework to take such decisions. This would go a long way in increasing the state of direct taxes, enabling the Government to achieve its revenue targets in an equitable manner, ensuring that the higher income earners absorb the larger shares of the tax burden. The previously practiced ad hoc subjective tax exemptions had been estimated to amount to 1.6% of the GDP in 2015, the Minister added.
Little Hearts project in chaos: Rajitha
The little hearts project has met with a snag due to haggling between the Anesthetists and surgeons over payment ratios, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
The minister was responding to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, during the questions for oral answers round in Parliament yesterday, as to why the 'little hearts' project was being delayed, while the lives of over 1,000 children could be saved if this project gets underway.
Nanayakkara said that there are over 3,000 children in need of heart surgeries which have been stalled due to the lack of operation facilities. To address this issue, a fund was created as the little hearts project and the government too allocated Rs. 350 million for this purpose. As this project requires around Rs. 2,000 million, if as the minister you intervene and expedite this project, the lives of around 1,000 children could be saved.
In response, Minister Senaratne said the reason for the delay was that anesthetists had demanded the same fees as surgeons for their part in heart transplant surgeries. He said the usual norm internationally, was that anesthetists are paid one third of the amount paid to surgeons.
The Little Hearts fund had been made and even surgeries had been completed. This is also being funded by International Rotary clubs, but the issue here is that anesthetists are demanding 50% similar to the payment received by the surgeons.
Previously, the arrangement was that the anesthetists were paid 1/3rd of the cost. However, now they are demanding for the same amount that is being paid to surgeons. Due to this tussle between them, I am still unable to start this project, Minister Senaratne noted.
Active Liability Management Bill: 'To better manage country's debts'
As the debt burden at present was the most serious challenge facing the country, the government had to pay around Rs. Four Billion as repayments, National Policy and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said, initiating the Debate on the Active Liability Management Bill in Parliament yesterday.
This Bill is being presented in order to better manage the countrys debts. Today the interest on debts have increased from 20 percent to 80 percent. All loans obtained are not the same. Some of these loans are without any interest. Obtaining commercial loans commenced in 2006  2007. These loans differ in comparison to the previously obtained loans. It was then that the international sovereign bonds were introduced. However, these have to be paid in a short term, or bullet payment, unlike the previous long term repayment. Hence, this is a big challenge, but no government has been without paying these loans, as defaulting on payments would have severe international implications, he noted.
However, why do we need this Bill Petitioners went to the Supreme Court against this Bill. Our government through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, brought in a clause that no one could bring in, without proper procedures being followed. Previously, even the 18th Amendment was brought as a sudden Bill, leaving no room for anyone to even go to Court against it. Yet, under the Good Governance regime, we have safeguarded the rights of everyone to go to the Supreme Court and present their views. Based on that, this group went to Court.
There the Judges Sisira Abrew, Nalin Perera and Malalgoda considered all aspects presented and gave a verdict which was presented to Parliament. It determined that the Bill would have no impact in any way on the powers of Parliament in terms of finances, he explained, adding that this Bill was in accordance with the Constitution.
He noted that it was being said on political stages that loans were only obtained for development purposes. But that is not true, as there should be assets to show. We need to formulate the assets registry, which the previous regime failed to do. This Bill basically gives the Central Bank the opportunity to overcome the challenges pertaining to loan repayments, he said, adding that this Bill was essential in managing our loans.
Depositors' investments will be protected at any cost:Kiriella
The Government would take all measures to protect the investments of depositors of ETI Finance Ltd. (ETIF) and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP), in accordance with the existing laws of the country, said Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a query made by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake concerning the protection of the depositors of these two financial institutions and on rumours that are being circulated that the television and radio channels of the EAP company is to be sold to foreign companies. MP Ratnayake brought to the notice of the House that television and radio channels could not be sold to foreigners.
Minister Kiriella stated that these matters would be considered by the Central Bank and the Treasury. He added that those institutions would not act against the law and every thing would be done in accordance with the law.
The Minister also pointed out that those institutions have enough assets that could be used to pay back the depositors their due amounts if required.
'Detailed description on 475 roomed city hotel soon'
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama yesterday, stated that he would make a detailed description concerning the 475 roomed city hotel with 90 serviced apartments to be constructed at No 116, Galle Road, Colombo 3.
He made this observation yesterday, in response to a query made by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Ratnayake on the Gazette Notification (2017.12.15) that was tabled in the House by Minister Samarawickrama and was to extend the time granted to implement the project.
According to the Gazette, the above project should commence commercial operations within a period of seventy seven months from the date of the Project Agreement signed with the BOI on July 19, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2018.
The JVP Parliamentarian demanded to know the project details, while the Minister said he would present these details at a later date.
Voting flawed due to technical defect: JO behaves in disruptive manner
The Joint Opposition members yesterday, behaved in a disruptive manner when the results of the vote on the Second Reading debate on the Active Liability Management Bill which was taken by way of e-voting, flawed due to a technical defect.
The incident occurred when the e-voting machine of the seat of Minister S B Dissanayake recorded his finger print, although he was not in the House. However, Minister Mangala Samaraweera's vote had not been recorded though he had cast his vote. The Joint Opposition members who rushed to the Well of the House, began to shout slogans.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya suspended sittings at 6.10 pm, calling for a Party Leaders' meeting to find out as to what caused the mistake. The sittings resumed at 6.35 pm and the Speaker announced that the flaw haad occurred due to a technical defect.
"Minister Mangala Samaraweera whose seat was located adjoining Minister S B Dissanayake's seat, had mistakenly pressed his finger on latter's e-voting machine," Speaker Jayasuriya announced. "So the Second Reading would be taken again in the traditional manner."
However, Joint Opposition members walked out of the House in protest.
The Speaker proceeded with the process and the Second Reading and the Third Reading votes were taken accordingly.
Thereafter, the Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that the Joint Opposition members banged on the door of the Speaker after they left the House and requested for an investigation.
Active Responsibility Management Bill passed
The Active Responsibility Management Bill was passed with a majority of 51 votes in Parliament yesterday.
The Bill which was presented by National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Harsha de Silva on behalf of Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, under the title Active Liability Management Bill, was later amended as the Active Responsibility Management Bill and later passed.
The Bill was passed with 53 votes in favour, while 2 voted against. JVP MPs Bimal Rathnayake and Sunil Handunnetti voted against. JO members left the House in protest, while TNA members were not present in the House.
All facilities would be provided for Thalassaemia patients: Health Minister
The Thalassemia Unit under construction in Kandy, would be completed by October, while further facilities would be provided to all Thalassaemia Centres that offer treatment to patients, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He said so in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question posed by MP Thushara Indunil during the Oral questions for answers.
Minister Senaratne noted that there were 665 Thalassaemia patients reported from every Divisional Secretariat Division in the Kurunegala district from 2010 to date.
He said facilities have been provided to treat Thalassaemia patients in every hospital in the district.
The minister said that with the completion of the eight storied building for Thalassaemia treatment, bone marrow transplants for children could also be commenced, which could save the lives of children affected by this disease.
However, the minister said that there was no operating theater facility for Thalassemia patients or a gene bank in the district.
He noted that a programme has been initiated to identify Thalassemia carriers, while blood tests are to be done on grade ten students with the assistance of the Education Ministry.
He further noted that provision of blood for Thalassaemia affected children, provision of medications without a shortage, provision of Thalassaemia transfusion machines, modernization of Thalassaemia units and provision of specialist facilities would also be provided.
Drastic drop in smoking: Rajitha
Cigarette consumption in the country had dropped by one billion in 2017 due to the imposition of the 90 percent tax on tobacco by this government, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation, joining the Second Reading debate on the Active Liability Management Bill and debate on five orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act.
He also said that under the orders moved by the Finance Minister today, it has imposed a Rs 0.50 tax on each gram of sugar in sweetened drinks. He added that this was commendable, since sweetened drinks include more than 6 grams of sugar contained in 100 ml of sweetened drinks. The Minister said that generally a person should consume only 6 grams of sugar per day.
He added that this measure was supportive for the control diabetes and heart diseases. He also said that these orders have measures to prevent the production of artificial toddy, which has a negative effect on the health of the consumer.
He added that measures would be taken to reduce the use of oil and salt in the future. He added that with these measures, it would be easy to control noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, obesity, high blood pressure, etc. which is the country's leading cause for premature deaths.
Active Liability Management Bill: All Govts' should be ashamed for bringing this Bill - Handunnetti
The existing government as well as the one under Mahinda Rajapaksa, should be ashamed for moving this Active Liability Management Bill, as both had boasted the country's ability of taking loans, said JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti, in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation, joining the Second Reading debate on the Active Liability Management Bill, which is one to authorize the raising of loans in or outside Sri Lanka, for the purpose of Active Liability Management to improve public debt management in Sri Lanka and to make provisions for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Along with this Bill, five orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act were presented for debate.
He said that even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had exaggerated concerning the Government's ability to obtain loans, while today, the loan and premium of the country in 2019 has increased to Rs 4.2 Trillion, which was three fold of the GDP.
He added that this Government's strategy of obtaining loans to settle the existing loans, was plunging the country from the frying pan into the fire. He pointed out that development rate of the country which was 4.8 percent last year, had dropped to 3.3 percent this year. He added that the inflation rate which was 4 percent last year, had increased to 7.3 percent this year.
MP Handunnetti said that the money which was been taken by way of loans, should be deposited in Government banks. He added that the interest of the deposited monies should go to the people of this country.

Politics that transcend No Confidence moves
The recent communal clashes in Ampara and areas of the Kandy district did have harsh echoes in Geneva at the current sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council, where the United States and the United Kingdom raised related matters. The US expressed concern on ongoing reports of human rights violations and abuses by members of the security services, and recent attacks targeting members of religious minority communities in Sri Lanka. The UK expressed serious concern about inter-communal violence and hate speech against minorities, and exacerbated by recent developments, including violence against Muslims in the Kandy district that led to the proclamation of a State of Emergency for 12 days.
On the wider issues relating to the current situation on Human Rights in Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana informed the UNHRC that the countrys judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms are fully capable of and committed to the processes of advancing justice to all concerned. The Foreign Minister emphasized that The legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy, and it permeates our society to this day. Extremists constantly strive to take advantage of this situation to achieve political gain. This realization only makes us even more determined to ensure that we never return to the violent days of the past. It is our intention to ensure the fulfillment of our commitments to all our people and bring closure to a sad and disturbing period of our recent history,
Sri Lanka does have to face international criticism for any violations of Human Rights, especially minority rights, which it carries out. However, it is necessary to note that both the US and UK are not countries that have any squeaky clean record on treatment of minorities. In the US, President Donald Trump has made it clear about the governments complete disregard and even contempt for the rights of the Muslim minority, especially in the immigration bans that have been introduced on citizens from several majority Muslim countries, and the Presidents own comments on attacks on protesters from the black minority. There is plenty of evidence that his Keep America Great slogan has much to do with Keep America White. In the UK, which certainly has a better legal record on the treatment of minorities, there is considerable evidence to show that the broader picture of equality shown to the world does not apply to the minorities in many areas of community relations that affect these communities most.
Internal politics
While the Sri Lankan delegation at the UNHCR Sessions will certainly have to carry on a tough fight due to delays on implementing the issues in the Resolution of Sri Lanka, it has the benefit of being able to announce the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons, and the progress it is likely to make. The larger issue facing the country is that of internal politics that has little regard for international relations, and in fact keeps pushing the country into tougher situations with the international community, forgetting the near isolation the country was pushed into by the previous government of the Rajapaksas, in complete disregard of the need for a good judicial process in the country.
While the recent Kandy violence rings in Geneva, Police reports now confirm that of the 314 persons arrested with regard to the violence, are five members of the SLPP - the Pohottuwa breakaway from the SLFP, and unofficially led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is reported that of those arrested, 205 are from the Kandy District and 109 from other areas, the latter showing an organized move in carrying out this violence. What is necessary is speedy legal action against those arrested in this regard, bringing the necessary punishment under the law to prevent such violence in the future.
The situation that took place in Ampara and Kandy also calls for necessary steps to be taken to prevent the use and spread of Hate Speech in the country, as well as its use in social media in a manner that spreads the hatred much faster than hitherto possible. This should certainly not be looked at as a means of controlling or silencing social media; but as a means of educating social media users of their responsibility to society, especially in the building of peace and understanding through quick and good communication.
The government could benefit from the huge international criticism of Facebook over the wrongful use of user information, amounting to at least 50 million, by Cambridge Analytica to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential poll, and elections in other countries, too. Acting with the necessary respect for the Right to Information and Media Freedom, the government should quickly move to a public discussion on the role and content of social media in the context of an expanding democracy, and aware of the role of social media, especially Facebook, in our own future elections. The matter is already the subject of a major debate in Indian politics  involving both the BJP and the Congress Party.
No Confidence
As Geneva diplomacy and the post-violence in Kandy remains situations of importance for the government, the theatre of local politics has now moved on to the No Confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is the leader of the UNP. Much of the boasting by the Joint Opposition (JO) has quietened with the 55 members who have signed the motion handed over to the Speaker, including only 4 members of the SLFP in government. Another disadvantage, possibly tactical, was former President and SLFP leader, and now MP from Kurunegala, Mahinda Rajapaksa too not having signed the motion.
The UNP group in Parliament has already passed a resolution to support Premier Wickremesinghe on this issue. They are 104 members in a House of 225. The Prime Minister has already had a meeting with President Sirisena on both the politics and the government aspects of this motion. With the motion to be taken up for debate on April 4, the government and JO are certainly moving to a period of hectic political activity, which will in conclusion point to the future structure of the Unity Government.
President Sirisena who has gone to Pakistan for the Independence Day celebrations there, has not yet carried out the second half of the Cabinet shake-up, regarding the SLFP members of the government. There is little doubt that despite all the noise of the JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa, there is a considerable agitation within the SLFP, with regard to its future position as a political party. The JO will be expecting the SLFP members in government to come out in support of the Pohottuwa by the time of the coming Provincial Council polls. The SLFP members in government will also have to come to a firm decision on this, as they would otherwise not get SLPP-Pohottuwa nominations at the next General Election, come 2020.
SLFP divisions
This is the whirligig of politics within the SLFP, driven by the uncertainty of its own position within government and the unofficial opposition of the JO. There are signals that if the No Confidence issue moves to a division within the SLFP, beyond the four members who have already signed it, some key members would extend their support to the Prime Minister, with better assurances for the next General Election than with the Pohottuwa.
The SLPP and Rajapaksa also face a problem of public support for this No Confidence move, as it has excluded the failure of the government to act against the corruption of the previous government - the Rajapaksa Regime - which was the pledge given to the people in August 2015. The Central Bank Bond issue although being hugely corrupt, many do not consider it to be a corruption that should cover up all the corruption that led to the Rajapaksa defeat in 2015.
These are certainly matters that President Sirisena, the formal leader of the SLFP, should give serious consideration to, with or without any plans to contest the next Presidential Election in 2020. The Politics of Numbers, in the context of Parliamentary seats certainly stand in favour of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe, today but, the Politics of Figuring is certainly an area of vast uncertainty on the future of the Unity Government. It is necessary to take note that sections of civil society that played a key role in electing the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in Jansury 2015 and the UNP majority coalition in August 2015, have already begun organising their own plans for the future of both electoral and politics and future changes in the political structure.
In this context, the JVPs idea of the abolition of the Executive Presidency may have much greater resonance among the public, than many political parties may now accept.
Irony of time
Mahinda Rajapaksa must be pleased that he may have given Chinese President Xi Jinping, the idea of running for life as President of his country, and displeased about what he did here for himself with the 18th Amendment, being taken away by the forces of democracy.

FOR RANIL WICKREMESINGHE ON HIS BIRTHDAY
As perhaps the last gentleman politician among us celebrates his birthday, I would like to quote this poem IF by Rudyard Kipling, as a tribute to him. It is my favourite poem which to me epitomizes Ranil and his political walk, through every step of the steep and rugged pathways of that journey.
If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowances for their doubting too.If you can wait and not be tired of waitingOr being lied about, dont deal in lies,Or being hated dont give way to hating,And dont look too good nor talk too wise;If you can dream and not make dreams your master;If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
If you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two imposters just the same;If you can bear to hear the truth youve spokenTrusted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,And stop to build them up with well-worn tools;If you can make one heap of all your winningsAnd risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,And lose and start again at the beginningsAnd never breathe a word about your loss.
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinewTo serve your turn long after they are gone.
And so hold on when there is nothing in youExcept the will which says to them, hold onIf you can talk with friends and keep your virtueOr walk with kings nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds worth of distance runYours is the Earth and everything thats in it,And---which is more, youll be a Man, my son.'
These words to me suit Ranil, who is the genuine article. Those who attack him and urge his removal will Im sure realise their mistake and rue the day they did so, in the not too distant future. I was glad to meet two young men from different parts of rural Sri Lanka recently. One of them who was from Matugama came to repair my computer. The other was from the Air Force and came to train my Golden retriever pup.
They both shared my opinion of Ranil and remarked that he was a National Treasure and not appreciated as he should be, they both remarked that their friends in their areas also shared their views and were very angry with those both in and outside the party who were attacking him, asking for his removal.
They both said they would leave the country in search of employment abroad if Ranil was ousted as UNP leader and as Prime Minister as the last hope for the country was him to them and no other.

## Title: Resurgence of Tuberculosis
## Supertitle: Today is World TB Day:
## Section: Features

Today is World TB Day:
Resurgence of Tuberculosis
The World TB Day which is held annually on March 24 is intended to promote awareness, and knowledge of the seriousness of the disease and to motivate for action to be taken against TB worldwide. 135 years ago after discovery of the kochs bacillus, TB still remains an epidemic in much of the world today despite the effective cures which have being made available for decades. This lethal killer of human beings in history still prevails despite the many scientific breakthrough.
Despite discoveries to combat the diseases, today tuberculosis has manifested with a vengeance and has become the deadliest infectious disease in the world and has become the number one leading killer causing 3 million deaths per year amongst and it has created serious implications to the world economy, as it kills or disables mainly young people who form the productive sector of the economy so much so that the WHO has declared tuberculosis as a global emergency in 1993 and could affect around 90 million people worldwide within the next decade.
Tuberculosis, appearing in forms resistant to multiple drugs (MDR TB) that cannot be cured by once effective medicines together with its deadly ally, the human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) has emerged as one of the most potent threats to the existence of mankind and the biggest threat to the world economy.
Why cant tuberculosis be eliminated Simply, it is due to the low priority that tuberculosis has been assigned by health policymakers. In many low to middle income countries, any less than 1 % of the annual health budget is allocated for tuberculosis why this silence Is it because Tuberculosis is something to be swept under the carpet. The tragic consequence is, because of inadequate funding, inefficient tuberculosis control programmes which have actually led to a worsening of the world tuberculosis situation.
This is because the patients are not cured but do not die of the disease either, leaving a pool of inadequately or improperly treated patients disseminating multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the community. In other words, in a poor tuberculosis control programme, many patients will die of the disease, but there will also be half treated half dead patients disseminating the disease to healthy people. Also, if there were no tuberculosis drugs at all in a country, there would be no multi-drug resistant tuberculosis for it is the improper use of anti-tuberculosis drugs that creates multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
In the wrong dosage, wrong combination or the wrong number of the drugs, due to ignorance, patients, because they have not been told the correct dosage or combination or because, if the patient has to buy the drugs (as happens when the patients, because they have not been told the correct dosage or combination or because, if the patient has to buy the drugs (as happens when the patient consults a physician privately.) he/she may buy less than the prescribed amount of drugs or take lesser than the prescribed dose, to make the drugs last longer, or because he has no money to buy all the drugs, because they may produce poor quality drugs which may not have the correct quantity of drugs in them.
However, all is not that gloomy. It has been shown conclusively in countries poorer than Sri Lanka, such as Nepal and Bangladesh. (with per GNP of around US$200, compared to a per capita GNP of US$ 840 for Sri Lanka) that more than 90% of Tuberculosis patients can be cured and the emergence of multi drug resistant tuberculosis controlled if the treatment of tuberculosis patients is completely supervised. In other words, if someone (Nurse, health volunteer worker, public health worker a relative) actually supervise the patient swallowing the drugs.
Tuberculosis patients (or for that matter any patient) has a bad habit of forgetting to take their drugs when, they feel better, or throwing their drugs away when they feel better. The very efficacy of modern anti-tuberculosis drug is in a way disadvantageous, because patients feel normal too soon, leading them to forget to take their medication or to take it irregularly. Directly supervised treatment circumvents this hurdle and has now been shown to be the only way rampant tuberculosis can be controlled.
As Tuberculosis has been declared a global emergency many efforts are being made to find new effective solutions and strategies in service, design and delivery to eliminate this global menace which are appearing in various forms.
New tools, drugs and strategies which are being researched and tried out bringing effective results.
The DOTS Strategy (Directly Observed Treatment short cause
Represents a major breakthrough in controlling tuberculosis. No other TB control strategy comes close to being as effective and are affordable as DOTS.
The advantages to the community by using the DOTS strategy are numerous.
A. Cures the patients
No other TB control strategy has consistently demonstrated such high cure rates. Dots produces cure rates as high as 95 percent, even in the poorest of countries. TB programmes not using DOTS often cure only 40 percent of their patients.
B. Prevents new infections
DOTS Makes it virtually impossible to cause a patient to develop the incurable forms of TB that are becoming more common. Other treatment strategies are actually causing multi-drug -resistant TB, and may be doing more harm than good.
Cost effective
A six month supply of medicines for DOTS cost only $ 11 per patient in some parts of the world. This can be less than the price of a few bottles of aspirin. The World Bank has ranked the DOTS strategy as one of the most cost effective of all health interventions.
DOTS have been demonstrated to add as many years of life as currently available protease inhibitors to HIV positive people. Yet, the medicines used for DOTS are only one hundred percent of the cost.
Nearly 80 percents of those ill with TB are in their most economically productive years of life. These youthful TB patients represent a workforce nearly as large as the number of people employed by the worlds 20 biggest international corporations.
Protects international travellers
There is no other feasible way to protect the worlds 500 million annual international travellers from TB. The only safeguard is to use DOTS more widely to reduce the number of infectious.
Stimulates economies
The DOTS strategy offers relatively quick payoffs to the economies of developing countries. Studies in India and Thailand have shown that a small investment in the DOTS strategy can save their economies billions of US dollars.
DOTS has been successfully implemented in a wide variety of conditions, including Sri Lanka, India, Tanzania, Guinea, China.
Implementation of Stop TB Strategy"
Has greatly expanded the Tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment services and has saved millions of lives.
Development of new tools is a major component of the revised global efforts to stop TB Progress has been made in this area. They are now in the evaluation process and will be incorporated in to the TB control programme in the near future. New and powerful drugs for the Chemotherapy of Tuberculosis are also been developed and progressively introduced in to the treatment regimen.
Systematic Strategy for screening and monitoring high risk zones
Where the population is concentrated such as,
a) Garment Industries
b) Factories
c) Prison Institutions
d) Rehabilitation Camps
e) Elderly Peoples Institutions
f) Orphanages
g) Mental Asylams
h) Low income communities residing in congested areas.
Changing of the campaign terminology strategy
In the campaign such terms as TB suspects, defaulters, control, Campaign tend to criminalize and patient unfriendly, Therefore in the control of Tuberculosis consideration is being given to use terms which are more humane and patient friendly which will make the patient more co-operative.
Greater involvement of NGOS/ CNAPT
In recruiting and mobilizing volunteers for treatment and supervision which will make Tuberculosis programmes efficient.
Compared to other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka is for ahead in terms of quality of life, life expectancy, literacy maternal mortality. This is a constant source of amazement to developed countries, who wonder how we can maintain such indices comparable to developed countries
The Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT) initiatives in Sri Lanka
It has been recorded that in countries poorer than Sri Lanka, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, (with per capita GNP of around $ 200, compared to a per capita GNP of US $840 for Sri Lanka) more than 90% of Tuberculosis controlled treatment.
However, compared to other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka is far ahead in terms of life expectancy, literacy, and maternal and infant mortality. This is a consistent source of amazement to developed countries like Japan, who wonder how we maintain indices comparable to a developed country despite the previous civil war. The answer lies in the solid infrastructure and the standard of literacy and education of our population. It would be tragic if the TB situation in Sri Lanka were allowed to deteriorate, in spite of possessing such a record of healthcare.
This is where the CNAPT steps in Educating the public is one of the most important aspects of TB eradication. The CNAPT has been at the forefront of the campaign for the education of Sri Lankans. Over the last 70 year, the CNAPT has worked in partnership with the Ministry of Health for and a diverse range of civil society partners to promote knowledge and understanding of the disease amongst the vulnerable section of the population and improving access to proper medical care.
In 1948 when tuberculosis (TB) was prevalent in Sri Lanka, the Ceylon National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis (CNAPT) was formed as a government approved non government organization (NGO), aimed to launch a nationwide TB programme via basic education, programme support and international cooperation. 70 years ago when medical treatment was at its infancy and TB was rampant with no definitive cure, Dr. J.H.F. Jayasuriya, Chairman of the Rotary Club, Colombo; sponsored a voluntary organization to combat TB through the auspices of the club. An inaugural meeting was held on 17th June 1948, thus heralding the beginning of the CNAPT.
In 2008 the CNAPT, with financial assistance from the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) sponsored a Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) study, to better understand the gaps in education and the lapses in public behavior that obstruct the national efforts in TB eradication.
This study was undertaken in collaboration with the medical personnel of the Respiratory Disease Control Programme of the Ministry of Health, the Centre for Social Survey and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.
With the intention of spreading knowledge regarding TB, its spread, prevention and management as well as to inform the public on how and where to get the help and information required, the CNAPT, with the assistance of the Global Fund, also started a Health Education Programme.
The primary target group of this education campaign were schoolteachers who aim was to take advantage of their strategic position and spread the message to their pupils and through them to the society at large.
The international community, WHO NGOs and the Sri Lankan Government have done a great deal for the prevention, treatment and management of the disease while also educating the public. Help is available but people need to be informed where assistance and information is available.
People need assistance and when we extend a hand others will willingly grasp it. The CNAPT aims to promote the concept of extending a helping hand by seeking community, public and volunteer assistance. Tomorrow will be better only through our efforts.
Despite the achievements, many TB patients remain undiagnosed. Escalated community involvement coupled with the harnessing of related elements could be the answer to combating this lethal disease and the CNAPT is committed to being a forerunner in fulfilling this goal.
Emphasis on research and development to improve knowledge and skills for diagnosis, treatment and prevention, plus expansion of existing methods may facilitate CNAPTs goals. The association has tried to educate all sections of the public through technical publications, workshops and seminars. We attempt to combat TB.
Despite the CNAPTs achievements many TB patients remain undiagnosed. Escalated community involvement coupled with the harnessing of related elements could be the answer to combating this lethal disease.
Special hospital facilities were non-existent for children afflicted by TB The CNAPT remedied this by constructing three childrens wards: Welisara Childrens Ward (1952) Hawake Memorial Ward, Kandana (1955) and Clarence Nathnielz Memorial Ward, Welisara (1960) which provided a total of 165 beds exclusively for children. The total cost of Rs. 900,000 was raised through the efforts of the CNAPT.
Health education
Since its inception the association has concentrated heavily on health education. The objective of the programme was to convey to the public that TB could be cured, patients must take prescribed treatment and those with suggestive symptoms be screened for they must take prescribed treatment and those with suggestive symptoms be screened for the disease.
The programme also included lectures to specifically targeted groups, talks via electronic media, participation at public exhibitions and the distribution of TB related literature. The appointment of permanent health educators furthered this cause.
The proximity of the Health Education Centre to the Colombo Museum make it accessible to any visitors of the Museum who wish to visit CNAPTs Health Education Centre.
Due to rapid advancement of TB medical treatment many functions of the CNAPT have been made redundant and today the association concentrates primarily on promoting health education. A drop in TB incidence has necessitated the closure of many chest hospitals and TB wards. The BCG vaccination administered at birth has almost negated TB in children and has resulted in the closure of the childrens wards. The reduction of the duration of treatment from 4 years to 6 months has made it easier for patients to carry on with their everyday routines with the least amount of inconvenience and the stigma attached to TB has all but disappeared.

Royal out to retain Michael Gunaratne Trophy
Royal College will be out to retain the Michael Gunaratne Trophy when they take on arch rivals S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia in their annual inter- school rugby encounter of the Singer A Division league tournament first round at Royal Complex commencing 4.15pm today.
This traditional encounter was inaugurated in 1962 and the first match ended in a draw. Present tally stands at 31 wins to Royal and 19 to S.Thomas with 5 draws. In 1979 the match was not played due to a dispute regarding the date for the encounter.
The Thomians lost last years encounter 14-31 at SThomas grounds at Mount Lavinia under the leadership of winger Naveen Heenakankanamge where the winning Royal captain was fly half Ovin Askey.
This time Royal definitely seem to have a great chance of retaining the trophy after having won both their two previous games in style against Kingswood College Kandy (29-03), and St. Anthonys College Kandy (55-13) being remaining as unbeaten Royal will be captained this year by their experienced wing three quarter Shabith Feroze while the most experienced and one of the best school coaches if not the very best Dushanth Lewke, the former Royal College rugby player and former Sri Lanka national rugby captain will be the head coach of Royal along with Peterite Mohamad Sheriff as assistant coach and T.A. Silva, former Army and Sri Lanka national full back is the kicking coach.
The 2015 Royal side under the leadership of Bhanuka Gamage re wrote the Royal-Thomian rugby history where they demolished the Thomians 52-0 at Havelock Park, which to-date is the highest score by a team in this traditional encounter.
The Thomians highest score is 22-0 under the captaincy of former Sri Lanka and CR & FC second row forward Charya De Saram in 1991. Incidentally in 2015 Royals unsung hero and the highest try scorer in the league tournament, number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya emerged the first and the only rugby player from both the schools to score a hat trick of tries when he touched down four times to enable Royal to achieve this remarkable 52-0 victory.
The Thomians will be hoping to produce an improved performance after they have lost both their matches so far against St.Joseph College Maradana (10-33) and Kingswood College Kandy (05-24) in their last game up at Digana in Kandy.
The Thomian outfit will be captained this year by experienced Sri Lanka national under 18 Sevens player and flanker Christian De Lile while ex Royalist Billal Yusuf will be their head coach and former Sri Lanka winger and ex Royalist Chamara Dabare as assistant coach along with hooker Achala Perera the forwards coach.

SLPP Mayors appointed for Galle, Negombo MCs despite UNP victories at LG polls
The Mayors of Galle and Negombo were appointed from Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday despite the UNP having won those Municipal Councils at the recently concluded Local Government Elections.
The SLPPs Priyantha Godagama Sahabandu was elected as Mayor of the Galle MC following a secret vote while the SLPPs Dayan Lanza was elected as Mayor of the Negombo MC following an open ballot.
At the LG polls, the UNP won 14 seats and the SLPP won 13 seats at the Galle MC, and in the Negombo MC, the UNP won 19 seats and the SLPP won 16 seats.
The inaugural meetings of the two Councils were held yesterday.
In the Galle MC, no party could secure an aggregate of votes exceeding 50 per cent. Hence,Galle Municipal Council Commissioner Ranil Wickramsekara facilitated the meeting of newly elected councillors providing them the opportunity to elect the mayor and deputy mayor for the ensuing term.

Some members have been bought over - minister John
Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga yesterday blamed the new electoral system stating that even when UNP had claimed a resounding victory for the Negombo Muncipal Council, it could not form a council with the peoples preferred representatives. Commenting on the election of Dayan Lanza of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as the Mayor of the Negombo Municipal Council through an open ballot, despite despite the UNP claiming victory at the recently concluded Local government elections, Amaratunga said that some members have been bought over. Some members have been bought over, money has been thrown all around and while only one UNP member had abstained from voting, all others had been handsomely compensated for their franchise, said John Amaratunga.
There are six members who had been bought over and theres nothing we can do at this point.
Therefore, one has to assess the overall political situation and take into consideration the view of the people, who voted to have a UNP council. This system does not give away for that majority rule to prevail, he said.
He added that this was a lesson in politics for the party and that the party should come together and take a decisive action over the matter. The newly elected Mayor Dayan Lanza is the brother of UPFA Gampaha District MP Nimal Lanza. He had the votes of 25 councilors in an open ballot Yesterday while the UNPs Royce Vijitha Fernando obtained 19 votes.
The United National Party (UNP) won the Negombo Municipal Council at the 2018 Local Authorities Election after claiming 19 seats. The SLPP received 16 seats in total, including 9 bonus seats, while the the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) won 2 seats and received 4 bonus seats.

Morkel reaches 300 Test wickets:
South Africa in strong position
CAPE TOWN March 23: Fast bowler Morne Morkel took his 300th Test wicket as South Africa bowled themselves into a strong position on the second day of the third Test against Australia at Newlands on Friday.
Australia were 245 for nine when bad light ended play, 66 runs behind South Africa's first innings total of 311.
But it could have been worse for Australia. They were in deep trouble at 175 for eight before Nathan Lyon hit a Test-best 47 in a ninth wicket partnership of 66 with Tim Paine, who was unbeaten on 33.
Morkel, who will retire from international cricket after the series, took three of the first four Australian wickets to fall and became the fifth South African to join the 300 club.
Morkel dismissed Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith in his first spell, then came back to break a 78-run fourth wicket stand between Cameron Bancroft and Shaun Marsh when Marsh flashed at a wide ball and was caught behind.
Bancroft made 77 off 103 balls with 14 fours but was leg before wicket to Vernon Philander in the last over before tea to leave Australia in a precarious position.
Morkel, 33, playing in his 85th Test, took a fourth wicket when Lyon's adventurous 38-ball innings was ended by a catch by Dean Elgar running back from point.
Earlier, Kagiso Rabada was hit for five boundaries in a row by David Warner but won a duel with the Australian opening batsman when he sent Warner's off stump cartwheeling.
Warner was bowled for 30. He hit three fours off the last three balls of Rabada's second over, then hooked the first ball of Rabada's next over for six.
He sliced a no-ball for four, then was bowled by a ball which went between bat and pad with Warner stuck on his crease.
Rabada, who had a two-match ban for making contact with Australian captain Steve Smith overturned before the Test, ran down the wicket to celebrate but did not go near the batsman.
But Warner appeared to react to a comment from a spectator in the members' pavilion, stopping and turning as he climbed the steps to the dressing room.
South African opening batsman Dean Elgar equalled a world record when he carried his bat through a completed innings for the third time. Elgar finished unbeaten on 141. Only Desmond Haynes of the West Indies had previously batted through a Test innings on three occasions. Smith also equalled a world record when he caught South Africa's last two batsmen for a total of five catches in the innings, the joint most by a fielder.
Although ten other fielders shared the record, Smith was only the second Australian to achieve the feat after Vic Richardson in 1935/36. AFP

Goverment will fulfill reconciliation mandate :
Sri Lanka emerges proud - united with allies at UNHRC
Sri Lanka concluded the 37th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council with its head held high with the acceptance of Sri Lankas Universal Periodic Review Report followed by a strong supportive joint-statement by the United States, United Kingdom and other member nations. The joint-statement by the co-sponsors was unambiguous in that with determined leadership and a clear timeline for action, this Government can deliver the reform and justice agenda, and take the actions needed to support long-term reconciliation, with the support of all Sri Lankans.
Sri Lanka still has an historic opportunity to avoid returning to divisions of the past, the statement added.
In his remarks to the Council, Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana listed out the accomplishments of the government towards national reconciliation, achieved in collaboration with our international partners. Key points were the operationalisation of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) in September 2017, the return of over 70% of private land held by the security forces, the operationalisation of the Right to Information Act, a zero tolerance policy on torture, the successful adoption of quotas for female representation to local government and provincial councils, and enabling legislation to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.
Minister Marapana also highlighted the ongoing efforts to establish the Office of Reparations and the overhauling of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the progress of draft legislation on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
These steps together have demonstrated the current governments commitment to work with the international community to ensure that the rights and liberties of all of its citizens are protected, said a participant at the UNHRC sessions who requested anonymity as she was not authorised to speak to the media.
The representative also praised Minister Marapanas clear articulation of the proactive steps taken by the government to swiftly clamp down on the recent attempts to incite racially and religiously charged violence in the Kandy District, and hailed the governments transparency on what may otherwise have been criticised as draconian measures.
It was clear that the leadership of Sri Lanka was thinking first and foremost about saving lives and preventing bloodshed.They clearly didnt pause to consider optics or political fallout. That is the job of a responsible regime, and a stark contrast to the blind eye turned to such violent incidents in 2014.
The strategy of the government in working with the Human Rights Council has also come into much praise, as it is widely believed that by changing the combative and defensive approach taken by the former government, and instead showing the world that Sri Lanka had nothing to hide, Sirisena-Wickremesinghe duo has shielded the country from the indignity and hardship that would have ensued if the world had united against Sri Lanka, as seemed inevitable going into 2015. According to a person involved in Sri Lankas engagement with the UNHRC over the last several years, it was a foregone conclusion that we would have been hammered with economic sanctions, and that members of the armed forces may have been tried in absentia for alleged war crimes in foreign courts, before January 8, 2015.
The diplomat pointed out that since the new regime opted for a fresh start, Sri Lanka has been successful in restoring its reputation on the world stage without any of the bombast of the past. Remember, every single prosecution or investigation in Sri Lanka involving members of the armed forces are for personal criminal conduct that had nothing to do with the war. This government has not allowed a single person to be investigated for their conduct of the war, despite several false allegations to the contrary. That is what it means to truly stand by the armed forces, and not to just use our brave men and women in uniform as political tools to win votes.

World Tuberculosis Day today
The World TB (Tuberculosis) Day falls today. This year's theme is Wanted: Leaders for a TB-free world. The TB walk will take place today (Saturday, March 24 ) at 7.30 am at Independence Square, Colombo 7 under the patronage of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
Sri Lanka has around 13,000 TB patients. Of them, only around 8,511 were detected and undergo treatment. Of them, 8,113 were newly identified cases. Sri Lanka has around 4,500 unidentified TB patients and they actively spread the disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says TB continues to be the top infectious killer worldwide, claiming over 4,500 lives a day. The emergence of multi drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a major health security threat and could risk gains made in the fight against TB. Last year, WHO reported that 10.4 million people fell ill with TB and that 2016 reported 1.8 million TB deaths. The disease is deeply rooted in populations where human rights and dignity are limited.
While anyone can contract TB, the disease thrives among people living in poverty, marginalised communities and groups.They include: migrants, refugees, ethnic minorities, miners and others working and living in risk-prone settings, the elderly, marginalised women and children in many settings. Malnutrition, poor housing and sanitation, compounded by other risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use and diabetes increase people's vulnerability to TB and affect their access to care, WHO says.

Youngest players with man of the series/tournament awards
Washington Sundar turned out to be India's main bowler during the Nidahas Trophy as he kept producing crucial breakthroughs in the powerplay overs. He returned with eight wickets in the five matches at an economy of 5.7 and stood out as the player of the tournament.
At the age of 18 years and 164 days, Sundar became the youngest player to be awarded the man of the tournament. The previous youngest was Pakistan's Waqar Younis, who was the man of the tournament in the 1990 Austral-Asia Cup at the age of 18 years and 169 days.
According to ESPNcricinfo, Sundar got Washington as his first name because his father wanted to honour a man named Mr. Washington who had helped him build a cricket career. His father came close to representing Tamil Nadu but never made it to the final squad.
The Indian off-spinner also became the youngest player to win a man of the series/tournament award in the T20I format.
Afghanistan's Rashid Khan won man of the series against Ireland at the age of 18 years and 173 days while Shadab Khan of Pakistan won the series award in his debut series against West Indies. Washington Sundar is also the 3rd youngest player to receive a man of the series/tournament award in any International cricket format.
Bangladesh's left-arm spinner Enamul Haque won the series award in his team's maiden Test series win in 200 against Zimbabwe at the age of 18 years and 44 days. The left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir was Pakistan's man of the series in the 4-match Test series against England in 2010 at the age of 18 years and 138 days. Only six players including Sundar have won a series/tournament award in International cricket before turning 19.
The 18-year-old also became the youngest Indian to receive a man of the series/tournament award in Internationals. Narendra Hirwani was the previous youngest among the Indian players as the leg-spinner won the tournament award in the 1988 Sharjah Cup. As many as five Indian players have received a man of series/tournament award before turning 21 but only Irfan Pathan returning with multiple awards.
