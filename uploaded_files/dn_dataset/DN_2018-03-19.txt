Govt has failed to address burning issues of industries
Sri Lanka industrial sectors burning issues are not being addressed by the government and this has resulted in several industries shutting down and the owners taking to trading said, Chairman Achieve Awards, Steering Committee, Kevin Edwards.
Speaking at the launch of the 17th CNCI achiever awards, he said high taxes, escalating labour costs and other issues are pushing the production costs of businesses. In addition several Indian companies are exploiting a lapse in the clause 16 of Board of Investment agreements and are setting up operations in Sri Lanka. These companies are selling their products in Sri Lanka using all the BOI tax incentives and benefits while local companies do not enjoy these benefits. Local industrialists want a level playing field and unfortunately the government is not creating it.
He said that this negative trend was started by an Indian based shoe manufacturer operating from the Katunayake Export Processing Zone and today several such companies are capitalizing on this.
He said that the association and other stake holders have personally brought this matter up with President, Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Minister of International Trade and BOI but with no avail.
Thought the government says that they support the local enterprises this lukewarm attitude of the government Sri Lanka is fact losing its competitive edge in businesses.
He said that they also have mixed thought about the current FTA and proposed FTA agreements.
Secretary, Ministry of Industry and Commerce K.D.N. Ranjit Ashoka asked to comment said that the government is aware of these issues and they are working towards some solutions.
He also said the industries should also try to introduce more automation and also look at moving away from labour intensified industries.
The entries for the 17th CNCI achiever awards close of March 16 and more details could be obtained from [emailprotected] and applications could be downloaded from the cnci.lk web. This year too any company being in the business for four years could apply and even companies in SAARC region could apply.
The Print Media sponsor for the event again is Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House)
DFCC to sponsor CNCI Awards 
For the first time DFCC bank PLC has came forward to sponsor the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) 17th annual Achiever Awards event which would be held in Hotel Galadari on August 9.
CEO, DFCC Lakshman Silva said that the bank has been supporting the Sri Lankan industrial sector since their inception 63 years ago and some of the companies that were supported by DFCC today are leading corporates and exporters as well. We are never afraid to fund industrialists, he said.
We will keep on supporting them and this is also the reason we came to sponsor 17th CNCI achiever awards which recognizes and honors industrial excellence of local enterprisers, he said.
Asked why the lending rates are high in Sri Lanka he said that banks today offer high interest rates for deposits which is around 11 to 12% The banks also have to offer better benefits for their shareholders and hence all banks have to increase lending rates.
He however said DFCC bank has access to several overseas credit lines and loans offered by them to local enterprises bring better returns for investors.

Port City to boost demand for  luxury dwelling in Colombo
With Sanken constructions progressing ahead of schedule, the luxury Rs 25 billion Capital Twinpeaks in its fashionable waterfront location of the Beira Lake in Colombo 2 is expected to be ready for occupation by end-2020, said Mahen Weerasekera, Chairman Sanken Construction (Pvt) Ltd.
Rooted in the Fortune 500 Mitsui Construction company of Japan, Sanken has maintained the high standards, skills and engineering culture of its Japanese origins and over 196 units have already been sold and buyers are a mix of both local, Sri Lankans living overseas and foreigners, he said at the unveiling launch held on Thursday in Colombo.
If you take all over the world from a living perspective, somebody who wants to live in this area by buying a 10 perch property and building a house, it is an uphill expensive task. But the two bedroom what we are offering is very affordable for someone who wants to live in this area. We have also won the customer trust in the past by delivering a quality product in time, Weerasekera said.
An official of Capital Towers Limited said the port city when it comes up will create over 83,000 jobs and the project will continue for about 30 years before its conclusion and there will be a huge demand for accommodation from these employees and visitors who comes in to strike financial deals there. The demand for Capital Twinpeak apartments is imminent from those parties as is located very close to the port city. I key point for us is in 2020, the area around the Beira is going to take such a tern with standing in a row with us, Twinpeaks, Altair, Shangri-La and Abans City Centre. So all of us will be standing in front of the Beira, and round the Beira. Megapolis is doing a development project where it will be like Singapores Boat Quay area which will consist of shops and restaurants. It is going to be a total different environment in 2020, the official said.

72 actresses to chart lifespan of a woman
Glico, the Japanese confectioner behind the well-loved brand Pocky, has warmed the hearts of viewers with a heartwarming commercial which follows the life of a woman through each year of her life till she reaches the age of about 72  and then dies.
Why 72 Well, Glico was playing on todays global average life expectancy which has increased to 71.8 years from the 31 years it was 100 years ago, it said.
In the clip entitled 71.8-Second Life, the lead role of a woman in a red dress is divided among 72 actresses starting with when she is a baby.
From the 0:14 mark, a new actress is swopped out every second with each female representing a new year of life.
The director made sure each second of the commercial is a seamless transition to the next in terms of action  whether an actress is walking, hopping or dancing.
Viewers get to see her walk away from her crib, hit her teens, fall in love, get married, start a family, have kids of her own and eventually watch her grandchildren grow up.
Incidentally, the director also made sure that every actress in the lead role was exactly the same age as the one she was playing in the commercial.
It all ends with a final send-off by family members, in what appears to be her peaceful death as she rises up into the sky, before the camera cuts to a wide shot of all 72 actresses.
Through the different stages of the video, various Glico products  such as Pocky, Bifix yoghurt and Bisco cookies  show up, to likely to show how the products are relevant in a persons life regardless of age.
The whole video, which has already amassed over 2 million views on YouTube, is set to a whimsical song that sings of saying goodbye to previous phases of ones life, which apparently doesnt necessarily culminate at 72 for the Japanese.According to data from The World Bank, the Japanese have an average life expectancy of 84.

Anuradhapura drinking water issue will be resolved by 2021
Acute scarcity of drinking water in the Anuradhapura district would be resolved to a larger extent by 2021, the Water Supply and Drainage Board sources reveal.
Anuradhapura boasts a population of 9,17748. Besides domestic level water supply sources, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NCP) provides drinking water for a population of around 410,000. The Board has given 82,000 water connections and the demand increases the supply. By 2020, the JICA funded Wahalkada and Mahakanadarawa Water Projects will be complete. These two mega schemes will benefit 290,000. China funded Rajangane-Thambuttegama Water Supply Scheme will provide adequate drinking water for 40,000 people by 2022.
Within the next three years, the WSDB (NCP) will complete the Eppawala-Mahawilachchiya Scheme including the expansion of the Thantirimale, Galnewa-Bulnewa, Thalawa, Mihintale, Kahatagasdigiliya, Kebitigollewa and Padaviya water projects benefiting 100,000 people.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said that once the proposed Yan Oya and lower Malwathu Oya reservoirs are completed by 2021 facilitating 150,000 people in areas such as Kebithigollewa, Padaviya, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Horrowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya, they would supply adequate drinking and agro water throughout the year.
He pointed out that the availability of drinking water would prevent the fast spreading kidney diseases in these areas. The only solution for fighting the drought in the district is to have the tanks system that comprises around 3,300 major medium and small tanks kept filled with water. The ongoing drinking and irrigational water projects will address this issue, the Government Agent said.
According to the sources, the Japanese and Chinese aided Wahalkada, Mahakanadarawa and Rajangana-Thambuttegama water schemes and the Yan Oya and lower Malwathu Oya Projects will cost around Rs. 100,000 millions.
Apart from this, the World Bank has invested through the Irrigation Department around Rs. 2,000 m to preserve the dams of Padaviya, Mahawilachchiya, Rajanganaya, Nuwarawewa, Thissawewa, Nachchaduwa and Mahakanadarawa Tanks.

Rukie Eheliyagoda
She was selfless
As the curtain finally came down on March 19, 2017, Rukie Eheliyagoda, at 90 years of age, stepped off the stage of life. Love that transcended biological ties was snuffed out, leaving in her trail a colourful luminescence which the passing of time could hardly diminish.
My mother was content with herself just the way she was and allowed her soul the freedom to love, sing, dance and praise God. An exceptional feature in her character was her calm temperament; taking everything with a smile, be it hard times or jubilant times and was never tremulous or ruffled.
She was richly endowed with Joie de vivre and a radiant smile which glowed from within. Outward beauty and the beauty of the soul were both hers in abundance. She was a raconteur par excellence and together with her great sense of humour, set alight a sparkle to her lively conversations. It is no secret that my mother endeared herself to anyone who met her for the first time within a few minutes.
She had an inseparable connection with her family that was deep and symbiotic. It was characterised by an axial relationship. Her family mattered to her the most, evidenced by the abundance of love, care and giving that surrounded her happy home of spouse, five children, four grandchildren and three great grandchildren. During my junior school days, I would constantly fall ill during exams and each time, I never failed to find my mother armed with Disprin and a flask of coriander, waiting near the school gate for the interval. She gave each of her five children her undivided attention, even as four out of the five, came in pairs.
Hers was a life full of selfless care for others. Kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity rained like confetti. She offered a sincere and unbridled friendship especially in the darkest hours. Her heart remained flooded with kindness to the very end.
She possessed an indefatigable zeal for labouring in Gods kingdom and was equipped with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy and enthusiasm.
Gods blessings beyond measure were showered on this gracious and indomitable lady from the beginning to the end of her glorious life.
During our years growing up, our home was filled with prayers as she would gather her family around her daily after dinner. Her faith in Jesus Christ was so deep-rooted that no storm in life ever succeeded in paralysing her faith. Her conversations hardly ended without her boasting of how great and good the Lord was. Her well-lived and fulfiled life is our legacy. Her deep and unfathomable love was her gift to us and our endless fond memories of her is the comfort in our hearts that will linger on.

Ariyadasa Ratnasinghe
Versatile writer
It is unbelievable that 13 years had passed since the demise of versatile writer Ariyadasa Rathnasinghe, who contributed immensely to Sinhala and English newspapers and magazines for well over four decades. His vast knowledge in History, Buddhism, Literature and almost all other fields was marvellous.
His writings were full of information and inspiration, which were always arranged in a way that gripped all readers.
It was wonderful how he could find enough time to gather such a vast knowledge in so many fields and produce such valuable writings admits his responsibilities at state institutions. It is also not a secret that many journalists sought his assistance regularly in order to gather information and to clear doubts they came across during their pursuits. It was evident by the sheer numbers gathered at his funeral; they expressed their gratitude to him for sharing his knowledge with them during their times of need. His vast knowledge and faith in Buddhism made him a strong personality that could bear anything; all the ups and downs he faced in life. He was a rare personality in present day society and a gentlemen par excellence.
His loss is immensely felt by his family as well as everyone who knew him. It is true that he left an indelible impression on many journalists and readers. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

In terms of value JKH & HNB led foreign purchases while Commercial Bank & Dialog led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Equity markets were buffeted by both dampened sentiment following last weeks communal tensions and global geo-political headwinds, causing the broad-share ASPI to pare down ~42 points W-o-W, to record its largest weekly loss since mid-Jan.
Retail investors opted to remain on the sidelines yet again this week, as the state of emergency declared last week failed to be lifted after the original 10-day lapse and amid discussions to extend it further.
Global financial market volatility meanwhile heightened over the week due to rising concerns over trade tensions following the USs tariffs on Steel & Aluminum imports, the worsening diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia and ongoing turmoil within the US political landscape. Despite the 0.64% W-o-W decline on the main share Index, daily average turnover levels on the Colombo Bourse rose 69% W-o-W to average Rs.1.25Bn as Local Institutional and HNI remained active in the market (59% of crossings cf. 43% last week) and foreign investor appetite for domestic equities made a strong rebound.
Local Institutional and HNI investors made a stronger comeback in March relative to Feb when average participation levels fell to 24% cf. the 61% in Jan and 59% so far in March.
Interest in blue-chips dominated crossings turnover with HNB accounting for 47% of total crossings for the week, while JKH accounted for 22% of crossings. Meanwhile, relative to last week when Foreign investors recorded the lowest net buying for this year (Rs. 193Mn), Foreigners pumped in Rs 1.0Bn to domestic equities this week amid strong buying interest in counters such as JKH and HNB.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for directional cues from both domestic political developments and the US Feds interest rate decision next week.
Manufacturing and serviceactivity expands in Feb 
A leading indicator of economic activity in the Manufacturing and Services Sectors, the SL Purchasing Managers Index in February indicated expansion in both Manufacturing and Service activities with a reading over the neutral 50 index point level.
Manufacturing Sector PMI rose to 55.6 index points (cf. 51.7 in Jan18) as Manufacturing activities expanded at a higher rate in Feb compared to Jan following a seasonal slowdown. While there was a notable expansion in the New Orders & Production sub-indices, all sub-indices of the PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signaling an overall expansion in manufacturing activities.
Moreover, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months. Services sector activities also gathered momentum over Feb (58.4 vs . 56.6 index points in Jan), supported by New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment and Expectations for Activity. Business activity in Financial Services, IT programming, and Transportation of Goods & Warehousing rose notably over the month while employment increased in Feb cf. to the decline observed in Jan.
Meanwhile, in a reversal of the dominant trend over the last 2 months, Backlogs of Work declined in Feb18 while optimism on the three-month business outlook strengthened modestly. In its latest Mission statement meanwhile, the IMF noted that Sri Lankas economic recovery is set to continue with the economy gradually normalizing post the weather-related shocks in 2017. The IMF noted that GDP growth is estimated to rise to 4.4% in 2018 while Inflation is projected to revert to around 5% by end-2018, as food prices stabilize.

Australian bushfires destroy 40,000 hectares
AUSTRALIA: Homes were razed, cattle killed and large swathes of land burnt on Sunday as bush and grass fires rage in Australia amid hot and blustery conditions, with residents fleeing flame-filled red skies.
Dozens of blazes in western and southwestern Victoria state began on Saturday and a change in wind direction early Sunday worsened the situation.
Some 40,000 hectares have been damaged, and hundreds of beef and dairy cattle will be lost as a result of these fires, Victorias Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley told reporters Sunday.
Up to 12 homes were impacted, he added, with broadcaster ABC reporting they were destroyed.
Weve got fires, major fires, running.
They will get larger in size before we get control of these, he added, as the weather bureau predicted peak gusts of up to 110 kph (70 mph). No significant injuries, no deaths (in) a very dynamic environment, I would say they (local communities) have done exceptionally well. Andrew Morrow, the local fire controller at Colac in western Victoria, said two of the bigger fires measuring 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) and 6,500 hectares were being blown east from the wind changes.
We know theres a significant number of properties that the fire has impacted, he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Residents living near one of the worst-hit areas -- the small town of Terang some 200 kilometres (124 miles) southwest of Melbourne -- were told by authorities it was too late to leave and they must take shelter indoors immediately.
Thousands of homes were left without power and other regions issued with evacuation orders, with fears some of the separate fires could merge in the changing winds.
Elle Moyle was hosting a friends wedding at a farm in Gazette when a bushfire raged towards the property.
We smelled the smoke at the venue and within 10 minutes the sky was completely red, she told the ABC.
The flames were only 100 metres away... the winds were crazy, Moyle said, adding that guests had to shelter in a stable before they managed to escape on a bus.
We did our best to keep everyone safe and get them out of there but it was very touch and go.
The dramatic scenes came on a weekend of extreme weather in Australia with the northern city of Darwin hit by Category Two Cyclone Marcus. It brought down trees and power lines, but no injuries or serious damage was reported.
The system was the strongest to hit the city in three decades, according to authorities, with clean-up efforts underway. The storm is now moving west towards several remote island and coastal communities. - AFP

Brilliant retellings of classical myths
Theres something about our oldest stories that never gets old. Rereading classical mythology is for me an exercise in surprise and recognition mixed together. There are things Ive always missed in a myth, the previous time around, that strike me as utterly vital to understanding its meaning. I believe that myths hit us somewhere below the brain, at some irrational, dreamlike level that somehow feels truer than ordinary stories. When I read Ovids myth of Apollo pursuing Daphne, one made swift by hope and one by fear, and the nymph metamorphoses into a laurel tree to escape the amorous god forever, it disturbs and thrills me in ways I find hard to explain.*
I wanted to capture this mythic effect of timelessness and inevitability in my novel The Red Word, a modern story about a war between a fraternity house and a group of ardent young feminists on a university campus. So I turned for inspiration to what is arguably the most massive epic in all of literature: Homers Iliad. The female students in my novel are taking a class called Women & Myth, and their course readings influence their perspective on the scandal unfolding around them. And life certainly seems epic, doesnt it, when youre in your late teens and early twenties Your highs are Olympian, your lows like a plunge into the River Styx
Beautifully wrought
The books in this list are the smartest, most beautifully wrought adaptations of classical myths Ive ever encounteredand they all just happen to be by female writers. I reread many of these titles while composing The Red Word, loving the sense that these master storytellers were reworking the heavy, hardened clay of the male-centered myths into supple material for building new worlds.
A chorus of competing female voices from the Underworldthose of Penelopes 12 maids accused of treasonous plotting and hanged by her son, Telemachusprovide the backdrop for this counter-epic to The Odyssey. Many of Atwoods novels deal with myth and legendher more recent works are dystopian myths of her own inventionso tackling the seminal Greek epic is for her a natural undertaking. The heroic gravitas of the storys events is undercut by Atwoods signature arch tone and multi-layered irony: for example, the chapter relating the abduction/elopement of Penelopes sister Helen with Paris, the inciting incident of the Trojan war, is entitled Helen Ruins My Life. Through Penelopes voice, the story works to set the record straight on epic events. Of her wedding, our heroine tells us, And so I was handed over to Odysseus, like a package of meat. A package of meat in a wrapping of gold, mind you. A sort of gilded blood pudding.
Feminist philosopher and critical theorist Butler uses Sophocles myth of Antigone to explore feminist concepts of kinship and citizenship in this non-fiction essay. As dense and difficult as all Butlers prose, the text is worth reading for its ethical speculations on the question What makes a liveable life Refusing to obey the patriarchal rules of her society puts Antigone in a position of resistance but also mortal risk. Butler uses the myth as a jumping-off point to engage with the work of Hegel, Lacan, Irigaray, and other big thinkers. She relates Antigones plight to todays world, where there are increasing populations without full citizenship existing within and between states. Because these people are not being entered into the life of the legitimate community, they arent granted full human status and so exist perpetually as a shadowy realm haunting our public sphere, like Antigone haunts Creons state. Its a wide-ranging, challenging essay that infuses the myth with bold new relevance for modern politics.
Red monster
This novel in verse by Canadas most celebrated living poet retells the tale of Herakles tenth labor: stealing the herd of cattle belonging to a winged red monster named Geryon. The monster is the protagonist in Carsons version, seduced and left pining by Herakles. Its the breathtaking beauty of the language that carries this book. Carson keeps the myth in the realm of the spectacular, the otherworldly, but also an immediately recognizable picture, as here, where Geryon is described as a typically sulky teenaged son:
He burned in the presence of his mother.
I hardly know you anymore, she said leaning against the doorway of his room.
It had rained suddenly at suppertime,
now sunset was startling drops at the window. Stale peace of old bedtimes
filled the room. Love does not
make me gentle or kind, thought Geryon as he and his mother eyed each other
from opposite shores of the light.
Geryon and Herakles are reunited in middle age in Red Doc>, a road-trip story in which Herakles is a war-veteran with PTSD and Geryon is a blocked artist dealing with the death of his mother. Its more playful than Autobiography but every bit as beautiful. - Lit Hub

CASA upbeat on collaboration of terminal operators
CASA welcomed the initiative taken by the Ministry of Ports and Shipping and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to ensure that terminals work in collaboration with each other to improve overall efficiency of the Colombo Port.
The terminal operators of Colombo port signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the March 14, 2018 to unload ships of their competitor terminals if berths are available. This will reduce the waiting time for clients which will improve ease of doing business in Sri Lanka and increase competitiveness over other regional ports.
Colombo Port has been ranked among the worlds best 25 ports in accordance with the Alphaliner rankings in 2017 and is therefore considered as an efficient port in the region. However it faces competition from many regional ports. CASA is of the view that the initiative of the three terminals to collaborate will help Colombo Port to stay competitive in the region and to reach the maritime hub status.
In a confident response to the changing dynamics of the global shipping industry, which are reflected by the emergence of new strategic alliances between shipping lines, CASA believes that the combined terminals collaboration will allow for the most effective use of facilities and manpower resources. Over the past few years CASA has worked with the terminal operators to improve overall efficiency of the Colombo Port and will continue to do so. It is now important to work out on a unified payment structure across terminals to ensure operational efficiency. CASA is optimistic about the future of the industry with all government agencies working together for a common goal of achieving the maritime hub status.

Social media not so social
President Maithripala Sirisena declared that if something is detrimental to the society we will have to get rid of it despite being useful another way. President Sirisena expressed these sentiments recently in reference to Sri Lankans habit of using the social media to destroy ethnic harmony. President Sirisena added that the mobile phone, the computer, internet and social media have been invented by the society to uplift humanity.
According to President Sirisena, the public has lodged complaints long before violence erupted in Ampara and Kandy districts. Complaints have been centred on Facebook. President Sirisena elucidated how Facebook has destroyed the family life, inciting hatred among various communities.
We did not control it at that time. We were compelled to place certain restrictions temporarily on them when the violence started in these two districts, President Sirisena added.
We fully endorse President Sirisenas statement. It is important to control social media to a certain degree. It is surprising to note how the politicians now rant against the social media control. They fail to witness the harm generated during the recent riots.
Only a few politicians had the gumption to come forward to control the recent riots. But when the government controlled the social media to stop the riots, many cardboard heroes came to the forefront to wage useless wars. They began to deal with the subjects of democracy, press freedom and media freedom.
But they must understand that peace and harmony are much more important than all this. What is the use of media freedom and democracy when there are riots These social media are managed by various businessmen. They are worried about their financial gains. They are worried about their marketing. They are not worried about the damage done to our young generation or family life.

City, port development to be fast tracked: Patali
Development of the Colombo, Kurunegala Dambulla and Trincomalee cities will be fast tracked along with the Economic Development process encompassing the Trincoamlee and Colombo Harbours, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He disclosed this when he called on the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings on March 18.
Ranawaka said all infrastructure facilities in these cities including water and electricity supplies will be improved in addition to the road networks and community habitats.
A special project to develop Kuruengala town will be launched with foreign finding. He said the Colombo City Development Programme too had been accelerated and the Port City would facilitate the development of the entire city. Minister Ranawakas light railway project had also been launched alongside the Colombo City Development project.
Speaking to the media after meeting the Mahanayake Thera, the minister said he would submit a comprehensive proposal which would provide a streamlined service to the people within 18 months.
He said he had also formulated a short term programme to improve the capacity of airport, harbour and electricity sectors.
The minister said he also hoped to implement a streamlined environmental friendly programme to protect people from floods, landslides and other disasters and resolve social problems.
Minister Ranawaka who observed that 1,417 protest campaigns had been held in the country in 2016 said this worked out to nearly four protest campaigns per day. He said a proper solution ought to be found to problems such as the SAITM issue.
Since inter-community issues should not be allowed to develop into clashes he would also submit a proposal to help diffuse communal tensions and rivalries in the country.
Consultant (Projects) Urban Development Authority former Provincial Council member Thushara Swarnatilleke was also associated with the Minister during the visit.

CMC to get tough with garbage dumpers
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has sought assistance from the Police and the Military to nab those who dump garbage haphazardly at public places.
Legal action will be taken against those who engage in illegal garbage dumping while violating waste management regulations imposed by the CMC, Colombo Municipal Council Acting Municipal Commissioner Eng. Lalith Wickremeratne said.
Wickremeratne also said the CMC would refrain from collecting non-segregated waste from today onwards.
Wickremeratne, responding to the Daily News, pointed out that an attitudinal change in people is in demand for a successful waste management system in the CMC as well as in the country.
He also pointed out that there is no issue relating to the disposing of segregated garbage.
The segregated garbage is sent to compost yards managed by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry or the recycling projects, he said.
The problem is with the unseparated garbage. Even in the last few days, you may have noticed that garbage piled up in areas such as Maradana, Maligawatta, Borella, Dematagoda and Slave Island.
Most of the people in these areas and the surroundings do not separate garbage before they dispose them. It is not fair to say that separating garbage into degradable and non degradable is a difficult task. Unfortunately, this matter rises not because of unawareness but because they dont feel the need to execute these policies. The general public needs to realize that it is them who will have to endure the repercussions as well, Wickramaratne further said.

Designed by a young architect it comprises 16 apartments with a clear view of the jogging path. This complex also houses a yoga studio, fully-equipped gym, pool and a little caf exclusively for residents.
Property developer, Landmark (Pvt) Ltd is a family run entity so the importance of family and community is a factor that is strongly associated with the company and its projects. The yoga studio, gymnasium, pool and caf designed exclusively for residents was included in the plan in order to create the kind of atmosphere that would emphasize and highlight on the collective and communal factor that they wish to portray.
The property developers also focus on detail and the standards of their product. As the developers have all of their suppliers under one roof and ensuring that they are in perfect synchronization to the customer requirement, maintaining the quality and the standards of the construction process and installations is foolproof.
Landmark is led by Chairperson, Neelangi Hapangama, a businesswoman in both Sri Lanka and Australia who has dedicated a large portion of her life to designing childrens furniture and toys. Eksith Hapangama, is the Managing Director of Landmark (Pvt) Ltd.

Ethnic harmony in flames
The recent incidents of racial violence in Kandy area obviously have created new challenges to the Yahapalanaya government locally and at the international level. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe admitted We thought the major challenge which the country had to face was the drought which crippled the agriculture sector but incidents in Kandy have posted challenges in the international levels as well. The Prime Minister said thus while highlighting that country's image has been tarnished. Also, he was worried about the effect on the tourism industry.
He said, We don't know whether we could achieve it as expected. He said revenues of tourist industrialists could decline. In addition, one has to look into repairing the damages. The state has to repair the damages while assuring that compensation will be paid to the families of those who were killed in the clashes and those whose houses and business establishments were damaged. Such is the burden on the country created by fascistic political violence; also it adds to the cost of maintaining religious freedom in the country.
All those who are familiar with Buddhism will agree that there is no greater perversion of Buddhism than killing in the name of Buddhism. In the Buddhas teachings, there is no place for any kind of violence, no concept of holy war or just war, no room for revenge, whatever the crime.
If the Maha Nayaka Theras are true followers of the Buddha, they would have walked going among the rioters, pleading for calm. But the only monks visible and audible in Kandy at that time appear to be those who are feeding the fires. Of course, the Maha Nayaka Theras and other leading monks came out with word of condemnation and plea for sanity and peace. Still, Kandy-burning symbolizes the failure of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. That is the humble verdict of the democratic people.
The argument that the violence, be it in July 83 or today, is the work of a fanatical minority is true. But it is also irrelevant. The majority of Sinhala did not take part in Black July. They didnt have to. Indifference is neither neutral nor benign. Indifference kills and destroys.
Myths and fake news
In 1983, the silence of the silent majority (together with the leniency of the government and the collusion of the police and the military) created the enabling environment in which a minority of extremists could set fire to an entire country. That collective indifference was fed by inherited myths and fake news about encroaching Tamils dominating our universities by cheating at exams, taking away our jobs and our land, planning to overrun our only country by breeding like rabbits... Ancient tales and false statistics were used to lend this demonization an air of sanctity, authenticity and objectiveness. Without that seeding, Black July wouldnt have happened. Those same lies are being repeated about Muslims now.
The BBS started the madness in 2012, under the patronage of the Rajapaksa regime, pouring lurid stories into willing ears, turning Muslims into the next enemy, the new other. Without that seeding, Ampara and Teldeniya wouldnt have happened and Kandy couldnt be happening.
Intelligentsia here, Sinhala or otherwise, were not serious about sterilization pill; the doctors were mostly silent. A few brave souls from the left spoke out but the absolute majority said nothing. The various medical associations (including the GMOA) did not bother to explain the truth to the country. Their silence directly or otherwise fed the fires of misunderstanding. More than a month later, they are still silent. Obviously, it is dangerous and irresponsible to allow extremists to dominate the subject and own the initiative.
The danger becomes a crime when leading extremists are granted de facto impunity on the strength of a yellow robe. These traditions and practices were supposed to regularize by Yahapalanaya. The latter was supposed to, expected to, end the impunity enjoyed by robed thugs and also adopt a rational firm policy towards every kind of racism. The government, in spite of pro-racist interventions by the president, was not racist. But during its tenure, especially the last two years, it has displayed an incapability to counter fascistic conspiracies hatched by the Rajapaksa group.
It was distressing for democratic masses to watch the absence of political and moral courage of Yahapalanaya. Instead of standing up to every form of extremism, it developed a habit of succumbing to monks, priests and mullahs. Of course, the government did not create extremists.
The Rajapaksa group was responsible for most of it. But Yahapalanaya pandered to extremists probably in the hope of disarming extremism. This political weakness only enhanced the Rajapaksa group; it helped turn the teeth into fangs. All minorities voted for the government in massive numbers, hoping for peace and security. The government failed them. Now they have to turn left and search for an alternative.
Trivial incidents
Lanka celebrated her 70th independence day just a month ago. However, still there is no stable, consolidated country with unity. Hence, in reality, there is nothing much to celebrate. Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim identities are still powerful, undermining the Lankan nation. We are Lankans in name only. Unity is just a word; coexistence a precarious state that can be destroyed by the most trivial of incidents. On the other hand, we are a country of Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims who know very little about each others religions. Most of us study in schools which are de facto segregated, even though there is a rule to give 5 % to other communities. We live in neighbourhoods with invisible walls. A fog of misunderstanding almost deliberately made, divides the nationalities and religious communities, who call this island home. Comparative religion is not a subject seriously taught in our schools. What we read in the media strengthen the prejudices we learn at home and relearn in school. Lanka is still a partial democratic society. Yahapalanaya was created to carry out the democratic revolution to the last. Revolution started but enlightenment is yet to come. Where ignorance and fear rule, violence is never far away. Anything can ignite it  a misplaced food order, the myth of a sterilization pill, a brutal crime.
One of the tasks of the new government was to carry out a systematic effort to dent this fog of misconception. Even that task, which did not require standing up to mad monks, priests or mullahs, was not done. In the absence of any counters, lies continued to flourish. For example, a website recently carried a news item claiming that the proportion of Sinhala Buddhists which had been at 72% a few decades ago has come down to 67% now. The statistics were a total fake. According to census figures since the first census of 1881, Sinhala-Buddhists never exceeded the 70% mark until 2012. 2012 was the last census and according to that census, Sinhala-Buddhists comprise 70.1% of the populace and Sinhala all is 75%.
Sinhala-Buddhists
So the news about a rapid decline in Sinhala-Buddhist numbers is fake news, a lie fabricated to make Sinhala-Buddhists feel insecure. More worryingly, the website attributes this incendiary canard to the governor of the Southern Province.
The government must investigate and wipe out such crimes. If these crimes are not suppressed sooner rather than later, the contagion of anti-Muslim violence will spread to other areas, including Colombo. If that happens, Lanka will not be able to escape the scourge of a religious war. Black July promoted the LTTE to gain the upper hand within the Tamil liberation struggle.
The triumph of criminal Sinhala racism in the South led to the armed liberation struggle of Tamil people. Now we are about to recreate that historical crime with Muslims.
There can be no peace in a country where the extremists set the national agenda. Talking about the rule of law is a joke when robed thugs are above the law and can command senior DIGs. It is a dangerous game, allowing extremists to ply their deadly trade, irrespective of which race they belong to, which religion they espouse or which political party they claim to support.
As multi-nationality, multi-religious country, our greatest enemy is racism; and the most dangerous is the extremism of the majority community. When Sinhala-Buddhist fanatics are given a free hand, they set the country on fire, endanger innocent lives and strengthen communalists in minority communities.
The habit of allowing extremists to shape the national agenda and set the national course must end if Lankas future is to be better than her past.

Federer survives scare to face Del Potro in final
INDIAN WELLS, Saturday: World No. 1 Roger Federer extended his season win streak to 17 matches, booking his spot in the Indian Wells Masters final by rallying past Borna Coric 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday.
The Swiss superstar survived a stern test from world number 49 Coric but managed to hold on for a 17-0 record this year, surpassing his prior career-best calendar year start in 2006 when he opened with 16 wins.
It took a while to get the record, Federer said. But Im happy. It was just a fighting match .... It didnt come easy, so I had to go get it.
I got a little bit lucky. I hung tough and put a lot of effort into it to get the record.
The focus has to be the finals right now. But its nice to get off to a good start this year, and I hope I can play well again tomorrow.
The defending champion will be aiming for a record sixth Indian Wells title when he squares off against world number eight Juan Martin Del Potro in Sundays championship match.
The 36-year-old Federer said he had to draw on every ounce of experience and mental toughness to pull out the match.
Margins are slim at the top of the game, he said. And I have been there so many times.
You just hope to take the right decisions along the way, and then it ends up falling your way.
But for that you need to have a very positive mindset. You need to be match-tough, you need to be confident, have experience, and I think I have a bit of all of that right now.
Down a set and trailing 4-2 in the second, Federer had to claw his way back from the brink of defeat.
In the third set he fell behind again 4-3 but won the final 11 points of the match to claim the victory.
Federer clinched the match when Coric hit a shot wide. The ball was called out but Coric challenged and after the video review the original call was confirmed.
Borna was incredibly steady, Federer said. Those 10 minutes when I was down a set and a break it was hard for me to accept.
I got a bit lucky. It was a good match.
Federer had not dropped a set (8-0) entering the semi-final. But he looked out of sorts in the opening set Saturday as Croatias Coric took it handily.
The match was played under difficult conditions with winds swirling around the main stadium. Federer said he had to be conservative with his shotmaking to get back in it.
At some point you are happy with very little, Federer said.
Former US Open winner Del Potro improved to 16-3 on the season as he stormed past the hard-serving Canadian Milos Raonic 6-2, 6-3 in just 65 minutes. - AFP

Fishing in Tehran
On the fiftieth anniversary of Richard Brautigans Trout Fishing in America, an Iranian writer (and devoted Brautigan reader) considers how he, perhaps even more than other Beat writers, achieved a wide readership in Tehran.
The story of how I met Richard Brautigan in Tehran begins in 2011, when I attended a film workshop where many American movies were shown and analyzed by Iranian critics. One of the films presented was Oliver Stones Platoon (1986), which, I believed, depicted the truth of the Vietnam War and the traumas suffered by American soldiers, and to be honest, Platoon was the only reason I attended the workshop in the first place.
Forgotten critic
Heres what happened. They showed the film, the critics began discussing it, and I was enjoying the conversation well enough until a guy with a large retro-western mustache, seated in the rear of the room, began asking questions. The guys retro-western mustache was so remarkable that I have completely forgotten whatever it was he asked of the critics. After the discussion broke up, I stayed behind to talk to one of the critics about the film program I was managing as a student at my university.
Before I left, I heard a voice behind me: Do we know each other I feel Ive seen you somewhere before.
It was the guy with the retro-western mustache, and he explained that he had seen me at my school, where he too was enrolled. I have always had my doubts about the idea of coincidencebut it seemed to work well for me and the guy with the retro-western mustache.
That night, we had a long conversation about cinema and literature, and we stayed in touch by text messages, chatting at length about the United States and its cinema. Mustache guy had many cousins who lived in the States, and he knew a lot about the land of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Of course, we began dating and attending workshops together, and mustache guy lent me many of his American postmodern novels.
But, Dear Readers, this is not a love story about me and the guy with the retro-western mustache. Its a story about how mustache guy introduced me to Richard Brautigan.
Changed forever
In those cafs in downtown Tehran, it seemed as though the writers of the Beat and Woodstock generations had paid a visit, had come to Tehran and left something behind that changed it forever. It all started with So the Wind Wont Blow It All Away, which mustache guy gave me. So the Wind Wont Blow It All Away is Brautigans final book, published two years before he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, and leaving behind perhaps the worlds most famous suicide note: Messy, isnt it The book is about a forty-two-year-old man narrating his childhood, from the ages of five to twelve, in postWorld War II America. I liked the book mostly due to its simple style and friendly tone.
Brautigan reminded me of Hemingwayshort direct sentences with little detail, and somehow you could tell that hed had no academic education. It was as though he was the product of American pop culture.
I was fascinated by So the Wind Wont Blow It All Away, so from there I set out to find the rest of Brautigans books in Tehran bookstores. This wasnt difficult. Richard Brautigan is extremely popular in Iran, even though he is not taught in universities. You can easily find photos of him on the walls of Tehran cafs, with his typewriter and his lovely smile, and of course he was inspiring retro-western mustaches in certain Iranian men.
I spent a lot of time in cafs in those days, meeting many other young men and women who were into art and literature. We gathered in the cafs to discuss Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Vonnegut, J. G. Ballard, and Brautiganthe last more popular than the others. He was always there, hanging on the wall and watching me while I read his books. In those cafs in downtown Tehran, it seemed as though the writers of the Beat and Woodstock generations had paid a visit, had come to Tehran and left something behind that changed it forever.
Cafe conversation
What struck me most about those caf conversations was that the men and women who were having thembarely more than boys and girls, reallywere not English literature students, as I was. They studied art or cinema, and they read Brautigan in Farsi, and Brautigan had a dramatic impact on them. Many of them looked very westernized. The men had long hair, and some wore mustaches, some not. Some wore weird glasses, and most of them smoked cigarettes.
Among the photographs of all those writers, Brautigans stood apart, perhaps because his image embodied his minimalistic writing. Brautigan entered the literary world through poetryand there is a strong bond between his poems and his novel-writing.
His novels would never have been written had he not written poetry first. And even his poetry focused more on daily life, as opposed to the more issue-based writing of the other Beat and Woodstock writers.
I read somewhere that Brautigan had always longed to be famous and to have many Dear Readers to read his books. This might have become truer of him here in Tehran than in the United States.
There are a slew of characteristics that have made him a major author in Iran: existentialism, identity crises, consumer society, the environmental crisis, the idea of self, Zen philosophy, choosing a lifestyle opposed to the American dream, repetition, his poetic style, his haikus, grotesque characters from the suburbs, death, imagery, Transcendentalism and the impact of Emerson, silence, and the strange relationship between his titles and the bodies of his storiesby which I mean, most often there was no connection at all between the two.

French for an intellectual community
If one is to reap the full benefits of education one must have clearly defined goals. You need to know your ambitions in life. Education is indispensable to anyone and one really never stops learning. Education can give you the keys to the kingdom. It helps you understand the world and also it gives you financial benefits.
AIC Campus joins hands with the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and in the Maldives and the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in Colombo to develop the teaching of French Language in Sri Lanka. In this regards AIC Campus will offer free French language courses to a group of selected students.
Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, Chandima Weerakkody pointed out that the prospects of this program are exciting. When it comes to higher studies we all think of USA, England and Australia. But we must always remember the tremendous possibilities in going to France and learning there. This is a gold mine.
Sri Lanka as a nation is in the forefront in terms of achievements in the field of education in the region, having witnessed a long period of civil war for over three decades. The steady progress made in the field of education show the resilient nature of our society even at the worst times and what should be prioritized to meet the challenges, said minister Weerakkody.
In addition to being able to speak French, the program offers the unique opportunity to experience the vibrant culture of France and its people.
France is one of the best destinations for higher education. It also offers very affordable higher education options to Sri Lankan students. The French language scholarship program initiated by AIS campus and the support and cooperation extended by the Embassy of France and the Alliance Franaise de Kotte is commendable. I am confident that students will get the maximum benefit of this great endeavor, minister said.
These students will receive a scholarship from AIS campus to complete the French Language Course up to level A1. 100 hours of language coaching will be provided by a native French teacher from the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in Colombo.
Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Jean Marin Schuh, commented that Frances Higher Education system remains one of the most efficient in the world, with world class universities, very attractive fees and local subsidies.
It is the fourth most popular destination in the world for international students with internationally recognized degrees in engineering, business, architecture, design, digital technologies and many more  taught in French and English, said Schuh.
He pointed out that this partnership is a great opportunity to raise awareness on those possibilities.
Speaking French creates access to many opportunities, and we are glad to help Sri Lankan students achieve it. The Embassy of France is proud to be a part of this project, which will give the opportunity to students to start learning French with a teacher specially appointed by the official Alliance Francaise De Kotte in Colombo. French speaking is a great asset. It is spoken by 274 million people in 32 different countries in the five continents, pointed out Schuh.
Executive Director/ CEO of AIC Campus, Dr. Gishan Sumanasiri said that this kind of program is the lifeblood of education.
The French Language Scholarship program, the very first of this nature, will provide Sri Lankan students access to the French higher education system, widely known as one of the best education systems in the world, due to practicality, affordability and innovativeness. Today France is among the top five global study destinations and at AIC, we want to provide our students access to high quality European education, said Sumanasiri.
Director and Delegate General of the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in Colombo, Francis Cappe, spoke on the value that Alliance Francaise places on education.
We have always placed the importance of this link between French and Lankan culture. We are an international institute but we are also a local body comprised of competent local board of directors. Alliance Francaise is a large network in this country and also in the Maldives. We are the only Alliance Francaise in the city of Colombo delivering French Professional Diplomas. We are the only genuine organization. I am so thrilled and happy to collaborate with AIC. We started two years ago, and we have groomed the first generation of students. They are all very excited about this experience, said Cappe.
He pointed out that France is not popularly known as a destination for international students and stressed that if you want high quality education, France will not disappoint you.
This is a great opportunity to go and study in France. Of course it is necessary to know the French Language, but it is also beneficial to understanding the French Culture a little bit. We assure you that you can go to France and confidently study there. It is a good destination for the good things in life as well. Living in France is quite a pleasant experience. I wish the program all success, Cappe explained.

The Funeral of Beowulf
As Seamus Heaney tells us in Stepping Stones: interviews with Seamus Heaney (2008), he was first asked for a translation of Beowulf by the editors of the Norton Anthology of English Literature in the mid-1980s. Although he made a start, he began to wonder, after 100 lines or so, whether hed be fit for the long haul and it wasnt until 1995 that he felt able to return to the task. In the introduction to the 1999 Faber edition of his translation, he suggests a number of reasons for this change of heart: his discovery of the closeness of certain Ulster dialect words to their Old English roots, particularly thole (to suffer) which comes from olian  a fact that became the secret fulcrum of the whole exercise; the crucial decision to translate the first word hwt as so to get the poem off on the right idiomatic foot; and his recognition that one of his earliest poems, Digging (1996), follows the rules of Anglo Saxon metrics  lines of balanced halves with two stressed syllables, linked by alliteration across the caesura. Part of him, he realized, had been writing Anglo-Saxon from the start. Coming soon after he began teaching at Harvard and was hearing the unmoored speech of some contemporary American poetry, the commission would also be a way of ensuring that his linguistic anchor stayed lodged on the Anglo-Saxon sea-floor.
There is a tension in translation, of course, between the poets need to make a poem sound convincing to himself and the obligation to respect the feel and sense of the original: as Heaney says, any translation sits half-way between a crib and an appropriation. But he admits that the set-text nature of the Norton Anthology made him even more aware of this pull, which we can see and hear, perhaps, in some of the changes he made to this extract  the magnificent set-piece of Beowulfs funeral  before the poem was published in its final form.
- Times Literary Supplement
The Funeral of Beowulf(Beowulf, lines 31373182)
In memory of George Mackay Brown The Geat people built a fire for Beowulf, stacked it four-square from the ground up, and hung helmets on it, as he had instructed, surrounding it with war-shields and shining mail.
Then his warriors laid him in the middle of it, mourning a lord who had been far-famed and beloved.
On a height they kindled the biggest ever funeral fire; fumes of woodsmoke billowed darkly up, the blaze roared and drowned out their weeping, wind died down and flames wrought havoc in the hot bone-house, burning it to the core. They were disconsolate and wailed aloud for their lords decease.
A Geat woman too sang out in grief; with hair bound up, she unburdened herself of her sorrows, telling again and again of the dread that possessed her: her people invaded, enemies on the rampage, bodies in piles, slavery and abasement. Heaven swallowed the smoke.
Then the Geat people bagan to construct a mound on a headland, high and imposing, a marker that sailors could see from far away, and in ten days they had done the work.
It was their heros monument; what remained from the fire they bestowed inside it, behind a wall as worthy of him as their workmanship could make it.
And they buried torques in the barrow, and jewels and a trove of such things as trespassing men had once dared to drag from the hoard.
They let the ground keep that ancestral treasure, gold under gravel, gone to earth, as useless to men as it ever was.
Then twelve warriors rode around the tomb, chieftains sons, champions in battle, all of them distraught, chanting in dirges, mourning his loss as a man and a king.
They extolled his heroic nature and exploits and gave thanks for his greatness which was the proper thing for a man should praise a lord who is dear and cherish his memory when that moment comes when he has to be conveyed from his bodily home. So the Geat people, his hearth companions, sorrowed for the lord who had been laid low.
They said that of all the kings upon earth he was the man who had been mildest and gentlest, the kindest to his people and the keenest for renown.

Get on your bike to stay young
Exercises like cycling can hold back the effects of ageing and keep people young in profound ways, a new study has found. Activities like regularly riding a bike appear to undo the assumption that we get more frail as we get older, the authors of the new research claim.
The studies compared data on amateur cyclists with healthy adults that did not regularly exercise. It found that those who were exercising seemed to be preserving many parts of their health. The findings showed that the cyclists preserved muscle mass and strength with age while maintaining stable levels of body fat and cholesterol. In men, testosterone levels remained high.
More surprisingly, the anti-ageing effects of cycling appeared to extend to the immune system. An organ called the thymus, which makes immune cells called T-cells normally, starts to shrink from the age of 20. But the thymuses of older cyclists were found to be generating as many T-cells as those of young individuals.
Professor Janet Lord, director of the Institute of Inflammation and Ageing at the University of Birmingham, said: "Hippocrates in 400 BC said that exercise is man's best medicine, but his message has been lost over time and we are an increasingly sedentary society. However, importantly, our findings debunk the assumption that ageing automatically makes us frailer. Our research means we now have strong evidence that encouraging people to commit to regular exercise throughout their lives is a viable solution to the problem that we are living longer but not healthier."
Male cyclists taking part in the study had to be able to cycle 100km in less than 6.5 hours while women had to cover 60km in 5.5 hours. The non-exercising group consisted of 75 healthy people aged 57 to 80, and 55 young adults aged 20 to 36.
Professor Stephen Harridge, director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King's College London, said: "The findings emphasized the fact that the cyclists do not exercise because they are healthy, but that they are healthy because they have been exercising for such a large proportion of their lives. Their bodies have been allowed to age optimally, free from the problems usually caused by inactivity. Remove the activity and their health would likely deteriorate."

Government provided houses for thousands: Sajith
The Yahapalana government has helped 264,000 families who were burdened without proper shelter by providing them with permanent housing facilities Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was speaking at a ceremony held to vest the newly constructed Siwdewigama Housing Scheme with the public. The President and the Prime Minister gave priority to the housing development programme. The Siwdewigama is the 49th model village constructed under the Reawakening Villages, Housing Scheme the Minister said.
"The new project is equipped with 39 houses, pure drinking water, electricity, and roadways. It cost the Ministry 373 lakhs. A community hall was also constructed and 337 additional families are listed to get the benefits," the Minister said.
The 50th village under the scheme will be vested with the public next Friday. Our aim is to construct 650 housing schemes by the end of this year and 2,500 housing schemes by 2020. The government invests a lot to uplift public welfare, the Minister said.
When the war ended, I brought up proposals to construct halls for the Sunday schools and provide two acres of paddy fields to every shrine. But they turned it all down and now speak of patriotism, he said.
The people appointed us to develop the country and we have a great burden on our shoulders to complete that task. We have to work honestly. Even though many obstacles come in my way, I am doing my best to protect the trust that the public have in my ministry, the Minister said.

ICC comes under criticism as Shakib is handed over only minor sanctions`
The virtual semi-final of the Nidahas Trophy between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka was marred by ugly scenes on the pitch. In the final over the game, off which eventual winners Bangladesh needed 12 runs to win, Sri Lanka's Isuru Udana bowled two bouncers to Mustafizur Rahman. The second was called a no-ball, but the umpire soon changed his mind.
This led to chaos between both the teams, with the visiting players protesting out of anger. Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, in particular, was furious with the umpire's decision, and with the kind of demeanour he put up that night, many thought that a ban was on Shakib's way. Had the umpires not intervened and stopped Shakib, the matter could have escalated to a whole new level.
Shakib later pleaded guilty to a charge of conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game and that was it. He received only minor sanctions and played in the final of the tournament against India yesterday. This has led to heavy criticism against the International Cricket Council, who recently imposed a two-match ban on South Africa's Kagiso Rabada, for an offence that is being seen as one of a much lesser violation than what Shakib did.
Proteas captain Faf du Plessis was the first to question ICC, asking how Rabada deserved three demerit points for a shirt flick with Steve Smith, which is the same number of demerit points handed to David Warner for an altercation with Quinton de Kock which got really ugly.
Getting one demerit point and losing 25% of the match fee for what happened yesterday, is like getting a pat on the back, Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle posted on Twitter, indirectly saying that charges against Shakib should have been much bigger.

Ireland seal grand slam in style at Twickenham
LONDON, Saturday: Ireland secured their third Six Nations grand slam in emphatic style on Saturday when, on a St Patricks Day to remember, they overwhelmed defending champions England 24-15 to join the men of 1948 and 2009 in the countrys rugby hall of fame.
The Irish made light of sleet and biting wind and an England team desperate to avoid a third successive defeat as they deservedly led 21-5 at halftime with tries by Garry Ringrose, CJ Stander and the prolific Jacob Stockdale.
England, unbeaten at home in the Six Nations since 2012, managed tries by Elliot Daly in each half and another in stoppage time by Jonny May but always looked second-best.
Ireland, who have now won 12 games in a row, top the standings on 26 points ahead of Scotland on 13, Wales 11, France and England on 10 and Italy with one.
Following Scotlands win in Rome earlier on Saturday and with just the Wales versus France game left in the championship, England will finish outside the top three for the first time in 12 years and could end as low as fifth - their worst performance in 35 years.
A year ago in Dublin Ireland ended English grand slam hopes by handing Eddie Jones his first defeat as England coach and on Saturday they rubbed it in by giving him his first at Twickenham.
The Australians oft-stated aim has been to build England into a team capable of challenging New Zealand as the best in the world but at the moment they have dropped so far off the pace that they are not even close to being the best in Europe.
That honour goes to Ireland, deserved champions - though the grand slam looked a long way away when they began the 41-phase move that ended with a Jonny Sexton drop goal to snatch victory in their first match away to France.
They had no need for such heroics on Saturday, however, as they were rarely troubled at a ground where they had lost on three of their last four visits.
It was all Ireland in the opening 20 minutes as they built a 14-0 lead that England could hardly complain about.
BLASTED THROUGH
First the TMO ruled that Ringrose had fairly reached the ball after Anthony Watson spilt a Sexton up and under then Stander skidded into the base of a post after Bundee Aki had blasted through the English midfield.
England finally roused themselves with a series of driving mauls that created space for Owen Farrell to find with a deft kick for Daly to reach on the left wing.
But just as the crowd were getting ready for halftime with the game delicately poised at 14-5, the visitors struck in stoppage time with a knockout blow.
The TMO again ruled in their favour as Stockdale knocked on  legally  with his knee before diving on the ball for his 11th try in his nine internationals to send Ireland in 21-5 ahead.
England, seeking to avoid a third successive defeat in the competition for the first time since 2006, came out full of fire in the second half but came up against the disciplined, organised and hugely motivated defence that has been a key aspect in Irelands march to the title.
As Ireland stood firm, the thousands of their fans were ensuring it was the St Patricks Day of a lifetime as the sounds of their Fields of Athenry anthem rang around the ground and the volume was cranked up further when a Conor Murray penalty after an hour stretched the lead to 19.
A great backhand pass by Mike Brown sent Daly over and May had the last word.
But, summing up Englands day and entire championship, Farrell uncharacteristically failed to convert any of the three tries and the score did nothing other than slightly delay the Irish celebrations.
We gave them too many penalties at the start of the game and allowed them to build a lead, Jones said.
They are a good tough team, very worthy grand slam champions and theyve performed extremely well today.

J. Walter Thompson Colombo  Tapping Into Female Capital
J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka launched 2018 with a preview of Female Tribes, A conversation on Motherhood which is due to be released in full this May.
Weve spent the last year in conversation with 100 people about the idea and realities of motherhood, said Alyna Haji Omar, CEO of J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka.
First time mums, young girls talking about their mums. Young women evaluating the choices before them, single mums, single dads playing double roles, Full-time dads reinventing the rules, LGBT mums, not-mums, celebrity mums. Weve spoken to so many wonderful people and retold these conversation through design, the first preview was launched in January and were thrilled with the reactions to it across the market.
A large proportion of the brands we work with are mainly targeted at women but the masculinity of marketing remains a real barrier in reaching out to women in a meaningful way. We believe in female capital, it highlights the value women bring to the world: as women. We need to know the value of women as leaders, politicians, economists, scientists, pioneers, activists, athletes, actors and artists. This first edition of Female Tribes does that through a powerful and incredibly insightful series of design stories.
Commenting on her journey as the CEO of JWT since June 2015 Alyna said, In just over 2 years we have completely transformed the Sri Lanka operation making us a more vibrant, digitally led, strategically rooted creative powerhouse that is in every way ahead of the curve within the local industry.
We set out to recalibrate our legacy, we restructured and established new KPIs and drove an entirely different, more aggressive and certainly more progressive agenda, building core competencies around Female Capital was and continues to be a central focus  looking back on the last 2 plus years weve hired 80% women, our teams are equally represented, my leadership team is equally represented, my junior leadership team in dominated by women, 2 out of 3 core departments are led by women, our last winner of the global high potentials program a woman  the ROI is powerful, over 400% growth in just over 2 years. 90% pitch win rate, attrition at a record low, client retention at a record high the future is female!
Tarun Rai, CEO of J. Walter Thompson South Asia said, Our Sri Lanka operations have been on a roll ever since Alyna took over as CEO. And I am not all surprised at their amazing success. The atmosphere in the office is electric. The energy is palpable. They are trying out new things. And most important, having fun. Alyna was my first appointment as I took over my new role at JWT and I am very proud of her achievements. She is not only the youngest woman agency CEO in Sri Lanka but in the entire South Asia region. And she has a fantastic bunch of very capable, senior women along with her to drive JWT Sri Lanka to even greater success.
I find that being a women- led agency infuses the team with a powerful blend of empathy and courage that has played no small part in building enduring relationships, not only with our clients but with our partners and colleagues as well, said Michelle Georgesz, Director of Client Services. We believe it is important to break barriers and stereotypes and through our ongoing research, we believe we have found genuine insights and not just pre- conceived assumptions into female behavior.
Asela De Silva,Head of Creative of J. Walter Thompson Sri Lanka, Being a creative in the industry for quite awhile, I have found that when the team is diverse, there is definitely an edge when tapping into insights and the ideas that come out of it, and subsequently the campaigns are more authentic, powerful and resonates with people better.

JLanka seminar on Investing in a Clean Future held
JLanka Technologies, Sri Lankas leading solar solutions provider facilitated a seminar titled Investing in a Clean Future - Understanding the Value Chain of Utility-Scale Solar PV Power Plants to a packed audience of investors, engineers, government representatives, corporate organizations, media institutions and other stakeholders in support of the public power generating programme Surya Bala Sangramaya (SBS) on March 8 at the Kingsbury Hotel.
The main objective of this seminar was to create a high level of awareness among all stakeholders on key aspects of the design and implementation of solar power plants, said Eng. Channa Silva, Head of Projects of JLanka. We were glad to bring together the key players involved in the SBS under one roof, setting the stage for an open and transparent dialogue between Power and Renewable Energy Ministry of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Electricity Board, solar solution providers and investors. We are thrilled with the success of the event, and are encouraged to continue this dialogue in the future.
The event kicked off with the Chief Operating Officer of JLanka, Jayantha Jayamanna giving comprehensive insight into the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) operational value chain in solar projects. As the foremost EPC subcontractor for solar projects in the country, Jayamanna presented JLankas expertise and success rate with the previous SBS bidding cycle of 1MW x 60 solar power plants, and bonus value offerings.
Our greatest asset is our team of 400+ qualified individuals spread across 17 locations around Sri Lanka, Jayamanna said. This gives us the ability to scale according to the demand of this second bidding cycle. Additionally, JLanka is the only solar solutions provider to offer a systems performance warranty up to 20 years, as opposed to conventional component warranties. This is an unmatched offering we are providing our customers with the guarantee from our partnerships with the worlds best solar companies.
Shashidhara BV, Head of SolarEdge India and Sri Lanka at SolarEdge Technologies, JLankas solar inverter partner, was also present to provide the participants insight into the latest SolarEdge developments as well as trends in the industry.
Eng. Dr. H.M Wijekoon Banda, Chief Engineer (Transmission Planning) of the CEB, during the keynote speech titled  Integration of variable renewables to the Sri Lankan grid  explained to the audience of the evolution of Sri Lankas energy grid, and the CEBs role in ensuring the perfect integration of renewable and conventional energy to meet the demand of power consumers.
Joining him, Eng. Buddhika Samarasekara, Chief Engineer (Generation Planning) of the CEB went on to describe the current and future status of the Sri Lankan power system. According to presented data, other renewable energy sources, inclusive of solar only took a 10% of the generated energy share in 2017, with much room for growth. Both representatives emphasized on the importance of the planning divisions of the CEB, where all potential power generation projects had to be first identified in the Long-Term Power Generation Expansion Plan of the CEB.
We have started with 1MW scale projects, and are looking at moving on to 10MW scale solar plants next, Eng. Samarasekara commented. The next step is 100MW scale solar parks, but building the infrastructure for such massive scale projects will take time. Developing a transmission network alone for such a capacity would take at least 2 years. However, it is definitely part of our future plan for solar power.
A panel discussion with the participation of State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith P. Perera along with the speakers concluded the seminar, where Dr. B.M.S Batagoda, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, thanked JLanka for facilitating the seminar and discussions between all stakeholders, to create an opportunity to resolve any queries and further improve the bidding process for 90 projects of 1 MW solar power plants on build, own and operate basis under Phase II of the SBS.

Kandy unrest: Compensation for properties damaged from today
The programme to pay compensation for the properties damaged during the recent unrest in Kandy would get underway today, according to Kandy District Secretary H.M.P.Hitisekera.
According to a decision taken by the government, all relevant parties have been informed to expedite payments to the victims and complete payments within a short period of time.
Hitisekera said the Government has decided to start paying compensation although it was yet to fully estimate the damages caused to properties.
He said an initial payment will be made to the victims starting today and the full compensation will be provided as soon as the damage assessment is completed. Hitisekera said the government has given instructions to the relevant authorities to complete the damage assessment at its earliest.
According to Hitisekera, altogether 465 property damages had been recorded in five Divisional Secretariat Divisions in Kandy due to the unrest.
Meanwhile, it is said that four Ministries will be involved in the payment of compensation for damages caused during the recent unrest in Kandy according to a decision made by the government on the instructions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
They are the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Ministry of Posts and Muslim Religious Affairs, Ministry of Rehabilitation and Resettlement and the Ministry of Disaster Management.
Payment of compensation to Buddhist and Muslim places of worship will be made through the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and the Ministry of Muslim Religious Affairs respectively.
Compensation payments in respect of damages caused to properties of the general public will be made through the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Resettlement while the Ministry of Disaster Management will make a common estimate of the damage caused for compensation payments.
The Prime Minister had also directed that all properties damaged should be fully rehabilitated within four months.

Ladies in law
The societies that sprang along the river valleys of the East and those of the Mediterranean considered women weaker than men. The women of the low orders laboured hard while the upper orders enjoyed less manual work but they were under the subjugation of men. All women were considered inferior to men both in physical and moral strength. The man took upper-hand in all kinds of work and women were under full and complete control and influence of men.
Aristotle thought that women were weaker and impulsive than men. Plato had a better reflection of womens abilities. He thought women could equal men as philosophers and admitted them in his Academy.
The argument was advanced that books destroy womens brain. However, in support of women, Juan Luis Vives wrote The Instruction of a Christian Woman and Sir Thomas Elyot wrote The Defence of Good Women. St. Jerome advocated restricted education to women and nunneries were opened for women. However the upper-class women enjoyed these facilities and the lower-class women continued to suffer under mens subjugation.
modern freedom for women
First female Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake
Entrance to law and medicine was more difficult. The Church and the public were hostile to women practising these professions. Law offered many difficulties. Training was in private offices and the societies did not encourage it at all and they were not allowed to practise the profession. After a strenuous fight, Myra Bradwell was able to practise in 1872 when Illinois brought legislation to remove sex disqualification. Though Bella Lockwood admitted to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (1873) she was denied the right to practise in the Supreme Court of United States till legislation was passed in 1879.
Great progress has been made in the year 1951 when fifty countries had equal numbers of girls and boys in the primary schools and 43 countries had secondary schools. In 47 countries higher education for girls ranged from 1% to 4%.
The modern freedom for women in Great Britain commenced with the introduction of the Legislation of Married Women Property Act, 1882, the Representation of the People Act 1918 by which they were allowed to vote. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 opened them to many professions hitherto before closed to them.
In Sri Lanka, it was so unfortunate that prior to the introduction of the Sex Disqualification Removal (Legal Profession) Ordinance No. 25 of 1933, the fair sex was not permitted to be admitted or enrolled as an Advocate or as a Proctor or as a Notary or as a Commissioner for Oaths.
However, the Ordinance No.25 of 1933 gave the license to the women to become and to practise as Advocates, Proctors and Notaries and to become Commissioners for Oaths. Section 2 of this Ordinance states:
More women as Attorneys-at-law
A woman shall not be disqualified by reason only of her sex 
from being admitted and enrolled, or from practising, as an Advocate or as a Proctor; or from being authorised to practise as a Notary by a warrant issued under the provisions of the Notaries Ordinance, or from practising or functioning as a Notary under the provisions of that Ordinance or of any other written law; or from being appointed, or from functioning, or as a Commissioner for Oaths under the provisions of the Oaths Ordinance.
Now, we are witnessing that the Sri Lanka Law College produces more women than men as Attorneys-at-law.
The first female to become a member of the legal profession (Proctor) was Sir Lalita Rajapakses sister-in-law, Ruby Devanayagam. The first female adorned with silk was Maureen Seneviratne (Advocate). Mallika Prematilake was the first female lecturer at Sri Lanka Law College. She was the first female Magistrate (1979) and District Judge (1985).
Shanthi Eva Wanasundare PC was the first female Senior State Counsel in the Attorney Generals Department, first female Deputy Solicitor General (1998) and the first female Additional Solicitor General (2005). She is the first female officer of the Attorney Generals Depart to be conferred silk (2007). She became the first female to be appointed as Acting Attorney General in December 2008 and in March 2009. Later became the first female Attorney General.
Dr. Shirani A Bandaranayake was the first female to be appointed as Supreme Court Judge on October 30, 1996, and the first lady to be appointed Acting Chief Justice. Later, she became the first female Chief Justice of Sri Lanka.
Lady Chief Justice
However, unfair impeachment of the Lady Chief Justice was brought up and a Panel of Inquiry of the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) hurriedly concluded within six hours of sittings, examining and recording of the evidence of most of the sixteen witnesses and marking of more than 1000 pages of documents, despite the Supreme Court request to restrain the PSC from proceeding with the Inquiry but the Panel went on disregarding the SC request and found the Chief Justice guilty and she was removed. She was reinstated after Maithripala Sirisena became President and Ranil Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister. She was the first female Chief Justice to be removed and reinstated.
Chandra Ekanayake was the first female to become the Judge of the Court of Appeal (2003) and President of the Court of Appeal in 2008. The first female Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo (Law Faculty) was Prof Savitri Goonesekera. There are many female roses who rose first in their respective fields of the legal profession, yet to be traced and identified.
Married Womens Property Ordinance was enacted in 1924. It gave them the freedom to hold immovable properties in their own names and to enter into the contract as feme-soles. The said Act did not in certain matters apply to Kandyans, Muslims or Tamils governed by the law of Thesawalamai.
It is good to see that women in the 21st century are marching with men hand in hand and on equal terms.

Dinesh Karthik finishes off in Javed Miandad style
Last ball six clinches Hero Nidahas trophy for India
What a finish! India were stretched to the limit by a spirited Bangladesh side before sealing a six-wicket win with a six off the last ball to clinch the Hero Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
India chasing 167 for victory required 34 off the last two overs and Dinesh Karthik had to use all his IPL experience to get his team over the line to provide a classic finish to an enthralling final. With the odds stacked heavily in favour of a Bangladesh win Karthik took matters into his own hands to single-handedly guide his team to victory.
Karthik hit Rubel Hossain for 22 runs in the penultimate over to leave India requiring 12 off the last six balls.
Bangladesh gambled on bowling part time bowler Soumya Sarkar for the crucial final over and it didnt pay off. Although they managed to get the wicket of Vijay Shankar off the fifth ball it left India with five required for a win off the last. Karthik obliged in style clearing cover with ease as the entire stadium that had been supporting India throughout the match erupted with a roar.
His finish was similar to the way Pakistan batting legend Javed Miandad once won a final for his country against India hitting Chetan Sharma for a last ball six at Sharjah in 1986 in the Austral-Asia Cup when four was needed.
Indias Dinesh Karthik celebrates victory after hitting the last ball of the final against Bangladesh for six.
Karthik finished unbeaten on 29 scored off eight balls with three sixes and two fours and thanks to his effort it brought Rohit Sharma his first trophy as captain in a tournament.
Until the 18th over Bangladesh were in control of the match. They actually gained ascendency following the dismissal of Sharma for a well composed 56 off 42 balls in the 14th over. From then onwards India came under pressure. Manish Pandeys departure for 28 in the 18th over brought Karthik to the crease and he simply snatched the game away from Bangladeshs grasp. It was a case of so near and yet so far for the Bangladeshis who had put up a great fight to make the final a worthy one when everyone expected India to walk away with it.
What Indias win meant was that they were the best team of the three competing in the series and although they were not at full strength (five of their regulars were rested) they had enough ammunition in their stocks to still compete and beat the best that Bangladesh and Sri Lanka could put out.
Despite the host country Sri Lanka failing to make it to the final a large crowd was present to witness the final the majority of them cheering for India. India never had such a backing from the Lankan cricket fans for a long time who were waving Indian flags. The Indian team in appreciation of their support did a lap of honour to thank them after the match with Sri Lankas legendary one-man cheer squad Percy Abeysekara leading the way.
Bangladesh invited to bat first were spurred by Sabbir Rahmans fourth half-century probably one of the best he has made. His innings helped Bangladesh recover from losing their first four wickets for 68 runs to post a competitive total of 166-8.
Sabbir who began with a reverse sweep went for his shots from the start but later settled down to play a brilliant innings of 77 off 50 balls that included four sixes and seven fours.
There wasnt a single noteworthy partnership in the Bangladesh innings which made Sabbirs knock all the more valuable as he helped them amass 84 runs in the last eight overs.
Yuzvendra Chahal caused the collapse of the Bangladesh top order by capturing three of the four wickets to fall for 18 runs as Sharma bowled him through his four overs.
However that allowed Bangladesh to make a late flourish as India had to depend on their fast bowlers Vijay Shankar and Shardul Thakur to bowl the death overs. Both bowlers were spanked for over ten an over that enabled Bangladesh to get to their final score which in the end nearly won the match for them.
Bangladesh has never beaten India in this format and yesterdays loss stretched their dismal record to 8-0 in Indias favour.
Karthik was named Player of the final and Washington Sundar took the Player of the Series awards.
President Maithripala Sirisena who witnessed the closing stages of the final presented the Hero Nidahas trophy to Indian skipper Rohit Sharma.

Legal Advice on What to Eat..!
With the world hearing that India is banning the eating of beef and trying to change people into vegetarians, my neighbor in London, a diehard meat eater, and who was planning a trip to India decided he would become a veggie. I dont want to be thrown into one of their jails. So I am practicing to be a vegetarian before my holiday, he said as he looked at a picture of a mango tree, I have told my cook to cook those leaves for lunch!
Thats a mango tree, I said, You eat the fruit, not the leaves.
You cant put anything of that tree into a curry
Only the raw mangoes, I said, you eat the ripe ones raw and cook the raw ones!
This is very confusing, said my English neighbour as he scratched his head and stared at the pictures of ripe mangoes on the tree. What happens if I eat the leaves
I dont know, I said.
What happens if I ate the raw mangoes raw and put the ripe mangoes into a curry
No idea, I said helplessly.
What about cauliflower
What about it I asked.
Do I eat it cooked or uncooked
You cant eat it uncooked, I said disgustedly.
Im sorry I didnt know, said my neighbour, now beginning to look a little worried, What about this fruit
Its a carrot, I said, its not a fruit its a root, which is eaten like a vegetable!
A root eaten like a vegetable but not a vegetable asked my neighbour, so its allowed isnt it. I mean as a vegetarian I can eat it
Sure you can, I said patting him on the back.
This vegetarianism business is going to be a long journey, he said. Is it okay if I eat this vegetable
Its not a vegetable, I said looking at the onion he was holding out to me.
Its a fruit
No, I said.
Let me guess, its a root
No, I said, its a bulb!
Whoa! Whoa! shouted my neighbour throwing the onion away, dammit I dont want to get electrocuted chewing a bulb! I thought being a vegetarian was safe
It is, I said.
And do you eat the bulb cooked
Raw, I said patiently.
I think I need expert advice before I get into this vegetarian business!
I agree, I said as I watched him go to his phone.
Do you know a good lawyer
Lawyer I asked.
Yes, some expert wholl advice me the do and donts of what to eat and what not to eat in India. I dont want to be arrested by the gestapo for eating the wrong food!
Theres no gestapo in India! I said stiffly.
Then whats this he asked fearfully, showing me another picture.
Oh that! I said, thats the Prime Ministers men, and they dont wear khaki shorts anymore..!

LIQUID OF LIFE!
Water! We drink it, wash in it, cook with it, swim in it and generally take it for granted. This clear, tasteless and odourless liquid is so much part of our lives that we hardly ever think about its amazing properties but take it for granted. We would die in a few days without water as 65 percent of our bodies are composed of water.
Besides slaking our thirst, water is necessary to dissolve essential minerals and oxygen, flush our bodies of waste products, and transport nutrients around the body where needed. Water is the only substance that has these properties. And it has many more fascinating features that suggest that it has been designed just right for life.
Water is not only the most essential substance next to oxygen for human life. It is also complex, often containing hundreds of dissolved minerals and chemicals. Most water is also structured or clustered in complex ways. It is indeed a remarkable substance whose extreme value is often unrecognised.
And today, we are messing with it. The sheer number of human beings on Earth - seven billion, with another two billion likely by 2050 - is adding unsustainable stress to the supply and the quality of fresh water all over the globe. While water is life, the limited, and in too many cases, nonexistent, non-availability of clean, potable water means lingering sickness and even death for countless people in scores of countries.
Water, water everywhere, not a clean drop to drink! The old primer attributed to a ship-wrecked victim may become a terrifying reality if our precious liquid is not managed and sustained adequately. Who would have thought that there will be a day when sanitation of available water would be more of a concern than availability of water itself
The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but it also decides the diversity of life there. Of course, the availability of water is not the only aspect that decides the sustainability of life in a region. Other factors such as the temperature and nature of soil also matter. But water is one of the major resources which determine life on land.
Many of us in urban Sri Lanka do not realise how fortunate we are. We simply turn on a tap when we need fresh clean water. We use this water for a variety of purposes. On average, our direct indoor water use comes to over 50 gallons of water per person per day. When you include all uses of water at home, both indoor and outdoor, a local family of four can use up to 200 gallons per day!
But spare a thought for the nearly 750 million people around the world who still have no access to clean drinking water. That is why so many people, children in particular, suffer all types of life threatening illnesses. In many parts of the undeveloped world women waste hours walking to fetch water from streams and waterholes rather than spending their time more productively.
It behoves us all to tell the world that responsible use of fresh water is essential for a healthy planet and human well-being. But fresh water, in turn, isnt possible without a healthy planet.
Yet human actions are putting a healthy planet at risk. After all, life on earth is maintained by water. A crisis of fresh water has become the biggest challenge to humans in the millennium.
That is why all the worlds national authorities responsible for drinking water supplies keep stressing the importance of spreading the message that drinking water will be the most precious commodity in the world in the near future. Water means different things to each of us but one thing is for sure! It is vital for all our lives.
This is a problem that concerns us all. Water authorities everywhere are striving frantically to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene to cover the worlds population by 2030. The goal is possible only if we all chip in and help them.
Fortunately, saving water around the house is easier today than ever before. Modern toilets, showers and faucets are designed to be more efficient and can save your household many gallons per day. For example, older toilets can use up to 6 gallons per flush, whereas newer low-flow (water-saving) toilets use from 1.6 to 3.5 gallons, and high-efficiency models even less.
Similarly, regular showerheads spray nearly a gallon per minute, while low-flow models put out just over half a gallon per minute. That is why we should also consider cutting our shower time down by at least a few minutes.
International World Water Day includes official and milestone events as well as many other events organized by various stakeholders around the world. Each year, the event highlights a specific aspect of freshwater. No matter how you spell it or how you pronounce it, H2O is a wonder: a beautifully simple, simply beautiful element that, when all is said and done, means nothing less than life. [emailprotected]
World Water Day, will be celebrated on Thursday March 22. It does so every year to focus attention on the importance of water. This years theme, Nature for Water, explores nature-based solutions (NBS) to the water challenges we face in the 21st century.
The campaign is called The answer is in nature and raises awareness of NBS. The central message is that NBS, such as planting trees to replenish forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, and restoring wetlands, is a sustainable and cost-effective way to help rebalance the water cycle, mitigate the effects of climate change and improve human health and livelihoods.
By using NBS to help meet the water needs of a growing population, we will contribute to the creation of a circular economy, at the same time as helping to protect the natural environment and reduce pollution - both key targets in Sustainable Development Goal 6, which commits the world to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.
Damaged ecosystems affect the quantity and quality of water available for human consumption. Today, 2.1 billion people live without safe drinking water at home; affecting their health, education and livelihoods.
Sustainable Development Goal 6 commits the world to ensuring that everyone has access to safe water by 2030, and includes targets on protecting the natural environment and reducing pollution.
The water crisis affects the poorest most  from slums to remote rural communities, refugee camps and disaster-prone communities, and particularly those marginalised by income, gender, caste, age or disability. As a result, the poorest live and die in conditions unthinkable to us in the developed world, unseen and unheard.
When we neglect our ecosystems, we make it harder to provide everyone with the water we need to survive and thrive.

Livelihood of over 300,000 tobacco  farmer community in jeopardy
The livelihood of the countrys 300,000 tobacco farming community will be severally affected if the Government imposes the ban of tobacco cultivation from 2020, `All Ceylon Cigarette Tobacco Barn Owners Association (ACCTBOA) said.
The ACCTBOA made these remarks at a meeting held in Colombo to create awareness of media about the Governments proposed tobacco cultivation ban which is going to be implemented from 2020.
The ACCTBOA said in addition to tobacco farming community, over 20,000 farmers in Polonnaruwa , Anuradhapura, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Kuruinegala, Monaragala and Kandy districts where tobacco is cultivated will lose their sole livelihood unless the authorities do not revert the ban.
Although our association pledged the authorities including the President and the Agriculture Ministry, mentioning our service to develop the national economy and also the pathetic living conditions of our farmers and dependents of the industry we have still not received any fruitful response from either side, ACCTBOA, President Jayantha Egodawela said.
He said tobacco farmers provide the required 100 percent processed tobacco leaves to Ceylon Tobacco Compnay (CTC) every year without any interruption and such a situation has resulted the CTC to refrain from importing tobacco leaves from major tobacco producing countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
President Egodawela further said if the Governments proposed tobacco cultivation ban is implemented, then the CTC will have to import raw materials by paying a huge amount of foreign exchange.
Egodage also said cultivators are ready to stop cultivating tobacco at any time if the Government gives an assurance to introduce a profitable acceptable alternative agricultural crop instead of tobacco cultivation.
But, without giving any such assurance how could we stop this cultivation and let 300,000 over farming community to survive without any income,  he said.

Lukaku, Matic send lukewarm Man United into Cup semis
MANCHESTER, Saturday : Headers by Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic earned Manchester United an unconvincing 2-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion in a low-key FA Cup quarter-final played in freezing conditions on Saturday.
United, looking to make amends after their feeble Champions League defeat by Sevilla, struggled to impose themselves against Brighton before Lukaku broke the deadlock by heading home Matics curling, left-foot cross at the far post after 37 minutes.
The goal was Lukakus 12th goal in 11 FA Cup games and the Belgians 25th of the season in all competitions, including goals in each round of the FA Cup. But once again, United were unable to build on the opener and lost their way in the second half as a slow tempo and lack of fluency restricted their attacking potency.
Brighton, in contrast, grew more confident as the game went on and dominated possession in the second half to keep United goalkeeper Sergio Romero busy.
Dutch forward Juergen Locadia was twice foiled by Romero and was off-target with a header from a promising Solly March cross.
But Matic calmed the nerves around Old Trafford seven minutes from time when he stole in to nod Ashley Youngs teasing free kick into the net.
It was difficult for us after the defeat against Sevilla, of course we were very sad after the game. It was important to see a reaction today and were through to the next round and were happy, Matic said.
Manager Jose Mourinhos angry 12-minute monologue on Friday contained little criticism of his players but he was less forgiving after this display.
Matic was an island of personality, surrounded by not water but lack of class and desire. I have to say that, said the Portuguese manager.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton said his team had caused United problems.
We were always in the game, certainly as regards shots and shots on target, I thought we were always a threat but we needed to work their keeper a little bit more, maybe that little bit more quality in the final third, he said.
United, bidding to win the FA Cup for the 13th time, joined Tottenham Hotspur in the last four. Leicester City play Chelsea and third-tier Wigan Athletic face Southampton in the other quarter-finals on Sunday.

Mahendran arrest possible since judiciary is independent: Navin
An open warrant for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran had been issued because the Courts of Justice are fully independent today, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanyake said.
He was speaking to the media after presiding over a workshop on quality upgrading attended by high officials of palntation companies recently.
Minister Dissanyake said they firmly subscribed to the view that a person found guilty by a Presidential Commission of Inquiry should be brought before courts.
A majority of the UNP members too subscribed to this opinion. He said the Prime Minister made the statement in Parliament because he had some confidence in Mahendran.
"They too as leaders made statements believing people whom they trusted. But the Prime Minister did not try to deceive Parliament wilfully by making that statement. Neither had the Commission said that he tried to provide wrong information," he said. Minister Dissanayake said Mahendran would not be able to be on the run evading arrest for too long. "A person engaged in wrong-doing would get caught sooner or later," he said.
"Sri Lanka had very close ties with Singapore and this issue should be resolved with Singapore amicably without harming our mutual relations," he said.
He said he believed that if Sri Lanka requested Singapore to hand over Arjun Mahendran since he is wanted by law enforcement authorities, Singapore would accede to the request sympathetically.

Manage irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can cause severe discomfort and is often difficult to treat as patients have different triggers. IBS may be inherited. It is linked to oversensitive nerves in the gut, causing debilitating pains and cramps among other symptoms. But there are ways to manage and reduce its impact on your life.Consider medication
Speak to your doctor about what is recommended for your particular type of IBS. If you have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), then laxatives could help. These range from osmotic laxatives, which increase water inside the colon, to cathartic laxatives, which stimulate the colon walls, although the latter may not be effective long-term. If you have IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D), then over-the-counter medications such as loperamide can help control your symptoms. Try probiotics Research has suggested that changes in gut flora may trigger IBS by increasing inflammation and altering digestive motility. For some people, probiotics available in capsules, powders and yoghurts can alleviate symptoms, balancing gut flora by inhibiting the growth of disease-causing bacteria, slowing down bowel movements and fighting inflammation.Move to a high-fibre diet.
If you have IBS-C or IBS-D, then increasing dietary fibre with fruit, vegetables, beans, whole-grain breads and cereals may relieve symptoms. High-fat meals can cause problems by inducing vigorous colon contractions more rapidly than usual, which can trigger cramping and diarrhoea. However, IBS has quite a wide spectrum and only one in six IBS patients experience improvements from this diet.Take exercise Research has suggested that 30 minutes of exercise, such as walking at a moderate pace, five days a week can significantly help to ease common symptoms such as constipation and abdominal cramps.Reduce your stress levels.
Stress is widely thought to trigger IBS, partly because of the neural connections between the brain and the gut, and any external stressors make the mind more aware of painful colon spasms. IBS may be an auto-immune disorder, and the immune system is heavily affected by stress. Try to make time in your day for relaxation sessions and, if you have a stressful life, consider taking up yoga or meditation, or practise breathing exercises.Keep a food diary.
IBS patients have different triggers, so keep a daily diary of all the foods and drinks that make your symptoms flare up. If you experience bloating, you may want to try eliminating gas-producing foods such as resistant starch (found in cold potatoes and bread), beans, cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, and carbonated drinks. Fructose, found in sweet vegetables and fruit, can also trigger diarrhoea, gas and bloating in IBS sufferers, and it is worth remembering that one in 10 IBS sufferers are lactose intolerant, so minimising dairy products can provide relief. Caffeine can make diarrhoea worse, so limit coffee and tea to three cups a day.Try peppermint oil.
Studies have shown that peppermint oil may be effective in reducing the severity of abdominal cramps and spasms, bloating and the intensity of bowel movement urgency and pain when passing stools, particularly in patients with IBS-D. Try purchasing enteric-coated peppermint oil, specially coated tablets that slowly release the oil in the small intestine. www.theguardian.com

## Title: MEDICAL SPECIALISTS DEBUNK RUMOURS OF 'INFERTILITY PILL'

MEDICAL SPECIALISTS DEBUNK RUMOURS OF 'INFERTILITY PILL'
Rubbishing reports that long-term sterilization (or infertility) pills were being used by one community against the other, doctors last week emphasized that such pills have not yet been discovered by the medical world. They also stated that any pill incorporated into hot foods like kottu rotti would be inactive under any circumstance.
This notion that sterilization pills were being mixed into food items sold at Muslim eateries has also been dispelled by the Government Analysts report, which confirmed that no sterilizing content was used in that particular food and the suspected particle was a mere ball of starch.
At present, there is no contraceptive pill which is known to exist that can cause infertility or sub-fertility by simply being added to food, said Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) Auditorium in Colombo last Thursday, this group of independent senior medical specialists said there were no sterilization pills in the pharmaceutical sector known to the medical profession that can cause permanent infertility.
The group of senior medical professionals noted that this media briefing on the so-called sub-fertility pill had risen in the aftermath of a major uproar in the country lately, leading to racial clashes in the Kandy and Ampara districts.
The media conference was convened by Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne, immediate past president of the Sri Lanka Medical Association, and was attended by a large number of senior consultants.
We are a group of medical professionals not affiliated to any professional organization, said Dr. Upul Dissanayake. We have come out on our own accord to dispel some myths on the current news which is causing much tension, the so-called infertility pill, said to be mixed with food served at eateries.
The pharmaceutical industry has been searching for a medicinal drug which can cause temporary infertility so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, similar to contraceptive tablets taken by women to prevent pregnancies, added Consultant Physician and Clinical Pharmacologist Prof. Chandani Wanigatunga. However, such a medicine has not been developed yet.
crux of fertility
Fertility in males and females is influenced by many factors; medicinal drugs are only one factor which can potentially affect fertility. Male fertility depends on the presence of adequate numbers of active spermatozoa which are normal in structure and function in seminal fluid. When either the number of spermatozoa are reduced or their function and mobility are impaired, the ability to impregnate a woman is reduced and this results in sub-fertility (difficulty in conceiving a child), and in extreme situations, infertility (the inability to conceive a child). Similar factors may affect the fertility of a woman.
Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake said surveys have shown some decline in the countrys male fertility.
In the past, not many males were willing to come forward and have themselves tested. However, now males are coming forward to have their fertility tested and this enables us to have some idea of the numbers. One of the main causes of male fertility is lifestyle changes. As men work in offices for longer hours, they wear tight clothing for long periods which can impede their fertility. Further, smoking and consuming alcohol could also have an effect on male fertility. But, there is nothing to suggest that male infertility is caused by any contraceptive pill, he said.
These specialist doctors noted that some medicines used for other purposes may reduce the sperm count in men or affect fertility in women, as a side effect of their use. But such a reduction in fertility by these drugs can be reversed in most instances. All such drugs, however, can only be obtained with a valid prescription from a registered doctor.
Furthermore, a single dose or a few doses of these medicines are not adequate to cause significant changes in sperm counts or sperm function. In essence, there are currently no easily available drugs or compounds, in Western medical practice, which can significantly affect fertility if they are administered once or for a short period to an individual. There is also no documented instance of the use of such drugs aimed at reducing fertility in the population anywhere in the world, these specialists emphasized.
Meanwhile, an expert in Forensic Science, Toxicology, and Pathology, Prof. Ravindra Fernando said in instances of such complicated issues, it is the Government Analysts Department that makes the final decision. The Government Analyst has examined the substance that was found in the kottu roti which created panic in the country and determined that it was a particle of starch. Now there is no suspicion whatsoever that it was not a tablet but a mere particle of starch, which led to this unfortunate incident.
No such drug exists
As the specialists vehemently expressed their opinion that in Western medicine there was no tablet that could cause sterilization of males or females by a single or short-term dose, the media raised a question whether native medicines could be used for such a purpose. Dr. Upul Dissanayake, in reply, said even in native medicine, there was no proof to suggest that such a pill could be made, let alone that it exists at present.
We are 100 percent certain that there is absolutely no drug in either Western or native medicine that can cause such infertility by oral administration, he said. The chemical compounds used in medicine are obtained mainly from plants, but they are all chemicals. Taking into consideration the current progress in medicine, Western or native, there is absolutely no possibility that such a drug can be manufactured.
There were also allegations that certain infertility substances were being applied to female undergarments to cause barrenness. However, these specialists noted that this is an absolutely baseless allegation, as there is no such thing known in the medical profession that can cause barrenness.
Proactive action
Explaining what action the medical profession would take in the future to come forward and clarify matters of medical relevance, Dr. Anula Wijesundara who will be the next President of the SLMA, said, The Sri Lanka Medical Association is basically a professional association that is non-political and non-profit-making that serves the interests of the medical professionals in the country. Hereafter, we will certainly highlight important problems which clearly arise from false information. This year and the next, we will continue to highlight controversial issues to the public by conducting press conferences of this nature.
Meanwhile, explaining the process followed when food samples are to be tested for any reason, Dr. Janaki Widanapathirana said, Only the public health inspector and the public health officer have been given the authorization to investigate such complaints, through the Food Act. When a problem occurs, the public health inspector goes to the relevant place and gets a sample of the food item. If the food is a dry food, three samples will be taken. One sample will be given to the owner of the restaurant. The public health inspector would take one and the third will be sent to the Government Analyst for investigation. However, the sample would be investigated by the Government Analyst only under two circumstances: if the sample is a biological sample or if the chemicals of the sample could not be tested by the public health inspector. These samples would be sent either to the Medical Research Institute or to the National Institute of Science. The police do not hold any power or authority in these investigations.
These specialists also noted that women today are more career-minded and as a result, they delay marriage until they reach their late 30s. Towards the close of the third decade in life, it is considered safe for a woman to take on the added responsibilities of marriage and family, without having to pay the price her grandmother did for domestic security. But there is a price to be paid for postponing commitment, too. This also sometimes leads to women passing their ideal child-bearing age, making it difficult to conceive, in some instances.
Hence, they said, there are many factors that lead to sub-fertility or infertility in our society today, and introduction of some pill is definitely not one of those factors.
The media briefing on this issue was attended by Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake, Consultant Endocrinologist Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne, Professor in Pharmacology Prof. Chandani Wanigatunga, Consultant Physician Dr. Anula Wijesundara, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake, Consultant Rheumatologist Dr. Lalith Wijayaratne, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. U.D.P. Ratnasiri, Specialist in Forensic Medicine Prof. Ravindra Fernando, Consultant Physician Dr. Panduka Karunanayake, Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Lakkumar Fernando, Professor in Pharmacology Prof. Shalini Sri Ranganathan, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne and Consultant Physician Dr. Priyankara Jayawardena. Around 132 medical specialists, administrators and medical officers have also signed the statement issued on the infertility pill issue representing the Medical Council and the College of Physicians.

Minister assures welfare of family
Urgent steps will be taken to obtain all compensation payments for the family of the Sri Lankan housemaid employed in Saudi Arabia reportedly shot dead on March 12 by a mentally retarded person in the house where the housemaid was working, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
Minister Fernando gave the assurance when he visited the late housemaid, Priyantha Jayasekara's family at their residence at Katamburawa, Wanduramba, Galle on March 17.
The Minister handed over Rs. 150,000 to the housemaid's family as an initial payment.
The Minister said the first duty of his ministry was to get down the housemaid's body to Sri Lanka and to obtain compensation payment to her family.
Apart from this, the Ministry would do its utmost to cater to the future welfare of the housemaid's children, he said.
He said the Ministry's final objective would be to prevent Sri Lankan women going for foreign employments as housemaids and promote the sending of trained workers for employments abroad instead.
Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said that while regretting this unfortunate incident, the Ministry would do its best to cater to the future welfare of the bereaved family.

Moving the mountain
The climb matters. And that needs much preparation. Frequently known as Pey Veema, the preparation is a dying tradition probably owing to its easier-said-than-done nature.
The ascent is tough. Yet the climbers are advised against expressing any concern verbally. Most climbers choose Sripada for the purpose of pilgrimage while a minority would opt for a joyride. Sripada, however, is more known as the pilgrims destination. In days of yore, the choice of Sripada was a complicated job. The pilgrims would oftentimes bequeath their properties and relieve themselves of any other worldly ownership before making the journey to the Sripada which used to be arduous.
Even in this day and age of untroubled transportation, the passage to the Sripada peak remains rocky. However classy your vehicle may be, your drive ends at the bottom of the mount. And the rest has to be made on foot. The trek begins around 9 am and reaches culmination around 6 am at the sunrise. It is not the physical robustness that matters. Aged and fragile pilgrims are a common sight as you ascend the sacred mountain.
Stretched between January and March Full Moon Poya days, the Sripada season is now at an end. The climb during the offseason is beyond imagination with the path absorbed in the nightfall darkness and the jungle creatures roaming hither and thither.
Yet certain travellers pick the off-season to climb the Sripada. If you want a real pilgrims experience, you should make it during the season. The season exposes you to numerous hardships of the pilgrimage. The nighttime climb often introduces you to a packed queue at the sunrise. The peak gets crowded with the pilgrims paying homage to the Buddhas sacred footprint, God Saman and the sun. The climb tests your spiritual strength more than physical power.
The climb itself is the epitome of discipline. Compare it with a Buddhist monks striving to attain Nibbana through discipline  to a moderate extent. If that Biblical phrase - Faith can move the mountain - needs a connotation, the Sripada climb could stand out as a well-heeled example. Armed with faith, the aged pilgrims walk for hours until they reach the peak. Destination is never a worry during the climb. The journey itself is the destination. Blessed by faith, the elderly pilgrims share spiritual stories with the youths. Before initiating the journey, the first-timers will get a handful of advice on maintaining the verbal discipline.
The Sripada journey abounds with hagiographical narratives. Believed to be the abode of God Saman, many pilgrims claim to have seen human-like figures donned in white robes roaming the terrains where humans dare to tread. If you suddenly happen to lose your way, such a figure will appear from nowhere and show you the way. It will take some time for you to wonder who that figure could have been. But then that figure is long gone.
That said, the ascent should be performed ultra carefully. Well, you could lose your way for one. Pilgrims always climb in crowds and seldom solo. As you need warm clothes to keep from wind chill, you will need warm food to keep up the physical vigour. Plus you need warm stories enriched with spirituality to keep from boredom and the urge to mouth some malicious talk. The endless steps will shake your knees however strong they are. A hat will be a good idea to keep the sunshine, but with strings attached to it as the winds are strong. The Ayurvedic oil massages are available free of charge during the sojourn.
Commonly termed as Ira Sevaya  loosely translated into English as homage to the sun  it is an age-old tradition linked with Sri Pada. Of course, it is a unique experience when you get to experience the slow rise of the sun at 4888 feet above sea level. That figure, 4888 feet, is no cakewalk. Climbing to the peak of Sripada means you take 5000 steps for about five hours. The duration depends basically on your climbing speed.
Technology is given such prominence, yet surprisingly the path that leads to Sripada has not made much progress. Is it simply in a bid to retain the age-old charm of the tough journey or because no one in the authorities wants to develop it With ubiquitous steep steps, Sripada path looks quite the old world.
Sripada journey, though infrastructure has improved quite a lot now, is still arduous and the baggage makes the journey heavier. However, it is not so for the pilgrims. Even if they feel honest, they would not dare say that. They fear the wrath of deities and consider it as a verbal misgiving if any such thing comes out of your mouth.
Whatever said and done, the night trek is the most enduring as well as the enjoyable journey. Especially in season, you wouldnt be alone. Backtrekkers would keep the climbers spirits lifted by hosannas.

Muslims will leave no room for extremists: Faiszer Musthapha
Muslims in Sri Lanka will not leave room for operation of extremist organisations as our Muslims have always been living in unity and harmony with the Sinhalese and other communities although such organisations infiltrate various countries to spawn terrorism by distorting the minds of Muslim inhabitants, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister. Faiszer Musthapha said.
He called on the Most. Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy yesterday and received his blessings.
Musthapha said that even though some people subscribing to excrement views were found among Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils, Muslims as a whole had never clamoured for a separate state or region in Sri Lanka. Minister Mustapha said those behind the Kandy incident were trying to create enmity between Sinhala and Muslim Communities.
A major dialogue among a collective or religious dignitaries, politicians and civil altruists should take place to erase certain misconceptions among the people, he said.
Minister Musthapha said the Kandy Meeramakkam Mosque was on a land belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
He said it symbolised the unity and harmony existing among the Sinhala Buddhists and Muslims in the country from ancient times.
"The Kandy incidents had blotted the long-standing unity and harmony among Sinhalese and Muslims to a small extent.
Since Facebook was used to instigate hate between the two communities, the government had to block social media websites for a limited period," the Minister said.
The Malwatte prelate in his anusasana said segregation of schools as Sinhala and Muslim schools led to problems as in Kandy.
The Thera said that ifcombined schools were crated for Sinhala, Muslim and other children, it would help forge communal unity.
The Nayaka Thera said Muslim traders in Ridigama belied their identity as they spoke Sinhala fluently in conducting business. The Prelate emphasised that he never condoned clashes of this nature and added that the Kandy incident was the climax of an issue burning for sometime.
The Thera said religious freedom should be ensured to all communities in the country.

Nip this in the bud
A disturbing trend is being witnessed these days where schoolchildren stage demonstrations inside school premises for the retention of school Principals who have been transferred or, in other instances, demanding their transfers from the schools concerned. What is more, the students engaged in such demonstrations comprise, both, the seniors, and, the brats from the lower forms, who may be hardly aware what it is all about. More often than not, these agitations take a violent form, with even the police called in to control the situation. Teachers too join in the protests, conduct quite unbecoming of our pedagogues, whose chief task lay in moulding the character of their charges and not leading them on the wrong path.
The latest to fall prey to this phenomenon is a school in Bandarawela where students, teachers and parents were seen holding placards and protesting against the transfer of the Principal of the school, inside and outside the school premises. Not only that, the rioters also virtually held the incoming Principal hostage, in the Principal's office, with the Police eventually summoned to rescue that worthy. The scene resembled a battlefield, with even stones being hurled at the school building, and, damage caused to school property.
The Principal was being transferred in terms of an Education Ministry regulation that says that a school Principal of a government school can serve in the same school only for a period of 10 years. Thereafter it is mandatory that he/she be transferred to another school. The parents and teachers who are involved in these demonstrations cannot be unaware of this rule, and, by encouraging their offspring and charges to take to the streets against a government regulation they will only be creating another generation, who, instead of being law abiding citizens, would one day have no regard or respect for the law, in their adulthood. Besides, this also could have long term repercussions, what with the students being encouraged to take the law into their hands with impunity, at such a tender age.
It is not clear if the demonstration in the school in Bandarawela had the outgoing Principal's blessings. But this state of affairs, if allowed to continue, would result in some Principals themselves organising these protests to remain in the school for one reason or another.
Schools are institutions of learning, where demonstrations of this kind have no place. It is a place which serves not only as a repository of learning but where character is built and the younger generation prepared to take over the role of responsible citizens of society, in their adult life. Such acts are also tantamount to permitting young children to defy authority. What was witnessed in the school in Bandarawela was rank hooliganism, the type of which, if allowed to go unchecked would be habit forming and spread to other schools as well. Hence, the authorities should not hesitate to stamp out such unbecoming conduct in our seats of learning, lest the student population is misguided, and led on the wrong path, which does not augur well for the country's future.
The country had already witnessed the rowdy scenes of the university students over the SAITM issue where even a government building was lain siege by the agitators. Now we have a nascent militancy developing in the schools which is bound to snowball someday where protests and acts of sabotage would become the norm. Therefore it is incumbent on the authorities to nip this development in the bud, lest the schools be turned into hotbeds of militancy that could be exploited even by unscrupulous politicians to their advantage.
It would be ideal if all Principals of government schools get together and go public about the true situation as regard the Education Ministry regulations and put matters to rest. School Principals, like all government servants, have to abide by the laid down policies. They, more than others, are bound to act as shining examples, given the dignity attached to their profession.
This is not to say that school Principals are not without their grievances. While there are a few bad eggs, even among school Principals, as has been exposed frequently in the media, there are also others who perform their job under trying circumstances with little reward. Some school Principals serving in rural schools find it difficult to even find proper accommodation. They find it difficult to even get their children admitted to popular schools, while government doctors have received this privilege, after agitation.
It is time that the Education Ministry pay more attention to the plight of school Principals serving in the schools in remote areas and take steps to improve their lot. Steps should also be taken to redress their salary anomalies and elevate them to levels that befit their station. School Principals, on their part, should not allow situations, as that witnessed in the school in Bandarawela, to get out of hand, and, teachers who lead students in agitations should be punished. They should always strive to uphold the dignity of their profession.

Nyras to brief PMs ministerial committee on SriLankan Airlines restructuring
A presentation on the restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines will be delivered to the ministerial committee looking into restructuring Sri Lankan Airlines on Wednesday (21), a reliable source said.
The ministerial committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will receive a progress evaluation on the first phase of the restructuring plan for the national carrier at this presentation. It will be conducted by Nyras, the international aviation consultant tasked to come up with recommendations to turn the tide for the flag carrier.
The restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines is presently going through the first phase of the plan which mainly focuses on the internal restructuring such as route rationalization, purchase renegotiation and cost deduction, the source explained. The main task in reviving Sri Lankan Airlines is to find a strategic partner. However, we cannot attract a good investor if we do not resolve the internal issues in the airline. The first phase of the restructuring focuses on these internal adjustments. the source said.
Speaking further on a strategic partner for the national carrier, the source said the reason as to why an international partner seems more desirable would be because such a partnership will allow Sri Lankan Airlines more space to regain its former performances.
Recognised international partners get low fuel prices, they offer low fares, they have more aircraft which could be shared, and their ratings are higher. These plus points make international partners practically more sought-after. it was pointed out.
Meanwhile, the head of the Official Committee appointed to look into the restructuring of Sri Lankan Airlines, Finance Ministry Secretary, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said the restructuring of the carrier is still at its preliminary stage.
He pointed out these initial adjustments to the airline follows the recommendations forwarded by Nyras, as a multi-action plan focusing on six main segments that should be restructured.
SriLankan Airlines which was a profit making establishment began to accumulate losses when the previous regime changed its management from Emirates.
The management agreement between Emirates and SriLankan Airlines ended in 2008 in a backdrop where the then Rajapaksa regime cancelled the visa of then emirates Chief Executive Peter Hill over a disagreement. Emirates exited the airline selling their 40 percent shares to the government.
The accumulated profits during Emirates-managed SriLankan Airlines was around 4.4 billion. The loss incurred in the seven years, from 2008 to the end of 2014, under the local management appointed by the previous regime was around Rs. 107 billion.
By 2015 national carriers accumulated losses stood at Rs.128 billion with a debt of Rs.76 billion and balance sheet discrepancies of Rs.74 billion.
The staff members of 5,113 in 2008, was also increased to 6,987 by 2015 which increased the operations cost of the airline.
The losses escalated as the previous regime decided to buy A330 and A350 aircraft.
The previous government signed an agreement worth of Rs.143 billion, leasing fifteen aircraft for the SriLankan Airlines, without a cost benefit analysis.The agreement was on seven A330 narrow bodied aircraft and eight A350 wide bodied aircrafts.

One clever remark by a nine-year-old girl was all it took to shut down a school bully.
In a post on Mumsnet, a woman shared her adopted daughters ordeal in school and how she defended herself.
A horrible and nasty fellow schoolmate was targeting her little girl for being quirky.
She described her daughter as a kind and empathetic human. The woman also expressed her sadness for what her child has to endure.
In the post she said: I told her what I thought might be a good way to quieten the bullies and today my 9 year old loudly replied to one Im sorry, did you MEAN to be so rude!
Her response had the other children bursting with laughter and the bully walked away. Her witty comeback had people on the popular parent networking site cheering her on.

Salah fires Liverpool third, Palace escape bottom three
LONDON, Saturday - Four-goal Mohamed Salah set a Liverpool record as they moved to third in the Premier League by thrashing Watford on Saturday, while at the other end of the table Crystal Palaces win edged them out of the relegation zone.
The spotlight was on the basement battle in a slimline Premier League programme, owing to the FA Cup quarter-finals, but the superb Salah took centre stage with a magnificent display in Liverpools 5-0 romp in the later kickoff.
He had begun the day level on 24 goals with Tottenham Hotspurs Harry Kane in the race for the Premier League Golden Boot but ended it four clear.
And his 36 goals in all competitions is a new record for a Liverpool player in a debut season  eclipsing the 33 scored by Fernando Torres in 2007-08.
I have to thank everyone but mainly my team mates  without them I couldnt reach this number, Salah, who managed only two goals in a disappointing spell with Chelsea, said. The Egyptian needed only four minutes to give Liverpool the lead, proving too fleet-footed for Watfords defence, to fire past Watford keeper Orestis Karnezis.
He tapped in Andy Robertsons cross shortly before halftime and soon after the interval he picked out Roberto Firmino who finished with a cheeky back-flick.
Salah completed his first Liverpool hat-trick in the 77th minute, wriggling this way and that before prodding a shot past Karnezis, and he was not finished as he slammed home from close range in the 85th minute to become the first Liverpool player since Luis Suarez in 2013 to score four goals in a league game.
A seven-match run without a win had dropped Palace back into the bottom three but they climbed out of it with an impressive 2-0 victory at Huddersfield Town, who are still in trouble. James Tomkins put Palace ahead in the 23rd minute and skipper Luka Milivojevics 68th-minute penalty secured the win on a snowy day across the country. Palace rose to 16th with 30 points from 31 games, ahead of Southampton (28) and West Ham United (30), neither of whom played and both of whom now have a game in hand.
To get a victory today in those conditions was very, very good. The lads put in a great shift today, Tomkins said. It will go to the wire but that was a massive win for us.
Bottom club West Bromwich appear doomed after they lost 2-1 at home to Bournemouth, having led through Jay Rodriguezs 49th-minute opener. Jordon Ibe and Junior Stanislas earned Bournemouth the points as they took a huge stride towards securing a fourth successive top-flight season.
They edged up to 11th in the table, eight points above Southampton, who now occupy the last relegation spot. West Brom are 10 points from the safety zone, having lost seven matches in a row. Without it being our last chance, its nearing the last-chance saloon, manager Alan Pardew said.

Serve up restaurant-quality meals at home
Restaurant kitchens run like well-oiled machines. The equipment is heavy-duty, the tools are the perfect ones for the job, and the cooks know every recipe like the back of their hand!
But it is not just about the skills and the tools, its also about the ingredients used that can really elevate and transform a dish.
When dining in restaurants, coffee-shops, hotels, cafes and bakeries, we savour various flavours and tastes which are carefully blended together to give us a perfect experience of the food, making us want more.
Anchor as a brand has long been highly-regarded in Sri Lanka. For many years it has stood for uncompromised premium quality dairy products that meet both personal and professional needs.
Fonterras very own Chef Jamie Aserappa, who works with leading international hotel chains, bakeries and cafes on customizing dairy solutions, demonstrates how complex restaurant-type dishes can be made at the comfort of your home using the same high quality dairy ingredients.
For example, a simple pasta dish can be elevated with a delicious cheese sauce made using Anchor Butter, Cooking Cream and the latest introduction to Sri Lankan home cooks, world-renowned cooking cheese brand Perfect Italianos Grated Parmesan Cheese.
Gnocchi  a complex Italian dish can be made just as light and fluffy asin a restaurant using a mix of Anchor Butter, Cooking Cream and Cheeses.
And for dessert, use Anchor Whipping Cream, Butter and UHT milk to make indulgent treatssuch as a rich and creamy Crme Brulee or get creative with the Strawberry Mookie - an innovative treat for loved ones.

Sri Lanka launches dedicated student  and youth online platform
The International Student Identity Card (ISIC) - a UNESCO endorsed lifestyle and photo identity card for students and youth launched its new online platform www.isic.lk the first ever for the local market, dedicated to benefits and discounts for students and youth.
The main objective of creating this site is to offer students and youth real and tangible discounts on air travel, accommodation and other products and services that enrich a students lifestyle. Additionally, we have book now and pay later options that further provide financial flexibility enabling students to explore some of these options that they may not have considered before, said Thisum Jayasuriya, Group CEO for United Ventures.
The card has been successful in providing value to students and youth in countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Europe and Latin America to name a few.
The ISIC is the only internationally recognized proof of full-time student status issued in close to 130 countries. The card allows students to prove their student status worldwide, as well as gain access to over 150,000 discounts and benefits.
The concept and benefits of the ISIC card is yet to gain traction in the locally in the active and vibrant student population exceeding 1.5 million, as per the Census and Statistics of 2016. This is due to the lack of awareness of the benefits.
ISIC currently maintains benefits and discounts with approximately 50 partners and is constantly working to improve and add value to the student lifestyle.
With the right partnerships, valuable benefits can be provided to this entire student and youth segment. The benefits and discounts provided are both local and international which no other card is able to offer currently. Besides we are providing them access to a global student community.
The ISIC card is owned by the ISIC Association, which is a Member Association of the World Youth, Student and Education (WYSE) Travel Confederation, a not-for-profit organization based in Amsterdam. Each country therefore has got to develop the benefits using its own initiative with the support of stakeholders who see value in the product.
Beneficial for students studying at home or traveling overseas, the discounts and benefits are extensive and range from air travel and transportation, museums and cultural sites, restaurants and cafes, theaters, hotels and hostels, online discounts, educational software, e-learning platforms and many other areas.
The biggest and most attractive discounts are the ones that are offered on travel. Through their partner STA Travel in Sri Lanka, ISIC is able to offer students discounted air travel on one-way and return tickets to London, Europe, Australia, USA and Russia, on major airlines.
United Ventures (PVT) Ltd is the sole representatives of ISIC in Sri Lanka. Visit www.unitedventuressl.com
The card is available to full time students at school, college or university, aged 12 years and above. There is no upper age limit. Youth who are not currently studying and fall under the age of 30 are eligible for the International Youth Travel Card (IYTC).

Sugar not so sweet
Once confined to the affluent class of the country, Diabetes has now become one of the four major non communicable diseases. Much awareness has been raised on the subject with restrictions imposed on the commercial consumption of sugar, a key catalyst behind diabetes. On the contrary to its past records, diabetes is now found to affect the low and middle-income countries in a major scale. Worse still, diabetes has become a decisive factor of human life as well. Daily News Health Watch meets Endocrinologist and Diabetologist Dr Noel Somasundaram to explore every possible remedy.
Q: What are the main health concerns of patients of Type 2 Diabetes for over 20 or more years
A: The complications of Type 2 Diabetes are the key worry for the patients. The Type 2 Diabetes is sadly a progressive disease and a multisystem disease. The longer it exists the more the complications arise. The Type 2 Diabetes results from multiple problems; the key issues are insulin resistance within the body and insulin deficiency. These result in inflammation as well as the rise of glucose that results in direct and indirect tissue damage due to deposition of altered glucose in the cells and blood vessels around the body.
In addition, there is abnormal lipid processing within the body that leads to accelerated deposition of cholesterol in arteries leading to atherosclerosis that is more aggressive than in individuals without diabetes. This process results in a much higher risk of heart attacks, strokes and peripheral vessel disease - lack of blood supply to key organs like the legs. In addition, inflammation and glucose deposition in the minute capillaries that supply organs like nerves, brain, kidneys, and the retina of the eye may result in neuropathy, dementia, kidney failure, and blindness. In addition, ongoing long-term inflammation is a concern.
The long-term inflammation in diabetes leads to multiple problems like cancers. Certain cancers like breast, colon and prostate cancers increase among the diabetics. In fact, almost all organs could be affected. The skin can be affected resulting in easy wounding in the legs. The liver can be affected resulting in cirrhosis. The hands and feet can become stiff due to damage to internal tendons, bones and muscles. The risk of fracture is higher in long-term diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy combined with poor blood supply leads to poor wound healing that result in amputations.
For blindness in adults, kidney failure, amputations of legs, heart attack and brain attacks (strokes) Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause. For those with longstanding diabetes, these as well as other organ problems are a reality. Type 2 diabetes is never a mild disease and we need to realize this and take good care of ourselves to lead as near normal life as possible. Leading a near-normal life is possible with current management strategies we employ in diabetes. These are well researched and can be done by anyone.
In Sri Lanka, most people rely on fasting blood glucose to check whether their diabetes is under control. This is wrong! The fasting blood glucose test looks at what happened at that moment only. This is inadequate to judge diabetes control as it is only a momentary test and does not reflect what happened at other times throughout life! The best ways to get a good idea of the diabetes control is the HBA1C test that can be done every three months to check whether there is a good control for three months. HBA1C reflects the amount of glucose that is deposited in the cells as it measures this process directly by checking the percentage of haemoglobin that has been altered by glucose. HBA1C is also a good marker of future complications as it reflects the degree of tissue damage that has occurred.
A good target is 7 percent but if possible, a lower value should be aimed at- particularly the young and those newly diagnosed to have diabetes can lead a normal life by getting a value less than 6.5 percent or even lower. Additionally, self-monitoring of blood glucose using a glucometer at multiple times of the day to make sure that not just in the fasting state but throughout the day and in all circumstances the glucose remains under control will give plenty of information on how to keep the glucose despite changes in life; A value below 140mg/dl after meals being a good target for most.
It is necessary to prevent the development of complications with a statin (e.g. Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin). Currently, the recommendations are that statin should be taken to prevent in those with diabetes who are older than 40 years of age even if the lipid profile is normal. In those under 40 years of age, the statin is started if the LDL cholesterol is more than 130mg/dl. It is important to remember that statins are taken. Statins are anti-inflammatory i.e. they reduce inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaques and reduces rupture of plaques and development of angina or heart attack. When using a statin the lipid levels are often very low and this is good. The above three are called ABC of diabetes; control of A1C, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol. This multifactorial control is the state of the art and current standard practice across the world. This triple approach leads to a reduction of most complications of diabetes and in those who have complications already results in reduction or arrest of worsening of those complications. As is well known, prevention is the best remedy. Most of the dreaded complications of diabetes can be prevented before they occur or at worst arrested in early stage even after they develop.
Q: What are the medical tests patients should do to be on the safe track
A: It is recommended that those with diabetes check their glucose themselves multiple times a day and blood pressure be measured at least monthly. HBA1C test should be done every three months.
A lipid profile is done at the onset to decide dose of statins and thereafter occasionally to make sure that the lipids remain low. Annually the following should be done. Feet examination, eye examination, kidney tests. Heart checks have to be done when there are symptoms or suspicion of heart issues. Similarly based on complications other tests may be required.
Key strategies
1. Good glycemic control
Diabetes is higher in those who do not control the disease well. On the contrary, those who control diabetes well can expect to reduce the complications of diabetes.
2. Blood pressure control
Blood pressure rises in diabetics. High blood pressure develops before the development of diabetes mellitus. Increased blood pressure multiplies the risk of developing serious complications like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and blindness due to retinopathy.
3. Lipid control
Even if the cholesterol and lipid profile are normal the risk of atherosclerosis leading to heart attack and stroke are high in those with diabetes. This happens because the lipids in the blood are abnormal forms in the presence of diabetes mellitus. These are more atherogenic and have a higher tendency to cause heart problems and others.
4. Lose weight if one is overweight or obese
Weight loss has multiple benefits. Insulin resistance and resulting inflammation improve when weight is lost and tissue injury that results from inflammation can be reduced. Weight loss also results in improvement of glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels as well as reduce the underlying problems in diabetes such as inflammation, the tendency for blood to clot easily resulting in heart attack (pro-coagulation state). Weight loss in early diabetes can even cure diabetes. Weight loss also improves quality of life and should be attempted as early as possible.

Tips on healthy eating
The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are. It is recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules). Most adults are eating more calories than they need.Base your meals on starchy carbohydrates
Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over one third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals. Choose wholegrain varieties (or eat potatoes with their skins on) when you can: they contain more fibre, and can help you feel full for longer.
Keep an eye on the fats you add when youre cooking or serving these types of foods because thats what increases the calorie content, for example oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.
Eat lots of fruit and veg
Its recommended that we eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. Its easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit
Eat more fish
Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals. Aim to eat at least two portions of fish a week, including at least one portion of oily fish. Oily fish contains omega-3 fats, which may help to prevent heart disease. Oily fish include: salmon, mackerel, trout, herring, fresh tuna, sardines and pilchards.
Cut down on saturated fat and sugar
Saturated fat in our diet
We all need some fat in our diet, but its important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat were eating. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease. Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as: hard cheese, cakes, biscuits, sausages, cream, butter, lard and pies.
Sugar in our diet
Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay. Sugary foods and drinks, including alcoholic drinks, are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if eaten too often, can contribute to weight gain.
They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.
Eat less salt  no more than 6g a day for adults
Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Even if you dont add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much. About three-quarters of the salt we eat, is already in the food we buy, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces.
Get active and be a healthy weight
Eating a healthy, balanced diet plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy weight, which is an important part of overall good health. Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease and strokes. Being underweight could also affect your health.
Dont get thirsty
We need to drink plenty of fluids to stop us getting dehydrated ( 6-8 glasses per day). This is in addition to the fluid we get from the food we eat. All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water and lower-fat milk are healthier choices. Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks that are high in added sugars and calories, and are also bad for teeth.
Dont skip breakfast
Some people skip breakfast because they think it will help them lose weight. In fact, research shows that people who regularly eat breakfast are less likely to be overweight. Breakfast has also been shown to have positive effects on childrens mental performance and increase their concentration throughout the morning.

Wales hang on to edge out France and seal second spot
CARDIFF, Saturday - Wales dug deep to edge out a resurgent France side 14-13 in the final game of the Six Nations at the Principality stadium on Saturday to finish second in the standings.
The Welsh prevailed thanks to a try by Liam Williams and three penalties by Leigh Halfpenny to end the championship behind Ireland who sealed the grand slam by beating England 24-15 at Twickenham.
France, who have been showing signs of improvement since they beat England last Saturday, scored a try through Gael Fickou with Francois Trinh-Duc kicking a drop goal and Maxime Machenaud slotting home a conversion and a penalty.
Les Bleus had the upper hand, notably in the second half, but finished the tournament in fourth place in new coach Jacques Brunels first campaign in charge.
It was definitely an ugly win. Sometimes you will take an ugly victory over the performance. We turned up today and it was all about winning, Wales coach Warren Gatland said.
The performance was not the most important thing. We started off well but there were too many turnovers and mistakes, he added.
That is not a bad French team and they are going to get better. It is a tough competition to win or finish second and we are pleased with where we are at the moment. The visitors started well and Trinh-Duc put them ahead with a fine drop goal.
But they made a mistake on Waless short kickoff, letting the ball bounce to allow the home side to grab possession.
Scott Williams kicked the ball through, Trinh-Duc could not control it and Liam Williams dived over to put his team in front.
Halfpenny missed the conversion but added three points with a penalty.
France were penalised again  the third time in the opening 15 minutes  and Halfpenny extended the lead to eight points.
The visitors hit back when Fickou, who started a nice collective move, ended it with a try after Machenaud, who converted, and Trinh-Duc played quickly to send him over.
Les Bleus, however, suffered a setback when flanker Yacouba Camara, one of their best players in the championship, was replaced by Mathieu Babillot after hurting his left knee.
Another Halfpenny penalty put Wales four points ahead as the home side benefited from Frances lack of discipline.
Brunels side dominated and were rewarded with a penalty converted by Machenaud early in the second half.
They enjoyed possession but Wales defended ferociously and Trinh-Duc, who took over the kicking duties after Machenaud was replaced, missed a routine penalty as the visitors failed to score when they had the chance.

Wallapatta worth Rs 1.4 mn seized at BIA
The Sri Lanka Customs apprehended a man carrying 25.4 kg of wallapatta estimated at Rs 1.4 million, at the Bandaranaike International Airport on March 16.
The suspect, a 45-year-old resident of Pannala, was apprehended at Departures while trying to smuggle the item to Dubai. Customs seized the goods and fined the suspect Rs.100,000.
Wallapatta or Sri Lankan agar is an indigenous herb that is used to produce some of the finest incense and perfumes in the world. Since the plant is unique to the country, trade without authorization is strictly prohibited.
In some foreign countries, the Sri Lankan wallapatta fetches a higher price than sandalwood. In the recent past, both the police and Customs have prevented several attempts to smuggle large quantities of wallapatta out of the country.

When speech is not speech
Hate speech relies on tensions, which it seeks to reproduce and amplify. Hate speech online was a virus circulating with no prescription medicine in this country for awhile. The folly of which was realized of late with the temporary shutting down of most channels of social media communication. Banning virtual reality is unrealistic since a full ban is practically impossible given alternate forms of communication available simultaneously online waiting only to be downloaded.
What is hate speech
Hate speech lies in a complex nexus with freedom of expression, individual, group and minority rights, as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. Its definition is often contested.
In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm (particularly, discrimination, hostility or violence) based upon the targets being identified with a certain social or demographic group. It may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. For some, however, the concept extends also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted discrimination, hostility and violent attacks.
The hate speech debate
A right to express ones mind is an essential human right on the basis of Free Speech, which we all cherish and value. However, there has been a seemingly blurred line between the word used to initiate discussion and the ones used to incite hatred. What distinguishes hate speech online Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute has noted, The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can infliction the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesnt stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates.
Facebook sits at the intersection between private and public spheres, where individuals create private online spaces, through which they interact with others online. Even so, a post shared among friends may travel far, reaching unexpected audiences and provoking unintended consequences. Twitter is designed as a public space offering greater opportunities for a tweet to be re-broadcast to large audiences and for strangers to respond and engage in public debates. Platforms like Snapchat, in contrast, by deleting conversations among users after they have occurred, offer a greater likelihood that the words will remain within smaller circles.
Responses to hate speech online
Legal and non-legal measures- Although hate speech is an offensive and low expression of dissent, it can also be thought of as a window into deeply-rooted tensions and inequalities, which themselves do need addressing beyond pure speech issues, and beyond the online dimension. Citizenship education and digital citizenship- Citizenship education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict.
Educational goals of media and information literacy to respond to hate speech - the first educational goal is conveying information on hate speech, the second on the critical analysis of the phenomenon and a third encourages individuals to take specifications. Initiatives falling under the scope of information as an educational goal include raising awareness about hate speech online, its different forms and possible consequences. The second educational goal is more complex and focuses on the analysis of hate speech online. This analysis includes assessments and evaluations of the different types of hate speech online, including racism, sexism, and homophobia, and of the multiple forms in which it is presented. An important aspect of the analysis is the critical examination of hate speech in order to identify its common causes and understand its underlying assumptions and prejudices. This analytical process enables individuals to report and expose hateful content online. A third educational goal focuses on fostering actions that can be taken to combat and counter hate speech acts.
Internet intermediaries, on their part, have an interest in maintaining a relative independence and a clean image. They have sought to reach this goal by demonstrating their responsiveness to pressures from civil society groups, individuals and governments. The way in which these negotiations have occurred, however, has been so far been ad hoc, and they have not led to the development of collective over-arching principles. Defining hate speech online will probably continue to escape a universally observed consensus for a long time, but a range of engagements with it can nevertheless be developed on a multi-stakeholder basis.
It is clear that no single actor can solve the problem of online hate speech, irrespective of how the phenomenon is defined. Ongoing participative processes of comprehension of the nature of online hate speech are as important as the evolving responses. A more fine-grained understanding how each platform can enable or constrain the production and dissemination of different type of messages may thus be a very important factor in developing appropriate responses.
Nevertheless that when addressing hate speech online, different perspectives should be taken into consideration and weighed against one another, both for their ability to explain this phenomenon and its complex link to actual violence, and to offer answers that are not at the expense of a holistic approach.
