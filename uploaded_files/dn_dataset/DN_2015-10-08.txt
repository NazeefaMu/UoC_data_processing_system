Bangladesh says Zimbabwe to tour in November
Bangladesh announced Wednesday it would host Zimbabwe for a two-Test cricket series in November after Australia postponed a planned visit this month due to security concerns.
Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hasan said Zimbabwe had agreed to tour that month although no date had been finalised. "Zimbabwe have principally agreed to tour Bangladesh in November. We will finalise the date with Zimbabwe officials during next week's ICC (International Cricket Council) meeting in Dubai," Nazmul told reporters.
Zimbabwe were originally scheduled to visit Bangladesh from next January 11-February 7 for two Tests, three one-day Internationals and three Twenty20 internationals.
But the BCB president said the series would now be spilt in two parts. Zimbabwe would play the Tests in November and return in January for the ODIs and T20s. Nazmul said following a meeting of the BCB board of directors that Bangladesh would also bid for the Asia Cup Twenty20 tournament, which could be held in February next year just ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 in India.
The BCB is under pressure to bring back international cricket to the country. South Africa's women's cricket team also postponed a planned tour later this month, citing security concerns. AFP

The project envisages constructing 60 basic facility houses for residents of Naachikalliya who are currently living in makeshift cajan huts under trying circumstances.

Construction of hospital to treat CKD patients
Chinese team begins feasibility studies
Chinas Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenminmeets President Maithripala Sirisena
A team sent by the Chinese government has commenced feasibility studies in Sri Lanka for the construction of what would be a fully facilitated hospital for the treatment of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
Calling on President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, China's Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said the team sent by China is currently conducting a feasible analysis on the construction of the hospital.
China agreed to provide grant assistance to Sri Lanka to build a hospital to cater to kidney patients at the request of President Sirisena when he met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in March 2015.
The victims of the fast spreading CKD in the country are mostly farm workers or agriculture workers in the North Central and Uva provinces. The disease has spread to the Northwestern, Eastern, Southern and Central provinces, and some parts of the Northern province.
The victims are mostly men. Women and children becoming victims are also on the increase.
According to the World Health Organisation, more than 15 percent of the population aged between 15 and 70 in the North Central and Uva provinces are adversely affected by CKD.
Over 1,100 CKD patients are admitted to hospitals every month. Around 300 deaths are recorded every year on account of the disease.
Extensive use of agro-chemicals with high level of toxicity is said to to be the main cause behind the situation.

Coalition aircraft re-routed to avoid Russians in Syria
US: Coalition aircraft have been re-routed on at least one occasion to avoid a close encounter with Russian warplanes over Syria, a Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday.
"We have an instance, at least, where there's been action taken to make sure we didn't have an unsafe separation" distance, Navy Captain Jeff Davis said.
The incident involved two F-16 fighter jets that were forced to abort a bombing sortie over Syria in order to remain within safe distance of the Russian planes, according to a US defense official
"They had to abort striking the target," said the official.
Davis said coalition air operations over Iraq and Syria continue and the effort to avoid Russian warplanes was not interfering with their broader mission.
But he said, "We have taken measures to re-route aircraft as necessary when there is an air issue where we might be getting close."
Earlier, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter denied that the United States had proposed to Moscow coordinating their air strikes.
"What we will do is continue basic, technical discussions on the professional safety procedures for our pilots flying above Syria," Carter told reporters in Rome.
"That's it. We will keep the channel open because it's a matter of safety for our pilots."
US and Russian officials held discussions last week -- at Russia's request -- on establishing measures to avoid accidents so warplanes flying over Syria would not be in the same place at the same time.
For want of such a mechanism, the US defense official said the coalition has put in place "its own set of air safety rules."
The F-16 pilots, who had taken off from Incirlik air base in Turkey, took the decision to abort based on those rules.
The so-called "deconfliction" talks came after Russia started bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, further complicating the four-and-a-half-year conflict.
But despite Russian violations of Turkish air space at the weekend, Moscow has not participated in further talks -- frustrating US military officials who had made repeated overtures. - AFP

COLOURFUL THINGS at Barefoot at Barefoot
4 pm - not the best time of the day to see customers jostling around to grab the best deal. Too tired sales staff after hours of work, too many walking on pavements here and there, Traffic and thats the time office ends for most of the workers. Its a time to hang out with friends. For some its the time to do a bit of shopping. Get the groceries and other items they may need for home. But for Jane and the others, rise in sales and customers was beaming. The weekend has been a good one. I bet.
A holiday in Colombo wont generally be complete unless it accompanies some vibrant textiles from Barefoot. Colombos holiday makers flock in to the Barefoot Gallery on Galle Road. And while this store remains popular, there are two other stores to make shopping easier for people -one in Galle and the other at the Dutch Hospital shopping complex.
The Dutch Hospital Barefoot is small compared to the Galle Road store. But still you would find enough of textile in brilliant eye popping colour, surfacing all linen, toys, notebooks, bags, pencil cases and cushion covers. They have a few new things in the line now such as Tea and Spices. Their products are cultural, artistic, vibrant and of quality.
Barbara Sansoni, Founder of Barefoot was creative and had an intense love for colour. She drew and painted since her early childhood. Later in early 60s at the suggestion of a family friend, Good Counsel of the sisters of the order of Good Shepherd she started learning to weave. Weaving is not an easy thing. It should be done with a lot of care. Only those who weave will know the art of running needles through fabric. Sansoni was patient, committed and watchful. She is clearly made of hard wearing hands.
And this is how Barefoot has become brave leaders in cotton handloom. Her creativity is functional and you can have them in your home as towels, napkins, table mats, cushions, bedspreads or anything. Their clothing includes handloom finished, well draped garments constructed from simple geometric sections of cloth. Every bit of fabric is used. Pencil cases and other collectibles are made of leftovers. And everything is handmade. The natural yarns they use are dyed and woven by hand. Everything that you find in Barefoot is made here by them and not in a factory. They are made in rural industry and cottage industry where workers take work home teaching skills for the needle woman.
Their design is all about persistence and tumouring. They know how a hand is important as much as a heart is. In Barefoot everything is about how hands can come in handy. Its about people, their hands and innovation. This is why things are a bit expensive here. But one thing is for sure. Theyd last a lifetime. Because their methods are remarkable and natural fabrics age well. And speaking of all this their handloom clothes go fast and 80 percent of their customers are foreigners and they love their linen clothes mostly. Everything pretty much starts from 500 rupees  so anyone can just walk in and grab something. Another thing, the Barefoot book collection is different from other bookstores. You will find coffee table books on art, architecture, photography, wildlife and biodiversity in Sri Lanka. Even sensational and vivid novels done by Sri Lankan English writers and self-help books like travel maps and travel guides.
Next time if you happen to go to Pettah or if you are somewhere near the heart of Colombo, drop by the Dutch Hospital Barefoot. They are open all 7 days from 10am to 8pm. And if you would do so, prepare to be shocked by their perfect use of colour and geometry.

Effective, efficient public will see a developed country - President
An effective and an efficient public service is vital for the success of overall development activities and the progress of the economic sector, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing public servants who received appointment letters as management assistants at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday.
He said public servants are duty bound to understand public issues.
President Sirisena said an efficient and an effective work pattern and a positive attitude paves the way to take the country forward.
He said the government was keen to uplift the economy of families of all communities including rural households.
Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake was instructed by the President to launch a proper and result oriented programme to empower rural family units. "The project will look into the welfare of rural family units while strengthening those family units economically," he said.
He said the government will never let anyone misuse public funds allocated for the development and infrastructure activities of the country.
Public servants as well as politicians are equally duty bound to get the maximum benefits of state allocations, he said. President Sirisena added that it is obvious that when public servants get small bribes, politicians and high ranking officers are engaged in monetary misuses amounting to millions or billions. Both these activities should be condemned and totally banned, he said.

Fabricated reports destroy SL's free health service
Fabricated media reports destroy Sri Lanka's entire free health service. All drugs imported to Sri Lanka are of the highest quality and recommended by committees of experts and professionals, Cabinet Spokesman and Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday, he said only qualified and experienced medical experts and specialist doctors sit for the Formulatory Committees which approve drugs.
"We import over 1,000 drugs. All drugs have a formulatory note. Each new drug has been tested at laboratories. If we find low quality drugs, we withdraw such batches and blacklist the supplier," he said.
Dr. Senaratne said persons who fail to obtain tenders approach specialist doctors and ask them to prescribe their drugs and inform patients that drugs available at hospitals, especially at the Cancer Hospital, are of low quality.
The drug mafia is the second largest mafia in the world. It is same in Sri Lanka. This is why it took 40 years to get the National Drug Policy passed in Parliament, he added.
Dr. Senaratne also said if the school boy taken into custody in connection with the murder of Seya Sadewmi murder was assaulted by Police it was wrong.
The minister also praised Police for solving all past crimes.
All crimes should be solved after investigations, he said.

The Sri Lankan military forces had no intention to harm civilians during the time of the war, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
"The Army, as a policy, refrained from such activities. But, if there are individual incidents where civilians were affected, they have to be investigated," Samarasinghe said addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday.
The minister said the government would investigate the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga and the disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda.
"Such investigations will restore the international community's faith in the Sri Lankan government," he said.
The minister said President Maithripala Sirisena was widely respected by top international leaders at the lunch hosted by the UN Secretary General.
"The Sri Lankan President sat among the most powerful world leaders and that alone was a honour for the country," Samarasinghe said.
He also commended the role played by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in restoring the international community's faith in the Sri Lankan government.
"Although this is an SLFP press conference, we should not fail to commend the role played by the Prime Minister," the minister said.

Head of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya, Dr Asoka Dangolla
Gone are the days when people would domesticate only canines, felines, livestock and cattle. These days, people prefer having pets for shock factor. Yes, exotic is the buzzword when it comes to having a pet. From horses to guinea pigs, parakeets and white mice, Sri Lankans are increasingly choosing the more unusual option.
Reptiles, tortoises and elephants are some of the unusual types of pets found in Sri Lanka. However dogs are still the most popular category of pets among Sri Lankans. This is because a dog can serve many purposes for many individuals in a family and society. Many rare and exotic pets cannot meet these requirements, University of Peradeniya Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science Head of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Dr. Asoka Dangolla says.
He notes that having a pet is a popular concept in Sri Lanka. However the number of pet dogs and cats or any other pet variety has not been estimated yet. The total dog population (including stray and community dogs) has been estimated. The cat population has not been estimated. Though it has not been put into practice thoroughly yet, all dogs need to be registered.
Pets are kept for various purposes. They keep company, share love and protect the owners. They are kept for services like guiding visually impaired people. They also serve the police, army, navy and air force. Pets generate a good income for breeders. Many people keep pedigree or exotic pets to show off. Some even keep them just for the sake of having a pet, Dr. Dangolla said.
Cats and dogs are the usual choices when it comes to pets but there are people across the globe who prefer iguanas, snakes, frogs, crabs, cockroaches, geckos, llamas, tarantulas, scorpions and many other unusual companions.
Unusual pets
Unfortunately, people trying to keep up with the Joneses are buying unsuitable animals as status symbols today. Even though wild animals are by definition unsuitable for domestic settings, they end up being kept as pets by people who are not aware of the pitfalls of doing so.
They have either little or no knowledge about them. Therefore it will be harmful to the animal as well as the owner. Also, others who are in contact with the owner of the unusual pet too might become affected. The animal may wound or injure people. Wild animals are often susceptible to known and unknown diseases. At least 60 percent of human illnesses are generated from animals. These, of course, do not come from domestic pets, he added.
The most unusual kind of pet he has come across in Sri Lanka is a colony of ants which have been reared by a senior university professor. If you are going to keep a pet for the first time, educate yourself about how to care for the little creature.
People dont realize that buying a pet requires a lifestyle change. Dogs with long fur are not suitable for Sri Lanka. They are comfortable in cool climate. Sometimes people keep exotic pets without knowing how to handle them. The owner may like the animal but those around him or her will develop hatred towards the creature, he noted.
Before you set out to choose a pet, be aware of some very important factors. The first is that certain varieties of animals, birds and reptiles are actually illegal to own as pets. There are many varieties of animals such as parrots, myna, chipmunks and other wild animals which are illegal to be kept as pets in Sri Lanka. Some animals like elephants require a permit to be kept in domestic settings.
Stress reviving
While caring for a younger sibling teaches children to be responsible and mature, another great way for children to learn these important lessons is to care for a pet. Family pets like cats and dogs are common in Sri Lanka. In other parts of the world, and particularly in European countries, it is common to give children their own pets to care for. Some dogs maybe too big for children to handle on their own, which is why there is an entire category of smaller pets that are ideal for children. Hamsters, Guinea pigs, tortoises and parrots make very popular pets for children.
Iguana
Everyone needs emotional comfort. There are certain people who are marginalized from society. They need a companion. Keeping a pet is also stress-reviving. Children learn how to communicate, share and care by keeping pets. They learn to recognize the pet's needs by reading their body language, Dr. Dangolla said adding that he believes that dogs make the best pets.
They are artificially bred by man to share their life with human beings. However if you are going to go for a pedigree you need to know a lot of details about the variety. People need to identify their needs and recognize what kind of pet they want. They should not get a pet for the sake of keeping a pet. Many want to have some cat or some dog as a pet. That is not fair by the pet. For example you should not buy a Doberman and expect him to keep companionship. Dobermans are guard dogs. Labradors, Pomeranians and Terriers make good companions, he said.
Otter
Insects are preferred by people who love their unusual nature. A few preferred insects are stick insects, Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, Doodlebugs, Praying Mantis and Giant African Millipedes. What keeps them from becoming more common pets is the fact they tend to be unclean.
People are becoming more experimental about the kind of pets they want. Smaller species like hamsters are becoming popular. Thats because people can keep them in smaller places and flats, says Nalindra (33), who lives in an apartment in Havelock Street. He is a father of two, who has bought his children two hamsters to tend to.
Otter
They were not stuck on getting any one particular pet. So my wife and I began to research different animals. We couldnt have gotten a dog because we travel a lot and dont have a big house. But we were clear that we wanted a pet thats affectionate, responds to us and is easy to keep in a small house. Thats when we zeroed in on a hamster, he said.
Popular notion
His wife, Shazrina (30), adds, Keshiya and Dulen love their pets and wouldn't exchange them for a dog now. The hamsters, Chip and Squeaker, are also very lively.
They wake up if we make too much noise in the night. When I come back from the market, they start jumping and making strange sounds. We feed them vegetables five to six times a day - cucumber, tomato, radishes, even lettuce. They get very excited when the fridge door opens.
Kaduwela resident Balendran (40) who has a pet Pomeranian and Tortoise says, My home is livelier and I feel less alone when my pets are around. I feel calm when I am with them, especially when they react to me.
Harshinis (38) love affair with Persian cats began when her son joined a piano class. When she once accompanied him to his lesson, Harshini realized that Dinuka was more excited about playing with the teachers cat than learning his chords. My dog had died not too long ago, so when I saw Dinuka with the cat, I decided to get one. Today, her four cats, all named after the Ice Age characters: Manny, Diego, Sid and Scrat - are a dominant feature in her apartment.
The popular notion of cats is that they are cold, demanding and unaffectionate pets but Harshini poopooed this idea. They sleep most of the time; then there is a sudden burst of energy when they play with anything and even give you a high five. Then they get exhausted and drift off to sleep again, she says.
In the Colombo modern society today, when professionals are old enough to gain financial independence, but not willing to give up their social independence, out goes the roomie or family, and in comes a pet. Animal company fills a home without intruding it, so it's no surprise that many youth prefer taking up the extra responsibility of walks, vet visits and feeding.
It's still less interfering than living with an actual person and is a small price for playful companionship and uninterrupted cuddling.
Jehan (28), a budding young entrepreneur, got his first cat when he was still living with roommates.
Animals are so simple. They know what is important in life: eating, sleeping and sun-bathing! Once I joined my cat by idling on the balcony but my phone kept buzzing. Miranda gave me a look as if to say, you don't know your priorities, he recalled with a smile.
Kumar (58) owns, Belle, a brown mare, which he grooms especially for his grandchildren.
He notes, Belle can be ridden bareback. She is hardy. She needs about two pounds of oats a day, some grass and regular grooming. Exotic pets are a huge responsibility. You need to think twice before getting one to keep you company. After all, animal are born free and should remain so.

"I have already had discussions with the relevant parties and solved the problem. A new theatre will be constructed at the hospital soon," he said.
The minister said consultant cardiologist Dr. Namal Gamage is Sri Lanka's only consultant thoracic heart surgeon who can perform three or more heart surgeries a day.
Dr. Senaratne blamed the Health Ministry for the issues at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital by sending more surgeons.
"Another cardio thoracic surgeon was sent there creating a conflict because he was not fast as Dr. Gamage. Another thoracic surgeon was also sent adding fuel to the burning fire. A long waiting list ensued," he said.
Dr. Senaratne said issues have now been solved.

Increase retirement age to 65 - Harsha
The retirement age should be increased to 65 years, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
Speaking at the National Pensioners' Day Symposium at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday, de Silva said Sri Lanka does not have a sustainable pension structure.
"Problems relating to pensioners have been ignored. Sri Lanka has more women than men. Statistics have revealed that men live up to 72 years while women live for 78 years. According to the latest labour force report, the labour force is 8.8 million of which 5.5 million are males and 2.5 million are females. This will generate problems in the future. Male participation is more in the labour force though there are more women in the country," he said.
De Silva said only 47 percent of the people are employed in this country.
"We need to create more jobs to attract more into the labour force. More opportunities should be created for women. The female participation in the labour force has to be increased. If more people are employed, the government will have more resources. The government's priority is to create a highly competitive social market economy," the deputy minister said.
Around 2.5 million people contribute to the public provident fund while nearly 170,000 people contribute to the private provident fund. Nearly 55 percent do not have sufficient coverage. Those outside the labour force also do not receive benefits, he said. De Silva said for a person to get the pension has to work in the public sector for 20 years.
The National Pensioners Day is celebrated to recognise pensioners who contribute to the development of the nation, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said as the Chief Guest at the event. The Sri Lanka Pensions Department along with the government intends to provide better facilities and benefits to the pensioners, he said.
Jayasuriya said the government spends over Rs. 15 million on pensioners per month.

A journey to our Heritage
The Heladiwa Heritage Circle is one of the most implemented concepts of Neurologist Dr. Dhaham Ratwatte. It has come forward by several steps by now. Sri Lanka is the main centre to the Heladiwa Heritage Circle. Under the programmes of Heladiwa Heritage Circle, the knowledge of our ancestors who utilized pure Sinhalese inherited systems will be presented to the world community for their comfort.
The main achievement of HHC is to introduce the hereditary values of Sri Lanka. Another target is eradicating every myth which has been established for a long time in society concerning Sri Lankan heritage. Next is to provide good service as a charitable program.
Participating in an interview, with Daily News TnC, Heladiwa Heritage Circle Information Technology and Media Director Ravishanka Senanayake elaborated on the heritage and international relationships which existed between Sri Lanka with other countries.
Much has been written on Sri Lanka. It has had many human settlements predating the dawn of human history. About 34,000 years ago evidence of the Balangoda human had appeared as Mesolithic hunters. Their settlements could be seen in some caves in the area. And there is evidence that agriculture has existed in Sri Lanka since 15,000 BC in Sri Lanka, he said.

According to the records oats and barley were grown on this land. Human remains have been found at the Varana RajamahaVihara and according to many historical legends and folklores Ravana was a great king who ruled the country about 5,000 years ago. He was a brilliant person who had a good knowledge of technology, specifically flight. He is reputed to have had a machine called Dandumonara that could fly and today there are many folk stories about the Dandumonara. It is said that, some names of villages like Wariyapola, Sitha Eliya and Ravana Ella were created according to reputations of Ravana.
Dr. Dhaham Ratwatta is trying to retrace this civilization and create a vast intellectual discussion about the pre historic period of Sinhalese. Another one is to present our cultural heritage with our traditional values to the world community. It is our vision.
The program by HHC is not limited to Sri Lanka as it has already stretched out to other countries in the world. United Kingdom is one of the main centers of the programme. Likewise, Canada, Japan, USA, German and Australia have centers to spread Sri Lankan culture to the world.
HHC has now chosen several centers in the country to provide knowledge to the people. Dr. Ratwatte has organized these centers in villages such as Chilaw, Battaramulla, Batticallow and Balangoda Diyavinna. The village headmen, indigenous medicine doctors and traditional dancers will participate in this project. Sri Lankan food and handicrafts can be sold in these centers. Other than that, eco-tourism would be promoted covering these villages. A very good job market will be developed.
One of the main topics of the HHC is providing services to the people through astrology. Astrology is not a new practice in Sri Lanka. The people of Sri Lanka knew the methods of utilizing secret subjects concerning astrology, oriental medicine, ritual practices, traditional offerings, palm reading, agriculture, Yaga Homa, Pilliyevima and Anjanam. Martial arts such as Angampora and Ilangampora also have to be included to the above list.
Anuhas Astrology is a company which has been registered in the UK devoted to the field of astrology and it wants to save the craft from people who only have commercial interests at mind. For this Neurologist Dr. Ratwatte has come forward.
According to Dr. Ratwatte, Astrology has been limited to its present state due to wrong political predictions. Therefore people in the country think that the subject is a failure. But the Anuhas Astrology is ready to provide its services free of charge from UK. Up to now, thousands of people have been treated in many ways through Anuhas Astrology.
People can contact Dr. Ratwatte and Anuhas through the Facebook where thre are articles and people who are unaware of this subject, could develop their knowledge easily.
The timely change of planets and influences of planets as well as the daily lives of people can be discussed by astrology. But astrologists should be very competent and honest providing a good service.
As another programme, HHC already has started to teach Angampora under the theme of Sri Lanka Traditional Indigenous Martial Arts. They have built up 10 training centers to practice Angampora. The Head Center is in Athurugiriya. MoratuwaIndibedda, Moratumulla, Bandaragama, Thalawathugoda, Polgahawela-Bandawa, Boralesgamuwa, Opanayake, Malinboda and Diwlapitiya- Maradagahamula are the other centers. The Kandy and Kalutara centers will be opened soon.
Other than that, trainings, competitions and shows would also be organized in many areas in the country by the Angampora STIMA under HHC.
The Heladiva Heritage Circle signed a MOU with the Kothalawala Defense University last July for training cadet officers in three areas. We are teaching martial arts to the Kothalawala Defense University cadets. Our Angampora martial artists are Guru Premasiri Malimbadaarachchi, Guru Sunimal Fernando, Guru Athula Nandana, Guru P Edirisinghe, Guru Sandun Frenando, Guru Sumudu Fernando, Guru H. Wijesinghe and International Trainer Oliver Herrmann, Ravishanka said.
During seven days of the week articles will be done on web sites making people aware of the programmes and cultural affair. Monday will be for indigenous Medicine and Ayurveda, Tuesday for Astrology, Wednesday for Traditional Dance, Thursday for Angampora Martial Arts & Folk songs, Friday for traditional Handicrafts, Saturday for Agriculture and Sunday for Cuisine.
There is a great demand from foreign countries to learn our Angampora and astrology, Ravishanka concluded.

At least 13 killed in Yemen wedding bombing
YEMEN: A suspected Saudi-led air strike killed at least 13 people at a wedding in a rebel-held town in Yemen, witnesses and the rebels said Thursday, even as UN peace efforts made headway.
There was no immediate comment from the Saudi-led coalition, which has come under mounting criticism from human rights groups for the civilian death toll from the bombing campaign it has waged against the rebels since March.
It was the second alleged coalition strike on a Yemeni wedding party in just over a week.
The new raid hit a house where dozens of people were celebrating the wedding on Wednesday evening in the town of Sanban, 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital Sanaa, residents said.
"Coalition warplanes launched the attack. The house was completely destroyed," said witness and local resident Taha al-Zuba. "Warplanes were heard in the area ahead of the attack." The rebels' Al-Masirah television said on Twitter that the wedding was hit by "aggression warplanes," referring to the coalition.
Medical sources said 38 people were also wounded.
In September a suspected coalition strike killed at least 131 civilians at a wedding near the Red Sea city of Mokha, which the UN said may have been the deadliest hit since March. The coalition denied involvement. The latest strike came as the United Nations announced that the rebels, who control the capital and much of central and northern Yemen, had accepted a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to the seven-month conflict.
The rebels' refusal to agree to abide by the resolution passed in April -- demanding their withdrawal from all the territory they have seized since they overran the capital in September last year -- had stymied previous peace efforts.
Yemeni President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled into exile in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in March but whose forces have since recaptured much of the south with the support of Saudi-led ground troops, had refused to join UN-brokered peace talks until the rebels signed up.
But UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced in New York late on Wednesday that both the rebels and their allies had confirmed they were willing to enter talks based on the UN resolution.
"This is an important step," he said. The Shiite Huthi rebels, whose heartland is in the mountains of the far north, were only able to capture so much of the country because of the support of renegade troops still loyal to Hadi's ousted predecessor Ali Abullah Saleh. - AFP

Mideast countries call for IMF help on refugee crisis
EGYPT: Middle Eastern countries urged the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday to help them deal with the massive influx of refugees from conflicts in Syria and beyond, including with low-interest loans.
"A number of our countries are facing heightened demands on domestic resources from the influx of refugees and internally displaced populations," said a statement from a dozen countries in the region at the IMF's annual meeting in Lima, Peru.
"We call on the Fund to provide financing to the affected counties on concessional terms to mitigate these costs and to encourage more timely and adequate support from the international community."
The comments came in a prepared statement to be delivered Friday by the United Arab Emirates' representative at the IMF meeting on behalf of Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, the Maldives, Oman, Qatar, Syria and Yemen.
Although much recent attention has focused on Europe's struggles to deal with the influx of uprooted Syrians, the war-torn country's neighbors have taken in the bulk of the more than four million people who have fled in the past four years, straining their capacity to cope with the new arrivals.
Many Middle Eastern countries are also struggling to deal with internally displaced people uprooted by conflict, including Iraq, Yemen and Libya. AFP

He said Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara introduced free education to guarantee a better future for children. However, contrary to ideals of free education, the allocation for education had witnessed a gradual decline over the years, he said.
"The government aims to transform schoolchildren into purposeful citizens. We are ready shoulder this responsibility. We will bring about radical changes through education by increasing the allocation," Karunanayake said.
"Our objective is to make Sri Lanka the country with the best education system in Asia," he said.

New Muslim role model rises from British baking contest
UK: The victor of "The Great British Bake Off" was hailed as a Muslim role model on Wednesday after winning the hit television contest, as well as the hearts of the nation.
Nadiya Jamir Hussain, a 30-year-old mother of three from the northern English city of Leeds, survived 11 weekly vote-offs to win the series after impressing judges with an array of artistic creations.
For her final show-stopping piece in the finale she made a cake decorated with a sari in the blue, red and white of Britain's Union Jack.
Hussain charmed viewers with her witty one-liners and endearing range of facial expressions, which spawned a "Many Faces of Nadiya Appreciation Blog", becoming the audience favourite to win the programme -- a runaway success whose final was expected to draw a record-breaking 14 million viewers.
The Muslim Association of Britain called her "an inspiration to many British Muslims, and especially Muslim women".
"I think she's incredibly talented and it's really wonderful to see a British Muslim just showcasing the best of Muslim talent in this country," said Zara Mohammed, vice president of the Federation of Student Islamic Societies.
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was rooting for her, as did Chancellor George Osborne who tweeted "Go Nadiya!!". Born to a Bangladeshi family in the multicultural hub of Luton, Hussain was credited with helping overthrow stereotypes. "Nadiya is the first British woman who wears a hijab to have occupied such a positive, joyous role in British mass culture," Charlotte Higgins, chief culture writer for The Guardian daily, wrote ahead of the final.
Hussain had admitted before the final that she was at first "a bit nervous that perhaps people would look at me, a Muslim in a headscarf, and wonder if I could bake". - AFP

Three foreign judges took part in formulating the Paranagama Report. Everything now happens according to the law of Sri Lanka and under the Sri Lankan Judiciary, Dr. Senaratne said.
He said according to the resolution, everything will be done after discussions with the Sri Lankan government. "It is the Sri Lankan government which decides what to do and how to do. The Sri Lankan government is the decision maker," he said.

Nuts over Chilaw Coconuts
The coconut is considered the heart of the Sri Lankan kitchen and to experience its many mystical and magical benefits head to Chilaw Adammana and Bolawatta coconut plantation estates, two places rich in traditions.
Wedding traditions
On the marriage day of Gail, a local coconut plantation daughter's wedding, a doorway was decorated of jasmine flowers. The coconut flowers are kept in a terracotta pot (kalaya) which is also called the punkalasa to symbolise prosperity and coconut palm leaves were used for the roofing. The symbolism been the husband enters through the doorway to take away the bride away known as Kandanyama. A coconut is broken with a manne (knife) and depending on how it splits will be an indicator of their future destiny together.
Gail and Kavinda's sliced perfectly in half splashing water in all directions as the coconut palms rustled in the wind and the holy water was poured over the couples fingers tied together with a string, binding them together in a future wheel of life to Bolawatta. Here, palm trees grow between 50 to 80 feet high, and tree houses are being created similar to the ones found in Africa. Interestingly this is where the humble palm came from in the first place.
Dragon Fruit Cook
Coconut is the islands lifeblood and the reason in Sri Lanka that everyone drinks coconut daily for its refreshing rehydrating water. Every bit of the coconut palm is used from its husk for coir rope to tropical style housing and even when only the shell is left they are burnt as charcoals to get rid of the mosquitoes. Here in the land of coconuts the dragon fruit cook Laura Judith teaches Plantation style Sri Lankan cooking with coconut and spices. This also includes grating the fresh flesh of the coconut for village style pol sambols and will tell you all as you cook the importance of drying the copra in the hot sun to yield the coconut oil.
After making a range of dishes you will get to feast on this magnificent homemade village banquet using local fish still wriggling as you buy it from the beach Karukkupane. Dragon fruits husband is a farmer over 40 years known fondly as Sarath, who will join the groups and talk about the many ways these trees with huge feather -shaped 18 foot leaves produce nuts the size of rugby balls that village kids will often use if there is nothing else around to play with.
On a walk around the estate with him, you will learn how coconut oil is used to make soaps, margarine and confectionary like pol toffee. The fibre or coir is woven into ropes and mats using the leaves twisting from one direction to the other by the local villagers, who also hand make brushes, furniture, stuffing, handmade coconut shell buttons and even beautifully carved jewellery from the polished shells. The branch wood has been used for over a century for building village ambalamas resting spots for the weary traveller, festival huts and quirky furniture. Even cattle yokes are made from this incredibly diverse and useful tree.
Sarath knows a lot about working with cattle having spent much of his working life as the Ambewela Dairy Farms manager. He is a visionary man with a dream to put farming and Chilaw on the traveller's map with his naughty goats, cows, chickens and ducks. To find out the secrets of the medicinal benefits of the coconut oils, you can combine doing a cooking class with going on a curated walk that will show you the grass roots other medicinal plants in the area that for centuries have made Sri Lanka the healthiest country in Asia.
Crazy brood
Sarath has finally persuaded his crazy brood that includes a DJ, IT expert daughter from Colombo, Marketing guru and film maker son-in-law to join him in an enterprise to give the coconut the same positioning as tea and cinnamon.
Tying the knot
This is a family full of stories and love of life, the very essence of a Sri Lankan family representing both its colonial Dutch past and its Singhalese Tamil re-unified future.
A family whose estate has passed down through a generations along with traditions such as on the wedding day coconuts are integral to the ceremonial part of the procedures. Something you will feel from the moment you enter this coconut plantation paradise.
To do a cooking class, go on a walk and learn more about coconuts one can call on Adammana Estate, Pallama, Chilaw or mail then on [emailprotected] or simply dial 0777228984.

Obama apologizes to MSF for deadly Kunduz air strike
US: US President Barack Obama on Wednesday apologized to Doctors Without Borders (MSF) for a deadly US air strike on an Afghan hospital, as the medical charity demanded an international investigation.
Three separate probes -- by the US military, NATO and Afghan officials -- are under way into Saturday's catastrophic strike in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz which left 22 people dead.
The US military has offered a series of shifting explanations for the bombing raid, from initially talking about "collateral damage" to now admitting, as Obama did in his call to MSF chief Joanne Liu, that the strike was a mistake.
One report said the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan thought American forces had broken their own rules of engagement in carrying out the strike, which sparked international outrage.
Obama called Liu to "apologize and express his condolences for the MSF staff and patients who were killed and injured when a US military airstrike mistakenly struck an MSF field hospital in Kunduz," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
The president told Liu of his "great respect" for MSF's work and assured her that the Pentagon probe would "provide a transparent, thorough and objective accounting of the facts and circumstances of the incident," Earnest said.
Obama also called Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to express his condolences and commended the "bravery" of Afghan forces battling to secure the city of Kunduz from Taliban fighters.
He also said he looked forward to working with Ghani and the Afghan government to "support their efforts to provide security for the Afghan people," the White House said.
But the charity, which condemned the attack as a war crime, stressed the need for an international inquiry, saying the bombing raid was in contravention of the Geneva Conventions.
"We cannot rely on an internal military investigation," Liu told reporters in Geneva, insisting that the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission should probe the bombing.
"This was not just an attack on our hospital -- it was an attack on the Geneva Conventions," Liu said.
"This cannot be tolerated."
MSF's US chief Jason Cone later called on Obama to consent to the commission, which he said would "send a powerful signal of the US government commitment to... international humanitarian law and the rules of war."
The fact-finding commission, which was officially constituted in 1991, requires a request by one of the 76 signatory nations to begin its work, according to its website.
Liu's remarks come a day after General John Campbell, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said the "hospital was mistakenly struck" when Afghan officials called for the raid.
But MSF brushed aside that explanation, saying "a mistake is not an answer for us" and insisting on knowing "the facts, the intention, the criteria" behind the raid, which lasted more than an hour.
International aid groups, the United Nations and a growing tide of global revulsion have added to the pressure on Washington to come clean over the strike, which came days after the Taliban overran Kunduz.
The strike killed 12 MSF staff and 10 patients, prompting the charity to close the trauma center, seen as a lifeline in a war-battered region with scant medical care.
Hungry, thirsty and war-wounded residents, slowly emerging from their houses after days of pitched street battles, complained that Kunduz lacked essential medical support.

School education to be standardized: New laws to monitor quality
In a fresh attempt to regulate the booming education business in the country, the Ministry of Education plans to introduce new laws to monitor the quality of international schools.
Initially the ministry will focus on the quality of education provided by international schools, focusing on curricular, quality of teachers and school facilities, Ministry Secretary W. M. Bandusena said.
Since the establishment of the first international school in 1977, the institutes have been operating in a vacuum, with no authority to govern or monitor them. Registered under Companies Act as a business entity or as BOI projects, international schools started multiplying across the country during the last two decades.
Last week Education Minister Akila Kariyawasam renewed his promise to regulate the sector. This was also included in the 100-day plan in the presidential campaign as well. But this is not the first time to attempt imposing regulations on international schools.
In 2013, then Education Minister Bandula Gunawardene attempted regulating the schools. Before him, the National Education Commission report given by Prof. G. D. Gunwardne recommended the same. But none yielded results.
Until this year Education Ministry officials had little knowledge regarding international schools. In March, for the first time, the ministry commenced collecting data on schools, including the number of students, teachers and the subjects taught. Accordingly, international and private schools both teaching local and foreign syllabuses to students between the ages of 5 and 18 were to provide details to the ministry. "It is our responsibility to ensure that all students of this county get a quality education and we are just acting on our duty," Bandusena claimed.
However, he was unable to provide details of the specifics of the monitoring mechanism that is being proposed to maintain quality standards of education services offered by international schools.
The move is a welcome change in the right direction, Buddhika Fernando, father of three school- going children claimed. With three children still receiving primary education in a leading international school in Colombo, expenses are high. But not the standard of education given, he claims.
"I put on my 'Mr. Angry face' and marched into the school when I realized that my children are not getting a satisfactory education. That was not the first time that I had to enter the school premises to inquire about the education system," he says.
He was concerned that the school employed unqualified teachers, and lacked quality in the education imparted on students.
"The charges of the school increased day by day, but the teachers at the schools are not well qualified. Sometimes the administration recruits school leavers too. Nearly 98 percent of teachers in the government schools are trained teachers and that is an advantage in those schools," he said.
When he understood the shortcomings, he considered changing the school. But the expenses involved in such a move were prohibitive, he claims.
The quality of education was a concern for Perera too, who declined to be identified by her full name. A teacher by profession, she claims she sees a marked difference in the education her two sons receive. One of her sons attends an international school, the other a state school.
"Acquiring a good English language skill is the only advantage in sending your child to an international school. The school administration needs to show some concern over the quality of teachers. There is no stability either. Teachers do not stay for long periods in the school. They leave the school for better job opportunities. It is not the same in government schools," she claims.
Added to the quality concerns, Fernando claims that the administration did not deliver all the services he was promised when admitting his children to the school.
"When I admitted them to the school, the administration promised to provide free transport. With the term fee we were asked to pay facilities fee which included both transport and recreation fees. But after a year, suddenly they included a separate transport fee and now I have to pay more than Rs. 65,000 for term fees per child".
With no authority to safeguard the interests of the students, Fernando has no one to turn to. However, not all are in favour of the ministry decision.
Calling the ministry decision a move to privatize education, General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers Union Joseph Stalin claimed that the government should take steps to take over all international school.
Stalin also questioned the legal capacity of the education ministry to impose regulations when the institutions registered as business entities fall outside the purview of the education ministry.
"Many of these small international schools don't even have proper facilities. Some function as mobile schools. When the lease period of the building in which the school is run expires, they move. All of these should be taken over by the ministry," he demanded.
International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL) association Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles expressed his willingness to cooperate with the government to regulate the sector.
However, the association is yet to be consulted by the ministry.
"We need to know the regulations that the ministry is planning to impose. The previous year, the ministry recommended us to teach the mother tongue (Sinhala and Tamil), History of Sri Lanka and Religion. All 25 member schools will be implementing the recommendation to the curriculum and it functions from September 2015," he said.
Although international schools provide education to over 40,000 students, unlike private schools their institutions receive no support from the government, he claimed.
Stressing on the need to take all aspects of the issue into account, Dr. Alles said the future of all students studying in international schools should be taken into consideration before regulations are made.

All one needs to is turn of their work mode and take a deep breath and take any mode of transportation and begin exploring sites away from tall buildings and the ocean front.
Taking into consideration that there is definitely more to Colombo than what meets the eye, Cinnamon City Hotels launched the Colombo City Excursions in collaboration with Nature Trails on Tuesday October 6. We have three city hotels  Cinnamon Grand, Cinnamon Lakeside and Cinnamon Red  three different experiences and budgets too. Theres a need to showcase the scenic beauty of Colombo. We wanted to see how we could extend the stay of a city traveler and to ones who think theres attraction only of the city, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts City Sector Marketing Communications Head Tharika Goonathilake stated at the press briefing.
Nature Trails which is the wildlife and adventure tourism arm of Cinnamon Resorts & Hotels is headed by Chitral Jayatilake, got together with his team and studied the time frames for each of the expeditions as well as on the budgets.

Sometimes we feel that we have neglected the true essence of the city and lost interest in all that is worth looking at in the city. We thought that it is worth to get a bundle of offerings to explore in the city. Sometimes a few moments spent in nature, a place of worship or just talking to an interesting personality is all you need to get some stress away. Interpretations of these excursions will be handled by the team of experts from Nature Trails. We will be keeping on adding excursions as and when we need, Chitral Jayatilake added.
There are altogether six excursions that have been arranged. There is the Nature tour which is separated into two excursions  Bird Watching excursion to the Thalangama Lake and a River Cruise down Kelani River. The Thalangama Lake hosts a variety of birds (migratory birds can be found during the Novemmber-March period), insects and mammals and is one of Colombos best wetland habitats. The urban wetland is also one of the best places to spot the endemic purple faced leaf monkey. One can choose a three-hour long cruise on the Kelani River to the Historical Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya or a cruise along the Hamilton Canal up to the Negombo Lagoon, Nature Trails City Guide with all the information Chandika stated.

The Architectural tour consists of visiting Colombos spectacular buildings, some of which have been erected in the Colonial era - the Old Parliament (1930), Galle Face Hotel (1864), Independence Square (1948), Race Course (1839), Dutch Hospital (1681), Town Hall (1927), Galle Face Green (1856), Old Colombo Light House (1829), Colombo Light House (1952), Grand Oriental Hotel (1870), Cargills building (1844) and the HSBC building.
The tour will shed light on design transformation that took place during the rule of the Dutch and the English plus a walk in Pettah - Colombos core commercial district  is also in the expedition.
Then there is the Religious and Historic tours organised to cover the historical and ethnic diversity of the country. One is a stopover at sites of religious worship of the four major religions practiced in Sri Lanka - visit to St. Anthonys Shrine in Kochchikade, Red Mosque in Pettah, Kovil on Vauxhall Street, the Gangarama Temple and the Seema-Malakaya in Colombo 2. The other is a trip to the Bellanvila temple to admire the murals that decorate the Shrine Hall. The Shrine Hall has been a key attraction for the murals artist Somabandu Vidyapathi. He was 67 years when he took upon the work in 1990 and by the time he completed the murals in 1998 he was 75. His creativity can be seen in an area of 4,632 sq ft of walls. Adding to the historic value is the temples sacred Bodhi-tree, which is believed to be one of the 32 saplings that sprang from the sacred Bodhi-tree in Anuradhapura, which was planted in the 3rd century BC.
There are people who do prefer the indoors to the outdoors (no matter how much you push them to step out). So for them a little journey to the world of Sri Lankan Culinary works has been arranged. Sri Lankas rice and curry is loved world over for the careful play of fragrant spices to enhance flavour. Cinnamon Grands village in the city Nuga Gama serves authentic Sri Lankan cuisine from various parts of the country. The food aspect of the expedition will be created here, with the amms sharing their secrets of cooking with guests, giving them a one-of-a-kind introduction to local fare. A plant tour is also part of the package, where guests will be able to walk among the medicinal plants that are grown in the Nuga Gama compound and used for cooking.
Guests can choose any mode of transport  Three Wheels (tuk tuks), Vans, Cars or depending on the quest requirements or groups larger than 20, the special double-decker bus can be arranged as well. So next time remember to pack a little extra for that excursions  so that you are as comfortable as possible to enjoy Colombo in a very different view.

Treat indeed for Sanhinda Childrens Home
In celebration of World Childrens Day, SriLankan Cares, the charitable arm of SriLankan Airlines, one of South Asias Grand Dames Galle Face Hotel and the pioneers in the transport world in Sri Lanka, Ebert Silva, joined hands to make children their main focus.
The day was not simply a day to celebrate children for who they are, but for them to enjoy a journey of hospitality. A culture of giving is one of the defining features of a successful society; indeed the three companies that joined hands on this occasion certainly did improve the quality of life of the children in the Sanhinda Home.
Todays experience for the children was an exposure to the kids to inculcate in them what they could aspire to be, Ebert Silva Holidays Chairperson Rajini Mendis stated.
The synergy through the three companies made the children very happy. A guest journey is not only about a hotel experience, it is also love, hope and the personal care provided that make it a memorable experience, Galle Face Hotel Director Marketing Communications Mahika Chandrasena added.
Arriving at the airport in a double-decker bus and then heading to an aircraft with a familiarization tour for the children by the authorities of airport and aviation, and finally a delectable tea party at the Galle Face Hotel indeed made the children rejoice to the utmost.
The children are our treasure and handling them with care and commitment whilst opening a whole world of hope for these innocent children who have been less cared for, was our main objective, SriLankan Cares Manager Niroshan Ranawake said.

She made this observation while addressing the media after a ceremony to introduce the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment new Chairman Rajpal Kumar Obeysekera.
"Requests have been made by various institutions to pay our attention on this issue and discussions are currently on among the authorities to find-out a proper method of doing it such as the introduction of e-mail voting," she said.
Athukorala also said that illegal migration is one of the major issues faced by the SLBFE and the recent Kuwait incident proves that illegal migrants have no chance to enter any country.
Eleven Sri Lankan women sent to Kuwait on tourist visas were deported recently.
The minister promised to take strict action against SLBFE officers linked to the racket.
Four officers have already been interdicted.
