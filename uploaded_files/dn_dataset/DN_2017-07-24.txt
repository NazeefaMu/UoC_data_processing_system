## Title: Protection against cervical cancer

Protection against cervical cancer
Dr. Deepa Gamage attached to the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry speaks to Health Watch about the vaccine against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) introduced by the Government recently. The vaccine is now included in the National Immunization Programme and is injected to all school girls starting from grade six in order to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer in them in the future.
Q: What is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 
A - Human Papilloma Virus has different sub types called geno types (more than 100 types). Each HPV virus geno type is identified by a number. This is a common virus which can stay in surfaces such as skin and mucous membranes (e.g. oral and genital tract surfaces). But the virus, just by staying on surfaces will not cause any signs and symptoms externally to identify whether virus is on the surface or not. It does not actually cause an acute illness and even sometimes it can spontaneously disappear due to various reasons.
Q:How does it spread and affect women 
A: Some geno types of the virus are dangerous. Even though they do not cause acute illnesses or disease to the person just by staying, it tends to stay long without disappearing (harbouring surfaces) and gradually causes cellular changes in specific areas in the body, which later transform into cancer cells or into non-cancerous cell growths resulting in warts. The interval between the acquisition of HPV infection and progression to advanced stages of cervical cancer is usually about 10 years or longer. It has been identified that 99 percent of cervical cancers are due to any of these types of the Human Papilloma viruses. Out of these different types, type 16 and type 18 are the most cancerous types causes 70 percent of cervical cancers.
Q: How can we diagnose cervical cancer 
A: Cervical cancer is usually identified very late because cancer develops inside the body and signs and symptoms develop very late. By the time a woman gets signs and symptoms, the cancer is usually spread beyond the cervix to the womb, tissues and organs outside, around the womb and even to other organs in the body.
Cervical early cancer is detected by screening for cervical cancer. Different methods are available to detect cervical cancer early before being spread to other organs. These HPV-induced changes in the cervical epithelium can be detected early by HPV DNA tests, cervical cell cytology testing, and visual inspection with acetic acid or by using Lugols Iodine. Cervical cancer screening is focused on early detection of cases and timely treatment. It is recommended for females in 21 - 65 age group and screening to be performed in every 3 to 5 years period.
Pap smear screening programme is focused on early detection of cases and timely treatment. It is recommended for females in age 21 to 65 groups and screening to be performed in every 3 to 5 years period. Pap smear screening programme in Sri Lanka is in place for the last two decades and all women at the age of 35 years (or above) are offered at least one time screening at the well women clinics conducted by Medical Officers of Health.
Even though cervical cancer early detection is available for women, nearly 850 to 1000 women in each year are still presented to hospitals with advanced stages of cervical cancer. The majority of these patients remain with complications and nearly half of them die due to cervical cancer. Cervical cancer cases in Sri Lanka tend to increase from 29 to 30 years and the majority is in 45 to 55 year age group according to the Cancer Control Programme data.
Q: How can we prevent cervical cancer 
A: The cervical cancer preventive vaccine gives the protection for these cervical cancer causing high risk geno types of 16 and 18 and prevents development of cervical cancer due to these geno types in the future when they become adult women. However, it has been identified that there is a protection for other cervical cancer causing types also by giving this vaccine through cross protection for other geno types.
This vaccine needs to be given at the optimal age which enables to develop protective immunity and before exposure to cancer causing HPV geno types. In fact, HPV vaccine is recommended to be given to girls ideally between 9 and13 years as two (2) doses. Cervical cancer screening in older women will be continuing and required even though the HPV vaccine is given to girls.
Q: How is the HPV vaccine given
A: HPV vaccine is given through National Immunization Programme from July 2017. It will be given through the school based vaccination programme. All girls in Grade six are given the HPV vaccination on completion of 10 years of age. Two doses of the vaccine need to be given for complete protection of the vaccine preventable cervical cancer proportion of cervical cancers (caused by cancer causing genotypes 16 and 18). Minimum interval (gap) between two doses of the HPV vaccine should be six months.
HPV vaccine is a very safe vaccine and mild common local reactions (such as pain and redness) can be experienced as for any other vaccination. Severe side effects are very rare and other country experiences shows no severe adverse events.
HPV vaccination was available in Sri Lanka in the private sector since 2010. There are two types of HPV vaccines called Bivalent HPV vaccine (which contained HPV geno types 16 and 18) and Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (which contained HPV geno types 16, 18 and 6, 11) . Both types give the same protection against cervical cancer while Quadrivalent HPV vaccine gives an additional protection for HPV related genital warts. Bivalent HPV vaccine was registered and available to use in in Sri Lanka since2010 and Quadrivalent HPV vaccine was registered and available to use in Sri Lanka since in 2012 in the private sector.
Quadrivalent HPV vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer is available free to the child since July 2017 and vaccination is provided through school based programme to Grade six girls.

Red Cross scales up response to dengue: Over 100, 000 affected

As the number of dengue cases tops 100,000 in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are rapidly scaling up emergency assistance to help contain the countrys worst-ever outbreak of the mosquito-borne viral disease.
Dengue patients are streaming into overcrowded hospitals that are stretched beyond capacity and struggling to cope, particularly in the countrys hardest hit Western Province.
Sri Lankas Ministry of Health reports that the number of dengue infections has climbed above 103,00 since the start of 2017, with 296 deaths. The number of cases this year is already nearly double the number of dengue infections recorded in all of 2016, when 55,150 people were diagnosed with the disease.
Dengue is endemic here, but one reason for the dramatic rise in cases is that the virus currently spreading has evolved and people lack the immunity to fight off the new strain, says Dr Novil Wijesekara, Head of Health at the Sri Lanka Red Cross.
Compounding the crisis, recent monsoon rains and floods have left pools of stagnant water and rotting rain-soaked trashideal breeding sites for mosquitoes. Ongoing downpours and worsening sanitation conditions raise concerns the disease will continue to spread.
Teams of Sri Lanka Red Cross volunteers have been supporting a large-scale government effort to stem the outbreakproviding patient care at hospitals and going door-to-door with public health inspectors to raise awareness about the disease, its symptoms and how to prevent its spread. Volunteers have also been helping authorities to identify and clean sites where mosquitoes are breeding.
Today, IFRC released new Disaster Relief Emergency Funds to the Sri Lanka Red Cross to vastly expand the response over the next six months, aiming to assist 307,000 people in the districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara where dengue is rampant.
In coordination with government partners, Red Cross teams are set to expand patient care at six priority hospitals and improve or install water and sanitation at nine medical facilities.
Additional teams of volunteers will be trained to identify and eliminate vector breeding sites, and then deploy to 72 vulnerable communities to lead household, school and community information and clean-up campaigns.
The size of this dengue outbreak is unprecedented in Sri Lanka, says Jagath Abeysinghe, President of Sri Lanka Red Cross. It will require a united front in support of the governments prevention and control programme and committed community action to tackle it.
Dengue is one of the worlds fastest growing diseases, endemic in 100 countries, with as many as 390 million infections annually, according to the World Health Organization. Early detection and treatment saves lives when infections are severe, particularly for young children.
Dengue tends to seek out the poor who live in densely populated places where sanitation is inadequate, rubbish piles up, water pools and mosquitoes thrive, says Gerhard Tauscher, IFRCs operations manager in Sri Lanka. But the disease can be stopped in its tracks when affected communities are informed about prevention and treatment, have access to medical care and mobilize to clean up their environment. Thats what our teams are focusing on.

The right time, the right way!
He is the heart throb of the silver screen. Making his debut into the industry through Udayakantha Warnasuriyas Hiripoda Wessa, his talent and good looks were noted instantly. Every director vied to have him for their male lead as his profile attracted masses to the theaters. Rumours were circulating about who would link up with this real life Romeo. Finally, in 2014 he revealed his lady love to the world. Kushlani Ranawana nee Fernando unfolds some chapters of her life with Roshan Ranawana.
Roshan in a few words
To put it in a nutshell: Roshan is a person with a strong mind and a soft heart. He is an honest person. He does not tell lies or cheat on people. He has strong moral values. He is also a helpful and kindhearted person. The common perception about him is that he is a very reserved person but what most people dont know about him is that he is a person who is really fun to be with.
First impression
Roshans grandparents have lived next door to us ever since I was born. So I have been knowing him from my babyhood. Roshans cousin, Arunika, and his brother, Chanaka, were my childhood friends. We spent most of our time after school together and I used to bump into Roshan then. He would hardly speak to me and since he was well-built at an early age, I used to run when I see him. He was very quiet, would keep company with his grandparents, go to the gym, and smile as we passed by. So my first impression of him would be a Hulk who doesnt speak much!
The attraction
As we grew up together, we started playing badminton. Roshan joined the clique. Later he and I became very close friends because we both perceived life the same way. We enjoyed being with each other and, most importantly, we understood each other. With time we realized that we found the perfect match in each other. His honesty and commitment to our relationship stole my heart completely and led to our marriage.
Route to matrimony
Well, he never proposed to me. He would always tell me, even at the time that we were friends, that he would marry and spend the rest of his life with only one person and that would be his first love. Therefore in his terms, a proposal was never needed since his intention was to see the relationship end up in marriage from the day we fell in love. After seeing each other for 11 years, we got married on August 1, 2014. Our wedding day was the most unforgettable day in our lives as we embarked on our journey of life together, with blessings from our families and friends. It was the first day that our love got public attention!
Mr Popularity
I love all the attention Roshan gets from his fans. I havent felt is as a nuisance at any stage. It makes me feel proud because not everyone is loved by so many people: female, male, young and old. Before we got married, I used to be the one who got caught to take the photographs as fans didnt know that I was his girlfriend. We always went out with our clique. Now, things have changed and often I too get called to be in the photo.
Going green
Roshan is a vegetarian. I too have been a vegetarian even before we got married. It was not his influence but a personal experience which made me convert.
Work vs household chores
I am a Management Accountant and I work for a US company. It is a challenging task to balance both office and the house work, especially because at times when I have to work after hours for conference calls with the foreign counterparts. Roshan is very understanding and supportive. When I get stressed out he makes sure to take me on a holiday. Also he hates to go for functions alone so I have to accompany him after work. Since this is the case I have acquired a new skill - I can dress up in a matter of minutes now! We both love doing household chores. So whenever we are together we attend to it and make it a fun thing to do together. He is very good with keeping the house neat and tidy.
The foodie
Roshan loves food. He has a special liking for the local dishes that his grandmother, his mother and my mother makes. My mother does the cooking at home most of the time and since we are all vegetarians we mostly enjoy home cooked food. So I make sure that when I get a chance to cook (mostly during weekends) I do some fusion cooking. I try out new things bringing together ingredients that you can never imagine could be put together. He really enjoys this. He likes the pastas I make and my Passion and Ginger Mocktail in particular. If we dine out it will be mostly Thai and Indian.
Most cherished quality
Roshans honesty and sincerity is what I value most about him. There is nothing about him I would want to change. I love him for who he is.
Travel companions
We both love traveling so whenever we get time off, we plan a vacation either overseas or in some place local. If we have any unplanned time off, we love spending time at home, just doing the housework, cooking and watching TV together. Our favourite vacation spots in Sri Lanka are Kandalama and Yala. If its overseas  Switzerland, Belgium and Australia.
Careerwise
We discuss each others work together. This helps both of us in making the right decisions in our careers. We have always respected each others opinions and we have taken decisions about our work together. Since our areas of expertise are different, we tend to look at things from different angles and often come to better conclusions together.
Scripting a role for Roshan
I wish Roshan to get a role that he has dreamed of portraying. That is a role of a person who would fight for others rights and is regarded as a superhero. Locally, it could be a military character. Since, he is a huge fan of Superman, I want to see him as Clark Kent but that is definitely at on an international scale.
Favourite role he has portrayed
My personal favourite is the movie Feel My Love. Roshans characters name is Roshan as well. I loved seeing Roshan being Roshan amid kids and doing what he does best - being sympathetic and helping others.
10 years from today
The situation would be just as it is today. We would grow old together, living a simple and happy life, enjoying each others company, travelling around the world and hopefully - being kids again with our kids!
Upcoming plans
Both of us had our life planned: the time to get married, travel destinations, building our nest, charity and everything happened just the way we planned  at the right time and in the right way. Next would be to have kids. Fingers crossed! Careerwise I am preparing for a new global ERP role out for my company.
This is very challenging. It has opened a new chapter in my career. Roshan is involved with two dramas these days.
They are both very different roles and people would love seeing him in playing those characters. He is also preparing for a drama which involves the Sri Lankan martial art form Angampora. Shooting will begin shortly. He has completed a movie, Harsha Udakandas Face to Face which is yet to be screened.

Roddick reflects on career spent in vacuum of Big Four
NEWPORT, Saturday - International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee Andy Roddick said on Saturday he was honoured to have played in the era of the Big Four, but also acknowledged that they caused him no end of frustration during his career.
Speaking in Newport, Rhode Island, where he was inducted with Belgian Kim Clijsters and Dutch Paralympic champion Monique Kalkman-van den Bosch, Roddick spoke about what it was like to compete with Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.
I can't believe the level of tennis that I got to see in my career, said the American former world number one.
The shots hit, the records that were broken, and the records that continue to be broken. Thanks to Murray, Novak, Roger and Rafa for playing the game at a higher level than it's ever been played.
It sucked being in your vacuum a lot of times. I still consider myself lucky. I got to guard Jordan, I went the distance with Ali, I pitched to Babe Ruth. I feel like I know what it must have been like to watch Picasso. I saw it all.
Roddick won his sole grand slam title at the 2003 U.S. Open, while he was a losing finalist four times  all against Federer, three times at Wimbledon and once at the U.S. Open. Perhaps the most memorable of those finals was the 2009 Wimbledon classic that Federer won 16-14 in the fifth set. Clijsters was inducted after capturing four grand slam titles during her career, three of which she claimed after coming out of retirement in 2009 following the birth of her daughter.
This is really special not just for me but for all of my family, she said as her husband and three children looked on.  AFP

Rural dairy farmers raise incomes through USAID
K. Mathanakumari, a single mother of three from Mullaitivu, faced many challenges to feed, clothe, and educate her children.
Despite her hard work trying to provide a better life for her family, Mathanakumari had difficulties gaining access to basic resources and techniques to improve production from her dairy farm.
In April 2015, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) selected Mathanakumari to join the Supporting Opportunities in Livelihoods Development (SOLID) project, which helped improve the quality and quantity of her cattle feed.
A year and a half later, her cultivation of more than two acres of sorghum and uninterrupted silage production have helped her feed nine cows and collect approximately 100 litres of milk daily.
As a result of Mathanakumaris success, this sole family breadwinner received an award as the best dairy farmer from Nestle Lanka PLC, a recognition bestowed by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena.
Mathanakumari is just one of more than 2,000 rural dairy farmers in 15 districts who have benefited from USAIDs SOLID project since 2013.
This week, USAID brought together SOLID partners from private and public dairy companies to review the projects successes. On average, beneficiary farms have increased monthly milk production by 27 percent and seen their incomes rise by 35 percent.The SOLID project has received strong support from Sri Lankas leading dairy companies, including Milco, Nestle Sri Lanka, CIC Dairies Pvt Ltd, and Pelwatte Dairy Industries.
The companies helped identify milk producers, organize workshops, and transport the farmers to attend SOLID programs. Local government officials also participated by convening and attending these events.
SOLID trained rural dairy farmers to produce high quality cattle feed year round; supplied equipment and material such as sorghum seeds, silage barrels, milk cans, grass cutters and choppers; constructed milk collection and chilling centers to facilitate regular milk collection; and strengthened market linkages with private sector companies.
We are happy to see Sri Lankan government authorities such as the Provincial Departments of Animal Production and Health using USAID-supported farms as models for hundreds of farmers from other regions, as well as students, to learn best practices, said David Dyer, USAID/SOLIDs Chief of Party. Seeing farmer-to-farmer learning take place will help ensure that SOLIDs training will reach many more households with the corresponding multiplier effects. USAID is the development agency of the U.S. Government, and has provided development and humanitarian assistance to developing countries worldwide for 50 years.
In Sri Lanka, the U.S. Government has provided over US$ 2 billion in aid since 1956.

Shoot drug traffickers if resist arrest: Indonesian President
The Indonesian Narcotics Agency recorded there are 6 million drug users in the archipelago out of its 255 million people, a situation the president labelled drug emergency.
INDONESIA: Indonesias President Joko Widodo has ordered the police to shoot drug traffickers who resist arrest in the latest effort to eradicate drug use in the country.
In a speech to one of Indonesias political parties late Friday, Widodo urged law enforcers to crackdown on drug dealers in Indonesia.
Be firm. Especially to foreign drug dealers who enter the country. If they resist even the slightest, just shoot them, Widodo said.
The Indonesian Narcotics Agency recorded there are 6 million drug users in the archipelago out of its 255 million people, a situation the president labelled drug emergency.
But Widodos remarks prompted criticism from human rights activists.
Andreas Harsono, Indonesias researcher from Human Rights Watch condemned the order. A president statement like that can seem like a green light to shoot without the correct procedure, Harsono told AFP Sunday, adding that law enforcers should be cautious and follow the law.
Indonesia imposes a tough punishment for drug trafficking, with smugglers who carry five or more grammes given the death penalty. In the last two years, it has executed about 18 drug traffickers, including foreigners such as Australian Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, which sparked diplomatic outrage and a call to abolish the death penalty.
Widodos comments came just a week after Indonesian police shot dead a suspected Taiwanese drug dealer who was caught with one tonne of crystal methamphetamine, but tried to escape. - AFP

Shrubsole stars as England edge India in Womens World Cup final
London: Anya Shrubsole bowled England to a dramatic nine-run win over India in the Womens World Cup final at Lords on Sunday.
India, set 229 to win, were well on course for victory at 191 for three in front of a full hose of more than 26,000.
But the dismissal of opener Punam Raut, who made a fine 86, lbw to Shrubsole, sparked a stunning collapse.
Shrubsole took five wickets for 11 runs in 19 deliveries as India, bidding for a first World Cup title on the ground where their mens side won an inaugural World Cup crown in 1983, slumped to 219 all out.
Pace bowler Shrubsole finished with stunning figures of six for 46 in 9.4 overs as England won a fourth World Cup title and third on home soil, by gaining revenge for their opening group stage loss to India.
Anya Shrubshole took a career best six wickets for 46 runs to bring about a remarkable turnaround for England in the Womens World Cup final against India at Lords on Sunday. AFP
Opener Smriti Mandhana -- who made 90 in that match -- was bowled for a duck by Shrubsole.
But fellow opener Raut hit Shrubsole back over her head for six.
Meanwhile India captain Mithali Raj, in what was, together with fellow 34-year-old Jhulan Goswami, likely to be her last chance to win a World Cup after being on the losing side in 2005, struck several fine boundaries.
But the all-time leading run-scorer in womens one-day internationals, effectively ran herself out for just 17.
Her exit brought in the big-hitting Harmanpreet Kaur, whose stunning 171 not out had set up Indias semi-final win over reigning champions Australia.
Kaur lofted and swept left-arm spinner Alex Hartley for two huge sixes.
Raut went to fifty in 78 balls and Kaur got there in 80 balls.
But the duo were separated when Kaur swept Harley straight to Tammy Beaumont at deep backward square to end a stand of 95.
Sarah Taylor, arguably the best wicket-keeper in the womens game, then missed a chance to stump Raut, on 65 off spinner Laura Marsh.
Another chance went begging when Veda Krishnamurthy (10) was dropped by England captain Heather Knight at extra cover off pace bowler Jenny Gunn.
Indias target was now under a run a ball and Veda Krishnamurthy raised a fifty stand with Raut off just 54 balls when she cut Shrubsole over point and drove her over mid-off for two fours in as many balls.
Rauts fine innings ended when she was lbw to Shrubsole, having faced 115 balls including four fours and a six.
It was the start of a cascade of wickets as panic set in.
Krishnamurthy made a fine 35 before she holed out off Shrubsole before Goswami was yorked by Shrubsole for a duck.
Shika Pandey was run out before Shrusbole, after Jenny Gunn had dropped a simple catch, ended the match by bowling Rajeshwari Gayakwad for a duck as England won yet another close game this World Cup.
Earlier pace bowler Goswami took three for 23 in 10 overs as India held England to 228 for seven.
Goswamis haul, which saw her take two wickets in two balls, included the dismissals of star batsman Taylor (45) and top-scorer Nat Sciver (51).
England started steadily after Knight won the toss.
But from 47 for none, they lost three wickets in quick succession to be 63 for three, with leg-spinner Poonam Yadav (two for 36) having Knight lbw for just one on the sweep.
Taylor and Sciver put on 83 before Goswami, the all-time leading wicket-taker in womens ODIs, struck in her second spell.
Taylor was caught down the legside by wicket-keeper Sushma Verma.
And 146 for four became 146 for five when Fran Wilson was lbw for a golden duck next ball.
But Englands tail, with Katherine Brunt making 34, took them past 200 and those runs proved vital in the end. AFP

SimpleCRM offers CRM software for finance, insurance businesses
Comprehensive and an affordable customer relationship management (CRM) software founded by a passionate and one of the most experienced CRM teams in Asia, SimpleCRM recently started delivering their solutions to Sri Lankan banking, financial services and insurance industry.
SimpleCRM aims to be the No. 1 CRM alternative to Salesforce.com or Microsoft CRM for the mid-enterprise and large enterprise market segments in the Asia Pacific, whilst helping the organizations to last longer with customer retention.
Owned by Simpleworks Business Solutions Pte Ltd, SimpleCRM is capable of managing the customer relationships better and is an enterprise grade, highly scalable, comprehensive and cost-effective CRM of choice for large enterprises in the Asian price-sensitive market.
Many renowned large organizations with thousands of CRM users are already using SimpleCRM software for managing their sales, digital marketing and customer support operations.
In Sri Lanka too, SimpleCRM is deployed at Union Assurance PLC and also as a pilot project at one of the largest banks in Sri Lanka. With an experience of delivering 300+ CRM projects over the last decade, SimpleCRM team is one of the most experienced CRM teams in Asia.
According to the SimplCRM officials, recent global economic conditions have brought dramatic impact to the banking, financial services and insurance industry and as a result a record shift in consumer behavior now demands a compensating shift in this sector.
Large financial write-downs, a much more volatile market and increased economic uncertainty have resulted in financial services companies being pushed to more conservative business principals and placing a greater focus on existing customer relationships.
On a parallel scale, the rise of consumer technologies such as mobile, social media and cloud have empowered consumers with on-demand information, real-time collaboration with other consumers and vetted customer opinions of financial services products, policy comparisons, service experiences and a host of factors which consumers use to determine what policy to purchase or where to put their money.
Officials from SimpleCRM added that todays customers of any product are readily sharing their bad experiences publicly and customers are switching their providers at a dramatically increased pace.
Therefore all financial services companies need to devise a strategy of their own which achieves increased efficiencies and greater customer focus and results in lower operating costs, better information, increased customer share and reduced customer agitation.
Under these circumstances companies need to switch to CRM systems to achieve these operational and information system requirements. Using CRM systems to consolidate multiple line of business information to achieve a holistic view of the customer's information, portfolio and household delivers insightful up-sell and cross-sell opportunities.
Further, when sales, marketing and customer support business processes are automated using CRM software, cycle times are dramatically lowered and user productivity increases.
Over the years with global demand it became increasingly clear that organizations in Asia require an enterprise grade CRM at a price point that factored in local economic realities. This led the team to launch SimpleCRM product specifically targeted towards Asian customers.

## Title: Snoring linked to Alzheimers

Snoring linked to Alzheimers
Difficulty breathing while asleep accelerates memory decline in people at-risk of the condition, a study found.Daytime sleepiness and sleep apnoea is also linked to impaired attention,memory and thinking in people who are genetically susceptible to the degenerative condition, the research adds.Researchers hope the findings will support sleep-based treatments in people at-risk of developing Alzheimers.
Study author Dr Susan Redline from Harvard University, said: Given the lack of effective treatment for Alzheimers disease, our results support the potential for sleep-disordered breathing screening and treatment as part of a strategy to reduce dementia risk.
How the study was carried out
Researchers from Harvard University analyzed 1,752 people with an average age of 68.
The studys participants took part in a sleep study, completed a sleep questionnaire and had their mental function assessed.So-called sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) was defined as having more than 15 stopped or shallow breaths per hour, as well as loud snoring.
Participants were diagnosed with sleep apnoea if they had more than five stopped or shallow breaths per hour, as well as self-reporting sleepiness. People were identified as being at-risk of Alzheimers if they carried a certain variation of a gene known as APOE, which carries cholesterol and supports brain injury repair in healthy people.
Previous studies have demonstrated one-fifth of the population who carry the APOE genetic variation are at an increased risk of Alzheimers disease.
Key findings
Results revealed that SDB is linked to mental decline when people are genetically at-risk of Alzheimers.
The findings also show that among such at-risk people, daytime sleepiness is linked with poor attention and memory, as well as slower thinking.Sleep apnoea is associated with impaired attention and thinking in those at-risk.
Apnoea is defined as the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relaxing and collapsing to cause an airway blockage for at least 10 seconds.The findings were published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society.
*Researchers hope the findings will support sleep treatments in people at-risk of Alzheimers *What the experts say *Study author Dr Dayna Johnson said: Individuals with SDB commonly report problems with cognition and may be at increased risk for dementia.Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent among elderly populations, and is associated with increased disability, neuropsychiatric symptoms and healthcare costs.
Our results suggest that more severe overnight hypoxemia and sleepiness may be related to poorer cognitive function, especially attention, concentration, and process speed in middle-aged to older adults, and that the risk is greater among carriers of APOE, a known risk factor for Alzheimers disease.
With use of this type of information, future risk stratification may help to identify individuals at increased risk for SDB-related cognitive deficits.
Dr Redline added: Our study provides further evidence that sleep-disordered breathing negatively affects attention, processing speed and memory, which are robust predictors of cognitive decline.Given the lack of effective treatment for Alzheimers disease, our results support the potential for sleep-disordered breathing screening and treatment as part of a strategy to reduce dementia risk. -Daily Mail
PAUSES IN SPEECH MAY INDICATE ALZHEIMERS
Pauses in speech and taking longer to talk may be early signs of mental decline, research revealed earlier this month.People with a family history of Alzheimers disease who are at-risk of developing the condition are less able to express their ideas and have reduced fluency when speaking, a study found.
They also use words such as it or they rather than specific names for things and speak in shorter sentences, the research adds.Julie Liss, a speech expert at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study, said: Those are all indicators of struggling with that computational load that the brain has to conductAround 47 million people worldwide have dementia, with Alzheimers disease being the most common form of the condition.

Northants opener Richard Levi smashed eight sixes as he made 88 from just 43 balls, but he had little support.
Northants were 107-1 at the midway point, but Sodhi (3-39) and Gurney (3-46) shone to restrict them to 195-8. Play stopped with Notts on 52-0 from 5.1 overs, giving them a 12-run win on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system. It is a second win in two days for Notts, who scored their highest ever T20 total in amassing 227-3 against Derbyshire on Friday. Northants remain second in the North Group but missed the chance to move top, as only England international Ben Duckett (28) really came close to backing up Levi with the bat.

Some notes on translation and on Madame Bovary
Not long ago, I was chatting with an older friend who is a retired engineer and also something of a writer, but not of fiction. When he heard that I had just finished a translation of Madame Bovary, he said something like, But Madame Bovary has already been translated. Why does there need to be another translation or But Madame Bovary has been available in English for a long time, hasnt it Why would you want to translate it again
Often, the idea that there can be a wide range of translations of one text doesnt occur to peopleor that a translation could be bad, very bad, and unfaithful to the original. Instead, a translation is a translationyou write the book again in English, on the basis of the French, a fairly standard procedure, and there it is, its been done and doesnt have to be done again.
Important landmark
A new book that is causing excitement internationally will be quickly translated into many languages, like the Jonathan Littell book that won the Prix Goncourt five years ago. It was soon translated into English, and if it isnt destined to endure as a piece of literature, it will probably never be translated into English again.
But in the case of a book that appeared more than one hundred and fifty years ago, like Madame Bovary, and that is an important landmark in the history of the novel, there is room for plenty of different English versions. For one thing, the first editions of the original text may have been faulty, and over the years one or more corrected editions have been published, so that the earliest English translations no longer match the most accurate original.
The earliest translators (as was the case with the Muirs rendering Kafka) may have felt they needed to inflict subtle or not so subtle alterations on the style and even the content of the original so as to make it more acceptable to the Anglophone audience; with the passing of time, we come to deem this something of a betrayal and ask for a more faithful version. Earlier versions may simply not be as good in other respects as they could belet another translator have a try. Each version will be quite distinct from all the others. How many ways, for instance, has even a single phrase (bouffes daffadissement) from Madame Bovary been translated:
gusts of revulsion
a kind of rancid staleness
stale gusts of dreariness
waves of nausea
fumes of nausea
flavorless, sickening gusts
stagnant dreariness
whiffs of sickliness
waves of nauseous disgust
Dante on translation
Nothing that is harmonized by the bond of the Muses can be changed from its own to another language without having all its sweetness destroyed. Every generation needs a new translation. Wise people like to say, every generation needs a new translation. It sounds good, but I believe it isnt necessarily so: If a translation is as fine as it can be, it may match the original in timelessness, tooit may deserve to endure. In fact, it may endure even if it is not all it should be in style and faithfulness. The C. K. Scott Moncrieff translation of most of Prousts In Search of Lost Time (which he called, to Prousts distress, Remembrance of Things Past) was written in an Edwardian English more dated than Prousts own prose, and it departed consistently from the French original. Yet it had such conviction, on its own terms, and was so well written, if you liked a certain florid style, that it prevailed without competition for eighty years. (There was also, of course, the problem of finding a single individual to do a new translation of a three-thousand-page bookan individual who wouldnt die before finishing it, as Scott Moncrieff had.) Even though a superlative translation can achieve timelessness, that doesnt mean other translators shouldnt attempt other versions. - Paris Review

Sri Lanka and Lebanon added the gloss to a flowless week of Davis Cup by BNP Paribas action in Colombo, defeating Qatar and Jordan respectively in Saturdays play-offs to earn promotion to Asia/Oceania Zone Group II for 2018.
Both nations went undefeated throughout the week at the Asia/Oceania Zone Group III event, with hosts Sri Lanka defeating Qatar 2-0 to make an immediate return to Group II and Lebanon defeating Jordan the same scoreline to return to Group II after a two-year abscence.
Sri Lankas promotion which comes a year after they suffered relegation to the Davis Cups fourth tier at the hands of Indonesia was sealed when Sharmal Dissanayake defeated Mubarak Shannan Zayid 6/4, 6/3 after Harshana Godamannas earlier victory over Mousa Shanan Zayed.
It was just a second singles victory this week for Dissanayake, but one that at the perfect time, with Godamanna taking the starring tole for Sri Lanka this week. In his 50th Davis Cup tie for his nation, he won his fourth singles tie of the week, improving his record in singles in the international team competition to a remarkable 43-15.
Lebanon triumph was equally authoritative with Hady Habib thumping Hamzeh Al-Aswad 6/2, 6/0 in the opening rubber for his 11th straight Davis Cup singles victory before Giovani Samaha sealed the triumph with a 6/4, 3/6, 6/2 over Mousa Alkotop in two hours ans 26 minutes.

Sri Lanka moves to generate electricity from garbage
The government is set to initiate three projects in the Western Province next month to generate electricity using municipal solid waste.
The initiative forms the basis of measures to find a permanent solution to the festering garbage crisis in urban areas.
President Maithiripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe spearheaded the move to find permanent solutions to the existing issue surrounding garbage.
As a result, President Sirisena appointed a three member task force, headed by Ministers Champika Ranawaka, Faiszer Musthapha and Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya to pilot the project in the Western Province and specifically Colombo.
With international support, with the use of latest technology, we will solve this crisis so that it will no longer a problem for any future leader or a government.
Today, we see protests, but no one offers solutions, President Sirisena said at a function held during the weekend.
He added that he was monitoring progress every two weeks of a committee to deal with the problem of garbage disposal. No previous government had given such priority to this issue, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who addressed UNP officials who helped his political career which began from the Biyagama electorate 40 years ago, spoke of the waste disposal crisis and the governments initiative to resolve it.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the government has found permanent solutions to the piling garbage crisis that remained unresolved by successive governments for decades.
We will start three projects next month in the Western Province to generate electricity using garbage,the minister said while launching a 30-million rupee railway square in Ella over the weekend.
He said the previous administration boasted that it deployed the army and did not allow even a toffee wrapper to be dropped in the city of Colombo. However, the reality was that they haphazardly dumped garbage at Meethotamulla leading to the April tragedy when nearly 40 people died after a mountain of rubbish collapsed on them.
The minister said unlike the previous government, the new administration did not deploy troops to clear the garbage that had piled up in the city, but the municipal sanitary workers had been used for the job.
We no longer pile up garbage. Out of the 700 tonnes of garbage generated in Colombo, 300 tonnes are being turned into compost. Another 100 tonnes is being recycled.
We are going to improve this even further. To permanently solve the garbage crisis in the country, we are building a sanitary landfill in Aruwakkalu (in Puttalam district), the minister said.

Two suspects arrested
A Police officer, escorting Jaffna High Court Judge M. Ilancheliyan, critically injured in Saturdays shooting in Nallur when an unidentified man opened fire, passed away yesterday at the Jaffna hospital.
Meanwhile, Jaffna Police have arrested two suspects in connection to the shooting of the Policeman in Nallur.
The Policeman had been escorting Jaffna High Court Judge M.Ilancheliyan, who is currently presiding over the Sivaloganathan Vidya case at the time of the incident.
According to Police Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara the arrested suspects are said to be the brother and a relative of the main suspect who is currently on the run.
While the shooting was initially suspected to have been aimed at Judge Ilancheliyan, Gunasekera yesterday said the presence of the Judge and the ensuing shooting was a coincidence and not a planned assassination attempt.
According to Gunasekera a fracas between several people on the road in the vicinity of the Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil had obstructed the road when the Policeman escorting the Judge had attempted to resolve the issue.
It was then that the suspect involved in the dispute who is also said to have been intoxicated during the time had shot the Policeman, Gunasekera said. The suspect had grabbed the Policemans revolver and had used it to shoot him. A second Policeman who was in the car and the Judge had got down from the vehicle when the shooting occurred. The other Policeman too had exchanged fire with the suspect who had later fled on a stolen motorbike, the Police Spokesperson said.
The second policeman too is receiving treatment at the hospital for injuries sustained during the shootout.
According to Police sources, the suspect had discharged the weapon around 11 times putting Judge Ilancheliyan in an extremely dangerous situation.
Ilancheliyan is part of the three member bench presiding over the controversial case regarding the rape and eventual murder of Jaffna school girl Vidya Sivayoganathan.
Both injured Police officers were immediately admitted to the Jaffna Hospital while one, 57 year old Police Sergeant Sarath Premachandra who was allegedly shot in the stomach later succumbed yesterday. Several Police teams are conducting further investigations into the incident.

War against dengue
A nationwide campaign involving tens of thousands of volunteers and security personnel will be launched this week placing the battle against dengue on a war-footing to destroy mosquito breeding grounds in schools.
A four-day intensive clean-up drive will be initiated from Friday when students, parents, teachers and well-wishers will be invited to participate along with health officials and thousands of troops and police, education ministry officials said. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed his officials to issue a circular to formally inform all schools about the coordinated effort to ensure that there is no room for mosquito breeding in schools.
Protecting our children from the dengue epidemic is a responsibility of all of us, Minister Kariyawasam said.
No other government has given such priority to tackle the dengue issue,Kariyawasam said.
The government has given the highest priority to battling the spread of dengue which has claimed some 290 lives so far this year and infected over 100,000 people, according to official figures.
Nearly half of all dengue cases have been reported from the Western province, the Minister said.
The Health Ministry is also assisting the unprecedented clean-up campaign in schools and asked principals to coordinate with local health authorities for arranging fumigation and other technical help.
President Maitrhripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne spoke over the weekend of the need for concerted action to contain dengue which spread more rapidly this year due to the twin effects of the garbage crisis and floods.
Education Ministry officials said there will be no teaching on Friday, but students could turn up in appropriate clothing to join the clean-up effort that will be supervised and guided by health authorities.
From the beginning of this month, thousands of soldiers, airmen and sailors have supported public health inspectors in a house-to-house campaign to identify mosquito breeding areas and take corrective action.
Army Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne said the military had been deployed initially for a three month period to assist the dengue prevention work carried out in line with the advise of the Presidential Task Force on Dengue Control.
Surprise inspection of several schools, including so called prestigious colleges, showed a shocking level mosquito larvae in their compounds and haphazard disposal of rubbish undermining the health of students.

## Title: What does Jane Austen mean to you

What does Jane Austen mean to you
I came late to Jane Austen. She was not on my O level or A level list in the 1950s, nor, as I remember, was she at all promoted by Mr Tillotson, the English Master (in every other respect a remarkable teacher).
I read widely in the school and town libraries but  no Jane Austen. By the time I got to university my reading outside the curriculum was extensive but basically the Russian novelists, the American, French, Irish novelists, and as many comic novels as I could get my hands on, coupled with a conscientious desire to read English  the Bronts, Fielding, George Eliot and Poets. Still no Jane Austen. I read History at university and in those days the perhaps rather sniffy History tutors said that English was something you read for yourself, not for a degree.
The woman who became my first wife lodged with Professor Peter Strawson, and it was he who took me firmly by the hand and led me to the six books which a Philosopher colleague of his thought were the only works of English fiction worth reading.
I suppose I may have dodged or ducked Jane Austen for what now seem to be silly or spurious class reasons or a foolish and mistaken notion of what she might be like. Certainly if I had any thoughts back then up to the age of twenty-one, it would be that  compared with D. H. Lawrence and Thomas Hardy and Thomas Mann . . .
But then I got hooked and have stayed hooked. Sometimes she is so good its unbearable and I have to put the book down for a while. The older I got and the better reader I became, and the more I get from her. And she just gets better! Television adaptations have led her to mass audiences and she has thrived there as well. She is incomparable.
PAULA BYRNE
Im not ashamed to admit that Jane Austens novels are my comfort read. After years of Austen scholarship, poring over every perfectly balanced sentence, decoding hidden meanings, trying to filter her sinuous use of free indirect discourse (just where does it begin in Emma), I now read her for pure pleasure. I understand why so many soldiers (including A. A. Milne) read her in the trenches. Think of a sentence like this: Elinor agreed with it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition. Or Catherine Morland: I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible. Or this gem: Really, Mr. Collins, cried Elizabeth with some warmth, you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one.
Austen achieves effortlessly the most difficult thing a writer can do  she makes her reader laugh out loud. But Walter Scott said it best: That young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with . . . . What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!
AMIT CHAUDHURI
Its astonishing how much writers owe to Jane Austen. Most love her, and rush to claim her, and even the few who dont (principally because theyre ignorant of her work) have to admit shes been important to them in some way. I belong to the second category. It was my search for an alternative to Austen that took me, eventually, to a way of writing about the world and place that I found in D. H. Lawrences Sons and Lovers. My avoidance of Austen came not from an enlightened critique of her work, but strategic disengagement; this disengagement was as important to me as embracing Sons and Lovers would be later. Austen portrayed a kind of provincial English life which I neither had a place in nor recognized. Her drawing room and its conversations denoted an interiority in which I felt unwelcome: not just because I am Indian, but because of the peculiarities of my temperament. At the Morels, I felt at home  not because Id grown up in such a home in Bombay, but because, in the way the smell of linen being ironed or the sound of Walter Morels whistling drifted from room to room, I was reminded, subconsciously, of my uncles house in Calcutta. Provincial modernity brought me joy: it was one of the things Lawrence helped me understand. Austen helped me, too, because her notion of the province was so powerfully different.
LYDIA DAVIS
I can follow with pleasure the shifting relations between Darcy and Elizabeth, so masterfully manipulated, and relish Darcys ultimate capitulation, as though it might not have happened this time around. And I can more generally appreciate Austens nuanced social satire, sly digs, perfect timing, broad comedy and outrageous characters. But perhaps I chafe within the necessarily tight parameters of an Austen novel, its domestic settings and familiar imagery, or perhaps the central preoccupations of the plot do not strongly engage me  in any case, I do not come away from reading her with the same exhilaration as I do from other superb books. This exhilaration may come from various sources  among them a delight in the density or distinctness of the authors language, or the sense that I have been transported into a world that mirrors some recognizable reality but is so strange it verges on dream. Recent deeply satisfying reading experiences, for instance, have been Malcolm Lowrys Under the Volcano, with its haunting descriptions of an intolerably extended impending storm or a caged eagle or a drunken solitary Ferris wheel ride; Regina Ullmanns stories, recently published in English, with their eccentric, lost characters; a uncanny love story of 1930s New York City by Millen Brand, The Outward Room; and, to shift into non-fiction, the rural life, human and animal, of nineteenth-century England described in such loving detail, with such compassion and crystalline clarity by W. H. Hudson in A Shepherds Life.
GEOFF DYER
We did Emma for A Level, so it was one of the first serious novels I ever read. In a sense, then, Jane Austen is literature to me. She was not just one of the first novelists I read but also the oldest, i.e. earliest. You can start further back, of course, but romping through Tom Jones feels like a bit of a waste of olde time in the way that Persuasion never does. I associate reading Austen with a consciousness of the gap between my limited life experience  swilling beer, basically  and the expanded grasp of the psychological subtleties and nuances of situations and relationships that her books gradually revealed. But Im conscious also of a different kind of gap: that between the riches afforded by the novels and the tedium of the criticism served up alongside them. Macmillan Casebooks  anthologies of critical essays  were the default educational tools even though most of the pieces in the one on Emma are complete dross. The process whereby doing English morphed into doing criticism began with Austen and continued all the way through university. - Times Literary Supplement

World Cup was a learning curve for us
Sri Lanka may have won only one match out of seven at the ICC Womens World Cup in England, but coach Hemantha Devapriya believes the experience of playing against the top seven countries in the world was certainly a learning curve for the future.
Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in their final league match to return home with a win, but according to Devapriya they came quite close to winning against West Indies and India if not for the middle order batting and fielding.
Sri Lanka lost to India by 16 runs after chasing 233 and to West Indies by 47 runs chasing 230.
Overall I am happy with their performance but we could have done a little better if our middle order batting and fielding came up to their capabilities, said Devapriya. Citing the positives that Sri Lanka took from the tournament Devapriya said, We were struggling to put 200 plus runs on the board and only two players had strike rates of over 50  Chamari Atapattu and Eshani Lokusuriyage. However if you see during the tournament we crossed the 200-run mark on four occasions and the girls have shown improvement in their strike rates. Some batters strike rates have gone up to 85-90 and that is a good indication. We did practice a lot of variation range of shots and I can see that they are now capable of using those shots. We are concentrating now on taking more singles because the confidence is not there. We have given them a lot of singles targets which quietly they are improving but still we are not upto international standards like other teams. Placing the ball and working with soft hands those are the areas we are working on, he said.
The tournament enabled our players to really see the standards of the other teams. Its a big demand for them to work hard and get into that level within a very short time. They have been talking to players from other teams and they know the areas they have to work on and they are ready to learn. Its a matter of working hard, creating motivation and setting up goals and achieving them.
Devapriya said that the fear of facing fast bowling was no more there as the tournament proved.
Chamari Atapattu was Sri Lankas stand out player with a stupendous knock of 178 against defending champions Australia. She had an aggregate of 311 runs and a strike rate of 89 and in the bowling new ball bowlers Sripali Weerakkody (8 wickets) and Ama Kanchana (7 wickets) stood out. We worked a lot on playing off the back foot and how to use the pace of the ball especially the flat bat shot and the sweep shot and inside out shots. The players are now taking calculated risks and playing those shots little by little. They have to gain confidence to play these shots, said Devapriya. We noticed that against sides like Australia, England, India and New Zealand very hardly do you get a loose ball. They are accurate and they are well ahead in the practical and mental game. Technically we dont have powerful bodies we have to put the players through special exercises to get more power into their shots and bowling. Fielding is coupled with fitness. The players now have a better understanding of what is required of them to become better cricketers. Devapriya, a former Sri Lanka batsman/wicket-keeper of the pre-Test era said what Sri Lanka Womens cricket needed at this stage is to strengthen their second string and provide a feeder to the first team.
If you notice our present side has aging players. India has several players who played in the last World Cup because they introduced them as youngsters. Now they are with a lot of experience behind them and their mental and tactical game is streets ahead of us. India has developed fast they were a little ahead of us when we played them in the last World Cup. But now for us to get there its going to take some time, said Devapriya.
Sri Lanka Cricket in the recent past has introduced an under 23 tournament. There was no tournament like that before. The selectors picked 60 players from the tournament called the development squad and after further trials pruned it down to 30. Of that we are hoping to get at least another 5-6 players and from the emerging squad a further 4-5 players. Well have to work closely with them and see how they can fit into the national squad.
What is encouraging is that leading girls schools have now taken upto cricket. At the moment we have about 2500 girls playing and Sri Lanka Cricket is working hard to promote the game. If all goes well we might see some good players coming through the schools, he said. Sri Lanka Women are next scheduled to tour the Caribbean for a series of five ODIs in October. The tour has yet to be finalized among the two cricket boards.

Baa Baa Land: the dullest film ever made
This really could be the dullest film ever made - and the people behind it couldnt be happier.
Baa Baa Land is an epic eight-hour, slow motion film about sheep. Yes, you read that correctly - its a film, with absolutely no dialogue, about sheep. Baa Baa Land features no actors, talking and doesnt even have a plotline to keep audiences hooked.
And the unconventional stars of this epic are nothing more than a flock of sheep.
Baa Baa Land even bills itself as the dullest film ever made and consists entirely of slow motion shots of sheep in a field. The film was shot in Essex and was produced by the founders of a digital meditation app, Calm. It is the latest example of the niche genre known as slow cinema, which is known for long takes and having little or no dialogue narrative.
In 2015, the BBC Four television channel broadcast, All Aboard! The Sleigh Ride, a two-hour, dialogue-free film, showing reindeer pulling a sleigh used by indigenous peoples in Northern Norway, shot from the view of the driver.
Baa Baa Land is scheduled to premiere on an as-yet unannounced date in September at Londons Prince Charles Cinema.

E signature to see light of day soon
The much awaited and the long overdue E signature for Custom clearing and container scanning would be up and running by the end of the year assured the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs, Chulananda De Silva.
Speaking at the 82nd Annual General meeting of the Import Sector of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce he said that it was some last minute legislature that held these two back.
The director general said he was very pleased to finally be able to launch the online payment platform last week and this would enable the department to move soon to a paperless clearing process soon. He however said he is yet to create a good, polite and pleasant working culture at the Customs Department for the customers and he is working towards this as well.
Outgoing Chairman, Dinesh de Silva said that the Chamber was fighting with the authorities for a long time to create a conducive environment for the private sector in the industry mainly in two areas.
Firstly, to have the proper required legislation in place to suit the modern day business like the enactment of the new Customs Law, Import and Export Control Act, Exchange Control Act, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act and the full implementation of the Electronic Transaction Act. Secondly, we want to maintain consistency in all International Trade related polices which will build confidence and predictability in making business decisions and operations.
With these two main enablers the countrys international trade will grow beyond doubt. These initiatives will directly help Sri Lankas global ranking in terms of business efficiency and Ease of Doing Business Index. This needs urgent attentions by the authorities as Sri Lanka needs to move up from the low ranking.
Currently in Ease of Doing Business Ranking among 190 economies in from being in the 85th position in 2013, the position has deteriorated to, in 2014-113, in 2015-109 and in 2016 to 110th position losing 25 places in the process, he cautioned.
Between 2014 and 2016, the countrys global ranking in terms of business efficiency, transparency of border administration, measured by the Global Trade Enabling Index, went down by 10 places from 87th to 97th out of 136 countries. Sri Lanka lags behind Thailand (44th) India (75th) and Vietnam (86th).
In Doing Business Index 2017 of the World Bank, it takes 76 hours on average to comply with export documentary requirements in Sri Lanka compared to 11 hours in Thailand, 38 hours in India and 50 hours in Vietnam.
Meanwhile the incoming Chairman of Import Section, Nishan Nanayakkara urged the government to expedite some of the long outstanding bottlenecks enabling the trade to benefit in terms of cost saving and time. We must also thank authorities for launching the on-line payment platform to felicitate real time payment to customers.
In addition involvement in the Trade Facilitation Agreements and the drafting of the new customs ordinance, addressing the negative impact on the local industry with the proposed tariff liberalization through FTAs, taking up concerns of the industry with the authorities at the highest level against arbitrary charges that affect the trade including attempts to re-introduce THC by parties with vested interests, will be a few of the focused areas of the import section in future, he added.

AIA plants saplings as part of their Go Green initiative
AIA employees joined hands with non-profit organisation ReForest Sri Lanka and the Athuraliya Divisional Secretariat, in an initiative to expand forest coverage in Sri Lanka. AIA donated 2000 kumbuk saplings, which volunteers from AIA head office and branch offices planted along the Nilwala riverbank, as part of AIAs Go-Green 2017 project.
Notably, trees reduce the risk of flooding during heavy rains, by acting as a barrier to floodwater and reducing sediment going into rivers while increasing water absorption to the ground. This area in Matara was submerged during the recent floods and badly in need of a re-planting effort to help mitigate similar situations in future.

[APPRECIATIONS - (24-07-2017)]
A. A. Latiff
A forthright individual
The 24th death anniversary of senior journalist A.A. Latiff fell on the first day of the holy month of Ramazan. Abuthalib Abdul Latiff, passed away in 1993 on the first day of the Ramadan. His death occurred a few months after his retirement as an Information officer at the USSR embassy in Colombo. A leading journalist, author and teacher, he was well known for his forthright and forward thinking views on matters relating to social and religious reform.
A. A. Latiff was born to an illustrious family from Matale. His father was Naina Mohamed Abuthalib Lebbe, and his mother was Mabokke Muhandiram Walauvvage Uduma Lebbe Marrikar Saida Umma. Her ancestors had served as Headmen under Sinhala Kings.
Latiff had his primary education at Vijaya College Matale when V.T. Nanayakkara was its Principal, and pursued his secondary education at Zahira College Colombo under T.B. Jayah. He also attended Zahira College, Matale. Both, Nanayakkara and Jayah, were leading educationists and politicians of their time and served as Members of Parliament. At Vijaya and Zahira
Colombo, Latiff came under the inspirational influence of Nanayyakkara and Jayah. He edited the Silver Jubilee edition of Az Zahira, the official magazine of Colombo Zahira.
Regrettably, the sudden death of his father caused Latiff to cut short his further education, and to take to the teaching profession. Jayah had visited his home to try and persuade him to continue with his education.
He began his career as an English teacher at Madawala Muslim Vidyalaya and later joined the teaching staff at Zahira College, Matale. Latiff did not limit his activities to teaching and soon became involved in social service activities.
He was the General Secretary of the YMMA-Matale and of the Matale Study Circle, the latter a socio-cultural organisation, comprising educated personalities from all communities. He was also involved in activities for the upliftment of the estate labour community.
In 1961, he left government service to join the Chinese Embassy in Colombo as a Press Officer. Two years later, he joined the Novosti News Agency of the USSR Embassy.
A long standing and leading member of the Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organisation and Ceylon Peace Council, he and Jaya Pathirana attended the Cairo conference which gathered to discuss the issue of Bangladesh.
For many years, he edited the Communist Party journal Desabimani and acted as contributing editor of the partys English journal Forward, which was edited by Pieter and Maude Keuneman. Latiff did not see a contradiction between Islam and socialism. He believed in their egalitarian philosophy.
In the 1960s, he published and edited the Islamic news weekly Insan, which was enormously popular among the Tamil-speaking population. Several budding writers and poets found their feet and established their literary reputations through Insan, which gave them the space and the opportunity to do so.
He wrote a regular column for the Tamil daily Thinakaran under the name Ram-Raheem, which attracted a wide readership. Equally fluent and facile in English and Tamil, his short stories, poems and other writings have been published in many journals. DRCA Goonetilleke, in Sri Lankan English Literature and the Sri Lankan people 1912-2003 reproduced Latiffs poem Dreams are Dying describing it as a cry from the heart, adding: Latiff is just in bringing out the sheer tragedy of the (ethnic) conflict, the sheer pity of it.
Through his writings, both in English and Tamil, Latiff popularised the works of the great subcontinental poets Allama Iqbal, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, also translating them into Tamil. In his writings, he condemned religious bigotry and hypocrisy in the strongest terms.
Latiff contributed in no small measure to the debate on Muslim personal law reform in the late 1980s, when he stood up in support of granting equal status to Muslim women, arguing against fundamentalists resistance to womens equality, emancipation and rights.
A deep thinker, he was widely read and many sought his wise counsel on matters relating to politics and current affairs. The late M.H.M. Ashraf approached him with a request to join his party, promising him an important position within the hierarchy. Not given to seeking office, he declined. He was opposed in principle to the formation of a party along ethnic lines.
When Al Haj A.H.M. Azwer was the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, he was honoured by President D.B. Wijetunge for his contribution towards Islam and peace.
When A.C.S. Hameed took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs during President J.R. Jayewardenes tenure, Latiff was offered to become Sri Lankas envoy to the USSR, but he politely turned down the request.
He attended international conferences on world peace at Aden-South Yemen and Moscow. In late 1980s, he was honoured by the Soviet Parliament by awarding Order of MeritLenin Prize for his services for world peace.
One a personal level, he remained a sincere teacher and advisor for several years until his death.
His visits to Matale were occasions for his friends and acquaintances to gather at his place to discuss current issues till late at night. Several politicians, cultural activists and youth leaders paid their last respects before his janaza left to Matale for burial. At the Janaza ceremony, the late Foreign Minister A.C.S. Hameed said: His demise is a great loss for the community and country.
May Allah reward him with Jennathul Firdous.

Gamini Gunawardena
He had a good heart
I learnt with sadness that Gamini Gunawardena had passed away in London. Gamini was a distinguished old boy of St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. He was a larger-than-life character and had a great sense of humourI always remember his stories and his hearty laugh. My earliest memories of Gamini were at St.
Thomas College, Mount Lavinia, near the Wardens office where Gamini would hold Court with his friends all around him! He was the life and soul of St. Thomas! He really loved his alma mater. I regret that I lost touch with Gamini during recent years.
Gaminis father, Patrick Gunawardena, was a wonderful educationist, he was Sub-Warden at St. Thomas College when I was in school and we held him with the utmost respect.
He sent me a wonderful letter before he passed away. Gamini and I came up with an idea to honour him as he was such a powerful force for good in the field of education in Sri Lankahe was so humble and unassuming, he had a heart for the vulnerable. So we organised the Patrick Gunawardena Awards in the Palace of Westminster in the presence of Members of Parliament from the House of Commons, peers from the House of Lords and CEOs of British charities.
The awards created history when MP Linda Perham mentioned them in the chamber of the House of Commons in a debatea huge honour remembering Patrick GunawardenaGamini was humbled by it.
Gamini was President of the Old Thomians Association in the United Kingdom in 2010. He raised funds for the College, organised dinner dances in London and was in the thick of it and he loved it! During his tenure as President, a cricket match was organised by Gamini and the Old Boys and the Oxford University Sri Lanka Society and the match was played at Oxford.
I must confess I had some fun with Gamini back in 1997. Gamini was in the Old Thomians cricket team and I used to tease him saying: Gamini and his donkey drops! Gamini was a really good spinner and back in 1997. I wrote an article about him routing the Old Royalists in the traditional Old Royalists vs Old Thomians match in Londonit was published in the
Daily News in Sri LankaGamini hit the headlines on the sports pages. On one side was the headline on Sanath Jayasuriya hitting 340 runs against India in Colombo and then the adjoining article was Gamini Gunawardena sinks the Old Royalists! He burst into laughter when he saw my article which was also reproduced in the Old Thomians Magazine in the U.K.
I will always remember something deeply illuminating about Gamini. He really had a good heart. When he heard that my father Vernon Corea had died in September, 2002, he was one of the first to arrive at my sisters home in New Malden. The funeral service was held at Emmanuel Church in Wimbledon VillageGamini had gathered together a group of Old Thomians to attend the funeralout of the kindness of his heart.
He had organized the ushers, made sure the food was on the tables at the church and oversaw the pall bearers at the funeral. He was capable of such kindness and compassionhe wanted to support his friend in his hour of need.
Gamini had a deep and abiding faith in God. We had some deep conversations at times and he even went with me to a Benny Hinn Crusade held at the Excel Centre in London Docklands, many years ago, as he was interested in the area of healing.
His remains will be flown back to Colombo and to his roots in Gampaha. I know that Old Thomians will be there to remember Gamini. May his soul Rest In Peace, in the arms of Jesus.

Ranjith Samarasekera
A modest man
During the memorial service in honour of the departed Ranjith Samarasekera at St. Theresas Church, my mind went back to the period that I first spotted Ranjith, but did not meet him.
I was a young teenager among the throng of spectators watching the Annual Public Schools Championships the blue ribband of schools athletics. That was possibly in 1955or 1956.
Ranjith, fair, good-looking and seemingly modest, was an excellent javelin-thrower who won the event. It instantly enhanced his image. In the old days, to be a champion at the pubs was some achievement.
I also recall that Anandian Sarath Wijesinghe, won both the other throwing eventsthe discus throw and the shot-putt, at that meet. I never imagined that both, Ranjith and Sarath, would be my friends someday. Fate was kind, but also inscrutable. Alas! both, Sarath and Ranjith are dead now.
Ranjith, like several others of those mellifluous post-independent years, was a true representative of that era. He was an embodiment of dignity and decency.
Years later, at the Colombo Colts Cricket Club, where we first met as comparatively young men, he showed total commitment, first as a player, secondly as a coach and finally, as an ExCo member, Vice Patron and Patron.
Colombo Colts owes its gratitude to some of its senior members like Ranjith, for their varied services which over the decades had helped to make that 144-year-old Institution a key component of cricket development in this Island.
How do individuals break out of the ranks of the average and emerge into limelight There are some basic and early inputs of character building. Among elements of a good upbringing are the home, school and the society you move in.
St. Anthonys College, Kandy, which produced Ranjith, is a front-ranked educational institution. If we consider the sports arena during the years, Ranjith studied at St. Anthonys College, Kandy. It was the leading educational institution in Kandy, in athletics and cricket, surpassing the other great Kandy school; Trinity College.
Let me justify the above. Even before Independence, the pubs was dominated by Royal, St. Thomas and St. Josephs. In the mid 1950s, St. Anthonys Kandy broke through the shackles of the virtual domination of such schools to grab at least a part of the limelight at this prestigious meet. St. Anthonys went on to produce champion athletes S. B. Miyanadeniya, Ivan Boteiju, Jeeva Weerasinghe, R. A. F. Perera, besides Ranjith Samarasekera and others, to project the schools prowess in the sport. In Cricket, also during that era, St. Anthonys had some excellent cricketers, which made it a force to reckoned with.
When penning this appreciation, I need to mention a distinguished old Antonian who provided me with valuable insights into his old school.
He is Dr. Janaka Goonetilleke, whom I met for the first time at Colombo Colts in the early 1970s. He was then a young doctor. He vanished from our sight and reappeared after nearly three decades, publicly, in Colombo, with an excellent book on the history of Atapattu Walawwa, the 260-year-old mansion in Galle, which his wife inherited. The media praised the book.
It was Janaka, now a retired specialist of the British Medical Service, who revealed, among other facts, how the great Antonian Cricketer A. C. M. Lafir, was discovered. It was Janakas maternal uncle, the notable Cricket Coach John Halangoda, who had identified early, the prodigious natural talent of the greatest of all Antonian cricketers of the 1950s.
Before I conclude this appreciation, which hopefully gives an insight into the varied characteristics of the good citizen and sports personality Ranjit Samarasekera, I need to mention one other fact. This relates to the intermittent interaction he and I had in yet another vital fieldTrade and Commerce, particularly during the long years I served at a leading Chamber of Commerce, then located in Fort.
Our exchanges principally revealed yet another aspect of his personalityhe was patient and calm and he knew his limits in the field of shipping and freight forwarding a highly competitive sphere in which he was engaged in.
May Ranjith rest in peace.

Jehan K. Cassim
A true gentleman
After attending a glittering wedding ceremony of my niece Huda, in the banquet hall on Nugget Avenue, Scarborough, Ontario, I was not so destined to receive a joyous message, but it was a grim and gloomy SMS from my good friend and former Mayor of Colombo Omar Kamil, of the news of the demise of Alhaj Jehan K. Cassim. This made me feel profound sorrow.
It was quite recently that I visited Jehan with my good friend and former President of the Sri Lanka football federation F.A. Yassin, another intimate friend of Jehan, at his residence down Lake Drive in Rajagiriya. He was, for a long period of time, bed-ridden and showed no sign of recovery, although his beloved wife was meticulously attending to his medical care.
I came to know Jehan about fifty years ago, in the company of some great Muslim leaders at that time at the All-Ceylon Muslim League. His father Kamar Cassim and uncle Senator Shums Cassim, were close associates of Doctor T.B. Jayah, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Alhaj Falil, A Caffoor, Jabir A . Cader, M.A.C.M. Salehstalwarts of the Muslim factor in the independence movement. Jehan very ardently followed the footsteps of his elders. He was a compelling follower of the Muslim League leadership in all social, religious and political spheres, which inspired Jehan in later life to propel himself up as an ardent worker in the cause of Sri Lankan Muslims, and made him one of the most likable and lovable personalities in the society.
Jehan always stood for national unity and amity among all sections of the people. Not only did he build up a sense of great brotherhood with the learned Ulemas of Bahjatul Ibrahimiya, a seat of higher Islamic learning in the South (Fort-Galle)the place where even Mamoon Abdul Gayoom graduated in Arabicbut also established a close rapport and bondage of friendship with all the Sinhala leadership including learned Buddhist clergy, like Ven. Elle Gunawanse Thera and leaders of other religious communities. He was a true protagonist of reconciliation and a bridge builder of peace and unity. Following the principles and philosophy of the great national leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah, he always persisted for a united Sri Lanka, which consists of the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malays, Memons, Borahs etc. The like of whom we are so sorely missing amidst us in the present context of time.
Jehan dedicatedly and devotedly, threw his lot with President Premadasa, and was a tower of strength to the President in his forward march of development; he gave immense support to President Premadasa in all Gam Udawa programme, joining hands with his erstwhile friend B. Sirisena Cooray to make the Gum Udawa concept work successfully.
Jehan, indeed, followed Sirisena as the Chairman of the newly created Common Amenities Board and performed a remarkable job in the clearance of Shanties and helped to improve essential service to the downtrodden people living in
muddukkus, in the city of Colombo.
The success story of Jehan followed through and through and saw him appointed as the Chairman of the premier banking sectorThe Bank Of Ceylon. The international Muslim factor also drew the attention of Jehan. He backed me to the hilt when ever I approached President Premadasa to close the Israeli Interest Section working in this country at that time. Jehan was the happiest man when Premadasa declared that all inimical forces to the interest of Sri Lankan Muslim population would be closed down. His happiness saw no bounds when Premadasa told a U.S. emissary visiting
Sucharita, to change the Sri Lankan leaders mind, his residents at Keselwatte that there are no Zionists but only Muslim voters in Sri Lanka.
Jehan was also an encouraging factor in the establishment of the Ahadiya school at the Sucharita Hall parallel with the Budhhist Daham Pasala. Jehan further enamoured us to encourage the President in the establishment of a Fund for Muslim widows with Sheriffdeen (later Ambassador to Kuwait), as its secretary. In the many phases of my political career, Jehan was always kindling in me a passion to promote better ideas in the social welfare activities. I still remember with nostalgic memory that whenever I concluded my interpretations of President Premadasas on public platforms, I would always encounter the countenance of the gleaming face of Jehan, patting me on my back: Well done, Azwer!
Jehan possessed superlative qualities with which one could attribute in lifehe was soft-spoken, polite, kindhearted, forthright, humble, trustworthy, dedicated and utterly devoted to the task assigned to him. He was an utmost patriot who loved his country dearly with gleaming pride and honour. In all sense of the words, he was a true gentleman that I had come across in public life, whose memory would always sway us into action.
May Almighty Allah (SWT) grant him the highest felicity in Jannatul Firdous!
A.H.M. Azwer,
Former MP/Minister,General Secretary,Sri Lanka MuslimProgressive Front,Toronto, Ontario
Janappriya Ratnayake
He stayed true to his name
My first encounter with Janappriya was half a century ago in 1967, when he came as a young Trainee Assistant Superintendent to Madampe Group, Rakwana. Thereafter, much water has flowed under the bridge, with both the good and not so good times. I cherish the friendship that we cultivated and grew over a period of time.
Janappriya hailed from the Deep South. He was from an aristocratic family of Ratnayakes in Deniyaya. He was the eldest son of Wijesena and Phyllis Ratnayake. He grew up with two sisters and a brother. His alma mater was Richmond College, Galle. He captioned the school cricket team in 1966. On leaving school, he joined the bandwagon of Planting, which was running in his blood from his forefathers.
At Madampe, he surpassed the expectations of his tough task master, a senior planter by the name of late Van Twest. This young lad performed in an excellent manner, riding on his in-born talent. Ironically, after the retirement of Van Twest, it was none other than Janappriya who cared and looked after him like a son to a loving father.
Consequent to his successful performance at Madampe, he moved to an upcountry estate named Abbotsleigh situated in Hatton. The experience he gathered at Madampe assisted him immensely to turn around the division of Abbotsleigh assigned to him. Whilst at Abbotsleigh, he married Manjula Kulatunga and they were blessed with two children.
The daughter, Dayanji, has settled down in the United States whilst the son, Millinda, is engaged in business locally. Millinda dutifully and with much affection looked after his ailing father during the final stages of his brief illness.After a very successful planting career in Hatton, Janappriya took over the reins as the Superintendent of Willie Group, Deniyaya. During his tenure, Willie Group achieved the best performance ever recorded at the time. He mastered the art of excellent public relations, tea cultivation, processing and other management techniques that propelled the Group to be at its best. Janappriya had the ability to strike a balance between volume and quality that contributed to the success of the group.
It was during Janappriyas stint at Willie Group that proliferation of private tea factories came into being in Southern and Sabaragamuwa regions, catering to the small holder growers. There was a paradigm shift in how the tea industry operated at the time, which resulted in the tea-broking firms looking for experienced personnel particularly with expertise in the field of factory development and manufacture. Janappriya, with his wide experience in all three tea-growing elevations, not only in manufacturing, but in all other plantation aspects, was handpicked by M/s Bartleet and Company, where he joined as an Executive. He excelled at his job functions, delighting the clientele of the broking company. I recall that during this time, the catalogue of this company had a significant market share particularly in the low grown sector.
Janappriya, with his knowledge, versatility and being an excellent PR Man was in demand.
He served as a Director of M/s Mercantile Brokers (Pvt) Ltd and later joined M/s Asia Siyaka where his role included managing tea factories and estates, until his retirement.I have many nostalgic memories of my dear friend. His beloved mother gifted him with a Mitsubishi Colt car on his 25th birthday. It so happened that he was the only person who had a car whilst we were on Motorcycles. So with Janappriya having a car, we planned so many aimless trips. One of the trips that I recall was the journey to Kataragama and Jaffna, motoring through the East Coast. The understanding we had was that Janappriya provides transport and the late Tissa Silva (who became the member of parliament for the Rakwana electorate subsequently), to bear the cost of fuel which was Rs. 3.50 per gallon and for myself to arrange for accommodation. What a memorable trip, it was! Our journey to Jaffna took three days passing through crossings in ferries and beaten tracks. In Kayts, we were met by a friend of mine, attached to the Excise Department who provided us with accommodation. This unforgettable trip took place over a period of ten days.
I have so many golden memories and silver tears and as all things have to come to an end, Janappriya bid adieu, after a brief illness. He will live in my heart for evermore until we meet at Sassara.
Adios, my friend!

As a diversified group, we wish to reiterate our commitment to make condominiums on the one hand, a lucrative investment to all our buyers and on the other hand, a higher foreign exchange-earning segment in the future, he added.
The prestigious Blue Ocean Group has the distinction of being the largest apartment developer in Sri Lanka with over 1,400 condominium units committed or completed, to its credit.

Point of view
Markets lost some traction this week as profit-taking on the back of tax policy concerns and initial corporate earnings weighed on the market rally since late-March.
The benchmark Index posted its largest weekly decline (~97 points) for the year, pushing the index below the psychological 6700 mark for the 1st time in two weeks.
Nevertheless, markets found support from the IMFs approval of its 3rd EFF tranche to Sri Lanka, helping push average daily turnover levels 17% higher W-o-W to LKR0.86Bn (cf. LKR 0.73Bn last week and LKR 0.70Bn the week prior).
Turnover levels were driven largely by Institutional and Foreign interest, with Institutional investors returning strongly to the market this week (~52% of total market turnover relative to last weeks 38%).
Foreign investors meanwhile, remained net buyers on the Colombo bourse for the 25th consecutive week, driving the YTD net flows up to LKR 24.1Bn, the highest annual flow in 4 years. Foreign purchases in H117 have doubled relative to H116 (LKR 63Bn cf. LKR32Bn in H116), helping push the foreign investor contribution to total turnover in 2017 to 47% relative to 42% in 2016 and 34% in 2015 and crossing the 50% mark for the 1st time since 2008 in April17.
Foreign interest in domestic equities this year has been driven both by the general recovery in global risk appetite for EM/FM assets and Sri Lankas lower than regional peer PER levels (ASPI: 11.5x vs. MSCI FM:14.9x and MSCI EM:16.1x). Markets in the week ahead are likely to take cues from the start of the corporate earnings season.
IMF approves thirdEFF tranche of $167.2mn
The IMF on Wednesday disbursed its 3rd tranche under its EFF facility to Sri Lanka, adding that the new Inland Revenue Act should support fiscal consolidation.
With the disbursement of the $167.2Mn tranche, a total of $501.5Mn has so far being received by Sri Lanka under the agreement which is aimed at supporting the B-o-P and the GoSLs broad economic reform agenda. The IMF added that the countrys performance has been broadly satisfactory and that macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite adverse weather and global market events.
The IMF also commended the authorities corrective actions to achieve the pre-set targets on international reserves.
In terms of fiscal performance, the IMF noted that fiscal performance has been strong and that program targets for the fiscal deficit and tax revenue have been met; the new Inland Revenue Act meanwhile, is expected to support further fiscal consolidation and make the tax system more efficient and equitable.
The IMF cautioned though that the countrys high debt burden and gross financing needs necessitate further revenue-based consolidation, adding that structural reforms on tax administration and energy pricing should enhance this process.
The IMF also noted that inflation and credit growth remain relatively high and that despite the monetary tightening in Mar17, further tightening may be appropriate until clearer signs of lower inflation and credit emerge.

Long journey home
It has to be admitted that long distance bus services have improved tremendously. This results in exploitation as well.
Buses are stopped at regular intervals in front of hotels/ restaurants etc which offer special concessions to the bus crew. Food is served at exorbitant prices, also under unhygienic conditions. No proper toilet facilities are offered and unclean drinking water is served which compels the customers to buy water at high price.
The health authorities should look into this matter early and grant approval only to hotels/restaurants which comply with health requirements. All others should be closed. Once this step is taken, food supplied will be charged at reasonable prices as a healthy competition would be maintained.

Etiquette education: crucial social safety-net
Teachers certainly have an imperative role in shaping their students future. In todays schooling system, there is a strong focus on the three Rs, - Reading, Riting and Rithmatic - but mentors must consider tagging on an E to the curriculum - Etiquette.
Etiquette lessons help children learn the difference between right and wrong, by helping them focus on their actions. Besides it teaches them how to interact with others. The purpose is to provide students the opportunity to develop life skills that go beyond academics into areas of character, leadership, sense and civility. Modern etiquette lessons should challenge students to recognise that social skills build character and are essential in developing positive, successful relationships - wherever they go, whatever they do, whoever they meet.
Clear and proper thinking
Todays schools are already aware of the importance of pupils being all-rounders with success in academia, sports and the arts. This has meant that manners have in some cases gradually been left by the wayside in favour of a dazzling CV. It is all too true that school staff have such a huge workload, that its a bridge too far to expect them to administer perfect manners, too. For educators the task of instilling character development in their students isnt just childs play. It is not on the curriculum of any school but should be a subject that is as crucially important as mathematical and literacy skills.
Teaching children to make intelligent choices will help them become considerate individuals who will be admired for their character and ethical behaviour. Clear and proper thinking will to a great extent help reduce future problems they may develop or encounter. Still teaching such a subject entails a delicate balancing act and makes it all the more reason for school authorities to provide encouragement and guidance to teachers.
The value of teaching character education from an early age cannot ever be overlooked. The objective of character education is to fashion and nurture emotionally balanced, socially empathetic and caring individuals with a solid system of values. Its goal is to eventually raise mindful adults with socially acceptable ethics who are capable of steering a course through the challenges of life without compromising their principles.
The fact is, etiquette, or the lack of it, can have a significant impact on our educational and career prospects in several ways. But what exactly is etiquette and how does one define it There are many ways to define etiquette but put simply, etiquette primarily relates to the way you present and carry yourself. That is why it is particularly important for students and young professionals beginning their careers to learn the subject.
Good role models
Etiquette, includes the way you dress, converse and handle yourself in a multiplicity of situations. It also influences that important first impression. First impressions do matter when it comes to communicating personality through appearance. Everyone has heard the old axiom that first impressions are lasting impressions. As a general guideline we have about nine seconds to make that impression.
As it correlates to everyday life, those nine seconds can often mean the difference between getting your scholarship, your dream job or not, securing financing for a new venture or not, or whether you decide to do business with a company or not. In other words it can be the cause of failure or success.
Unfortunately todays culture sets the focus on self-destructive and all too often sociopathic role-models. Just take a look at our newspapers or turn on the TV and you will observe the escalating violence in our schools and universities. This type of anti-social behaviour from the future generations of our nation is a threatening reminder that the very fabric of our social structure is in danger of being torn asunder.
Despite of all the benefits that teaching character education offers to both the individual and society, there is no sure-fire formula or set standards on how and what to teach. While no general program exists that is suitable for all students, an established foundation for successful character education should follow certain methods and common principles. And if not handled carefully it can become a problem for both the educators and their charges. As children grow older, they figure out messages in their own way. Lessons fitting to character development stages allow children to make their own choices while bolstering positive group activities.
When character education blends both individualistic and collective play it encourages youngsters to apply their own perceptions and flair in most situations while also serving as good role models to their younger peers.
Emotional intelligence
While children are in school, open forums with active role-playing can provide practical tools to students for handling difficult moments and peer pressure. Moderated by teachers or, in later years, by the students themselves, the sharing among classmates is certain to encourage moral thought, ethical debate, decision-making, and crucial thinking.
The subject though should be devoid of moralising or indoctrination of any one type of belief or behaviour as being the right one for all. In its place, common principles based on shared values such as justice, equality for all, respect for individuality, empathy, kindness and integrity should serve as the elementary building blocks of all character education programs.
While there is no official certification required of etiquette teachers, you could become a credible authority on the subject if you start building your etiquette-related knowledge by reading books on the subject to improve your understanding of the topic. But remember teaching is more commonsense that is honed by the right refinement. Indeed every teacher should practice proper etiquette to prove their correctness as gurus. As an etiquette teacher, you should embody proper social practices. Particularly when establishing yourself in the industry, practicing what you preach is necessary.
Recent psychological studies have shown that emotional intelligence (EI) is as significant to a childs success and fulfilment as good grades and a university degree. Etiquette seeks to enhance the EI of children by encouraging them to express and discuss their emotions, thereby improving their social sensitivity and public behaviour.
Along with increased self-confidence and the ability to relate to others, students of etiquette develop enhanced social skills and experience far less anxiety when handling peer pressure. The potential for school violence can also be reduced by practicing the responsible behaviour stressed in etiquette education.
International studies have shown that the effects of etiquette and character training are immediate and long lasting. For parents, educators and especially our children, etiquette education and character development pay big dividends. In all, it provides a crucial safety-net in both social or anti-social societies.

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage ordered police to forward the extracts of the two investigation reports on the Panadura alleged petrol bomb hurling incidents on May 15, 2017 to the Attorney General and obtain his advice and submit the reports to Court.
When the five suspects in the case were produced before Court from the remand on Thursday, the lawyers appearing for them levelled serious allegations against police for misleading Court regarding the two incidents to turned them out as a racial and religious incidents occurred in Panadura during the second week of May 2017.
Police had submitted contradictory B Report to Court to keep the suspects in remand misleading the Court without any evidence against them, the lawyers told court.
The Attorney-at-law told court that on May 15 a shop had been damaged at Eluwila, Panadura opposite the Mosque.
Panadura South Police Chief Inspector Indika Thusara de Silva investigated the incident with the crime branch officials and submitted the first B Report to court that the police had recovered a bottle containing some oil from the location.
The shop had been damaged causing a Rs. 10,000 loss to its owner. But evidence hardly proved that petrol bombs had been hurled at the shop to incite racial or religious disturbances in the area, they told court.
Lawyer Major Ajith Prasanna told Court that on the instructions of the Inspector General of Police, Colombo Crime Division OIC Chief Inspector Neville De Silva had investigated the two incidents. Police suspected that petrol bombs had been hurled at the shop at Eluwiwla, Panadura and a mosque but evidence did not prove that petrol bombs had been hurled. If petrol bombs had been found, police should have summoned the Sri Lanka Army Bomb squad to conduct investigations, he told court.
Lawyer Amila Nawalage told court police must arrest all three wheeler drivers who possess plastic bottles containing petrol since they keep spare bottles of petrol in their vehicles.
The Chief Magistrate ordered the police to forward the bottles of petrol to the Govt. Analyst for examination and submit reports to the Attorney General.
Police was told to obtain AGs advice and submit to court on the next hearing date.
The five suspects were further remanded till August 7.

Involved in both the airline (Airwing Tours) and hotel sector (Royal Castle Hotel Negombo) for the past four decades, he said that today travel patterns have changed and new marketing tools are needed to attract tourists.
Managing Director of both these ventures, he said that today the Web has got priority and travel agents and tour operators are losing their share.
He explained that with the dawn of peace, the tourist industry has once again awoken and this has seen new players coming to invest in the industry which in turn has seen room capacity of the country increasing by leap and bounds.
In addition, new areas like the North East was opened up giving tourists the opportunity to move away from traditional destinations like the South, Negombo and the hill country. This obviously puts pressure on us, he said.
Fernandopulle who also heads the Small and Medium Tourists Hotels Association (ASMED) said the home stay concept has also been introduced giving more accommodation options for the tourist.
He however said that the biggest problem faced is from the informal sector which offers rooms with better facilities than home stay and for a cheaper price than two star hotels. The irony of this is that while taxpayers like us have to renew our license every year with a tedious process, the informal sector simply register their business with the local authorities and function smoothly.
We are requesting the Sri Lanka Tourism Ministry to seriously look at renewing some of the annual licenses for hotels at least every two or three years as the annual renewal process takes a lot of time and manpower.
He said the authorities should also look at separate destination marketing where places like Negombo, Bentota, Kandy and the East Coast are marketed separately targeting the off season.
They should look at more Asian countries to woo tourists for the off season.
He said that entertainment is another area and the Ministry should step forward to take off some of the uncalled-for restrictions on the industry.
We have also taken a step to introduce a special 75 cover night club with DJ music and other entertainment at Royal Castle Hotel Negombo and will open up The Happenings a rooftop restaurant and entertainment area adjoining the regions only rooftop swimming pool, next month.
Royal Castle Negombo also offers guests who enjoy partying an exclusive bar - Spazio Pub - with a trendy ambience and perfect mix of fun and music.

Froome on brink of fourth Tour de France crown
MARSEILLE, France, Saturday  Chris Froome all but secured a fourth Tour de France title by finishing third in Saturday's 20th stage time-trial in Marseille as Maciej Bodnar took the stage victory.
Rigoberto Uran moved into second overall at 54 seconds, set to be the tightest winning margin of Froome's four Tour successes, while Romain Bardet held on for third by just one second ahead of Mikel Landa.
It's incredible, the atmosphere here in Marseille, it's massive being here in the stadium, said Froome, 32, who will nonetheless finish without a stage win this year. It's the Tour de France, you can't always win everything, said the Sky team leader.
We had to put in the effort over three weeks and that's what we did.
For Bodnar, it was sweet revenge have come within a few hundred metres of a solo victory on stage 11, before he was caught by a charging peloton and Marcel Kittel took the sprint finish.
It's something special for me today. After the stage when I went alone I was thinking, I have to do something nice again'. Today I got more luck than the other stage, I'm really happy about this.
In what has been the closest Tour battle in years, the top three riders started the day separated by less than 30 seconds, building hope for a grandstand finale in the steamy southern port city ahead of Sunday's procession into Paris. But any such romantic notions of Frenchman Bardet overturning his 23sec deficit to Froome had disappeared long before the end of Saturday's 22.5km race against the clock, which began and ended in Marseille's iconic Velodrome football stadium. Bardet started the day second overall but only narrowly escaped the double humiliation of being pushed off the podium by Landa and overtaken by a charging Froome, who started his time-trial two minutes after the Frenchman.
Froome reached the first time check after 10.2km in second place, two seconds behind team-mate Michal Kwiatkowski, with Bodnar third at 6sec.
By then it was already clear there would be no grandstand finish as Uran was 23sec down on Froome having begun with a 29sec deficit, while Bardet had given up 44sec to the British leader.
By the second time check, Colombian Uran was starting to gain back a bit of time and looked certain to take second overall. But Bardet was in crisis, already 1min 17sec off Kwiatkowski, who still had the best time at the second check, although only fractions of a second ahead of Spanish veteran Alberto Contador, after 15.6km and the climb up to the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica, with Froome fourth at 3sec.
Spaniard Landa, who had started the day 1:13 behind Bardet, was now starting to threaten the Frenchman's podium hopes.
At the finish, Uran almost came a cropper, hitting the side boardings on a tight bend in a technical run-in to the Velodrome.
It cost him a few seconds but disaster was averted as he stayed upright to finish 31 seconds behind four-time Polish time-trial champion Bodnar, whose strong final section took him a second ahead of Kwiatkowski, the 2014 world road race champion.  AFP

Global Tea Party at SL Embassy in Russia
As part of the celebrations for the 150th anniversary of the Sri Lankan tea industry, the Sri Lankan embassy in the Russian Federation organized the Global Tea Party on July 6.
The event was jointly organized by the Embassy, Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Colombo Traders Association under the guidance of Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake.
The Global Tea Party in Moscow was attended by more than 60 invitees among whom were representatives of the Russian tea and business sectors, officials from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia and other prominent guests.
The welcome address of the event was made by Sri Lankan Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Dr. Saman Weerasinghe, who said that the two countries shared a common history in the tea industry and pointed out the importance of mutual cooperation between Russia and Sri Lankan tea companies, as strengthening of bilateral relations in the private sector which will lead to further development of trade and economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and Russia on the whole.
Furthermore, all invitees expressed their readiness to continue the cooperation with the Sri Lankan tea industry in the future. The event was elegantly organized and a demonstration of Ceylon tea preparation was conducted by Ustinya Kosterkina, a professional tea master and the winner of the Tea Master Cup Championship 2016, which made the Global Tea Party even more fascinating.
Besides the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Moscow, other Sri Lankan diplomatic missions organized the same Global Tea Party all over the world as a part of the global celebrations of 150 years of Ceylon tea.

## Title: The Glyphosate effect

The Glyphosate effect
By 2006, more than 17 million hectares were in genetically modified organism (GMO) crops in Argentina  second only to the USA. Half of this area was in GM soy, and sprayed annually with 200 million litres of glyphosate herbicides. Villagers and their crops in smallholder farms bordering the large commercial farms got copiously sprayed indiscriminately, by air and land. Villager crops were destroyed. They felt initial discomforts like skin and eye irritation, diarrhea and so on that developed within ten years to repeated miscarriages of malformed fetuses, still births and babies born with gravely high levels of pesticides in their bodies. Those babies are not expected to live long. Small fish, frogs and other amphibians disappeared entirely.
Argentinas tragedy is an undeniable, non-retractable and obvious case in support of the dangers of glyphosate herbicides to life forms. The affected population lived in deep rural areas in the pampas, with very little exposure to plastics, fossil fuels, chemicals and detergents in their lives. They are very poor, with 51% of the population living in poverty. Their major or even only exposure was to glyphosate herbicides, copiously sprayed by airplanes and helicopters. This is in stark contrast to people in say, the USA and Canada who are exposed to many chemical hazards other than glyphosate fertilizers, leaving room for regulators to say they cannot pin the abnormal observations on glyphosate fertilizers. Those Argentinians had glyphosate herbicide in their food, water, soil and air. For 3,650 days, they inhaled it every time and ingested it at least twice a day with food and at least four times a day with water. Just consider the havoc even a mild poison can play on a living body abused for so long  especially accumulative poisons like glyphosate formations.
At the beginning the Argentinian government enthusiastically approved a project by Monsanto to manufacture and distribute RoundUp for global sales. This was cancelled by the government in the face of the adverse results of glyphosate use.
The case of Argentina should be more than enough for all reasonable persons to decide to ban glyphosate herbicides at least for ten years to carry out comprehensive studies.
The ban in Sri Lanka
The ban in Sri Lanka wavered between yes and no for about 18 months. Probably the only concern for banning was the CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown origin) epidemic which some researchers connected to glyphosate herbicides. Within that time an expert panel rejected a ban and recommended a ban limited to the CKDu area. Also, three professors severely criticized the ban and trashed the research that pinned glyphosate herbicide to CKDu.
The expert panels decision was very depressing to say the least. It could not have been arrived at with a full knowledge of the dangers involved. It was a decision weighted for the economy and money against human lives. At that time there were an estimated 20,000 dead from CKDu and another 400,000 affected, many of them condemned to die. This was far more than those affected by the Minama Disease (mercury pollution) in Minamata and Niigata and Itai-Itai Disease (cadmium pollution) in the Jinzu river basin  all in Japan. They got global attention and aid. Sri Lanka, though in a much worse situation, got nothing.
Time was ripe for an immediate ban based on the generally applied precautionary principle; it states that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a credible risk, and extensive scientific knowledge or consensus on the matter is lacking. A credible risk was certainly there in the form of 20,000 deaths and 400,000 CKDu afflicted people. Lack of scientific knowledge was evident.
The precautionary principle (PP) is embodied in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety which regulates trans-boundary movements of GMOs. Sri Lanka signed it on May 24, 2000 and ratified on July 26, 2004. It is noteworthy that under the PP embodied therein, member nations are entitled to restrict or prohibit the import of GMOs if there is insufficient or conclusive evidence as to their safety. It is common sense to apply this principle to glyphosate formulations.
The expert panels decision for a selective ban was senseless for many reasons.
(1) Even armed sentries with shoot-at-sight orders cannot enforce a ban in a particular area. The banned item will be smuggled in and sold at blackmarket rates.
An example is Prohibition in the USA. Machine guns were freely used in a killing spree - by police in law enforcement and by bootleggers to carry on regardless.
(2) Water run-off from the tea plantations and vegetable cultivations to the upper reaches of the Mahaweli would have inevitably polluted the water going to the CKDu areas via Kandalama, Kala Wewa and the Jaya Ganga. It appears as if decisions were based on the brand manufacturers unproved but promoted claims for glyphosate. All these claims have now been proved as myths - which shows that the whole world, including our experts have been taken for a ride for believing the companys marketing jargon and not doing their own due diligence.
The run-off will introduce plenty of glyphosate residues to the Mahaweli - to the water, soil and food used and produced by those in the CKDu areas. A repeat of the story in Argentina.
Sri Lankan researchers have found that six of the seven tributaries in the hill country that form the Mahaweli are very dangerously polluted with cadmium, most probably from phosphate fertilizers. Cadmiun is a kidney poison. They did not look for glyphosate. If they had, they would have found a dangerous load of unreacted glyphosate in the Mahaweli  a poison ingested at least four times a day that would play havoc with life as it aggregates over the years until a very early death.
It is very noteworthy that in Denmark glyphosate was banned as far back as 2003 when it was proved that glyphosate does not decompose fully in the soil as claimed by the manufacturer Monsanto. A considerable amount of unreacted glyphosate was found in soil just five feet below the surface and in surface and underground water. The authorities did not wait for stupid definite scientific proof; they acted on the possible danger to life  on the precautionary principal.
(3) It was recommended that estates be allowed to use glyphosate as they did not have the labour resources to do manual weeding and that would have been too expensive too.
The plantation sectors could have been given a six-month period to adjust to a total ban. After all, human ingenuity has always adapted to worse disasters, and adapting to a ban on glyphosate was possible without heavy investment and high recurrent costs either on labour or inputs. The RPCs could even have requested financial incentives to adapt. The government would have certainly agreed because, after all, the plantations are government properties, only managed by the RPCs.
The tea industry is being exposed to destruction by glyphosate. Consumers will not want glyphosate in their tea. Glyphosate-free foods and beverages are already in the market. Anti-glyphosate discussions are going on in social media like FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. The RPCs will be burdened by sickened glyphosate applicators and damages claims in general.
(4) It was submitted that food prices will rise sharply, that there will be scarcities, rice will have to be imported and the economy will be adversely effected.
What does a flood do to agriculture Dont we recover from that damage soon enough without permanently escalated food prices Within the next decade will we have anybody left in the CKDu areas and in other areas gradually becoming CKDu areas, to grow our food Isnt that a much more desperate situation Isnt human life more valuable Isnt it the greatest asset anywhere
Apart from the foregoing, has the true cost of food produced by modern agriculture been assessed No! If the cost of depleting raw materials and fossil fuels used for making fertilizer, the damage to life-forms, the soil, groundwater and the environment and so on are added to the cost, modern agriculture must be much more costlier than organic agriculture  just as much as coal powered power is cheap by itself but at least as costly as renewable energy if cost of damage to people and the environment are added on.
Even if costlier, it must be borne in mind that organic agriculture leads to a dynamically balanced living soil ecosystem that, in about 15 years, results in a soil that needs no fertilizer at all. That is the physically visible and still used, highly fertile Terra Preta do Indio  the black soil of the Indians of ancient Amazonia. This agriculture ensures human and plant health. In fact plants grow better in terra preta than with chemical fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer has to be applied yearly in increasing quantities. It kills soil bacteria and thereby the soil. Just as much as humans should preserve their gut bacteria for better health, the soil bacteria is an essential plant nutrient provider.
(5) The human factor was relegated behind the profit or money factor.
Without farmers there will be no agriculture. Without agriculture there will be no food and without food there will be no life. True, this is an extreme scene, but the world is coming at least part way to it through the adoption of modern commercial agriculture that focuses on huge swathes of repeated monocultures, a single herbicide applied extensively, copiously and in increasing strengths to overcome resistance developed by weeds, producing chemical-resistant bacteria that could confront humanity with unknown and incurable illnesses, unknown fungi and viruses  all forcing us to finally poison and disease ourselves out of existence. RPC plantations too can have poisoned workmen and families, poisoned green-leaf, weeds that are herbicide resistant, and face the burden of liability in the near future.
Three professors wrote against the ban. Two criticized the ban as politically motivated with an underlying insinuation that it was to gain voters. How so Those who might appreciate but still do not benefit because it is too late for them, are the CKDu afflicted and others living in those areas  maybe close to a million people or votes. Those who will be adversely affected by the removal of a real convenience and money-saver are in the millions in plantations and in agriculture in the other areas of the country. A definite loss of votes scenario here. Yes, the ban was based on political reasons, but not for votes. The President enforced it for the safety of his people and our unique island environment.
All three professors trashed and rejected the hypothesis put forward by Dr. Channa Jayasumana pointing to glyphosate as the major cause of and/or boosting CKDu, on three counts. A rise in food prices and scarcities were alluded to by two professors, but that point has been already dealt with and will not be taken up here.
One was that the results presented were inconclusive. Another was that the hypothesis was wrong in terms of its chemistry and the third was that it had no standing to be presented in prestigious scientific publications and so was permitted to be published only on open access basis.
Rejecting the results presented as inconclusive is a spurious argument. Results in science are intrinsically inconclusive; that is the very nature of the subject. Research results are always negatively qualified by using the words maybe, possibly, probably and so on. Tests are conducted on small animals  mostly rodents. Doubts are expressed about the results on humans. Human guinea pigs are virtually non-existent. A research study is not even a nano-window on the millions of conditions and their variations in the planet. No natural condition can be replicated in the laboratory because the environment and the conditions affecting it are in flux all the time, and the very limited facilities in a laboratory cannot replicate even a natural condition that has been somehow frozen static. Where can one get the definite proof that is called for
One professor pointed to fluorine in water as the cause. That is an eminently acceptable theory, but it was not developed. Besides, fluorine cannot be the sole cause of CKDu. The evidence points to one or more causes that boost damage by other entities while damaging the life-form themselves. Glyphosate fits into that picture as evidenced in countries in which glyphosate is used heavily.
Another professor theorized that the cause of CKDu was the ionicity of the water in the CKDu areas and forwarded the Hoffman Series in support. Again eminently acceptable, but not supported or developed. These ideas still remain ideas.
Dr. Jayasumanas papers have been accepted as plausible by eminent scientists abroad. Dr. Mae-wan Ho and Dr. Eva Srinathsinji, are just two of them who are also crusading against glyphosate.
Another very eminent scientist is Dr. Don M. Huber, Professor Emeritus, Purdue University who was critical of glyphosate even while working for the US Department of Agriculture. He says It is well established in the scientific literature that glyphosate disrupts the endocrine hormone system, and is toxic to liver and kidney tissues, a strong mineral chelator, and a potent antibiotic.
He has been researching glyphosate at the USDA as well as at Purdue University. He has done such research for over three decades. His statement above is firm and unambiguous. Are our professors, scientists, doctors and promoters questioning Dr. Hubers integrity also when they say there is no scientific evidence against glyphosate
Acceptable comments on the effects of glyphosate on metabolic processes can come only from eminent scientists in the fields of life sciences including biology, botany, zoology, microbiology, physiology, biochemistry, and related subjects  not from those involved in physics, chemistry and nuclear sciences.
Monsanto has admitted in court that it cannot claim that Roundup doesnt cause cancer because the complete formulation has never been tested - but glyphosate supporters here and abroad fans are asking for proof of damage!
Unsealed court documents released early this year reveal startling details of falsehoods, cover-ups, skullduggery from Monsanto and collusion between Monsanto and USEPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) in connection with the hazards of glyphosate.
There are also revelations of Monsantos plans to peremptorily sabotage and ridicule the expected conclusions of the World Health Organizations IARC on the probable carcinogenicity of glyphosate.

GMOA to take union action over SAITM issue tomorrow
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has decided to take stern trade union action from 8.00 am tomorrow (July 25) if the Government failed to meet eight demands today (July 24), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said their first demand was to announce the ownership of the white van number NP - 0410, the identity of thugs came in it, the person who gave them the order, the details of the connection (if there is any between the police and them) and to assure that such events will not take place in the future.
Dr. Aluthge said secondly they demand to take legal action against all persons connected to the abduction attempt. They demand to apologize the nation for the abduction attempt, not to suppress innocent unarmed students and release all the university students now in custody without any charges.
The Government should give a written assurance today (July 24) for appointing a President for the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) acceptable to the SLMC, declare the final decision on gazetting the `Minimum Standards of Medical Education and release a legal document assuring that the SAITM will discontinue enrolling students and offer them degrees, he said.

Govts NTP, Roadmap will entice FDI -IMF
The National Trade Policy (NTP) formulated by the Government recently and the Roadmap on Investment Climate Reforms that identify strategies to create an enabling environment will attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) to Sri Lanka in future, said IMF mission Chief of Sri Lanka, Jaewoo Lee during a video conference from IMF Headquarters in Washington.
The media briefing in Colombo was conducted by IMF members Jeff Danforth and Cory Hillier.
Sri Lanka and Maldives ILO Resident Representative Eteri Kvintradze co-ordinated the briefing.
The main objective of conducting the video conference was to highlight the second review of the Sri Lanka s economic programme, related to the three year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), granted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Sri Lanka .
IMF Mission Chief Lee was also assisted by IMF senior economist Sarwat Jahan , IMF Economist Suchanan Tambunlertchai and IMF Senior Communications Keiko Utsunomiya,
During the presentation from Washington Lee also explained several key points of the second review of Sri Lankas economic programme.
Responding to a question Lee said it was true that Sri Lankas world ranking on the Ease of Doing Business is not the strongest, but they knew that the government was working on improving it.
Furthermore, the IRA will simplify the countrys tax system, making it more efficient and transparent which should be favorable to foreign investors, he said. Lee also said the IMF is hoping to publish the staff report soon which will provide Sri Lanka with IMF views and analysis more in depth, as well as more detailed data.
 You can also see the authorities views on issues related to economic policies,.
At the conclusion Lee said the IMF is hoping to have a 2-way dialogue with Sri Lanka to hear your interests and concerns.
It is also said that the ILO mission had discussions with several key Government representatives including in this regard. The IMF mission also discussed with Sri Lankan business community, civil society and International partners.
According to Lee, the mission made a significant progress to reach a staff level agreement with the Sri Lankan Government on completion of the first review.
It is said the mission and the authorities discussed plans for a transition to flexible targeting as the monetary policy framework, possibly supported by IMF technical assistance.
The Mission also encouraged the Government to make concerted efforts in implementing structural reforms in public financial management and state owned enterprises that were building on technical assistance received over the years.

The Gracious New Tenant
Every morning for the past two weeks, a loud tap-tap-tap sound comes from the top of our roof. It feels as though a carpenter is up there hammering a nail onto the wooden ceiling. When I poke my head out of the balcony and look up I see him dressed in a spectacular dark red coat tapping away. Sometimes he turns his head and looks at me as if to ask me havent I got better things to do than stare at him, then, returns to his work. I watch him till the sound of a passing vehicle on the road below makes him fly away. The hole he has created on the ceiling is quite big now and Im waiting to see if he would bring his lady love to admire his work. No one at home is worried about the tiny hole in the roof. The way we see it, we are probably living on land that once belonged to Woody and his wife, so all we can do is welcome him back as the new tenant on our ceiling.
Thankfully our first lodgers, the bulbul family on the living room fan dont mind the newcomers either. Mama Bulbul and Papa Bulbul are too busy to notice Woody, anyway. They are busy carrying mouth loads of worms and caterpillars to feed their hungry brood. The only time they get agitated is when our monitor in residence walks on the roof making loud thumping sounds. But as I explain to the Bulbul family whenever this happens we have to forgive him. He cant help making such a huge noise, especially when his great great great grandfathers happen to be dinosaurs.
In addition to this extended family of ours we also get a few visitors who drop in at regular intervals. They help themselves to the shoe flowers in the garden and give us a wide grin when we offer gifts of bananas by keeping it on the parapet wall. It makes me feel good to know they are our relatives (of sorts) come to say Hi.
I consider myself lucky that my cat Podi observes the first precept of not taking the life of other living beings and leaves the birds alone. But I know of a friend who takes leave from work to safeguard the baby bulbuls on her lampshade from the cat next door.
And I also have a friend, Prof. Kamani Jayasekera, who has a crow watching her work from his perch on the window of her home-office. He even gives her presents when she comes out into the garden, probably because he knows bird droppings bring luck to the unwilling recipients.
Survival
Good luck or not, it is heartening to know that most of us no longer feel threatened or invaded when wild animals decide to lodge with us or call on us as visitors, and would never dream of chasing them away or of killing them. Environmentalists say it is becoming increasingly common that in cities and suburbs around the world, wild creatures are showing up where we least expect them. Not all of them arrive by accident, and some are here to stay. Who can blame them, as we, the human population tops seven billion, robbing animals of their sacred spaces. We so selfishly destroy their natural habitats to put up highways, buildings, car parks, and houses. The result A wildlife invasion of our urban neighborhoods. But, how can they survive in our ecosystem of concrete, steel, and glass
With great difficulty. According to the Audubon Society  a program that protects birds and their places, up to a billion birds are killed every year by hitting windows, making it one of their largest threats. And as bird lover Steward Brand points out, You dont have to find a dead bird near a window. Even if you just find feathers you know the bird has flown on but it will die eventually. He quotes Valdimr Nobokovs Pale Fire: I was the shadow of the waxwing slain / by the false azure in the windowpane.
Be careful
So, if we want to welcome birds into our house lets make it safe for them. If you are looking for an excuse to avoid your chores this might be useful. Dont clean your windows. Put the blame on the birds. Dirty windows are less reflective and can reduce collisions. You could also insert exterior window screens. With the advent of air conditioning, a lot of people dont open their windows as much, says Joanna Eckles, coordinator for Project Birdsafe, Audubon Minnesota. Thats a shame because open windows with exterior screens create a visible barrier for birds approaching windows, reduce reflection, and make for a softer landing in case of collision. Theyre also easy to install and arent eyesores. Hanging strings, ribbons, or cords in front of your window is also an in expensive way to help birds avoid your windows. Keep in mind that the occasional collision might not seem like a big deal, but just one or two collisions per house per year can mean that hundreds of millions of our feathered visitors are dying annually.
Relationship advice!
As always there is also the other side of the coin too. Is it alright to make the birds dependent on us Will they get angry with us if we dont provide them the shelter they are looking for When someone posted this question with regard to a crow he had got used to feeding from his office window, Jon Mooallem, a Mr.Know-it-All had this to say.
Crows are shrewd and resilient birds, in other words. And they have fetching personalities. (Remember that viral video of a Russian crow sledding gleefully down a frosty sloped roof on a jar lid Id hang out with that crow!) What Im saying is, you and this crow are in a relationship. What youre asking for, essentially, is relationship advice.
Will the crow be let down if you stop feeding it Without a doubt. Breaking up is hard to do. Still, the idea that the crow is dependent on you seems a little self-important. The crow is certainly working the person, says wildlife biologist John Marzluff. It will find another meal.
See, the crow has seduced you into a much more psychologically complicated relationship than you thought. In fact, Marzluff, with a colleague, has even worked up a typology of human crow-feeders. Crow observers take a detached, transactional view; crow friends say things like Isabella scolded me when I got too close to her kids. Her anger has no bounds. (If it isnt obvious, Isabella is a crow.)
So, summing up: The birds just not that into you. Youre free to stop feeding it because the crow doesnt actually need you. But ask yourself, how much do you need the crow
Following this advice I have been asking myself too if Woody needs me at all Probably not. But I need him every morning to brighten my day with his colorful (and noisy) presence.
Tips for creating a bird-friendly environment
* Minimize bird strikes by pulling curtains over windows, adding a screen to the exterior or decorating the outside surface to break up the reflection. Dont use mirrors as exterior decor.
* Choose appropriate feeders and seeds for birds in your area. Position them 30 feet away so birds arent drawn to reflections or less than 3 feet away from windows so they slow down.
* Plant native trees and shrubs and wildflowers.
* Include a water source and keep it clean.
* Avoid pesticide use.
* When nesting season is under way most nests are inconspicuous, tucked into hedges or under shrubs. Be mindful when trimming the garden: Find out if you have a tenant by listening for chirping or watching for birds bringing in bits of nest materials.
* Cats kill millions of birds each year. Keep your cat indoors to protect the birds and keep your cat safe.

A great relief
All right thinking Sri Lankans will heave a sigh of relief that Judge Manickavasagar Illancheliyan escaped an assassination bid on Saturday night in Jaffna after an unidentified man snatched the revolver of one of his personal protection officers and opened fire. His personal protection officer, who was critically injured in the line of duty in the shooting incident in Nallur died yesterday at the Jaffna Hospital.
Judge Illancheliyan is widely known as a fearless judge and has presided in many high profile cases. Currently the most high profile case handled by him, as part of a three-judge Trial-at-Bar is the rape and murder case of Sivaloganathan Vithya, a young Jaffna student in May 2015. This is the first time that a Trial-at-Bar is being conducted in Jaffna, which saw much unrest after the case came to light.
In a rather curious and even sinister turn of events, the abortive shooting comes just days after the arrest of former Central Province DIG Lalith Jayasinghe in connection with the above case. Jayasinghe, who was SSP Jaffna when the incident took place in May 2015, is believed to have helped one of the main suspects to flee the country. The Trial-at-Bar is continuing in the meantime, with the next hearing coming up tomorrow. Two suspects had been arrested by the Police in connection with the shooting incident. Although according to the Police, initial investigations had revealed that the shooting has not been pre-planned, all aspects of the incident must be investigated thoroughly before coming to a firm conclusion.
There is another dimension of the incident that many have not thought of. July 23 marked the 34th anniversary of the July 1983 communal riots that eventually led to a protracted conflict. While Sri Lanka has indeed moved beyond these dark days and the conflict itself, there are individuals in both the North and the South whose only salvation is ethnic disharmony and strife. They will leave no stone unturned to inflame ethnic passions and gain political mileage. They usually exploit this type of incident to whip up communal feelings among the public to further their political ambitions. The Government must keep an eye on these individuals and protect law and order in the North and elsewhere at all costs, especially at a time when concrete moves are being made to ensure reconciliation and lasting peace. A few racist politicians must not be allowed to sabotage the process of reconciliation.
The Government must enhance overall security in the peninsula in the wake of this incdent, at least until the Vithya case comes to an end. Additional protection must be provided to all three judges hearing this case and also to the court and courtroom where it is heard. Any witnesses coming forward to give evidence against the nine suspects too must be similarly protected under the terms of the nascent Witness Protection laws. In the meantime, the authorities must make sure that any attempts being made to impart an ethnic dimension to the incident are nipped in the bud. The authorities acted swiftly when a youth in a sand truck was gunned down by Police in Jaffna and the same safeguards should be applied in this case too.
This is not the first time that judges have been attacked by gunmen. High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya was fatally shot by assassins on November 20, 2004 on the orders of a drug lord whose case he was hearing. In fact, this brutal murder of a judge led to the very establishment of the Judicial Security Division (JSD) of the Police in 2005. Quick thinking by the JSD officers assigned to protect Judge Illancheliyan helped save his life. In the light of this incident, the JSD must be given additional training and facilities and expanded if possible. There have been many other attacks on individual judges and the judiciary itself over the years.
Restoring the independence of the Judiciary was one of the main planks of the electoral campaigns of the National Unity Government, which marks two years next month. The previous Government laughed in the face of the Judiciary, culminating with the infamous overnight impeachment of the then Chief Justice Dr Shiranee Bandaranayake. Her only fault was giving a verdict that directly contradicted the wishes of powerful figures of that Government.
True to its word, the present Government has ensured that the judiciary can function fearlessly and independently. There have been several verdicts against the Government which it accepted gracefully. If there are reservations about a verdict, that too can be addressed via the court system. However, the freedom of judiciary alone is often not enough  the Police too must be able to act fearlessly and impartially in gathering evidence for court cases. Again, this Government has strived hard to ensure the independence of the Police at all times. In high-profile cases such as Vithyas, it is vital to ensure that the Judiciary, the Attorney Generals Department, Police and any other allied public entities can act independently without any fear or favour. Then only can true justice be dispensed effectively.

## Title: Growing up as an untouchable

Growing up as an untouchable
My stories, my familys stories, were not stories in India. They were just life.
When I left and made new friends in a new country, only then did the things that happened to my family, the things we had done, become stories. Stories worth telling, stories worth writing down.
I was born in South India, in a town called Khazipet in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
I was born into a lower-middle-class family. My parents were college lecturers.
I was born an untouchable.
When people in this country ask me what it means to be an untouchable, I explain that caste is like racism against blacks here. But then they ask, How does anyone know what your caste is They know caste isnt visible, like skin color.
Within the village
I explain it like this. In Indian villages and towns, everyone knows everyone else. Each caste has its own special role and its own place to live. The brahmins (who perform priestly functions), the potters, the blacksmiths, the carpenters, the washer people, and so onthey each have their own separate place to live within the village. The untouchables, whose special rolewhose hereditary dutyis to labor in the fields of others or to do other work that Hindu society considers filthy, are not allowed to live in the village at all. They must live outside the boundaries of the village proper. They are not allowed to enter temples.
Not allowed to come near sources of drinking water used by other castes. Not allowed to eat sitting next to a caste Hindu or to use the same utensils. There are thousands of other such restrictions and indignities that vary from place to place. Every day in an Indian newspaper you can read of an untouchable beaten or killed for wearing sandals, for riding a bicycle.
In your own town or village, everyone already knows your caste; there is no escaping it. But how do people know your caste when you go elsewhere, to a place where no one knows you There they will ask you, What caste are you You cannot avoid this question. And you cannot refuse to answer. By tradition, everyone has the right to know.
If you are educated like me, if you dont seem like a typical untouchable, then you have a choice. You can tell the truth and be ostracized, ridiculed, harassedeven driven to suicide, as happens regularly in universities.
Or you can lie. If they dont believe you, they will try to find out your true caste some other way. They may ask you certain questions: Did your brother ride a horse at his wedding Did his wife wear a red sari or a white sari How does she wear her sari Do you eat beef Who is your family deity They may even seek the opinion of someone from your region.
Stories of shame
If you get them to believe your lie, then of course you cannot tell them your stories, your familys stories. You cannot tell them about your life. It would reveal your caste. Because your life is your caste, your caste is your life.
Whether they know the truth or not, your untouchable life is never something you can talk about.
It was like this for me in Punjab, in Delhi, in Bombay, in Bangalore, in Madras, in Warangal, in Kanpur, in Calcutta.
At 26, I came to America, where people know only skin color, not birth status. Some here love Indians and some hate them, but their feelings are not affected by caste. One time in a bar in Atlanta I told a guy I was untouchable, and he said, Oh, but youre so touchable.
Only in talking to some friends I met here did I realize that my stories, my familys stories, are not stories of shame.
No one informed me that I was untouchable. It is not the kind of thing that your mother would need to tell you. What I was told was that we were Christians.
Christians, untouchablesit came to the same thing. All Christians in India were untouchable, as far as I knew (though only a small minority of all untouchables are Christian).
Hindu neighbors
I knew no Christian who did not turn servile in the presence of a Hindu.
I knew no Hindu who did not look right through a Christian man standing in front of him as if he did not exist.
I accepted this. No questions asked.
I saw the grown-ups in my family scrambling to their feet, straightening their clothes, and wringing their hands when a certain bowlegged, cross-eyed, drooly-mouthed Hindu man passed in front of us. - Lit Hub

Industrial zone joining Bandaragama, Millaniya and Millawa on track
Necessary plans have been already made to form a huge industrial factory zone joining Bandaragama, Millaniya and Millawa of Kalutara district state minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
This industrial zone will be setup with the collaboration of Rojana Company, which owns seven of the biggest industrial zones of Thailand and has been realized and brought to Sri Lanka with the personal intervention of State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.

Rojana contemplates forming around 200 mega factories in this zone. Minister Senasinghe further stated that they wish to bring their factories from Thailand and Vietnam as well. Rojana is a leading name in Electronic Appliances and Automotive Sectors.
Senasinghe further stated that a leading company like Rojanas interest in investing in Sri Lanka is great achievement. And he also said with the commencement of industrial zones, it would provide the opportunity to make high tec, high end products right here in Sri Lanka.
The minister said that he is personally intervening to get the necessary infrastructure and approvals to bring this industrial factory zone to Sri Lanka. He stated he is taking the necessary steps to fast track the establishment of these industrial zones by keeping in contact with BOI Sri Lanka, Central Environment Authority, electricity, water, provincial governing bodies and other relevant institutes.

Inflation dips in June
Inflation, as measured by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), decelerated to 6.3 per cent in June 2017 from 7.1 per cent in May 2017, on year-on-year basis.
Both Food and Non-food categories contributed towards the year-on-year inflation in June 2017.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis remained at 6.1 per cent in June 2017, at same level of the previous month.
When the monthly change is considered, the NCPI increased from 121.8 index points in May 2017 to 123.4 index points in June 2017. This monthly increase was mainly due to the increase in prices of the items in the Food category.
Within the Food category, prices of vegetables, rice, fresh fish, green chillies, red onions, dried fish (sprats) and chicken increased during the month. In the Non-food category, prices of items in Furnishing, Household Equipment and Routine Household Maintenance (Wages to servants and Wages to drivers); Miscellaneous Goods and Services; and Clothing and Footwear sub-categories increased. Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco (areca nuts) sub-category also increased during June 2017. Prices in Health sub-category recorded decrease during the month.
Meanwhile, prices in Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels; Transport; Communication; Recreation and Culture; Education; and Restaurants and Hotels sub-categories remained unchanged during the month.
The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy decreased to 4.1 per cent in June 2017 from 4.7 per cent in May 2017 on a year-on-year basis.
This decline is due to relatively low monthly increase of items excluding Volatile food, Energy and Transport categories. Annual average NCPI Core inflation also declined from 6.4 per cent in May 2017 to 6.1 per cent in June 2017.

Israeli embassy in Amman: Shooting leaves two dead

Two Jordanians have been killed and an Israeli wounded in a shooting incident at the Israeli embassy in Jordan's capital Amman, according to a local security source.
The two Jordanians were working for a furniture firm and entered the embassy before the shooting, police say.
Few details have been revealed and what sparked the shooting is unclear.
Security forces have sealed off the embassy and Israeli authorities have evacuated staff.
The shooting happened in a residential building used by the Israeli embassy, Jordanian police say.
The police said investigations were still in their "initial phases".
Israeli authorities are not commenting on the incident and have imposed reporting restrictions.
The heavily protected embassy is located in the Rabiyeh neighbourhood, an affluent part of Amman.
Holy site row
On Friday, thousands of Jordanians protested in Amman against Israel over the installation of metal detectors at a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews in East Jerusalem.
Jordan, which occupied East Jerusalem from 1949 to 1967, is the custodian of the site, which is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount.
Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians over the site have surged in recent days in response to the metal detectors, which were put in place following the killing of two Israeli policemen.
Security cameras have nowalso been installed at a gateway leading to the site.

Jane Austens Great House launches urgent appeal to stay open
As Jane Austen becomes the new face of the 10 note, Chawton House Library, the Great House where she whiled away many an hour, is hoping that at least some of the currency bearing her image will be directed its way. The charity is looking to raise around 150,000 over the next 18 months to stay afloat after its main backer withdrew support. It will also be applying for millions in capital grants over the next few years to transform its focus.
The Elizabethan residence in Hampshire, built by the Knight family in the 1580s, was inherited by Janes brother Edward centuries later. He offered the nearby bailiffs residence, now the Jane Austens House Museum, to his mother and sisters Jane and Cassandra. But the author was a frequent visitor to her brothers home, eating and reading there, and walking in its grounds. I went up to the Great House between 3&4, & dawdled away an hour very comfortably, she wrote in 1814.
The house had fallen into disrepair when American entrepreneur and philanthropist Sandy Lerner intervened in 1992. Lerner reopened it in 2003 as a library and research centre after extensive restoration, turning it into a home for early womens literature. The library features an original manuscript in Austens own hand, first and early editions of her novels, as well as writing by women authors who inspired her, and others whom she in turn inspired.
Open to visitors since 2015, Chawton House is facing an uncertain future after Lerner stepped down from the board of trustees last year, and her foundation decided to focus on other projects. Before that, Lerners foundation had covered around 65% of its operating costs.
We know Jane Austens Great House should be a major historic literary landmark but it does not currently have the facilities to reach its full potential, the charity says on a newly launched website for its urgent, large-scale fundraising campaign. Its fairly urgent, but exciting as well, said director of fundraising Jane Lillystone on Thursday.
An event in Dallas, Texas, organised by the Jane Austen Society of North America, has already raised $17,200 (13,200) for the campaign, while Chawton House has just launched a social media campaign called TheDarcyLook, which is encouraging supporters to raise money by drenching a man wearing a white shirt  a la Colin Firth as Mr Darcy  in water, in homage to the ice bucket challenge.
I hope Jane would have liked it, said Lillystone. She often had a very different opinion about things, and liked to tease, so I hope she would. -Guardian.co.uk

Kalutara Bar Associaitons Law Night
The Kalutara Bar has produced dazzling and resplendent guiding stars in the galaxy of the legal and political fraternity. It also has a large number of competent and talented juniors and they should be helped to reach greater heights by creating opportunities for them to blossom in life, said Attorney at Law and Past President of the Kalutara Bar Association, M. A. M Hanaffi.
He was delivering the keynote address at the 'Law Night' year-end get-together and farewell reception to judges held at the Tangarine Beach Hotel, Kalutara, recently. Association President Ravi Domingo presided.
Hanaffi said they are gathered to mark the Law night get-together and to bid farewell to Civil Appelate Court Judge Pushpamali, Additional District Judge Chamath Madanayake and Magistrate Udesh Ranatunge, on their retirement from Judicial Service. On behalf of the Kalutara Bar Association, he wished to extend greetings to them for happiness and contentment in their life in retirement.
Hanaffi said, the get-together and the farewell ceremony was a great tradition in the rich heritage of the Kalutara Bar Association. Therefore, it was a proud occasion for their membership.
He said, special honour is due to Thushara Jayakody for the silent service he had rendered to the progress of their association.
Hanaffi added, it was appropriate for him to highlight a quote from Lord Macdonald, mentioned by Justice Soertz in an article on Our Legal Fraternity, published in the Law College Magazine which said, stand your trial in the forum of your conscience.
Quoting Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony, he had said The evil that men do lives after them and the good is oft interred with their bones.
Another quote from Shakespeare in Hamlet mentioned in the Judges Journal also came to his mind: This above all to thine own self he true and it must follow, as the night the day. Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Attorney Hanaffi said, At this juncture, it is our bounden duty to remember with a deep sense of gratitude the founding fathers of our Association and all the others who nurtured and preserved these traditions as our heritage.
Late D. J. F. Walter a golden jubilarian, a much respected senior of our Bar, commenting on the calibre of the lawyers who adorned our Bar in the past, in his book 'In and out of the Kalutara Courts,' referred to the then class of lawyers as They were fearless and independent men, imbued with their heritage of our noble traditions, alive to their rights and privileges and no less conscious of their duties; men of courage who asserted themselves without flinching as occasion demanded, thereby earning the respect and regard both judges and suitors.
"In keeping with these great and time honoured traditions, President, you have organized this function with your colleagues. It is with a tinge of sadness we bid farewell to Pushpamali as the judge of the Civil Appellate High Court, Additional District Judge Chamath Madannayake and Magistrate Udesh Ranagunga," he added.
"I had the privilege of appearing before her Ladyship, Pushpamali and Chamath Madannayake. She has earned the respect of the Bar and meted out justice to all with your feminine charm tempering rigours of the law with mercy and compassion. After 33 long years of dedicated service to the nation as a judicial officer, having commenced her judicial career as a president of a Labour Tribunal and retired as a judge of judges from our Civil Appellate High Court. Yours is a well-earned and well -deserved retirement. I wish you a peaceful life," he said.
"Chamath Madannayake, you are a young judicial officer and an upright judge. You have a great future. I wish you and Hon Udesh Ranathunga another young judge with a future, all success in all their endeavours. Be always guided by the thought that the path of duty is the way to glory," Hanaffi said. Hanaffi also thanked the President and members of the Executive Committee and other members of their association for the excellent arrangements. Ravi Domingo made the welcome speech and Magistrate Udesh Ranatunge spoke on behalf of the Judges. Association Secretary Thushara Jayakody proposed the vote of thanks.

KingTuts wife finally found
The life of Tutankhamun has always been shrouded in mystery making for legendary tales and stories. Now it turns out that the wife of Ancient Egypts most famous ruler may have been uncovered in the Valley of The Kings.
Egyptologists believe that they have discovered the burial chamber of Ankhesenamum, Tutankhamuns wife and if confirmed it could also help unravel the final fate of the boy kings wife who suddenly disappeared from historical records after her second marriage.
The burial plot was discovered by world renowned archaeologist Zahi Hawass near the tomb of the pharaoh Ay.
Ankhesenamum was married to King Tut and wed Ay after the boy kings death.
King Tut became pharaoh at the age of ten in around 1332 BC and ruled for just nine years until his death.
In the same year he became pharaoh he married Ankhesenpaaten, his half-sister.

Maldives Parliament shut down to stop Speaker's removal

The Maldivian army has locked down the country's parliament after the opposition vowed to move ahead with a vote against a key ally of President Abdulla Yameen.
Defiant lawmakers, however, scaled metre-high walls to the parliament compound on Monday, after fighting off riot police and pepper spray.
A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh was scheduled to take place on Monday before the lockdown was forced into effect by the military.
The opposition, which secured enough support from government defectors to begin impeachment proceedings against Maseeh earlier this month, accuse him of ignoring allegations of corruption, mismanagement and rights abuses.
However, the ruling party dismissed the motion after Yameen, who denies opposition allegations of corruption and authoritarian reversals, announced that four of the defectors had lost their parliamentary seats.
Ahmed Mahloof, an opposition lawmaker, said soldiers carrying batons followed the MPs inside the parliament house and forcibly ejected them.
"Soldiers in riot gear are dragging elected members out from the parliament," Mahloof told Al Jazeera.
"This is clearly unconstitutional. Many of us have been injured."
Videos posted on social media show soldiers pushing lawmakers out of the building. A few politicians appear to have been injured.
"There is no better symbol of Yameen's dictatorship than the image of his security forces barring elected MPs from parliament. This president has lost all legitimacy and credibility," said Eva Abdulla, an opposition lawmaker from the Maldivian Democratic Party.
The army could not be reached for comment.
Yameen has arrested or forced into exile most of the opponents who might have challenged him in next year's presidential elections.
Last year, an Al Jazeera investigation revealed how Yameen's government embezzled millions of dollars in tourism revenue.
The embattled president now faces a coalition of four opposition parties, led by his brother Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives with an iron fist for 30 years, and Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected president.
Faris Maumoon, Yameen's nephew and the leader of the effort to impeach the speaker, was arrested on charges of bribery last week.
Two other lawmakers were put on trial on charges of bribery and terrorism.

This victory by the MAS team is a fitting tribute to their experienced former Sri Lanka national skipper Fazil Marija who executed and inflicted a superb brand of attacking rugby and dished out a fabulous team game together with the entire team.
For the victorious MAS team the tries were scored by three quarters Anurudda Willawara, Sadun Herath and Roshan Weeraratne - one try apiece. Roshan Weeraratne put over the two conversions as well. Three quarter Richard Dharmapala scored both tries for Acces with Chanaka Chandimal slotting in both the conversions.

Military did not maintain torture chambers
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday strongly refuted claims made by United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson that the military was maintaining torture-chambers.
Wijewardene said the government does not agree with the alleged comments made by Ben Emmerson with regards to the above subject, following his visit to Sri Lanka with several other UN Rapporteurs. Wijewardene vehemently refuted that Sri Lanka military was keeping torture-chambers at present and added that the government has a zero-tolerance policy on torture.
Wijewardene made these observations at a media brief held at the UNP head quarters Sirikotha yesterday morning. The Defence Minister also said the government has nothing to hide from international human rights organisations of the present operation of the military forces in the country.
Any human rights organisation can come to investigate to see if such torture-chambers are available, he added.
Minister Wijewardene said it is very clear that international human rights organisations are fed with false facts by certain groups of Diaspora in order to continue their status as refugees of war and subsequently to raise funds.
He also said the Yahapalana government has has assured all Sri Lankans of their human rights.
Minister Wijewardene pointed out the government will not allow an inclusion of foreign judges to the examinations done on war crimes in Sri Lanka.
If they desire, they can observe the proceedings but not to examine, he said.

Navy rescues two more jumbos at sea in Trincomalee
Navy personnel attached to the Eastern Naval Command rescued two elephants that were swept out to the sea, between Round Island and Foul Point, Trincomalee yesterday morning.
The jumbos in troubled waters were first noticed by an Inshore Patrol Craft on routine sea patrol. A combined rescue mission was launched by the Navy and Wildlife officials to save the two wild elephants. The Navy augmented the rescue mission deploying three more Fast Attack Craft, on patrol and a team of Navy divers.
The mammoth effort of the rescue teams saw the two jumbos being carefully directed to the shore without any harm to the animals. They were subsequently released to the Foul Point jungle.
A team of navy personnel belonging to the same naval command saved an elephant caught in current in the seas about 8 Nm off Kokkuthuduwai on July 11.

Newfangled fanaticism
A new approach is needed to understand what attracts some young people to violent extremist groups such as those supporting radical Islam or far-right nationalism. Today the world is troubled by flashpoints of civil strife tearing apart countries from within and outside.
Professor Hilary Pilkington, a sociologist from the University of Manchester in the UK, coordinating the work of the DARE consortium told University World News: The traditional approach to terrorist research is failing because it tends to start by focusing on acts and agents of terrorism, such as the mass shooting at the Bataclan Theatre rock concert in Paris or the suicide bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester and recent terrorist incidents in London.
Young people in the grey zone
Among those leading the four-year European Union-funded research is Viggo Vestel, told University World News: Our emphasis in DARE will be on dialogue. We want to hear young peoples own reflections, thoughts and emotions about these issues. Our research is about radicalisation, of course; but it is not just about attitudes that lead to violent behaviour or attitudes that support violence. It might be how they have become important societal critics.
Whether moderate or radical, young Muslims said that world politics, the big politics, were very important to them. What happened in Chechnya, Iraq, Afghanistan and more recently in Syria and the treatment of Muslims in Burma (Myanmar) and prisoners in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay had a big influence on them.
Terrorism, radicalisation and violent extremism
Extremism and terrorism continue to be understood differently in Western and non-Western contexts. One reason is terminology: Arab media today more commonly use terrorism (irhab) or militant terrorism (irhabmosalah) rather than extremism (tataruf), and there is no equivalent to violent extremism. Writing for Al Hayat newspaper, Al Ghabra (2016) emphasises the Western roots of the concept of terrorism as state-led, highlighting that the most common use todayto describe violence by non-state actorscontradicts this. He argues that a non-state actor who commits violence should not automatically be labelled an extremist or a terrorist: since both state and non-state actors can be violent, terrorism should be defined as deliberate violence that targets innocent civilians and their assets.
Radicalisation in the Far East and South Africa
The Diplomat reports, as Islamic State (ISIS) loses territory in its base, northern Iraq and eastern Syria, fresh concerns about returning foreign fighters have mounted in Southeast Asia. In December 2015, the Soufan Group estimated that some 900 Southeast Asian fighters, with a majority from Indonesia, had travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the fight. Official estimates from Southeast Asian intelligence agencies placed the number between 1,200-1,800. While it is difficult to estimate precisely how many fighters from the region are currently participating, the Straits Times reported most recently that some 392 Indonesians are believed to be fighting for ISIS in Syria. Malaysians have also been seen in ISIS videos, but they are believed to constitute a distinct second to Indonesian fighters.
However, not all Southeast Asian who have traveled to ISIS-controlled territory are fighters. It appears that some 45 percent of the numbers estimated are women and children who have accompanied the men fighting in the Levant. Estimates also include those who have gone to fight alongside other rebel groups, including Jabhat-al-Nusra.
In the first phase, from 2013-2014, the Islamic States potent online propaganda resulted in South Africans moving to join the groups self-declared Caliphate in Iraq and Syria. In the second phase, from 2014-2015, Islamic State recruiters took a more active interest in South Africa, and potential South African recruits were wooed online. Again, the purpose of these interactions was to persuade South Africans to join the Caliphate.
The most recent phase, which began in 2015, saw the Islamic State adopt a different  and more ominous  approach towards its small South African constituency. Coming under increased military pressure in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State sought to expand its global footprint, and consequently directed South African sympathisers to remain at home.
The UN
Antnio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that the organisation had been established to prevent war by binding the international community in a rules-based international order. Today, that order is under grave threat, he stressed, noting that millions of people in crisis looked to the Security Council to preserve global stability and to protect them from harm. However, the enormous human and economic cost of conflicts around the world showed how complex and challenging that was. It was unfortunate that the international community spent far more time and resources responding to crises rather than preventing them. People are paying too high a price. You, the Member States, are paying too high a price. We need a whole new approach, he underscored.
Fod Seck from Senegal, underscoring the need for a paradigm shift in the Councils work, said more resources should be invested in prevention, in particular in Africa. Indeed, the effectiveness and efficiency of the Councils work would depend on its capacity to see, analyse and prevent various threats, and to halt new ones. While the tools needed to achieve those goals existed, political will was often lacking. As a result, the Council acted too late, and its actions were costly and ineffective. Calling for the creation of synergies between the three recent reviews of United Nations peace operations, which had all placed emphasis on the importance of prevention, he said the protection of human rights and people on the ground were the only real guarantees of security. A lack of unity and political will on those issues had sometimes paralysed the Council in 2016, he said, stressing that Member States should unite around
Ana Silvia Rodrguez Abascal from Cuba said many conflicts over the last 70 years could have been prevented had the causes of conflict not been linked to the self-interest of the powerful few. Stable and lasting peace that would prevent the outbreak of conflict required respecting the sovereignty and political independence of all States. Sustainable peace also implied the rejection of aggression. There could be no peace and stability without development and as long as millions continued to be condemned to poverty and hunger. Manipulation and double standards had in no way contributed to peace. Improving the ability of the United Nations to prevent disputes was more effective than shouldering the aftermath of conflict.

Neymar dazzles as Barcelona down Juventus
EAST RUTHERFORD, United States, Sunday  Neymar gave Barcelona fans a dazzling reminder of what they could be about to lose on Saturday, scoring twice as the Spanish giants defeated Juventus 2-1 in a pre-season friendly.
The 25-year-old Brazilian superstar is at the centre of frenzied speculation linking him to a gargantuan, world record 222-million-euro ($256.8 million) transfer to Paris Saint-Germain.
Neymar had kept the guessing game about his future bubbling away after posting a picture of himself looking pensive on Instagram on Friday.
But there was little to suggest that the charismatic striker is overwhelmed by the transfer saga as he produced a bewitching performance in front of a sell-out 82,104 crowd at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
The Brazilian broke clear after only four minutes but saw a tame shot from near the edge of the area drift away from the goal. Barcelona, with Lionel Messi starting, looked by far the more threatening of the two teams with Aleix Vidal and Messi both drawing early blocks from the Juventus defence.
At the other end Mario Mandzukic might have given Juve the lead on 14 minutes but his header from a Stefano Sturaro cross went wide.
The Italians were made to rue Mandzukic's profligacy a minute later when Neymar fired the Catalans into the lead, playing a clever one-two with Paco Alcacer and drilling his finish past Gianluigi Buffon.
Nine minutes later and Neymar grabbed his second, picking his way through a static Juventus defence before burying a low shot beyond Buffon once more.
Neymar might have had a hat-trick three minutes from half-time, when Messi floated a delightful pass in behind the Juve defence for the Brazilian.
Buffon on this occasion was equal to the challenge however and blocked safely. Barcelona rang the changes at half-time, withdrawing all but two of their starting line-up, Neymar exiting for Sergi Roberto and Arda Turan replacing Messi.
Juventus also made a raft of substitutions which led to the introduction of Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain and Douglas Costa amongst others.
The changes immediately gave Juve a sharper attacking edge and Dybala was quick to test Adria Ortola with a rasping shot on 62 minutes that was turned around for a corner.
From the ensuing setpiece, Giorgio Chiellini nodded home Dybala's cross to make it 2-1.
However it was Barcelona who finished the stronger of the two sides, with Luis Suarez repeatedly threatening to extend the Spanish side's lead. Man of the moment Neymar departed the stadium without addressing reporters, while Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde could only repeat his desire to keep the Brazilian.  AFP

Speaking to journalists in Kandy, Rajapaksa said he had no intention of forming a separate party to face the polls but added that he will extend support on an individual basis for those whom he prefers, irrespective of which party they represent.
The former President said he was not sure when the local government polls will be held but going by the words of the Elections Commission Chairman, the elections to appoint members to provincial councils may be held on time.
Rajapaksa rubbished claims that there was an attempt to divide the Malwatte Chapter.
No one can divide the Malwatte chapter. Dont know whether these people are talking about the Peradeniya Malwatte, Rajapaksa said.
Rajapaksa said plans to set up a missing persons office could lead to unnecessary issues. He also questioned the scope of powers vested with such an institution claiming that they seem to even violate the present constitution.

Our proposals for controlling dengue ignored: GMOA
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said authorities were groping in the dark without a scientific solution to the dengue epidemic plaguing the country.
A press release signed by GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge noted that the Association submitted proposals to the President last week to ensure a scientific approach to control and defeat the dengue.
What was happening is quite opposite to our proposals. Every dengue patient must be recorded at the MOH of the respective areas but that process has been completely ignored, the press release noted.
This is essential to control dengue and carry out fumigation and other preventive methods.
Neglecting this procedure would curtail the information on actual figures of the dengue patients and the affected areas, GMOA said.
What guarantee could the Health Ministry give that the true number of dengue patients had not exceeded 100,000 the GMOA asked in its press release.

Our right to new Constitution
The Venerable Mahanayake Theras of the Buddhist Chapters suddenly met in Kandy on July 4 under the leadership of the Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayaka Most Venerable Warakagoda Gnanaratna Thera. The purpose is to stall the ongoing Constitution-making process which is already more or less halfway through. First of all, the million dollar question is as to why such a concern on their part arose after nearly one and a half years, and not at the beginning of the process.
As is well known, the National Unity Government, with the two traditional arch rivals happily joining hands for the first time in the countrys long term interest, secured the peoples mandate to form the National Unity Government, inter alia, to enact and operate a new Constitution. Hence, it is irrevocably incumbent on the Government to carry out the sovereign peoples mandate, and there shouldnt be any hindrance from any quarter in this respect. Of course, all sections of the people of all races and religions have had the opportunity to present their views and ideas from the time the Public Representations Committee headed by a political leader and Attorney-at-law Lal Wijenaike started functioning at the inception. What has to be borne in mind by one and all is that the peoples mandate cannot be jettisoned.
Executive Presidency
Now, it is common knowledge that the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had pledged in 2005 to abolish the Executive Presidency, reneged on that pledge. On the contrary, having gone halfway through his second term, he got the infamous 18th Amendment passed in Parliament to remove the mandatory two-term limit to seek election to the Presidency, insatiably aspiring to become the first third term President, but of course it misfired thanks to the will of the people which is the most paramount factor.
Presently, of course, he is a Member of Parliament as well as the foremost leader of the Joint Opposition (JO) representing the dissident wing of the UPFA, including the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), the National Freedom Front (NFF) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) led by Parliamentarians Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila respectively. The notorious propaganda of the JO is that (a) Federalism has all but been conceded, putting paid to the Unitary State system, and (b) that the foremost place given to Buddhism is being compromised. Such a bizarre misleading propaganda is nothing but an insult to their own intelligence, besides taking the sovereign people for fools.
National Unity Government
Well, the National Unity Government appeared somewhat taken aback by the sudden moves of the Buddhist Chapters which might well erode the Governments 2015 mandate to take the country along the path of peace and reconciliation, to fast-track economic development for democracy to thrive, so that people of all races and religions could live in peace and amity.
In the meantime, President Maithripala Sirisena has met with the Mahanayake Theras in Kandy and assured them that there will be due consultations with them once the final draft of the Constitution is ready. Of course, the Mahanayake Theras can have their say even at this stage of the Constitution-making processes, but at the end of the day, the National Unity Government should boldly act in accordance with the peoples mandate handed down at the two elections in 2015. What is of most paramount importance is that there should be no question of pandering to the whims and fancies of any segment, apparently driven by a hidden hand.
Bandaranaike- Chelvanayakam pact
It is quite appropriate in this connection quote a journalist of yore of no mean repute, Tarzie Vitachchi, from his book titled Emergency 58. Here is what he said on the question of the price paid for pandering:
When a Government, however popular, begins to pander to racial or religious emotionalism, merely because it is the loudest of the raucous demands made on it, and then meddles in the administration and enforcement of law and order for the benefits of its favourites, or win the plaudits of a crowd, however hysterical it may be, catastrophe is certain.
What is historically relevant to remember in this connection is the situation that led to Bandaranaikes unilateral abrogation of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam pact in 1958, that is well-nigh six decades ago. Chelvanayakam had consciously accepted the pact, knowing well that it was a halfway house, even though some of his confidants had their own reservations.
The fact that Bandaranaike found himself meekly abrogating the B-C pact due to extraneous pressure especially from the Buddhist clergy, is history, and a real tragedy; for had the BC pact been fully implemented sans any obstructions, the chequered problem could well have been well and truly finally resolved as the years went by, and there would certainly have been no war and the colossal destruction of life, limb and property.
Let lessons be learnt. Let wisdom prevail. Better late than never.

A path paved for peace
A group of civil society members, religious dignitariesmembers of inter-religious organisations, Women and Development Organisation representatives, war victims, former LTTE cadres, media and representatives of the business community, recently came together for at the American Corner in Aththiyad Lane, Navalar Rd in Jaffna, for a survey on what people of the North thought need be addressed for lasting peace and reconciliation in the country.
Yearning for lasting peace and reconciliation
Ven. Meegahajambure Ghanarathana Thera.
Almost all those who had been interviewed pointed out grievances of the same nature; they yearned for lasting peace and reconciliation in the country and did not want another war. All the participants at the interviews were also unanimous in the view that the Government had to find effective mechanisms to promote ethnic and inter-religious harmony, lasting peace and reconciliation. They stressed that there was a delay in the implementation of activities promised by the current government and in finding effective solutions for their genuine grievances.
The Northern community, they said, was the worst-affected by the war and many still remember the suffering they underwent due to decades of conflict.
They said, the previous government never took action to resolve the post-war issues affecting the day-to day lives of the war victims and they had started to doubt whether this regime too, could solve their grievances.
Disappearances
Jeyakanthi Narmilas husband from Thilaiyampathi in Kondavil, Jaffna, disappeared on August 17, 2007. She alleged that he was taken away by the Army in a white van.
Some Army soldiers reached my home in a white vanit was around 3.30 am. He has not returned since. I havent heard anything about him. I made complaints about the abduction of my husband to both, the Uralu Army Camp and the Kopai Police, she said.
Six months after the disappearance, she had seen her husband on a motorcycle pillion, ridden by an Army soldier. Three years later, she saw her husband once again, in an army truck.
J. Vathsala and family.
On that day, a piece of cloth was tied around his mouth. Thereafter, I never saw my husband again. I have two children and I find it extremely difficult to feed them. I live with my mother and suffer to earn a living, doing odd jobs as a labourer. What had happened to my husband I need justice, she added.
J. Vathsala, a resident of Gurunagar, Jaffna, said that her husband was killed by a shell attack during the final phase of the war. He was employed as a security officer for the LTTE.
I was pregnant then. My husband Benjamin Jayasingham was 33 years old when this incident took place. That was in 2009 at Puthukkudyiruppu, Mullaitivu. He was paralyzed and rushed to Vavuniya Hospital by the ICRC. His wound were infected and he died when the shrapnel was removed, she said.
My father was a fisherman. He was killed by the Navy in the deep sea, along with some other fishermen. When my mother went to Palaly camp, she was informed that all the fishermen had been killed, she added.
I have two sons and two daughters aged 19, 17, 15 and 10 years, respectively, she said.
Her elder son passed the G.C.E. (A.L.) and the other son has just sat for his G.C.E. (O.L.) exam. The elder one is temporarily employed as a labourer and earns Rs. 800 per day. Her two daughters are still studying and she makes string hoppers daily, to support her family.
During the final phase of the war, my sister and her family tried to escape to India by boat, but the Navy shot at the boat. An Indian fishermen rescued her and her infant child, but her husband was killed. My sister and her children returned to Sri Lanka and are now in Mullaitivu, she said.
Her hope was, all communities in Sri Lanka to be allowed to live in peace and harmony without discrimination.
N. Ravindradasan and his wife.
She suggested that peace and reconciliation units consisting members of all communities be established in all areas to avoid another bloody war.
N. Ravindradasan, 62, from Keerimalai, Jaffna, is an ex-LTTE supporter and used to work as a library assistant at the University of Jaffna,
Im a former supporter of the LTTE movement. I prepared porridge and soup for LTTE cadres. My second daughter joined the movement voluntarily when she was only 17; that was in 1998. She died in 2001 due to a claymore mine and her body was handed over to us by the LTTE, Ravindradasan said.
During the Ceasefire Agreement signed between the LTTE and the Government, Ravindradasan got his old job back as the library assistant at the university.
My own house at Kankasanthurai was acquired by the Army as they said, it was located in the High Security Zone. So we left for Kilinochchi. At that time, I heard once again that the war could start, so we left to Puthukkudyiruppu without informing the university authorities, he added.
We all lived on the beach there, inside a tent provided by the UNHCR. My elder daughter, her husband, two of my grandsons and my son, were sleeping one day while my wife and I were away on the beach. I heard the sound of a bomb exploding near the tent. When we got to the tent, it was on fire, I could only rescue my son who was suffering severely from the injuries, he said.
LTTE cadres in the location, rushed his son in a truck to an area called Mathalan. Five people from his family were buried in a mass grave on that beach.
His wounds needed 84 stitches and throughout his university career, he was always emotionally disturbed that his hands did not work as they used to. Both, he and his girlfriend, were only 22 years old when they committed suicide by jumping into a pond in Kopai, he added.
Ravindradasan and his wife are the only survivors of their family and they live temporarily in a house given to them free of rent by his friend in Keerimalai, Jaffna.
There is no difference between the Northern politicians and their counterparts in the other provinces of the country. Lasting peace and reconciliation are of no use for us as all our family members have already been killed. Two years into the new government, nothing worthwhile has been done to solve the burning problems of the war victims. We are living in another persons house while my own house is occupied by the army. There is no war now; our house has to be released. Ravindradasan said.
He also asked that the Government take action against certain Southern politicians who were in the habit of rousing communal sentiments in order to come into power.
Naga Vihara, Jaffna
The Naga Vihara Chief Incumbent Ven. Meegahajambure Ghanarathana Thera said that the temple was completely destroyed 5 April, 1985, by the LTTE. In 1995, the Sri Lankan Army re-captured Jaffna under the Rivirasa-02 operation.
The reconstruction of the temple began in 1995 and unemployed Tamil youth too, were employed in reconstruction work, Ghanarathana Thera said.
The temple was reopened by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during the Ceasefire Agreement.
Irrespective of ethnic or religious differences, all communities in Jaffna are in the habit of taking part in all the religious ceremonies held at the Naga Vihara. Religious dignitaries representing all religions actively take part in inter-religious discussions conducted in the Naga Vihara Temple when resolving issues relevant to peace and reconciliation, he said.
Ven. Ghanarathana Thera requested, Systematic programmes be implemented to rebuild the shattered minds of the war-affected communities in the North.
Mechanisms the government promised to promote lasting peace and reconciliation in the Jaffna Peninsula are proving to be very slow and this causes frustration once again in the minds of the Northern communities, he added.
Language Barriers
The Chief Incumbent also asked that the government send qualified teachers to teach Sinhala in Northern schools, similar to the manner in which Tamil is taught in Southern schools, to solve the language barrier between the two communities. He stressed that there was a serious shortage of qualified teachers in the schools in the North.
He explained that when the former Chief Incumbent, Ven. Meegahajambure Sirivimala Thera (presently in Switzerland), was at the Naga Vihara, he formed an inter-religious committee and launched numerous programmes to solve the unrest created among the students of the University of Jaffna.
Lack of livelihood opportunities
The Chief Incumbent also asked that more factories be opened in the North to solve the employment problems and that resources be equally distributed to all people without ethnic discrimination.
The housing schemes started for the war victims at the beginning are not suitable for human habitation when compared to the recently provided houses. New housing schemes have to be started to relocate civilians, if there is a delay in releasing the houses and lands in the High Security Zones, he said. Child abuse, incidents of rape, use of intoxicating varieties of drugs are not rare in Jaffna or other parts of the Northern province. This could be due to the abuse of the new-won freedom after a long bondage by the LTTE, he added.
Women and Development
A woman feeds her infant at a makeshift hut, waiting for her home to be released from the High Security Zone.
Jaffna-based Women and Development Organisation Chairman Saroja Sivachanthiran said, lasting peace and reconciliation should not be confined only to words.
The fishing industry in the Northern Province had been gravely affected, causing economic problems for the fishing community. Fishermen from the South, as well as Indian fishermen, were in the practice of stealing the fishing resources of the Northern Sea, she added.
There are close to 80,000-90,000 war widows. Whether they were wives of the members of the Army, Navy, Air Force or the LTTE does not matter. Widows have the same grievances; all should be treated the same. The facilities provided to widows of the Government Forces are not provided to the widows of the LTTE cadres and this can be identified as yet another type of discrimination, she said.
The issues of missing persons were also highlighted and she called for certificates of disappearances at least to be handed out to those who cannot be found.
She also asked that government forces not engage in commercial activities which impacted local businesses.
The crime rates have gone up and a large number of liquor shops are found in Jaffna, sometimes in close proximity to schools, she said. She added that the number of school dropouts in the province had also increased significantly.
Sivachanthiran proposed certain solutions such as: creating avenues for job opportunities, ensuring equal rights irrespective of ethnic and religious differences, a proper system in the protection of human rights, increasing the number of Northern women entering local government bodies and Parliament and to have exchange programmes from women from the North to the South and vice-versa.
Jaffna National Youth Services Council former Director Wimalesvari Srikantha Ruban said, war-affected civilians had no funds to cultivate their lands.
Several Organisations had also submitted their proposals on the proposed constitutional reforms, but the Government had not taken action to silence the racist politicians in the so-called Joint Opposition, she added.
The Media
LTTE former Media Spokesman V. Thayanithy, alias Day Master, who is presently employed as the News Editor of Dan TV, said that the Northerners were peaceful and the civilians never made remarks to antagonise the Sinhala community in the South.
The present government was inactive and conveniently ignoring finding solution for the problems of the citizens of the country, including the communities in the North. Thus, paving the way for the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to come to power, Thayanithy said, quoting a recent news report appeared in Veerakesari on a speech made by a certain veteran peace activist.
The Northerners live in constant fear whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would come back to power again. Those who need lasting peace and reconciliation never advocate what he preached whenever he visited Buddhist Temples, Thayanithy added.
He said, the Government should resort to the internationally-recognized mechanisms such as, Truth Commissions and Transitional Justice Mechanisms to provide opportunities for war victims to reveal their genuine grievances. These mechanisms could help the Government to find solutions for the unaddressed issues of the war-affected, he added.

Plans afoot to elevate Navy: Wijewardene
State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said plans are afoot to elevate the standards of the Sri Lankan Navy while strengthening it with high tech facilities. As a part of the plan, the government has imported a fully armoured warship for the Sri Lankan Navy from India.
The new warship claims to be the largest ship with the Sri Lanka Navy.
The plan to modernise Sri Lanka Navy comes as a result of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe paying special attention to the important role played by the Sri Lanka Navy in securing Sri Lankas sea lines, State Minister Wijewardene said.
The Defense State Minister said the Sri Lanka Navy holds the responsibility of deterring substance smuggling into the country, especially from Pakistan, while monitoring illegal fishing activities in the northern sea area.
State Minister Wijewardena said the government will import a similar warship in the the future.
He was speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday morning.

PM makes impassioned public appeal
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday (Sunday) called for the stepping up of efforts to control the spread of dengue and made an impassioned public appeal for cooperation to destroy mosquito breeding grounds in their neighbourhoods.
The Prime Minister said the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump in April triggered problems relating to municipal solid waste management and increased the mosquitos breeding grounds.
He recalled that the Supreme Court had issued an order temporarily banning the dumping of garbage at Muthrajawela after the Meethotamulla collapse that led to the deaths of nearly 40 people.
Despite the (temporary) ban, I hope the issue will be resolved after the court case is concluded, the Prime Minister said addressing the diamond jubilee celebrations of the government Medical Laboratory Technologists at Temple Trees yesterday.
He said although the government which came to power in 2015 had identified the need for a permanent solution for the garbage crisis, various court action had prevented the use of any of the locations the authorities earmarked alternatives to Meethotamulla.
However, the authorities were now able to dispose of garbage at Karadiyana and Dompe and long-term garbage-to-energy projects were also expected to be ready shortly.
The need now is to control the spread of dengue. We need to step up our efforts, the Prime Minister said adding that hospitals were overflowing with dengue patients.
Cleaning schools (of mosquito breeding grounds) and their surroundings is taking place, the Prime Minister said. If residents can take care of their homes and neighbourhoods and ensure they dont allow mosquito breeding, we can resolve this problem more easily.
He applauded Health Minister Rajith Senaratne for his efforts to launch a multi-pronged campaign to save lives and also take preventive measures to contain the virus.
The health minister has got all stake holders involved in this effort and the President is giving his utmost to tackle this problem, the Prime Minister said.
He said government laboratories played a key role in detecting dengue and helping with effective treatment although there were several shortcomings with private sector labs which delayed blood reports thereby undermining effective treatment.
The government had allocated 350 million rupees to import urgently needed equipment to deal with the sudden demand for blood tests from suspected dengue patients.
We have lost several lives, we cant allow our people to suffer like this, the prime Minister said. It is our responsibility to control dengue and eventually eradicate it.
Official figures show that there had been over 100,000 reported cases of dengue this year and about 250 people have succumbed to the virus.
Australia last week offered 1.5 million Australian dollars (Rs. 172 million) to manage dengue patients as well as engage in long-term research with the Monash University to battle the spread of dengue.

PM says government will immediately procure new equipment for dengue tests
The Government will immediately procure new equipment for laboratory tests on Dengue, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He said Rs 350 million was allocated for the purpose. He was speaking at the Diamond Jubilee Anniversary of the Government Medical Laboratory Technologists Association at Temple Trees yesterday.
Procurements will be done by the Health Ministry, and we have instructed to import them as soon as possible without following the tender procedure. Now our responsibility is to control dengue and gradually eliminate it. The dengue spread worsened due to garbage issue, he said.
The Prime Minister, highlighting the importance of giving laboratory test reports on dengue within an hour, said the Health Minister would take stern action against the private hospitals and laboratories which delay blood test reports.
The Premier said durable solution to garbage issue is now being worked out and added that the collapse of Meethotamulla garbage dump was a result of not addressing the garbage disposal issue by successive governments.
