Political elements tarnishing Armys image
Alleging that certain political elements are attempting to tarnish the reputation of the Sri Lankan Army, Media Director Brigadier Sumith Atapattu issued a statement on Friday in response.
He addresses issues such as foreign allowances, army rations, and payments for disabled veterans, which he says have been mischaracterized in the media.
Following is the full text:
It has been observed that certain elements with malicious and vested interests and hidden agendas are currently engaged in an organized vilification of the Army, particularly with the motive of demoralizing, and misleading its soldiers and tarnishing its image. In the most recent past, it has been done by way of spreading or publishing unfounded and fabricated stories of vicious nature in all types of media when it relates to foreign allowances, rations, payments for disabled War Heroes, etc, to highlight a few.
Firstly, the Army would like to place following facts in correct perspective in regard to allocation and payment of foreign allowances to Army Officers proceeding on overseas training assignments.
In keeping with the circular, specifying the provision of such allowances to overseas-bound tri-service officers for training assignments, all those payment are also done only after scrutiny of terms in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that has been signed between the overseas host and the Sri Lanka Army before the departure of the attendee. Many such overseas assignments, implemented through the goodwill that prevail between the host and the Sri Lanka Army, generally provide board and lodging and other facilities gratis or a living allowance, quite sufficient to the attendee for stay during the assignment.
The Army has also already taken measures to clear a backlog of Rs 200 m, remained in arrears earlier as foreign allowances for the years 2016 / 2017 in coordination with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) by January 2018.
Likewise, a novel project that has been launched on an experimental basis with the good intention of providing each soldier with a nutritious lunch when on duty has also been found misinterpreted giving a distorted version.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Commander of the Army after perusing a recent report of the nutritionists at the Colombo Army Hospital and elsewhere under the ongoing Healthy Army - Healthy Nation (HAHN) project, directed authorities to introduce a pilot project among members serving the Security Force Headquarters  West (SFHQ-West) to improve the physical health state of each serving soldier by way of providing All Ranks, including those living outside with a sumptuous and nutritious lunch when on duty.
This pilot project was also prompted after medical authorities and nutritionists recommended each soldier be supplemented with 3500 - 4000 calories per day, considering the need for his / her physical fitness for duties.
Accordingly, this new scheme purely on the basis of providing a healthy lunch to All Ranks came into effect only within the formations of the SFHQ-West on experimental basis, effective from 1 January 2018. Deduction of the expenditure for this new ration arrangement were to be made against the salary of each soldier living outside, based only on the number of consumed lunch portions every month. However, those still wishing to bring their lunch daily from home were exempted from this scheme, if they so desire. Nevertheless, concerns or any other grievances to that effect are still being addressed by respective Commanding Officers on request since this project was just launched. Therefore, a question of any salary deduction does not arise as alleged and misinterpreted.
It is also regretted to note that some politically-manipulated elements with vested interests are found behind regularly organized street protests of some disabled War Heroes or members of their families, although their issues have been resolved to a large extent with 100% increase in their pension and disabled payments.
Those elements, serving different political agendas were also screened abusing a video commercial that has been produced solely by the Army for promotion of its image and the recruitment drive, now underway. This also amounts to an act that brings discredit to hundreds of War Heroes who truly defended the countrys sovereignty and peace and a deliberate attempt to associate the Army with political agendas.
The Sri Lanka Army, now fully committed to the national security and nation-building roles of the country as the most sought service provider with strict focus on concerns of reconciliation and development, therefore appeals all segments of our society to keep the Army off from their machination and all acts of intentional vilification and public ridicule for the greater benefit of the Nation.

Tea blending for re-export a destructive practice
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday decried the practice of blending inferior foreign teas with local teas for re-export, saying it was highly damaging to the local tea industry.
Addressing the media at the Presidents House, President Sirisena said this practice has been identified as one of the reasons for the loss of export revenues. This will devalue the Ceylon Tea brand and make it less appealing to foreign buyers who seek genuine Ceylon Tea.
A similar situation has arisen with the re-export of pepper and pineapple, he said. The Pepper industry has been affected as a result of mixing lower quality foreign pepper with local pepper and re-exporting. No action has been taken on these matters by the relevant authorities.
The president also disclosed another serious problem that affects the Cost of Living vis-a-vis the pricing of imported foods and other essential goods. For example, a food item that costs Rs.500 to import is often priced at Rs.1500, whereas it should cost only Rs.750 or so. This is a grave injustice to the consumer, who has to pay triple for a product that costs only Rs.500. Some entities profit enormously through this unfair practice. The Consumer Affairs Authority must step in to prevent this and protect the consumer.
Such practices are not conducive to a healthy economy, he added. We have taken many steps to improve the economy which was in very bad shape in 2015. However we have to address shortcomings like this to improve the economy. Economic management has to improve.
Commenting on the much-delayed Audit Bill, the President said it would finally see the light of day soon. Auditing was an essential component of a good economy. This Bill was to be brought in 2016. I have spoken about this over 100 times. The National Audit Commission members have told me they were idling. This is not an enviable situation at all. There seems to be a lethargic attitude about this on some sectors, which could have been the cause for the delay.
Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando said the Audit Bill will soon be ready for presentation and implementation, having completed the drafting process.

Disappearance of 11 youths:
Another Navy suspect arrested
The CID had arrested retired Navy officer Luthuwahandige Thushara Mendis on January 23, in connection with the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008.
He was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on January 24 and ordered to be remanded.
According to the CID, Mendis had served as the senior Master Chief Petty Officer in the Special Intelligence Unit headed by Lieutenant Commander Sumith Ranasinghe, and had been involved in the abduction of Ali Anver in Katunayake.
Ali Anver was an informant to this intelligence group. Mendis had also been part of the Navy Special Intelligence team that had allegedly taken the eight abducted youths to the Gun side underground camp at the Trincomalee Naval Base, from where they were being held at the Naval camp in Chaithya Road, Colombo Fort.
A CID source told the Daily News that Mendis had been in charge of a boat which provided support to this special intelligence team, especially in the disposing of bodies. He had served under Ranasinghe from 2008 to 2009 attached to the Parakrama Naval base.
CID investigations had revealed that on October 17, 2008, the intelligence team had obtained an open warrant and raided a house near the Dehiwela Police Station and arrested five youths including Rajiv Naganathan, Pradeep Vishvanathan, Thilakeshwaran Ramalingam, Mohommed Jilan and Mohommed Saajith.
The five youths were allegedly taken in their black Indigo car (KC 5565) and held at the Pittu Bambuwa jail under Lt.Commander Hettiarachchi.
However, during the period from December 31, 2008 to the end of March 2009, one of the abducted youth, Rajiv Naganathan had been in contact with his parents Govindasamy Naganathan and Maarachchige Sarojini Perera.
The Navy personnel guarding these abducted youths had lent them their mobile phones for them to contact their families.
The CID sources said that Ali Anver had been the informant to this special Navy team, but he too disappeared in 2009. However, it was revealed during the investigations that in fact, Rajiv Naganathan had told his parents that Ali Anver had also been arrested and he was being beaten up. The five boys had been later taken to Trincomalee by Mendis and Ranasinghe.
Further, the Indigo car had been taken to Giriulla by Thammitage Dharmadasa and Aluthgedara Upul Bandara, who had also given evidence.
The duo were residents of Giriulla. Further, several Navy personnel too had given evidence confirming the detention of these youths. CID sources also added that they had obtained evidence that the Indigo car had later been handed over to the former Navy Spokesman Commander Dassanayake. Further investigations are under way.

Avant Garde case:
Commission recommends filing criminal cases against Gota, Senadhipathi and 11 others
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry has recommended filing criminal cases against 13 individuals including former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Avant Garde Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi over the Avant Garde case.
The final report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday.
The other individuals against whom the Commission recommends filing criminal cases over the Avant Garde case include former Additional Defence Secretary Damayanthi Jayaratne, former Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL) CEO Major General K.B. Egodawela, former RALL Chairman Major General Palitha Fernando, former Minister Rohitha Bogollagama, former Mayor Dhanasiri Amaratunga, former Mayor Janaka Ranawaka, former MP Duminda Silva,
Western Provincial Councilor Upali Kodikara, former Navy Commanders Jayantha Perera and Jayanath Colombage and Rohanaweera De Zoysa.
The Commission has held that the state officials among those mentioned above are deemed not fit to hold any office in the public service hereafter. It observed the former Navy Commanders, who acted in a manner that Avant Garde Maritimes Services gets undue benefit, have been recruited to the company at higher salaries after their retirement.
It has proposed taking legal action against the deployment of RALL employees at election work and crediting those expenses to RALL, depriving a considerable income to the Navy by handing over the floating armory project to Avant Garde and not issuing permits under the Firearms Ordinance to the weapons possessed by the RALL.
It has also recommended that the Auditor General must be given full authority to audit the business undertakings with majority shares to the Government in the same manner that the public enterprises are being audited.

India's 69th Republic Day celebrated
The Indian High Commission and the Indian expatriate community in Sri Lanka celebrated the 69th Republic Day of India yesterday at India House in Colombo. High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu unfurled the Indian flag and inspected a Guard of Honour presented by a contingent of the Border Security Force. He read out excerpts from the Address to the Nation on the eve of the Republic Day by President of India Ram Nath Kovind.
The President of India recalled with gratitude the sacrifices made by millions of freedom fighters in obtaining Independence and creating the Republic of India. Presidents address complimented the contribution of various sections of people including soldiers, farmers, mothers, doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, teachers, scientists, missile technologists, engineers, senior citizens, youth, children and many more, to the Republic in diverse ways. The ideal of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam  of the World being One Family and the principles of compassion, of assisting those in need, of building capacities of our neighbors are the principles that underpin Indian society - the very principles India brings to the International Community. President further urged all to renew the sense of selflessness, determination and commitment to craft a modern India that is both a land of talent- and a land of unlimited opportunities for that talent.
The High Commissioner congratulated the Government of Sri Lanka on completion of three years in office. Recalling that both India and Sri Lanka celebrate 70 years of independence, he highlighted the special place Sri Lanka has in the hearts of Indian people. He recalled the exceptional high level bilateral visits including the landmark visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May 2017. He further enumerated some of the many achievements in the last year including the expansion of Indian assisted 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service nationwide, completion of nearly 46000 houses in the North and East and ongoing construction of 14000 houses in the plantation sector, fresh infrastructure assistance of US$ 318 million for development of Sri Lanka Railways and US$ 45 million for renovation of Kangesanturai Harbor among others. He added that Indias total development assistance to Sri Lanka stood at US$ 2.76 billion, with over US$545 million as outright grants.

JITF Gateway to the North attracts stakeholders
The largest Consumer Exhibition and Trade Fair in the North, Jaffna International Trade Fair (JITF 2018), opened yesterday and would conclude on Sunday. The event aptly named as Gateway to the North is held at Jaffna Municipal Council Grounds.
The event in its ninth year was opened by the Chief Minister of the Northern Province, C. Vigneswaran and Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage. The event is organized by Lanka Exhibition and Conference (Pvt) Limited, with a record 313 stalls overtaking the previous year tally of 290 stalls.
This year the event has attracted 72 Indian companies sponsored and hosted by ASSOCHAM of India (The Associated Chamber of Commerce in India) as well as from Bangladesh and other countries.
Indian Consul General for India in Jaffna, A. Natarajan said the event is growing from strength to strength and the annual Indian participation too is growing. However I am sad to note that these Indian companies do not bring a lot of investments to North East.
The Exhibition is widely accepted as a must-attend in the event- calendar for all stakeholders in the supply chain and in the procurement process.
The event offers many attractions for visitors of all ages which includes an amusement park for children, all types of food and beverage, hawker type food courts and special discounts for over 1000 products.

The fisherman who went fishing from the Trincomalee harbour on January 12, aboard the multiday fishing trawler Minos Putha, had taken seriously ill due to high fever out at sea.
Upon receipt of information, the Navy promptly dispatched the Fast Attack Craft P 4446 to the sea area about 100 nautical miles off Trincomalee harbour. Having reached the location, the patient was safely transferred to the naval craft and brought to the Trincomalee harbour.
Subsequently, he was rushed to the Trincomalee District Hospital for further treatment.

No decision yet on running in 2019 - President
President Maithripala Sirisena told the media yesterday that he has not yet taken any decision on seeking another term at the Presidential Election slated for 2019.
I did not expect to become President. All others who have become Presidents before me have been prime ministers or opposition leaders.
I am the only one who went straight to the Presidency from a ministerial post. There are lots of things I have to do before I think about another term, President Sirisena said, addressing the media at the Presidents House.
But I do not know where my mission will end.
I will do politics till I die. I am very much a political organism, having engaged in politics for 50 years. I might not need a political office to serve the people, he added. He pointed out that many people were angry with him due to his policies. I fought against the tobacco industry and the pharmaceutical companies. I came to the Presidency on a platform of opposition to corruption, waste and fraud.
He said it was abhorrent that one of the biggest frauds ever committed in this country happened recently. He will not hesitate to act against the persons who had given support to the bond issue perpetrators. However, this has created many opponents for him.
Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake has spoken against me. He says the Bond Commission report contains falsehoods. He tried to speak about it several times  first the Prime Minister prevented then and then the Speaker. It would be political suicide to make a statement like that.
The President emphasised that he has taken on the challenge of taking the country towards a righteous era. I will do my utmost, I just do not where it will end. It is not an easy task by any means. I will do everything possible to turn this country around. I am sure the people will bless my policies.
Improving the economy would be a priority. The cost of living has to be reduced and agricultural and other sectors have to be developed. However, all must acknowledge that the economy is in vastly better shape now than it was in 2015 when there was an economic crisis. The International community had almost imposed sanctions back then, through steps such as the GSP Plus withdrawal and fish exports ban to the EU. His ascension to the presidency helped the country to overcome these crises.

President calls for broad alliance to fight corruption
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday called for a broad alliance to fight corruption in the face of an emerging unholy alliance that seeks to scuttle probes into acts of corruption.
Those who fear the probes that would follow the recent publication of both the Bond Commission report and the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into serious acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC) have now teamed up to form an unholy alliance of tainted politicians from various political affiliations, President Sirisena told media heads and senior journalists at a media briefing at the Presidents House.
This unholy alliances primary aim is to block investigations and court cases into their sordid dealings, the President said. They have gone to the extent of obstructing investigations and intimidating investigating police officers.
He called on the media and civil society to rise up against his unholy alliance through a counter alliance that stands for truth and justice and strengthens politicians and officials who fight corruption. We will take action against all wrongdoers regardless of party or rank. There are powerful individuals with plenty of money who want to stop these investigations.
But we are determined to go ahead with the probes and punish the culprits as soon as possible, he stressed.
The President noted that the almost simultaneous release of the Bond Commission Report and the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into serious acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC) seems to have silenced many politicians who were vociferously demanding action on the Bond Commission Report. Even I did not expect both reports to come within 2-3 days of each other. We had an opportunity to release the reports to Parliament and the Internet. Many people have now gone silent after they came out together.
Repeating his stance that at least 2-3 days Parliamentary debate would be required to thrash out the issues raised in both reports, the President said those who clamoured for a debate on the Bond Commission Report had clammed up since the twin reports contain material that can potentially be politically disadvantageous to certain individuals on both sides (Govt/Opposition) of the political spectrum. Hence, the lackluster response to his open challenge to hold the debate on the Bond Commission Report before February 10, he added. No party except for the SLFP was keen on a debate.
Flatly refuting allegations that he had deliberately hidden certain parts of the report by the Presidential Commission on the bond issue, the President said there were however certain materials in the report which are needed to trace the lost funds and take legal action against the culprits. Maintaining confidentiality with regard to these documents was very important.
There are no gaps in the report, although there are nearly two truckloads of documents pertaining to it which have to be studied to fully comprehend the whole issue. When I received the Bond Commission Report, I wanted to study it with my lawyers for at least two weeks, but there was an immediate politically motivated clamour to release it. So I did that and also read out a written statement which was drafted in consultation with top lawyers and experts, solely because of its gravity. This was in fact the first time ever I received help to draft a statement.
The President also pointed out a trend where some borrowings had flowed into private entities without any accountability to the Cabinet or Parliament during the last three years. It has been revealed that these are linked to certain businesses and entities connected to some figures who were in the Government.
This is a reason for reduced Government revenue. There are also instances where only 40-50 percent of budgetary allocations for certain subjects had been spent. These issues must be probed in-depth, the President asserted.
The President said he has told the Prime Minister and other relevant persons that corruption cases should not be filed without solid evidence. We do not want to have any cases that will get thrown away. I want lawyers to go through these files and gather evidence meticulously to avoid such a situation. I have given the same instructions with regard to the case against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.

SLFPYPA demands MRs expulsion
Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professionals Association (SLFPYPA) representatives said that their association will urge the SLFP Central Committee to expel Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa from the post of party patron.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday, SLFPYPA member Rajika Kodithuwakku said the Parliamentarian Rajapaksa cannot be considered as a SLFP member anymore since he stands for the victory of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of G.L. Peiris.
It is clear that Rajapaksa is working for the SLPP.
It seems that he is acting as the Brand Ambassador of the SLPP. Therefore, he is no more a SLFP member and how he can be an advisor of the party Kodithuwakku queried.
Accordingly, the SLFPYPA will suggest to the Central Committee of SLFP to expel Rajapaksa from the SLFP adviser post with immediate effect, he said.
Kodithuwakku claimed that Rajapaksa tries to split the SLFP by betraying it while promoting the SLPP of G.L.Peiris.
As professionals, we request the Central Committee to sack those who betray the party and stand for the victory of any other political streams, Kodithuwakku added. He further alleged that not only Rajapaksa, but his siblings Gotabhaya and Basil also had betrayed the SLFP.
Both Gota and Basil are responsible for several financial irregularities amounting to billions, he said.
It has been estimated that there is financial misconduct of US $ 7.5 million relating to the MiG fighter jet deal for which Gotas name is linked during the Rajapaksa regime. There is no responsible person for the huge loss of US $ 7.5 million eventhough the country lost such a huge amount of public wealth, Kodithuwakku said.
Speaking on Basil Rajapaksas political conduct, Kodithuwakku said that Basil is engaging in a political game to coverup his black money. He does not need to make the SLPP win. Speaking on the Presidential Commission report on the Treasury Bond issue, Kodithuwakku said no Commission report was out during the Rajapaksa regime eventhough he appointed many commissions.
Unlike President Sirisena, the Rajapaksas wanted to hide the truth by appointing a commission, he said. By speaking on the Treasury Bond Commission report, the Joint Opposition wants to protect their members, who have faced charges of financial irregularities.

SLPP should take responsibility for rift in SLFP:Minister Yapa
The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) should take responsibility for the rift in the Sri Lanaka Freedom Party, despite the friendly hand extended by its leadership on various occasions, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday.
He said the SLFP was so enormous that it was two fold larger than the UNP. "But it was defeated since it did not understand the pulse of the common people," Minister Yapa said. "Even grave yards in the Gampaha district have been carpeted, but Gampaha was defeated for the first time in in its history. Educated people shunned a few members of a family who were enjoying the dividends of politics."
He made these observations, during a rally held at Gampaha yesterday.
He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena permitted us to contest together at the previous General Election in order to set up our own government. "But some politicians outside did not permit us to do so," Minister Yapa said.
He added that the SLFP was a living party and it would grow continuously though the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna was attempting to split it.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the previous government was defeated as it did not punish wrong doers. He said that President Maithripala Sirisena always stood against corruption. He stated that the President had attempted to look into the Treasury bond issue since 2008. "So that the members of the SLPP and the UNP were attacking the President today," Minister Jayasekara said.
Former MP Piyasiri Wijenayake also spoke on the occasion.

Thajudeen Murder case:
Statements recorded from several close associates of MRs family
The CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen yesterday informed Court that it has recorded statements from several individuals who were close associates with the family members of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Filing a further report in Court, the CID informed Colombo Additional Magistrate Darshika Wimalasiri that it has also commenced a comprehensive investigation into two Navy vehicles which were used during the time that Thajudeens murder took place.
The CID further stated that they have sought an analytical report pertaining to Thajudeens mobile phone and laptop as a part of investigation into the murder case.
Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for May 3.
Former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake, former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera and former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had been named as first, second and third suspects of this case respectively. They were arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts. Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for CID. Presidents Counsel Shavindra Fernando appeared for the third suspect.
