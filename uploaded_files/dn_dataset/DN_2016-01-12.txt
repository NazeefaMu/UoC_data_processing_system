Constitutional reforms within the legal framework, ask JVP

Constitutional reforms should take place within the legal framework outlined in the current constitution, Leader of the JVP, Anura Dissanayake said.
While acknowledging the need for a new constitution, he said that the reforms should not be done in a manner that curtails the equal rights of Members of the Parliament, violating standing orders.
"The proposal made by the Prime Minister does not fall within Parliament standing orders, it goes beyond that. The Prime Minister has displayed by his behavior in Parliament and in Party Leaders meetings that ideas and suggestions by other parties and sections will be ignored by him," Dissanayake said.
Designing a constitution should not be done according to any one's single preference, not the way the TNA wants it, nor should it be just as the President or the Prime Minister wants it, Dissanayake said. "Both the JVP and the TNA have equal right to contribute," he said.
Dissanayake also said that the current issue with the constitution was not a lack of clauses, but the failure to adhere to what was already enshrined.
He also accused certain political factions of using the constitutional reforms to cover up their shortcomings and crimes while the government is using the same to divert attention from welfare cuts, and their shortcomings, he said.

'Country will only develop under JVP administration'

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is dangling the proposed new constitution before the people, in an effort to detract attention from burning issues, Parliamentarian and President of the Socialist Youth Federation Bimal Ratnayake said.
He was speaking at a district seminar organised by the Socialist Youth Federation in Anuradhapura. Ratnayake said that while they were not opposed to formulating a new constitution, several issues in the country needed to be resolved first.
He said the so called good governance policy has severely deteriorated. Public outburst had ensured the arrest of Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra, even if only for 20 minutes before release on bail - but those responsible for the murder of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen were still at large: Not a single corrupt individual of the previous regime has been brought to book and punished so far, he said.
Ratnayake said the last 60 years, since Independence, had only proved the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party's inability to rebuild and develop the country. The country would only develop under a JVP administration. Therefore, the JVP must gear up to establish administration by 2020, he said.
He also said that while the media had lauded the students who showed excellence at the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, it should not be forgotten that only a meagre 25,000 of the 149,000 students who sat the exam qualified to enter university. The rest of the students are languishing at home with no hope for the future, he said.
The Parliamentarian also charged that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had promised to set up a Volkswagen factory in Kuliyapitiya, but had not even appointed a security officer to the factory, a year since making the promise.

Dilwale : Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol reunite in cliched crime caper

2015 was the year the commercial cinema stepped up in the matter of monetising nostalgia. In the west, the Spielberg/Lucas copyism of 'Jurassic World' and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' raked in megabucks by cosying up to established fanbases, as did 'Spectre' by extracting 007 from the real world (and real-world peril) Skyfall placed him in and instead returning the character to those fantastical lairs he'd escaped a half-century ago.
With 'Dilwale', Bollywood follows suit. In its title and casting, Rohit Shetty's film trades heavily on fond memories of' Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', the 1995 landmark that was still enjoying regular rotation in one Mumbai cinema as late as this February.
What's initially so discombobulating here is that that film's stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol should be reunited in a very different movie. Where the original was a lush, keening romance, the new one foregrounds elements of those pulpy crime stories about one sibling getting inextricably drawn into another's risky business. The good brother here is Raj (Khan), a former tough who reformed upon opening an auto repair shop. Yet one of the hot-rods parked under his roof is trickier to handle than most: this is younger brother Veer (Varun Dhawan), who - while attempting to impress the winsome Ishu (Kriti Sanon) - crosses a fearsome drug dealer.
Damsel in distress
An extended pre-interval flashback clarifies matters a little. Here, we learn that the beardless Raj only turned thug after he, too, stepped in to assist a damsel in distress - and after the thoroughly boysy beginning, it's something of a relief when Kajol shows up, still possessed of the best eyebrows in the business (chief rivals: Camilla Belle, Lee Pace, Eugene Levy), as Raj's beloved Meera. Thus can Shetty make a narrative point of having history repeat itself, and for at least its first half,' Dilwale' provides functional enough holiday entertainment.
It's clear Khan's rare, Cary Grant-like ability to strike up a chemistry with anyone placed in front of him hasn't diminished over the past two decades. With Kajol, it's a given, and a joy - and, for this lovestruck Raj, something of a liability - but there's also a warmth to his interactions with Dhawan that steers the garage scenes away from flimsy Fast & Furious-ism. (The Khan-less scenes, full of grown men wailing like kids, overdo the wacky sound effects, and the less said about Dhawan's impromptu Love, Actually homage the better.)
Crisp editing
Shetty keeps his end up by ensuring the action scenes remain coherent: the punches land with uncommon force for a 12A-rated movie, and the crisp editing is such you can see the drivers in the cars flipping over at 80mph. While it's transitioning between genres, you ride along. Trouble arrives, however, once Dilwale enters its ultimate destination: the dud second half feels copied-and-pasted in from some Big Bollywood Book of Star-Crossed Lovers, tossing out one implausible, indigestible chunk of melodrama after another. It's not just the stars who've been reunited, but all those narrative and visual tropes that have curdled into cliche.
The lovers' fringes still blow up as they turn towards camera in slow-motion; tragic developments occasion torrential rainstorms. Shetty's clinging at numbing length to what's worked before, and this of all seasons, that may prove as much limitation as consolation.
The 1995 'Dilwale's title translated as The Bravehearted Will Take the Bride, and the boldly beautiful Bajirao Mastani surely has that prize sewn up this Christmas.
The new' Dilwale' has the star power to pick up those unlucky bridesmaids shut out of adjacent screens, but everybody's evening, everybody's legacy, might have been better served by returning the original to circulation.

Fast and infuriating!

Just when you thought that you will give the series a break, 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' return with its fourth installment: 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip'. A mouthful of a title, 'The Road Chip' adds nothing new to the series except for more trouble for Dave.
'The Road Chip' sees Dave inviting his date, Samantha, an attractive ER doctor, to take a trip to Miami with him for an album release party. It is a rude shock for Alvin, Simon and Theodore especially since Samantha's tyrant son Miles is hell-bent on standing oppose to the chipmunks. With the nightmare of the two families merging together hanging over his head, Alvin leads the other two boys to the road.
One of the themes which are explored in the movie is the importance of having a father. Miles who has been parentally abandoned realizes this fact towards the end of the movie. Dave even goes to such length as to adopt his chipmunk kids legally as a token of proving his devotion towards them.
Common grounds
Another fact that comes to light is that with the right understanding and devotion even the most unlikely relationship will find common grounds. This is signified when Miles and the chipmunks act as a team after a few hiccups on the way.
'The Road Chip' touches familiar territory when the chipmunks encounter a villain in the form of Tony Hale's vengeful air marshal.
This leads the chipmunks to unite with Miles sooner than expected. Any screenwriter would not have recommended such a fast union.
It seems such a waste that the concept of rebelling against the proposal was brought up in the first place. Naturally chaos is caused for their long-suffering guardian Dave when the boys engaged in their madcap mission. This as well as Miles' instant dislike to the furry vocalists brings on a few laughs. But a movie of this genre which basically relays its success on comedy needs to fine-tune this element.
Vocal talents
Another problem with this movie is that the chipmunks are not given apt space to showcase their vocal talents.
They are up against the rising stars of America, the Chipettes. Unfortunately the girls too do not get to sing much in this series.
'The Road Chip' is suitable as a children's movie except for a few scenes which project women in skimpy clothes.
In one such scene Alvin grazes at some bikini clad beauties in Miami Beach and drools out, "If this is grounded - ground me for life!" There are a few women who also don short skirts and cleavage baring tops at a party.
Jason Lee, Josh Green, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Tony Hale, Jennifer Coolidge, John Waters, Bella Thorne, Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, Jesse McCartney, Christina Applegate, Anna Faris and Kaley Cuoco act as well as render their voices for the animated characters.
The forth 'Chipmunk' movie does not hold much surprises. It doesn't enlighten the audience either. It is best suited if you are in the mood for light entertainment.

Hiddink wants Loftus-Cheek to make his mark

LONDON, SUNDAY: Guus Hiddink has challenged Ruben Loftus-Cheek to put in the hard work required to fulfil his potential after the teenager scored his first Chelsea goal in their 2-0 FA Cup win over Scunthorpe.
Loftus-Cheek gave a glimpse of his talent when he came off the bench to sweep home Cesar Azpilicueta's pass with a composed finish in the 68th minute at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
The 19-year-old finished off third tier Scunthorpe after Diego Costa had given Chelsea an early lead in the third round tie, but Hiddink claims the gifted midfielder still has a lot of work to do before he is the finished article.
London-born Loftus-Cheek has been regarded as the jewel in Chelsea's academy crown for some while, but previous boss Jose Mourinho was critical of his attitude and rarely used him.
After pumping millions into overhauling the youth system of a club that hasn't produced a star of their own since John Terry, Blues owner Roman Abramovich is desperate for more homegrown players to emerge.
Abramovich celebrated in unusually exuberant fashion when Loftus-Cheek scored, but Hiddink made a point of highlighting both the youngster's potential and areas where improvement is needed.
"Ruben came in and he had a beautiful goal, not just in the execution but the way he prepared himself, and that was good to see," Hiddink said.
"It's important he also has a hard-working role. If you play number 10 it's a role where you can maybe get away without so much hard work, but that's not what we want.
"I start knowing these youngsters now. I can see the possibilities they have and what they have to work on also."
Asked if he felt pressured by Abramovich to introduce more youngsters into the first-team, Hiddink insisted he is free to pick who he likes, but the Dutchman did concede Chelsea were right to expect more from such a heavy investment.
"It is normal when you have the academy with a lot of investment you must develop players in the Premier League," he said.
"If you see three or four of these players coming into the team that is what you want. "It is not said (by Abramovich) but that is the consequence of the academy; you have to use them, under the conditions that they learn. "Our position in the league gives a few options for putting young players in the team."
Rehabilitation
Hiddink has overseen a four-match unbeaten run, including successive victories against Scunthorpe and Crystal Palace, since replacing Mourinho.
But the savvy veteran is well aware that Chelsea's rehabilitation after their remarkable collapse under Mourinho is still far from complete.
"There were some vulnerabilities in the second half, it is true. We have to improve," Hiddink said.
"It was a difficult game, which we expected. We got a little bit sloppy in finishing it off after a good start."
With their Premier League title defence already in tatters, Hiddink says reclaiming the FA Cup -- a competition he won with the club in his previous interim spell in 2009 -- would help salvage a troubled campaign. "We are aiming for the FA Cup, we have the Premier League which is difficult to get to fourth place, so it was a very important game to get to the next round," he said. "We are very determined to go on to get silverware."
To enjoy a successful end to the season, Hiddink will need Costa to stay fit and in form.
The Spain striker's fourth goal in his last three appearances was well timed after his midweek training ground row with Oscar once again raised questions about his explosive temper. "If you see his goal in slow motion it was a difficult goal, but he was so focused and concentrated to get the flick on it. It's nice to see when he is focused on the right things," Hiddink added.

Maradona offers praise on golden day for Napoli

MILAN, SUNDAY: Diego Maradona offered glowing praise as Napoli boosted their hopes of a first Serie A title since 1990 by going two points clear of champions Juventus and Inter Milan.
The last time Napoli were top of the table at the halfway stage of the season in Italy was 26 years ago, when Maradona led the 'Partenopei' to the second of their two leagues titles in 1990.
But Fiorentina's shock 3-1 defeat to Lazio on Saturday whet Napoli's appetite, and it grew considerably earlier Sunday when Inter suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Sassuolo at the San Siro.
Napoli pounced on those setbacks to hammer league new boys Frosinone in a one-sided encounter that saw Gonzalo Higuain hit a brace, including one from the spot, to take his goals tally to 18 goals from 19 games.
Sarri has consistently played down Napoli's title hopes and has every reason after Juventus beat Sampdoria 2-1 in Genoa to claim their ninth victory on the trot to move two places up to second.
Paul Pogba broke the deadlock on 17 minutes with an angled strike and Sami Khedira found himself in acres of space to double the champions' lead on 46 minutes before Antonio Cassano hit a consolation just after the hour.
Inter dropped to third due to inferior goal difference, while Fiorentina are in fourth place at three points behind and Roma are seven points off the pace in fifth after being held 1-1 by AC Milan on Saturday.
Only four months ago Maradona publicly embarrassed Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri following an inauspicious start to the campaign. On that occasion Sarri, a lifelong Napoli and Maradona fan, soaked up the criticism and on Sunday it was time for payback.
"It's with great joy that I heard about Napoli's result, which we've all been waiting on for many years," said Maradona in a message sent to Sky Sport Italia.
"Knowing that the city of Naples and my Neapolitan fans can enjoy such emotion makes me even more happy for them. Go on Napoli. Now I want us to win the league title."
Against a Frosinone side fighting for top flight survival, Napoli took a 20th minute lead when Raul Albiol coolly flicked a volley into the net at the back post following a corner.
Higuain doubled Napoli's lead from the penalty spot on the half-hour and claimed his second in two crazy, second-half minutes that saw captain Marek Hamsik on target.
Frosinone's defence backed off as Hamsik ran towards the edge of the area before unleashing a drive that beat Massimo Zappino down low in the 59th minute. Barely 60 seconds later, Higuain muscled his way through two defenders to beat Zappino down low as the 'keeper came rushing out to block.
The goals took the Argentinian's tally to 18 from 19 games, an impressive return given the league's 'Capocannoniere' (top scorer) award has been won the past two seasons with 22 goals. Sarri replaced Higuain with Manolo Gabbiadini 20 minutes into the second half, and six minutes later the striker hit Napoli's fifth, a superb curling effort that sneaked into the far top corner.

Michalak keeps champions Toulon on course
PARIS, SUNDAY: Frederic Michalak scored a penalty four minutes from time to keep champions Toulon in the hunt for the European Champions Cup knock-out rounds on Sunday.
The France international came off the bench to give Toulon a 12-9 victory over dogged Bath, who deserved more from a game they lit up with some ambitious and at times scintillating running rugby.
George Ford kicked two drop goals for the visitors but they came up short and a second straight Pool 5 defeat leaves them with little chance of making the last eight.
"I'm not sure the best team won," admitted Toulon manager Bernard Laporte.
"We played a great team but what is sure is that we had more try-scoring chances."
He added: "Bath based their game on territory but the result is that their competition is over and we're still on course."
Toulon are now just two points behind group leaders Wasps, who must still come to the south of France. The first half was far more entertaining than the scoreline suggested after Eric Escande scored a pair of penalties in response to Ford knocking over one and adding a drop goal in what had been an enjoyable match.
Ford knocked over another drop goal early in the second period as an adventurous Bath side frequently attacked from deep.
Toulon started to get their own running game into gear and Escande levelled matters for a third time.
But after resisting a long period of Bath pressure, during which time Ford narrowly knocked another drop goal wide, Toulon steam-rollered up the other end and won the decisive penalty.
Stirring fightback
Ulster produced a stirring second half fightback to keep Irish interest alive in the European Champions Cup as they won 24-23 at Oyonnax.
Paddy Jackson kicked a penalty three minutes from time to complete a remarkable turnaround after Ulster went into the break trailing 23-0.
That kick kept alive their hopes of reaching the knock-out stages as they closed the gap to Pool 1 leaders Saracens to six points. With Munster eliminated on Saturday after a 27-7 defeat at Stade Francais, who played the entire second half with 14 men but still dominated, Ulster were the only Irish province still able to progress to the quarter-finals -- Leinster were eliminated a month ago when losing to Toulon.
But it looked bleak for the Irish when Ulster turned around at the break in France with a large deficit.
Oyonnax, who had already been eliminated themselves having lost all their previous matches, played without fear and scored a try through Jeremie Maurouard after just seven minutes.
Nicky Robinson kicked the conversion and three penalties before Uwanakaro Tawalo picked up a loose pass from deep inside his own 22 and broke clear to score a second try, also converted, on the stroke of half-time.
But Ulster showed great heart in the second period, in which they almost never let the hosts out of their own half. Rory Scholes got them on the board just three minutes in before tries from Craig Gilroy and Kyle McCall, all converted by Jackson, made it a two-point game with 12 minutes left. Oyonnax, playing in their first ever European Champions Cup campaign, couldn't hold out and Jackson had the final word. Ulster probably still need to get a result away to Saracens in their final match in order to make the last eight, though. On Saturday, Stade produced a stunning display to rout Munster with young flanker Sekou Macalou particularly impressive.
The French champions are just four points behind Pool 4 leaders Leicester, who have yet to play in Paris.
Racing 92 virtually assured their knock-out stage passage with a bonus point 34-10 victory over Glasgow that took the Parisians seven points clear of Northampton in Pool 3. On Friday, Clermont beat Bordeaux-Begles 28-10 to take over top spot in Pool 2 from Ospreys.
This weekend's matches had all originally been postponed following the Paris terror attacks last November that left 130 people dead. AFP

Saint unmasked

Although one might not ordinarily see many points of comparison between the two, the worlds of organized religion and professional wrestling enjoy a surprising number of similarities. Both find themselves in the middle of eternal battles between true believers who take every aspect as the unvarnished truth and naysayers who decry it all as ridiculous fiction; both have inspired any number of battles over the years between those who insist that the faith or wrestler of their choosing is the one true one and all others are impostors; both have seen the faith of their believers exploited by Donald Trump for his own personal benefit. With the release of "The Masked Saint," a film that dares to combine religion and rassling into one oddball package, they can now claim to have something else in common in that they are both institutions that will presumably recover from all of the absurdities on display-quite possibly before I do, in fact.
As the film opens, Chris Samuels (Brett Granstaff) has decided to give up his career as a masked wrestler known only as The Saint in order to become the pastor of a Baptist church in a run-down Michigan neighborhood. (There is a good Knights of Templar joke in here somewhere but it currently eludes me.) Sadly, he doesn't go out with a bang as much as a snap of his femur, courtesy of an evil opponent known as The Reaper, but soon he, relentlessly perky wife Michelle (Lara Jean Chorostecki-yes, the same one who previously appeared on "Hannibal") and terrifyingly perky moppet daughter Carrie (T.J. McGibbon) are off on their new adventure.
Alas, the church is in disrepair, the congregation is dropping and after Chris winds up alienating rich blowhard Judd Lumpkin (Patrick McKenna), who has been the church's main source of income as of late, it appears that his first pastorship may be in jeopardy when his wife and parishioner Ms Edna (Diahann Carroll. . . yes, Diahann Carroll) convince him to take up the offer made by his sleazy former promoter (Roddy Piper) to return to the ring to earn the needed money. The other parishioners won't know what he is doing and besides, as Michelle points out, "Where in the Bible does it say 'Thou Shalt Not Wrestle'" (If it does, it is probably somewhere in Leviticus.)
The plan works and soon Chris is supplementing his ministering by wrestling three times a week and earning enough money to help turn the church around. The heroic-like violence is not just limited to the ring either-when he comes across the evil local pimp (Dwain Murphy) slapping around his one hooker (Danielle Benton) for excessive praying and lack of respect, Chris puts the mask on and dishes out some vigilante justice on the guy's skull. This attracts the attention of what appears to be the only cop in town (Mykel Shannon Jenkins), but Chris not only skirts his attention, he manages to continue his vigilante activities and ruin the pimp's business by admitting his employees and customers into the flock. Inevitably, Chris begins to get a swelled head about his accomplishments and begins acting curtly towards his loved ones. However, as we all know, pride goeth before the technical fall and when the grumpy pimp trashes the church and Chris is forced to admit his double life to his parishioners (though he keeps the vigilante stuff to himself), he almost loses everything. However, it mostly clears up for him in time for the big climax where all of the various subplots happen to turn up in time to be resolved before watching the now-unmasked Saint try to regain his title from The Reaper.
At the very beginning of "The Masked Saint," a title card informs us that what we are seeing is "Inspired by real events." What this means is that there was a guy by the name of Chris Whaley who wrestled professionally for about ten years before quitting in 1988 to study theology before becoming a pastor and eventually writing the novel on which this film was based. Indeed, the early scenes observing Chris during his first fumbling attempts at bring new life to the congregation are the best because while they may be a bit on the ham-fisted side, they at least have a trace of believability to them.
However, once the film shifts away from that to focus more on the surreptitious wrestling and vigilante work, it begins to suggest what "Nacho Libre" might have been like if the laughs were all of the unintentional variety (which is still more than were on hand in the real "Nacho Libre") before getting into some weirdly disturbing areas (such as a subplot involving an abusive husband that is resolved in a manner that is borderline offensive) that add nothing but extra minutes to a running time that is stretched out far too long for its own good.
Although nowhere near as obnoxious as such recent faith-based offerings as "God's Not Dead" and "Do You Believe," "The Masked Saint" is still kind of a chore to sit through, even for those predisposed to like anything that brings together Christian faith and sleeper holds.
The only thing about it worth remembering is that it was the last film made by wrestler-turned-actor Roddy Piper before his death last year. Film fans will remember him as the star of "They Live," John Carpenter's brilliant piece of cinematic agitprop in which he played a homeless man who discovered that aliens were living among us on Earth disguised as Republicans that could be revealed only by wearing special sunglasses.
In that film, he uttered the immortal line "I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick ass-and I'm all out of bubblegum." In the case of "The Masked Saint," if you have to choose between seeing it or chewing bubblegum, do yourself a favor and stick with the sweets.

Steyn ruled out of third Test

Johannesburg, Monday: South African fast bowler Dale Steyn was on Monday ruled out of playing in the third Test against England, starting at the Wanderers Stadium on Thursday.
Coach Russell Domingo said Steyn had been advised to take another weeks rest after suffering a shoulder strain during the first Test in Durban.
He has been undergoing tests and the Domingo said his medical team were awaiting further opinion from a specialist on how best to manage the injury.
Steyn, the worlds top-ranked Test bowler, has only played in two of South Africas most recent five Tests and on both occasions has suffered an injury which prevented him from bowling in the second innings.
Domingo said he was confident that Steyn, 32, would still have a role to play in the Test side.
"All players are going to experience some sort of niggles at some stage of their career and he has just had a few of them of late.
"He is a great athlete, as fit as anyone, these things happen. He is just going through that phase of his career but Im sure he will get through it."
Following the resignation of Hashim Amla after the drawn second Test in Cape Town, South Africa will be led for the first time in Tests by AB de Villiers.
"Within our team its been business as usual," said Domingo. "I dont see too much of a change in the change room because its all the same players, they have all played under AB in the one-day side so its not too much of an adjustment.
"We want to build on our performance from Cape Town, there were a lot of positives for us.
"AB is really looking forward to doing it. He has always wanted to captain the Test side and he is really excited by the challenge."
Domingo said he was not too concerned about the lack of experience in the bowling line-up with both Steyn and Vernon Philander ruled out because of injury.

Towards new Constitution: Constitutional Assembly to epitomize transparency in Amendment Process

The government has called for a Constitutional convention of transparency to review and suggest changes to the Constitution as with its resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly, United National Party [UNP] legislators yesterday told the Daily News.
As pointed out by UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera , the resolution for converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly will ensure transparency of the amendment process more than it will under the Standing Orders of the House.
Although some members of the Janatha Vimuthi Peramuna [JVP] have made statements to media that converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly was in violation of Standing Orders, they admitted in the party leaders meeting that the Constitution can be amended with more transparency under the proposed resolution.
Asked if they have a mandate as a political party to change the Constitution entirely, Perera said they said in unison with President Maithripala Sirisena during the Parliament election, that they will not compromise the unitary state of Sri Lanka , but would look to devolve power meaningfully to find a lasting solution to the national question.
He said they undertook the task of abolishing the Executive Presidency and introducing a new electoral system.
Having to undergo many changes over the past since 1978, our Constitution is having serious problems. It needs to be strengthened, he said.
All legislators may propose amendments to it , the draft of which must be approved by two-third supermajority in Parliament. The draft Constitution must then go to the Supreme Court for its determination, he explained.
The Court can determine whether those changes to the Constitution are requiring the approval of the people at a referendum.
Perera said the government has clearly stated that it will put the draft Constitution to be approved by the public at a referendum.
We asked Perera about criticism leveled against the government by interested groups in the joint opposition that the government is set to change those clauses in the Chapter two , Article 9 of the Constitution which states:
The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).
Perera said, These were mere speculations hammered out by some frustrated parties out of malice. We will not do anything to injure the position of Buddhism. Nobody has event wanted to do anything of the sort, not even the Tamil National Alliance.

Tributes paid as Motorhead frontman Lemmy laid to rest

Dave Grohl and Slash from Guns N' Roses were among those paying tribute to Motorhead frontman Lemmy at his funeral in Los Angeles on Saturday (09Jan16).
The Brit rocker died at the age of 70 on 28 December last year (15), just two days after discovering he had an aggressive form of cancer. Lemmy, real name Ian Fraser Kilmister, died while sitting with his family in front of his favourite computer game, BBC News report.
Motorhead's manager Todd Singerman said that at the time of his death, Lemmy had cancer in his brain and neck, and his sudden death was "a massive shock".
The funeral service at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery began with an introduction by Todd, and a photograph of the band was on display at the chapel, alongside a set of speakers, Lemmy's boots and an urn shaped like the rocker's brimmed hat.
"He was one of the last true rock stars left, this guy lived it every day," Todd said. "He was one of the kindest men I ever met - he was the people's man."
Lemmy's son Paul Inder praised his father as a "stage warrior" and a free spirit, and added, "Travel well, my dear father. You are back out on the road for a longest tour to the great gig in the sky."
Slash told the rocker's family and friends gathered in the chapel, "Lemmy was somebody I just feel so honoured to have been friends with. He lived his life the way he wanted to... his music and personality will last forever."
Foo Fighters frontman Dave gave an emotional speech at the end of the service, during which he recalled meeting the rocker for the first time more than 20 years ago. He described Lemmy as his "hero", and "the one true rock 'n' roller".
Then Lemmy's bass guitar was plugged into a set of amplifiers and the volume turned right up, leading the congregation to stand up and applause as the feedback from the speakers filled the room.
Robert Trujillo and Lars Ulrich from Metallica, Judas Priest singer Rob Halford and Anthrax frontman Scott Ian also paid tribute to the rocker during the service, while Ozzy Osbourne, Queen's Brian May and Kiss star Gene Simmons were among the mourners in the star-studded congregation. Music-News
