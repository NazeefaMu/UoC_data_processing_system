Seek NBC for blood donations, not social media
The National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) said that there had been a rise in calls for rare blood groups through social media networks and as a result, terms of patient confidentiality had been violated.
The NBTS provides blood to all government and private sector hospitals and collects approximately 400,000 units of blood per year. We have a registered volunteer donor base exceeding 600,000 members, the NBTS said.
Blood requirements for patients admitted to government hospitals are fulfiled by their respective blood banks and if necessary, the hospital coordinates with the National Blood Centre (NBC) to fulfil the requirement, the NBTS added.
Private hospitals ask patients to seek assistance through social and other media networks instead of requesting assistance from the NBC as the above facilities are not being utilised by such hospitals, it said.
Under the guidance of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the NBTS had conducted 100 blood donation programmes through voluntary, non-remunerated donors in 2014. Thus, none of the private or state sector hospitals have the right to request from the relatives of patients, to donate blood or call for donors, it added.

Part of my life ended on the day my father died
Twenty-five years after the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, his daughter Dulanjalee Jayakody shares with the Daily News the most treasured memories of her father- his pains, virtues, strengths and unforgettable moments.
Bitter memories of May 1, 1993, still haunt her. Profound sadness is still buried in her heart. It did not fade away over time and would become intense on every May 1 when she starts hearing her fathers voice on the radio or TV.

Part of my life ended on the day my father died. Your father can be a king, president, farmer or beggar, whoever he is, he is your father. To realize that my father was no more was devastating, She recalled the tragic moment that changed her life forever.
Her greatest regret to this day is that she couldnt return to the country to be with her father on that fateful May Day just as she promised.
I was in England. I was there for a week and was going to fly back to be with my father on May Day. But my husband insisted that we should stay there one more day, she recalls with profound sadness.
How do I come to terms with my life without my father, and my guilt that I should have been there, and I know that if I had been there I would have been more alert, she lashes out at his security guards for not being vigilant at all in protecting the President of the country.
If they were vigilant they would have been able to understand that there were sleeper cells around us. How did this incident happen They are responsible for what happened. Up to now, no proper investigation has been done as to how my father died, she notes with regret.
Wonderful father
Dulanjalee and her brother grew up having a father who was more a peoples politician. They had to be disciplined and they knew that even though he was their father he was accountable to his people.

She remembers her father as wonderful, kind, very loving, but strict.
We knew that he would not have tolerated us behaving badly. He was a strict father. But he loved us immensely. Even after getting married I used to sit on his lap and he would stroke my hair, she takes a stroll down memory lane and recalls one of the most affectionate father-daughter moments!
I think we are all unique in our own ways, but he was exceptional. We all have our faults. My father was not perfect, but who are we to judge him she queries.
She reminisced how he took over as the candidate for the UNP in the 1988 Presidential elections.
My father had the support of the majority. There were many other people who wanted to be the candidate, but the Working Committee decided that none of them could win the elections. They said only the Prime Minister can face it.
And he waited for his turn.
Never go and sit in the main seat, wait till you are called to sit there, he used to tell us always. And only when you are called, when you are really called you go and sit there, Dulanjalee recalls her fathers words.
Great Qualities

Asked what made her father an outstanding politician she replies;
First of all his sense of responsibility, discipline, accountability  accountable to the people as a politician, and his deep love for this country and its people. He was highly patriotic, but he respected all religions and ethnic groups. He loved this country as a whole with its different ethnicities and religions.
She emphasised that her father genuinely felt the needs of the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers, He realised that all of them have huge issues. He knew his Tamil well, but still, he polished it up further so that he could speak to them and listen to their grievances.
Even during the speeches sometimes when the translator made mistakes, he got up and corrected it in Tamil, she reminisces.
I was nine years old when he became the Prime Minister. He woke up very early - at 3.30 am or sometimes 4 am. The whole household was up at that time because he used to leave our house and go to Sucharitha. So until he became the President he stayed there.
Dulanjalee reminisced that she used to be half asleep always because her father used to come to give her a kiss before leaving!
Childhood
The enthusiasm of the poor upon seeing them was immense. The words of those people still echo in her mind.I was born in 1969 when my father was in the Opposition. So I grew up seeing my parents going to meetings, rallies and Sathyagraha and getting battered and assaulted. That was my childhood until the 1977 elections and even before that my brother and I were taken to the rural areas of Sri Lanka.
Premadasa Mahaththaya Enawa,
He actually felt what they were going through. He was always a peoples politician. It was not something which he put on to get the votes or to be in power, it was his call. Those are the things my brother and I grew up with, she adds.
On some days we walked into small houses during lunch time. They were happy to share whatever they were eating with us. So we used to sit with them and eat.
Gam Udawa
Having witnessed the poverty-stricken villages, President Premadasa was determined to build self-sufficient villages across the country.
As he visited the rural areas he saw their needs. He understood that building houses for them alone would not help them get rid of poverty. He wanted them to become self-sufficient. Villages have to be built. For villages to be built, schools have to be built. Religious places of worship have to be built. Roads and hospitals have to be built. The next issue was how to fund these. During that time he was the Prime Minister and did not have much power. So he started the Sevana Lottery to enable the funding of his housing programme, independent of State funds.
Next he launched Sevana Sarana Kapakaru Mapiya Kramaya to educate the needy children. Schools uniforms and meals were given afterwards, she says.
Father and daughter
Our ideas and views were so much alike, we thought alike. We held the same views on certain matters. I would agree with him when he took controversial decisions, she recalls.
During the Indo - Lanka Peace Accord he was determined not to take part in it. My mother and brother were worried that my father would resign from his post.
Dulanjalee still vividly remembers the day President Jayewardene and Mrs Jayewardene visited her home to take up the matter with her father.
Usually the President does not visit the Prime Minister. But since this is a great issue President and Mrs Jayewardene visited us. However, my father was firm in his decision. Sir I have never said no to you. But I cannot agree with this Accord, he told President Jayewardene.
Next the President turned to me and said what do you think I said I think my father is correct I believed thats what his conscience is., she explained her stand on the matter.
And I remember my father putting his arms around me and we had a good laugh, a wide smile spread across her face.
All looked stunned. But to me, my fathers principles and convictions were more important and I respected that. He should not go up to the people and ask them to accept something with which he himself did not agree.
And then the President said, Do the changes to the Accord.
My father said, I will do the changes sir, but Rajiv would not agree.
So just like he said he did the changes, immediately it was faxed to Rajiv Gandhi, but India did not agree with suggested changes.
Taking up politics
Since of late a lot of people told me that President expected me to take over, but I said he had never told me anything like that. Probably he would have thought that I would have had a political mind, but that does not mean that I have to get into politics. Anyway getting into politics is not really a good idea when you are a mother, she states.
Respect
There was one security officer C A Upali Silva (STF) who survived for three days after the Armor Street Bomb explosion. He was standing very close to my father, had fallen having withdrawn his weapon. Obviously, he would have noticed the man coming towards the President. He was the only person who had withdrawn the weapon and I respect him for that, she adds.
Asked how she wants the people of this country to remember her father, she responds.
Remember him as a human being who worked tirelessly to uplift his country, his people with so many odds against him - so much of criticism, so much of mud-slinging, sometimes more than he could take.
Still, he was determined.
He was strong enough to overcome all these odds because he knew that he was honest. Everything he did was transparent. He had the love of the people and he was hard working. You cant impeach a President just because he does not listen to his ministers. So the impeachment fell through.
Today we see President Premadasa as the President who did the most for this country. Nobody else could ever match him.
Was Lee Kuan Yew impeached because he was strict with his ministers That is why Singapore is where they are and we are where we are. My father started to put in some rules and they did not like it. In the early 50s, Singapore was less developed than us. They listened to Lee Kuan Yew and allowed him to do some work.
My father did all that he did amidst great opposition and mud-slinging. Thats the difference. He never had it easy. But at the end accusations really hit him. If you read his last speech you will understand how upset he was.
Does he need to kill anybody to gain power The work he has done would have been enough. If he was allowed to do his work where would we be as a country, economically financially she throws at his opponents accusingly.
Is it because he did not come from the affluent class There were instances that certain ministers didnt call him sir, just the prime minister. He didnt care. But when he became president they had to call him Your Excellency. But that did not stop him from rendering his services to the people. It was all because he did not come from the affluent class! she emphasises.
Dulanjalee vows that she has not witnessed that kind of strength in any other human being.
Amidst all the weapons targeted at you, you perform. That strength, that single-mindedness I have not seen in anybody, she adds triumphantly.
Sometimes he was too stressed, sometimes he was said to be too harsh, but who are we to judge him she reiterated.
Just see, throughout various presidencies how corrupted the ministers had been. Can you imagine why my father was strict with his ministers Do you understand why he thought he had to be much disciplined with them First of all, he was disciplined himself.
Now do you realise if other leaders too were strict and disciplined it would have been a different story she throws a question at me.
Today, at the end of the day, who has won My father. They want him back. But it is too late now, she concludes with regret.

We are for a political solution if the problem is political
Addressing a group of Sri Lankans at the London Inter Continental Hotel on July 12, 1987 Prime Minister Premadasa spoke angrily about the dropping of food parcels by air under the protection of Indian mirage jets in June 1987 at a time when the relations between the two countries were strained.
As you all know ours was a peaceful country where people of different races and religions lived in perfect harmony. They loved each other. They respected each others political, religious and cultural freedom.Then terrorism raised its ugly head. Terrorism, as seen all over the world, has no regard for religion or culture or human rights or for anything that is valued in civilized society. They are a bunch of plains criminals or gangsters. They kill for the love of killing. They care not whether their victims are infants, women, innocent workers or the pious clergy.
But what is strange is that there are some who call them boys, militants, guerrillas, freedom fighters and..... ... Who is calling them by these names Naturally they are the people who support them. Why do they support them It is to get their support in return. What support do they except in return for supporting the terrorists That is the big question.
You will agree that terrorism has become a global menace. It is a threat to the democratic world and to the democratic way of life. Those of us who cherish democratic ideals should refrain from supporting, sheltering and encouraging terrorism. All the democratic nations and countries in the world should unite, close ranks and join hands to demolish and destroy terrorism whether it is national or international.
All peace loving nations that cherish democratic ideals and those who value fundamental human rights and freedom must pool their resources to fight terrorism, the common enemy. As a first step the developed countries must curb the supply of arms to the terrorists. They must exercise vigilance on the movement of terrorist, their sources of funds and supplies. As small countries like Sir Lanka find difficult to combat terrorism without international assistance a fund should be established for that purpose.
Sri Lanka since 1977 has been on the path of rapid social and economic development. We liberalized our economy and foreign investors came in large numbers. A wide range of industries were established. This led to an increase in our per capita income far beyond that of many developing countries. It provided employment to more and more people. We tapped the potential of the Mahaweli River and several other rivers.
Our country began to approach self sufficiency in our staple foods. We were fast producing enough hydro electricity for industrial and domestic use. We began a most ambitious housing programme. After housing a hundred thousand families were are now fast moving towards a target of a million houses. Or people were beginning to feel secure and satisfied. We have always followed a non aligned foreign policy.
Now there are those who are envious of all this. Our success is an irritant to them. Some of them feel that we should toe their line. They find our economic progress something to be jealous about. They see our political stability as a thorn in their flesh. Their reaction is very clear. They think Sri Lanka must be destabilised.
On the subject of terrorism in Sri Lanka let me tell you that it is fed and nurtured in India and more particularly in the State of Tamil Nadu. All these years the Indian authorities denied it. They denied it despite revelations made in their own newspapers.
Later they admitted the pressure brought about by the terrorist leaders taking refuge on the Indian soil. They invited them to talks at official level. They also took some of them into temporary custody along with their guns and mortars.
Apart from all this, the terrorists themselves have declared that India is their foster mother. Living up to that relationship the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu made a cash donation of thirty million Indian Rupees to the LTTE which is the main terrorist group in Sri Lanka.
There has never been any starvation in Sri Lanka not in its living memory. Have you ever heard of food shortages in the Jaffna area Despite the obstacles placed by the terrorists our government has supplied food, medicine and other essentials to the people of the North and the East.
Despite the recent embargo on fuel supplies to the Jaffna Peninsula they were given enough kerosene for their domestic use. Fuel for public transport was available freely. Under no stretch of imagination can one say that petrol, diesel and kerosene are food items. But only a prejudicial mind can say so. So my friends, we experienced the latest episode of food dropping from the air.
That was a naked violation of Sri Lankan air space. By whom By the Government of India. The whole world is now asking questions. How can this great culture based on Rig Veda produce power hungry policy that seeks to destroy its neighbours Where is the non- violence of Mahatma Gandhi Where is the vision of peace of Tagore Where is the magnanimity of Jawaharlal Nehru What is path for the successors of the heritage of those grat men to have chosen
You must have read in the world Press the most unambiguous criticisms of that high handed act by India. I will tell you exactly what happened. The Indian Government suddenly decided that the people of Jaffna were starving. They ignored for a moment that millions of people were starving in their own country. They decided to force-feed the well-fed people of Jaffna. So the Indian Government informed the Government of Sri Lanka on June 1,1987 that they will be sending a shipload of food supplies to Jaffna on June 3 and asked for the Sri Lanka Government help in the distribution. Well, we replied that we have enough food and we don't need Indian supplies. If India insists in being so generous the matter could be discussed with our officials so that the modalities could be arranged.
When a big bully wants to force a bun down a small boy's throat, he doesn't discuss modalities with the little fellow. Similarly India sent a convoy of food barges on June 3. Our Navy stopped them from entering our waters. Of course the barges had to go back. This bully felt insulted. The very next day after informing our High Commissioner in India a mere hour in advance, the Indian Air Force escorted by Mirage 2000 fighters dropped some 22 to 23 tons of food supplies on Sri Lankan territory. This was nothing short of a brazen invasion. The whole world was shocked. Hasn't the Government of India painted a picture that they support terrorism openly
As you yourselves know there is no starvation in our country. People of all races are living in exemplary amity. It is only in the North and East that the Tamil terrorists are not tolerating the sober minded among their own people. Please remember that the majority of the Tamil people live not in the Jaffna peninsula but outside in the other parts of the country and among the Sinhalese. They are a prosperous lot helped and cared for by the Sinhalese and Muslims.
Thomas A. Marks of the University of Hawaii and former US Military Intelligence Analyst have made certain observations on the Indian Government involvement. I quote: Throughout 1986 and 1987 however, each time the military attempted concerted action against the insurgents, the Indians stepped in and pressurized Colombo to curtail its offensive. Yet it is clear that Indian involvement has made the situation for worse than it would have been, had the parties involved were allowed to deal with each others on their own terms and in relative isolation.'
In an attempt to justify the air drops various excuses have been given by the Indian Government. It has been said that the air drop was due to Sri Lanka's flippant attitude. But the whole world knows that we have always stood for a peaceful settlement. In fact we have offered much more than any other governments would have been able to offer.
It is said that Sri Lanka has been buying time for a military solution. But the truth is that whenever the terrorists were losing ground against the Sri Lankan armed forces India bought time for them by bringing pressure on Sri Lanka under various pretexts.
We want peace, harmony and brotherhood to return to our country soon. We are for a political solution if the problem is political. But it is not possible to find a political solution in an atmosphere of tension. Violence and endless destruction. This is the policy that has been adopted by our Government.
An AFP news report from New Delhi Dated July 10 has quoted Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi referring to terrorists in his own country saying that there cannot be any kind of talks until the Sikh militants stop fighting and killing people. The bloody violence would have to end first'.
He had said this in the wake of the killing of 72 Hindus by the Sikh militants in Punjab and Haryana States in India. So you will see that there is no difference in the policy adopted by India and Sri Lanka. But the trouble is that the Indian Government is following double standards, one in respect of their terrorist problem and another in respect of ours. Anyway I hope that the Government of India would realise the truth, concluded Premadasa.

25th Death Anniversary today: President Premadasa helped soccer in a big way
Today 1st of May is the 25th death anniversary of the late President R. Premadasa, sportsman, sports benefactor and above all a great gentleman who did his best for the country. He was killed along with 17 others on 1 May 1993, at 12.45 p.m. during a May Day rally in north Colombo, by an LTTE suicide bomber. Another 38 people were injured in the bombing including seven who were seriously wounded.
The name of R. Premadasa will go down in the annals of our history not only as a nation-builder but also as a great sports promoter. He as a sports promoter and political leader gave off his best for the people regardless of caste and race.
R. Premadasa was born on 23 June 1924 at Dias Place, Colombo 11, to the family of Richard Ranasinghe (Ranasinghe Mudalali) of Kosgoda and Jayasinghe Arachchige Ensina Hamine of Batuwita, Horana. He was the oldest of five children, three sisters, and one brother. He received his primary education at Harvard Girls School, Dam Street, Colombo, post primary education at St. Lorenzs College, Skinners Road South (now Sri Sangaraja Mawatha, Maradana) and his secondary education at St. Josephs College, Colombo. While attending school, he attended the Hewavitharana Daham Pasala. He completed his education at St. Josephs College, during the Le Goc era.
He wanted people to work and do something for the country. Today, most of the Sri Lankans, will remember his good work. This friend of the common people, departed suddenly in a bomb blast, on May Day where his party was celebrating May Day with the workers of the country. As a politician - Prime Minister and President he is the man who did a lot for the country in the same way he helped sports.
It was he who built the Kettarama Stadium (now known as R. Premadasa Stadium) for cricket with lights. Today this cricket venue can be rated as one of the best in the world.
Then for football he re-developed the Sugathadasa Stadium, and also gave a new face to the Pedris Park. Football was R. Premadasa's pet sport. The game of football came naturally to him, perhaps because football was identified with the poor man. As a young footballer, he learnt the game at Keselwatte. He introduced a rugby tournament for clubs for this he got together with Malik Samarawickrema, Y.C. Chang and Dushantha Samarasekara. This tournament was known as the R. Premadasa Trophy and became very popular. Subsequently he introduced a schools segment to this tournament. After his death this tournament was scraped.
Even after taking to politics, he was with football and football was with him. He promoted the game among the Parliamentarians. He gave unstinted support to football's controlling body. During the time of late Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi and Manilal Fernando he came out in a big way by granting Rs. 60,000 for the development of football.
R. Premadasa was a gentleman to his fingertips. He was prepared to stand for what was right even though it meant that he had to make a personal sacrifice. He took part in politics, sports and social service work to help his fellow people. He had a generous heart and would go out of his way to help countrymen - but his special concern was about those countrymen who happened to be less fortunately placed in life. For these people R. Premadasa was a real leader in need.
Even in the rough and tumble world of politics, R. Premadasa always maintained that "sport is the best reformer and the ideal one for politicians to engage in as sport has no barriers". There is no doubt that every sport in the country benefited from his true love for sports.
Today, all sports, realizes his loss. It's a void which will be very difficult to fill because he yet had so much to offer for sports and the country. It is said that no man is indispensable. When one considers R. Premadasas worth to society as a politician, administrator and sport promoter and a friend no one would hasten to challenge that statement.
In 1960, he married Hema Wickramatunge, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wickramatunge Arachchige Charles Appuhamy of Bandarawela, on June 23, 1964. His son, Sajith, and daughter, Dulanjali, were born to this couple.
Today Sajith is following his fathers footsteps in UNP politics.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara had issued instructions to the North Central Province DIG to take disciplinary action against Police personnel who had allegedly assaulted the villages who had behaved restlessly on April 28.
A Sub-Inspector attached to the Eppawela Police has been interdicted in connection with the alleged assault, based on the directive issued by the IGP.
The alleged assault had taken place over a dispute with a monk at the Nallamudawa Shailya Bimbarama Temple in Eppawela, Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
The IGP had issued this order on April 29.
It was reported that several female protesters at a temple in Nallamudawa, Eppawala were allegedly assaulted by the Police following tensions arising when the Police tried to disperse the crowd.
The protesters were agitating against a Monk who resides at the Nallamudawa Shailya Bimbarama temple.

Of ants and men (in politics)
Have you observed ants I mean not just seeing them but studying them their movement and habits. It is very educative. You should do so. Well, Mark Twain had done so and given us a wonderful insight on their nature. Conscious of the travails of humans in their spatial movements through traffic-jammed, accident-prone highways, trunk roads and narrow street lanes, I was particularly interested in how ants move from point A to point B. I preferred to observe black ants. Not that colour matters (I hate colour-bar) but they are the most friendly as they do not hurt or prick you.
Believe it or not, they cannot move in a straight line. To move from A to B they do not take the shortest route (being ignorant of Euclidian geometry), if it is even clear of any obstacles. They would start going sideways, then retrace their steps somewhat and go round and round returning several times to the point of departure without ever reaching their destination though they may at times get very close to it. Or else, on way they meet their fellow ants and often get waylaid or enjoy life with them oblivious to their need to reach B. It is after traversing a distance of about ten times the shortest one they reach the destination, tired and hungry.
To me, the performance of the present Government looks similar. For example, the President and the Prime Minister jointly set upon a journey to bring in yahapalanaya or good governance. For three years they were going round and round in circles, elipses and all types of geometrical curves without even nearing their destination. Now it is said that a new beginning is to be made with a new Memorandum of Understanding between the duo supreme.
Humans, especially politicians who claim to lead the masses should have more gray matter than ants!
Ministerial portfolios
Bizarre as it is, nevertheless the story goes that the SLFP is insisting that those Ministers who voted for the no confidence motion against the Premier and joined the Opposition should be given ministerial portfolios, in case they ask for. The claim was also reiterated publicly by Presidential confidante Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. It is almost blasphemous to bring back who have been openly flouting the collective responsibility of the Cabinet of Ministers. The latter is the bedrock of representative parliamentary democracy. As Harold Laski said the collective responsibility of the Cabinet is central to the whole structure of the parliamentary system. To jeopardize it is to risk all that system secures for the effective discussion of governmental policy in the country. One could say that re-accepting portfolios by such people is immoral or unethical. However, it would not be an issue with the gentlemen in question as they had lost their morals long time ago.
There is gem of thought in one of the home truths the President told a public gathering. What I mean is reference to the method of constituting the Cabinet of Ministers. He said it would be done scientifically. Ignorant as I am of the hurly-burly world of present politics, I was hitherto unaware of any science of Cabinet-making in the political sense, the only thing that was within my power of comprehension was the science practised by our Baas Unneheys or carpenters down Moratumulla and elsewhere. At a time when the whole globe has been shrunk to the size of a village (global village, they say) I hope our President would be able to shrink the Cabinet of Ministers scientifically to about one-third its present size.
Political power
The Grand Old Party  the UNP is in deep structural crisis. Contradictions that have been simmering inside have reached critical level and burst into the open. They could not be contained even by veins and arteries of political power. The party constitution is being tinkered with pointing to fundamental changes being necessary. It should be remembered that it was basically created by President J R Jayewardene to suit the executive presidency. Since then the party leader has authoritarian powers. A formal split seems unavoidable at the close of tenure of the Government, if not before.
The divisions in the SLFP are in public view with already three groups existing, though with some intra-group fifth columns. The additional SLFP is no more and its supposed re-incarnation- the SLPP is different in class composition as well as in its outlook. The modern SLFP about which President Sirisena speaks often is yet to be born and the possibility of a still birth too cannot be over-ruled.
As far as the lesser parties are concerned they also have their problems but they are far less serious or mature. No doubt the crisis within the political parties is symptomatic of the crisis in society at large.
It is clear that balance of political forces is changing. New political alignments are on way. Once the process is completed some existing parties may be reduced to their skeletons. The period ahead will certainly be turbulent and volatile.

Cabinet reshuffle today
The much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle is to take place at the Presidential Secretariat today and all ministers are informed to be present by 9.30 am, a senior government Minister said yesterday.
This would be the second Cabinet reshuffle effected by the government since it took office in 2015. Highly placed political sources said there will be 32 United National Party Ministers and 10 United Peoples Freedom Alliance Ministers in the new Cabinet.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama is slated to get additional responsibilities, according to sources.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan when inquired said that ministers were informed by the Presidential Secretariat to arrive early, by 9:30 a.m..
Other than that, I have no other information, Minister Ganesan said.
President Maithripala Sirisena in April said he wanted further Cabinet changes, after new ministers were sworn-in at the end of February.
President Sirisena changed the portfolios of several UNP ministers on February 25, including six Cabinet Ministers, three State Ministers, and one Deputy Minister.
Six SLFP ministers resigned from the Cabinet recently after they voted for the Joint Opposition sponsored No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

IS claims twin Kabul blasts killing scores, including journalists
AFGHANISTAN: The Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for a double suicide bombing in Kabul on Monday that left at least 25 people dead, including four journalists.
In a statement issued via its propaganda agency Amaq, it said two suicide bombers had targeted the Kabul headquarters of Afghanistan's intelligence services. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a double suicide bombing in Kabul Monday that left at least 21 people dead, including four journalists.
In a statement issued via its propaganda agency Amaq, it said two suicide bombers had targeted the Kabul headquarters of Afghanistan's intelligence services.
Ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh told Afghanistan's largest private TV channel Tolo news that at least 27 people were wounded and rushed to hospital, warning that some were in critical condition and the toll could yet rise.
The second explosion came minutes after the first at targeted reporters at the scene, police spokesman Kabul Hashmat Stanikzai told AFP.
The bomber disguised himself as a journalist and detonated himself among the crowd, he said.
A security source also confirmed both were suicide blasts. The first bomb was detonated by an assailant on a motorcycle and left at least four dead and five injured, according to the interior ministry.
Stanikzai confirmed that journalists had been killed, but said he did not know how many. AFP confirmed that, along with Marai, two journalists from 1TV and one from Tolo news were among the dead. Marai joined AFP as a driver in 1996, the year the Taliban seized power, and began taking pictures on the side, covering stories including the US invasion in 2001.
In 2002 he became a full-time photo stringer, rising through the ranks to become chief photographer in the bureau.
He leaves behind six children, including a newborn daughter.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred shortly before 8:00am (0330 GMT) near the headquarters of the Afghan intelligence services, the interior ministry said.
It comes days after the Taliban kicked off their spring offensive in an apparent rejection of calls for the militants to take up the Afghan government's offer of peace talks.
During the announcement the group vowed to target US forces and their intelligence agents as well as their internal supporters.
The blasts follow several bloody attacks across the country including a bombing that targeted a voter registration centre in Kabul that killed at least 57 people last week.
The Taliban said the offensive was partly a response to US President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan announced last August, which gave US forces more leeway to go after insurgents.
President Ashraf Ghani's government is under pressure on multiple fronts this year as it prepares to hold October's long-delayed elections while its security forces struggle to get the upper hand on the battlefield and prevent civilian casualties.

The day I lost him
Mr Premadasa used to call me every morning like a prayer. He knew I got up early. His first call was always to me and it would come between 4.30 and 5 in the morning. It was not always about work. Sometimes he would joke, play the fool.
He called me as usual on May 1, 1993, and asked me what time he should come for the procession. I told him. He was a little worried about the success of our May Day activities. He wanted to know whether we will be able to get a good crowd. I reassured him. Then he told me that in his speech he is planning to deal Gamini Dissanayake a blow that will finish him off politically. I do not know what he was planning to say. He did not tell me. But he was very angry about the unfair accusations being levelled at him by the DUNF-led Opposition that he was behind Laliths assassination.
I was organising the UNP May Day procession near the Sugathadasa Stadium from a trailer when Mr Premadasa came. AJ Ranasinghe and Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi were also with me. Mr Premadasa was early. He talked to us, went off and then came back. That was rather unusual. He was happy about the large turnout. I could see that from his face. Then he went away. That was the last time I saw him alive.
I was still near the stadium when the blast took place. We all heard it but we did not take it seriously. Then one of my security people, Abeynayake, came up to me and said: Sir there had been a bomb blast in Armour Street and the President had been there.
At first, I did not believe it because I was under the impression that Mr Premadasa had gone ahead in his vehicle. I did not think that he would stop at Armour Street to direct the procession because there was no need to do so. Still, I was worried. Mallimarachchi and A J Ranasinghe started asking me whether something was wrong. I said no, that everything was all right.
The procession kept on coming. But I could not be easy. Finally, I decided to go and investigate. I did not want to make a fuss about anything, so I did not tell anyone. I just went to Armour Street. It was then I saw the carnage. There was total confusion there. Even the police did not know what had happened. But everyone was confident that the Presidents Security would have taken him to a place of safety even though no one has heard from him or from his security personnel since the blast.
It was at this point I began to lose hope. I knew that if he was conscious if he was able to talk, he would have somehow contacted me. I know the man. I started thinking that he may be seriously injured and thus unable to contact me. I then tried to reassure myself with the thought that perhaps he left Armour Street before the blast took place.
I was confused. I did not know what to think, what to do. Finally, I decided that the best thing would be to do my job and wait for him to contact me. After all, his first question would have been about how things are, whether the procession was successful. So I did not want to leave my work unattended. (I must emphasise that I did not order the location of the blast to be washed. I merely asked the police to re-direct the procession because I did not want any more violence.)
I went back to my post near the stadium and attended to my task hiding my unease. Once the entirety of the procession left the stadium I went back to Armour Street. This time Mr Premadasas bodyguard DIG Gunatillaka was there. I asked him what happened; he did not know what happened to the President, but he was definite that the President was present when the blast took place.
As I was trying to figure out what happened I got a message asking me to come to the Presidents office. When I went there I was told that the President was dead. Until then I didnt believe the worst, did not want to believe the worst, did not even want to consider it. I cant quite remember the details of what happened next. You are confused in a situation like that. At that moment you dont feel much; there is just a feeling of numbness. The emotions, the sense of loss comes later.
I started crying.
As soon as I controlled myself I realised the important thing now was to prevent a clash from taking place between our people and the Opposition supporters. Our people were arriving at Galle Face. I was concerned about what was going to happen once they found out the President has been killed. There would be anger and that could lead to clashes since the SLFP was having its meeting at the Campbell Park. I thought the best thing would be to cancel all meetings and declare the curfew. I proposed this and it was agreed upon. After that, I went to Galle Face. Several ministers who were present asked me what was happening. I told them that I was not sure and that the President was injured in the blast. I did not tell them that he was dead. The procession was still coming in. A little while later the curfew announcement was made.
The constitutional provisions concerning the interim period were very sound indeed. They worked very well and helped to restore stability.
I was present in the Secretariat when the Prime Minister took oaths as the President. I was standing there and I started crying. I went away immediately because it may have been considered unlucky. I went to a corner where I could not be seen and wept.
All the reports we got indicated that there was going to be a mammoth crowd for the funeral. Of course, that did not happen. The reason was the steps taken by some of the political and security authorities to prevent a large gathering.
The police were worried about a large crowd turning up in Colombo for the funeral. They thought they would not be capable of controlling the situation. As a result, the National Security Council decided to declare a curfew. I did not know about it and I was not consulted or even informed.
I heard about it on the radio, when I was organising the funeral. I was furious. I went and yelled at those people. I said: you fellows have done a terrible thing; now it is better not to have the funeral. That decision was wrong and it sabotaged the funeral. That was not the only thing. Throughout the morning Police turned back buses full of mourners coming for the funeral at the Kelani bridge. I know about this because these were party people and they told me about it. So the leaders who were in charge of the security arrangements actually killed the funeral. And that did immeasurable political damage to the Party.
At the funeral, a foreign correspondent asked me what happened to the crowds. I told him the funeral was sabotaged.
The parliamentary condolence vote on Mr Pramadasa was a very emotional occasion for me. That was the first time I spoke about him in public after his death and it was difficult to control my tears.
Hon. Speaker,
On this emotional and sad occasion, on behalf of the UNP and of myself I want to pay tribute to a good friend with whom I spent almost the entirety of my political life.
Moments before his tragic death
All the members of this August Assembly know of the long and close association between the late Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa and myself. Therefore there is no need to elaborate on our friendship based on mutual understanding and trust. Our relationship began as a personal friendship. With time it grew into a close political relationship. We walked together along a rough and difficult political path, with innumerable ups and downs. We were together in both victory and defeat. We shared joy and sorrow alike. But today he has left me alone to face the sorrow of his death. But this sorrow is shared by the poor and downtrodden masses of this country. They grieve for the loss of a great and exemplary leader who dedicated his life to the betterment of the society.
This is not a traditional speech of condolence on the death of His Excellency the President. This is a speech made with great sorrow. His death is an incomparable loss to my family and myself. It is a similar loss to the people of Colombo Central which was our political university where we learnt the ABC of politics, gained political experience and constructed the development strategies necessary for the solving of day to day problems of the people.
I later heard that Babu, the suicide killer even went to Premadasas estate in Ambanpola. Premadasa did not know anything about it. It was Premadasas valet, Mohideen, who took him.
When Babu came to Colombo Central he became friendly with Mohideen. He had a lot of money and he obviously spent lavishly. The first security lapse was not investigating the background of this fellow when he started throwing money around. Later, when I asked his security people why they did not do so, they said they did not want to ask permission from the President because he may have been angry. I told them that there was no need to ask the President and that they should have carried out their own investigation. By then it was too late.
Mr Premadasas family wanted to put up the main statue of President Premadasa at Torrington Square. I opposed it. I felt that the best place to have the statue was where he lived and died in Colombo Central. He would have wanted it that way.
A friend who is also a famous sculptor, currently in England, recommended the sculptor who built that statue to me. I went to his house with Harold. When I made the request he promptly agreed. The statue was unveiled one year later, on May 1, 1994. On that day, at the request of President Wijethunga, I resigned from the post of Party General Secretary.
After Premadasas funeral ceremony was over and the body had been cremated I sat alone by the pyre. Everyone had left (the only other person there was Dulanjalee; I remember talking to her.) I knew even then that my world had collapsed. I also knew that the Party and the country were lost, that we would not be able to do anything, to continue on our journey without him.
The day I lost him was the end of the story.

The end of the episode
It was no smooth ride for Ranasinghe Premadasa who began his political career as an Municipal Councillor and achieved the political stardom by degrees. The Presidency did not smooth the way for him either. An impeachment motion levelled against by the close partners of the party rank added fuel to the burden of an insurgency brewing in the South and the disturbing presence of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in the North and East. Albeit a battle-hardened politician, President Premadasa could not weather the storm, as ill luck would have it.

Fiji storm to Sevens victory in Singapore
SINGAPORE, Sunday : Olympic champions Fiji stormed to victory in a dramatic final at the Singapore Sevens on Sunday, narrowly edging out a captainless Australia 28-22 to go top of the circuit table.
With the clock ticking in the second half, it appeared Australia -- leading by one point -- had the title in the bag, but they scuppered in the very last minute by the spirited Fijians. The tightly-fought match was won in the final play of extra time, with Alasio Naduvawho sprinting 95 metres across the field to score the final try.
I'm speechless. Australia are a very good side and took us to the wire. We gave everything for this final, Fiji captain Jerry Tuwai said in a post-match interview.
Thank you very much (everyone back home) for all your prayers support and belief in this young team.
The Fijians may lack the high-end training facilities of their wealthier opponents, but the world-beaters are set apart by fierce team spirit and guided by their deep faith.
Fiji had arrived in Singapore looking for a third consecutive Sevens victory after winning the Vancouver and Hong Kong legs of the challenge. This is their fourth victory on the circuit.
After dispatching New Zealand in a blistering quarter-final -- a repeat of this year's Commonwealth Games final -- the Fijians narrowly edged out South Africa 12-10 at the semifinals.
Sunday's win has also helped them displace the Blitzboks at top spot.  AFP

Fletchers five-for rocks Worcester
LONDON, Sunday : Stuart Broad was upstaged by Luke Fletcher as Nottinghamshire exposed Worcestershire's batting problems after a belated start at New Road in the English County Championships.
After losing the first two days to bad weather, the home side were bowled out for just 110 in 26.3 overs.
Broad warmed up for England's Test series against Pakistan with 3-28, but Fletcher claimed a career-best 5-27.
Notts also found batting tough despite Ross Taylor's 50 and they were 204-6 when bad light ended play, 94 ahead.
Somerset captain Tom Abell struck 82 to ensure his side enter the final day against Yorkshire as favourites.
Having resumed on 6-0, Ben Coad (4-61) and Jack Brooks (3-44) reduced the hosts to 24-4, as they appeared to be squandering the 120-run lead they had built up from the first innings.
But Abell's 137-ball knock guided Somerset to 200 all out, setting Yorkshire a victory target of 321.
Yorkshire reached 49-1 before bad light struck, still trailing by 272 runs.
Tom Bailey led Lancashire with the bat and ball as the hosts maintained their hopes of beating Surrey.
After resuming on 352-8, Lancashire declared on 439-9 when Bailey was caught for a career-best 66 off the bowling of Amar Singh Virdi (4-80).
England opener Mark Stoneman (0) was bowled by Graham Onions, before Scott Borthwick (79) helped Surrey recover.
But Bailey struck four times as the visitors closed on 231-9, still needing 59 runs to avoid the follow-on.
A draw would be almost inevitable should Surrey somehow be able to stave off being forced to bat again, but with last man Virdi having a top score of just eight in first-class cricket, their chances are slim.
Hampshire and Essex were frustrated by the weather once again, with only 28 overs possible on day three of their County Championship game.
The hosts are yet to complete their first innings, reaching 241-4 at the Ageas Bowl before bad light ended play.
Jimmy Adams (87) and South Africa's Hashim Amla (52) took Hampshire from their overnight 154-2 to 227-2.
But both fell after an initial two-hour delay for bad light, before it closed in once again.
Only 88 overs have been bowled in the match so far after long delays for rain and poor light during all three days.
With heavy rain forecast in Southampton on Monday, England and Essex opener Alastair Cook is unlikely to get a bat in his first domestic match of the season.  AFP

Former DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara further remanded until 14th May

Former Deputy Inspector General of Police Prasanna Nanayakkara was further remanded today until May 14 on charges related to the murder of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Nanayakkara was first arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in February on allegations that he destroyed and concealed evidence relating to the 2009 murder.
In April of this year, Nanayakkara and formerMount Lavinia Police Crimes OIC Tissa Sugathapala, also arrested in connection, were both denied bail.
The CID investigation alleges, among other things, that Nanayakkara had pressured Sugathapala not to further investigate the murder of Wickrematunge when it occurred.

Foundation stone laid for 700th reawakening village
The foundation stone to the 700th reawakening village which was named after renowned Sri Lankan film director Lester James Peiris, was laid at Tissamaharama on April 28; a day prior to the passing of film director Dr. Lester James Peries.
The village was named as Sinepathi Lester James Peiris Gama. The said project would aid families suffering from poverty by providing a sum of Rs. 500,000 for the construction of houses.
The funding for this project was donated by the Indian government, which provided Rs. 600 million for the construction of 50 reawakening villages following a request made by the Housing and Development Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The reawakening village would be the 700th village to commence construction work and is the 139th reawakening village in the Hambantota district, while being the 65th village in the Tissamanaharama electorate.

Hamilton wins chaotic Baku battle to lead title race
BAKU, Azerbaijan, Sunday - Defending world champion Lewis Hamilton claimed his first win of 2018 on Sunday and took over as leader of the title race when he triumphed in a dramatic, crash-strewn Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
The 33-year-old Briton, who had struggled for outright pace, managed to steer his Mercedes through a chaotic race and capitalize on others misfortunes to register his first victory in seven races and the 63rd of his career.
Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari looked set to turn pole position into a victory until a second Safety Car intervention left him lunging to pass Valtteri Bottas and locked up and ran off.
Bottas then seemed sure to win, but suffered a sudden right rear puncture on his Mercedes after running over metal debris on the straight. Hamilton flew past to return to the top of the podium
That was quite an emotional race, to be honest, said hamilton, who now leads the championship by four points from Vettel.
Valtteri deserved to have the win and also Sebastian did a great job. I was very fortunate today so it feels a bit odd to me to be here.
Vettel managed to continue and finish fourth ahead of his teammate Kimi Raikkonen and Mexican Sergio Perez of Force India. Carlos Sainz finishing fifth for Renault and Charles Leclerc sixth for Sauber, his first points finish.
Fernando Alonso finished seventh for McLaren ahead of Canadian Lance Stroll of Williams, Stoffel Vandoorne in the second McLaren and New Zealands Brendon Hartley of Toro Rosso who scored his first point in F1.
The race was heavily punctuated by accidents which included one in which the two Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen collided while fighting for fourth place in the closing stages, the pair having banged wheels and battled for positions throughout the race.
They ended up among the seven retirements on a challenging day on the second-longest circuit on the calendar.
In cooler conditions with a strong blustery wind, the drama unfolded from the start. As the lights went out, Vettel was away fast enough from his 53rd pole to hold off Hamilton in second, but behind them mayhem erupted.
Raikkonen, starting sixth, attempted to pass inside Ocons Force India, but the Frenchman turned in and as the pair collided he crashed into the wall.
In the surrounding chaos, Sergey Sirotkin was also contacted and he went down an escape road while Raikkonen limped back to the Ferrari pits. The luckless Alonso suffered punctured right front and rear tyres.
The multiple incidents required a Safety Car before the action settled and racing resumed, after five laps.
Vettel pulled away to open a three seconds lead ahead of Hamilton and Bottas after 10 of the scheduled 51 laps of the tight and fast Baku street track.
On lap 11, Nico Hulkenberg lost control of his Renault and clipped a wall at Turn Four as Ricciardo began a series of attacks on his Red Bull team-mate, the pair banging wheels to the consternation of their pit wall.
At the front, Vettel was in control and opened up a 3.6 seconds lead despite Hamilton recording fastest laps.
These tyres are done, complained Hamilton, who pitted to switch to softs after 22 laps, rejoining third behind Bottas, but ahead of Verstappen. Vettel led the Finn by 12.5 seconds after 25 laps.
The Red Bulls continued providing thrills as they fought for fourth, Ricciardo passing Verstappen outside Turn One before the Dutch tyro regained the place inside Turn Two.
With 20 laps to go, Vettel finally pitted and passed the lead to Bottas, but rejoined 8.5 seconds ahead of Hamilton.
A frustrated Hamilton complained about back markers, but began clawing back time, recorded a fastest lap and then saw Bottas go eight-tenths quicker.
A tense and high-speed conclusion was clearly in prospect before, after their pit-stops had reversed positions, Ricciardo rammed into Verstappen under braking for Turn One on lap 41.
The Safety Car was deployed again and the leaders pitted for new ultra-soft tyres to set up a charging 10-lap finale.
The action resumed with four laps remaining and promptly delivered even more twists as Vettel lunged to take the lead from Bottas, but locked up and fell to fourth. Then, with two laps remaining, Bottas suffered a right rear punctured after running over debris.
Oh my God, it just blew up on me, he said as Hamilton took the lead ahead of Raikkonen and Perez.

HC Judges request acceptable ratio
The High Court Judges have complained to the Constitutional Council (CC) to consider their appeal of an acceptable ratio in appointing persons to the Appeals Court.
The High Court Judges have been victimised by the ratio adopted by the Constitutional Council in appointing judges to the Appeals Court, it was unanimously decided at the General Meeting of the High Court Judges recently.
Speaking to the Daily News, a member of the legal fraternity who did not want to be named said, in the past when appointing persons to the Appeals Court, most of them were those who were not judges. This affected the promotions of the judges, he said. However, he added that despite their appeal to appoint members to the Appeal Court based on a ratio that is fair to all, for some reason it is not done.
However, appointing persons to the Appeals Court had been taking place on a 1:1 ratio of one High Court Judge to one member from another field, the High Court Judges have appealed to the Constitutional Council to implement the 3:1 ratio instead, which had been the customary procedure.

Heaven eleven: Nadal takes 11th Barcelona title
BARCELONA, Sunday - Rafael Nadal won his 11th Barcelona title on Sunday when he breezed past Greek teenager Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-2, 6-1, reinforcing his position as the overwhelming favourite to lift an 11th French Open.
It was world number one Nadal's 55th career clay-court title while he also extended his winning streak on the surface to 46 consecutive sets. The 31-year-old Spaniard won his 11th Monte Carlo Masters last weekend, also without dropping a set. Nadal now has 77 titles overall while his career clay-court match record stands at 401 wins against just 35 defeats.
It's very difficult to describe how to win 11 titles at one tournament. To win 11 Monte-Carlos and 11 Barcelonas is something I couldn't imagine doing. I'm just enjoying every week and the fact I'm playing in a tournament that I enjoy so much means a lot to me, said Nadal.
His win on Sunday was greeted by ticker-tape and a video review of all his titles on the centre court in Barcelona which now bears his name.
It's really emotional to see that video. I never dreamed of having a career like this, said the 16-time Grand Slam title winner.
Last year, they made a video of my 10 titles here. Now they have had to make another video for 11 -- it makes me feel like I am ageing.
Thanks to everyone for making the tournament so special and thanks to my family who have been with me even when things have not been so smooth.
Nadal is now level with John McEnroe on 77 career titles with only Jimmy Connors (109), Roger Federer (97) and Ivan Lendl (94) ahead of him. He may not catch them but one thing is for certain -- barring injury, he is more than likely to be lifting an 11th Coupe des Mousquetaires at Roland Garros in Paris on June 10. His confidence of capturing a 17th major will be boosted by seeing his Big Four rivals falling by the wayside. Roger Federer is skipping the clay season for a second successive year to concentrate his assault on a ninth Wimbledon title. Novak Djokovic is struggling to recover from an elbow injury and Andy Murray hasn't played since last year's Wimbledon and underwent hip sugery in January. Tsitsipas, 19 years old and ranked 63, was the first Greek man to make an ATP final since Nicholas Kalogeropoulos in Des Moines back in 1973. He was also the youngest Barcelona finalist since Nadal in 2005.
Stefanos, you had an incredible week. You have a great future and I wish you great success, added Nadal of an opponent who will become just the second teenager in the world top 50 next week after Canada's Denis Shapovalov.

For him, no was never an answer
Ranasinghe Premadasa was born on June 23, 1924, No 12, Dias Place, Keselwatta, Colombo 12. His father Richard Ranasinghe came from Hegalla in Kosgoda and his mother Batuwita Jayasinghe Arachchige Ensina Hamine hailed from Batuwita in Horana.
It is most probably this rare merging of two different streams of genes from two different communities who had lived wide apart for several generations that produced the genius called Ranasinghe Premadasa. As was customary at the time, soon after Premadasa was born his father had gone to the family astrologer with the time of birth to get the horoscope compacted. To the astonishment of the father, the astrologer had predicted that Premadasa would one day be the King of Ceylon; meaning in today's parlance that he would become the head of state; which he eventually achieved in great style indeed!
According to his parents, young Premadasa had displayed extraordinary leadership qualities from a very young age. In 1939 at the age of 15 years he began showing his colours as the prime mover and organizer of the Sucharita Movement; a social welfare and community development organisation. Politics ran in his blood. He was inducted into politics by Labour Leader A E Gunasinha in 1949. He was elected as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) in 1950 and in 1955 he rose to the office of Deputy Mayor of the CMC. He joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1956; which incidentally became a lifelong contract.
On June 23, 1964; exactly on his 40th birthday, he got married to Hema Wickramatunge of Bandarawela. It is said that this was the turning point in his life as far as his political fortune goes. His journey to the very top of the political ladder commenced upon being elected as the second MP for Colombo Central in 1965. Thereafter, he was appointed Chief Government whip, Deputy Minister and Minister of Local Government in the 1965-1970 Dudley Senanayake Government. In May 1977 he was elected as the first MP for Colombo Central and appointed to the high office of Leader of the House and Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction. On February 6, Premadasa was appointed as the Prime Minister; which paved the way to being nominated as the UNP candidate at the December 1988 Presidential Elections.
Front at the Presidential Elections
Premadasa's leadership qualities such as fearlessness, self-confidence, courage, determination, innovation and immaculate organization were taxed to the maximum at the December 1988 Presidential Election. The Presidential Election was a move of a battle of wits and of course, a do or die for Premadasa. It was conducted amidst chaos, bloodshed and mayhem. No one ever dreamt that it could be successfully concluded as the entire country was in turmoil. The civil war in the North and East was raging and the separatist terrorists had gained control of much of the territory. The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) which was inducted under the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement to disarm the terrorists had been forced into battle. The JVP insurrection in the South had turned out to be a civil war of sorts leading to murder, arson and wanton destruction of both private and public property. Conducting an islandwide election seemed impossible. The prospect of LTTE land mines and car bombs exploding at any time, anywhere in the country was driving fear and uncertainty.
The Presidential Election was a real test of Premadasa's courage, determination and leadership qualities. Public meetings could not be conducted due to threats, disruption of transport and the uneasiness that prevailed. All kinds of alternative strategies had to be adopted to reach the voters. Premadasa never vacillated. He led from the front and held midday meetings in every electorate. The people listened to his speeches from the safety of their homes through the public address system.
Premadasa was a man who never took no for an answer. He was no coward either. He won the Presidential Election securing 50.43 percent of the votes.
Crisis management, his forte
Premadasa was the best crisis manager that Sri Lanka ever produced. The greatest crisis that he faced in his political career was the Impeachment Motion. It was masterminded by two of his Cabinet Ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, ably supported by Leader of the Opposition Sirima Bandaranaike and Speaker M H Mohamed. President Premadasa had prior knowledge of the impending bombshell but he remained calm and collected until one day in August 1991, when the former Speaker Stanley Tillakaratne called on the President and related signatures of MPs were being collected for an Impeachment Motion on the pretext that it was a motion to prevent the premature dissolution of Parliament. He said that he refused to sign the document as he was not allowed to read it. In the meantime the National Intelligence Bureau was tracking the clandestine activities of the perpetrators and in fact managed to obtain a photocopy of the draft motion from an employee of a Foreign Mission in Sri Lanka. It contained five allegations of misconduct bordering on fiction said to have been committed by the President. They were the abuse of power, autocratic rule, sexual misconduct, mental disability and misuse of state resources.
On August 28 at about 6 pm while the Cabinet meeting was in progress at the Cabinet Office, I received a telephone call from the Speaker M H Mohamed to the effect that there is an urgent letter to be handed over to the President and that he is sending it through his security officer. I asked him whether it is regarding the Impeachment of the President and he laughed. I immediately phoned the Cabinet Lobby and spoke to the President. He asked me to open the letter and read it to him. It stated that in terms of Article 38 (2) of the Constitution an Impeachment Motion against the President has been entertained and that in terms of Article 70 (1) of the Constitution the President has to refrain from dissolving Parliament until the Impeachment Motion has been finally disposed of. I took the letter and handed it over to the President. He slipped it into a file cover and continued with the meeting as if nothing had happened. He did not show any emotion nor did he show any excitement. At the end of the Cabinet meeting, the President very casually inquired from us whether anyone of the Ministers had signed the Impeachment Motion but no one had the courage to own up.
After the Cabinet meeting, the President came to my office and held a meeting attended by Ministers Sirisena Cooray, K N Choksy PC, Attorney General Sunil de Silva PC and myself and discussed the various legal, constitutional and procedural issues involved in dealing with the Motion. The President did not disclose his hand at this meeting. The following morning, the President telephoned me and told me that the only way out would be to prorogue Parliament immediately and I was asked to bypass the Attorney General, the Legal Draftsman, the Secretary-General of Parliament etc. and personally and confidentially to prepare the Gazette Notification proroguing Parliament with effect from midnight on August 30, 1991, and summoning Parliament on September 24, 1991. Those behind the Impeachment Motion were perplexed and confused. Teams of UNP MPs loyal to the President were sent to the districts to locate the errant MPs and bring them to the Presidential Secretariat. Out of the 20 UNP MPs who are said to have signed the Motion, 12 MPs said they did so without reading the document; upon being told that it was meant to prevent the premature dissolution of Parliament. Four UNP MPs said that they did not sign the document but their signatures may have been forged. All of them signed affidavits by way of disclaimer or withdrawal and all these affidavits were forwarded to the Speaker. In any case after computation of valid and invalid signatures it was revealed that the Speaker had entertained the Motion without the statutory requirement of 113 valid signatures; hence the Motion was, technically invalid. Therefore the Speaker was not in a position to place the Motion on the Order Paper of Parliament. We were wondering why the President remained so calm and collected throughout the 26 days of this melodrama. It is because he had a thorough understanding of Parliamentary systems, rules and procedures. The Impeachment drama ended with the expulsion of eight UNP MPs from the party and Parliament.
Fearless, true to his conviction
In terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 1987, the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was inducted into the country for the limited purpose of disarming the LTTE. However, due to the intransigence of the LTTE, before long the IPKF was forced to switch roles from peacekeeping and disarming to combating and destroying the LTTE. Towards the end of 1988, the IPKF had become a permanent fixture in Sri Lanka and its numbers had increased to alarming proportions exceeding 100,000.
In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the government virtually had no control. Sri Lanka Armed Forces were ordered to remain in barracks. Immigration and customs formalities were almost non-existent. The Airports, Seaports and much of the territory were under the control of the IPKF. Civil Administration was under the indirect control of the LTTE. For all practical purposes, the sovereignty of a third of Sri Lanka had been ceded. The entire country including the LTTE and the JVP labelled the IPKF as an occupation force. Both frontline candidates at the Presidential Election of December 1988 R. Premadasa and Sirima Bandaranaike solemnly pledged that no sooner they came to power the IPKF would be sent back. The JVP in the meantime pledged to continue with their reign of terror in the south sent it such time the IPKF is fully withdrawn.
President Premadasa knew that the crux of the problem was the IPKF. They had accomplished a good part of their task by pushing the LTTE into the Vanni jungle hideouts. In the meantime, at the invitation of President Premadasa, the LTTE had commenced talks with the government even though not in total sincerity and were ready to declare a ceasefire against the Sri Lanka government and all other militant groups in Sri Lanka. President Premadasa, therefore, made up his mind that the IPKF should leave Sri Lanka. On June 1, 1989, Poson Poya day he made an announcement that the IPKF has completed its mission and should leave Sri Lanka by the end of July. He followed it up by addressing a letter to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. However, Rajiv Gandhi was not prepared to accede to the request on the grounds that devolution of power to the North and East Provincial Councils as per the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement has not been completed. By mid-July, as India was not responding positively Premadasa decided to issue an ultimatum to the Officer commanding the IPKF in Sri Lanka demanding the withdrawal of Indian forces before July 29, 1989, or for the IPKF troops to withdraw to their barracks.
In the absence of any positive move by India, a confrontation between the IPKF and the Sri Lanka Army was imminent. A special Cabinet meeting was convened on July 27 and the President briefed the Ministers on the gravity of the situation and the follow-up action that has to be taken. However wiser counsel by some ministers seemed to have prevailed. Luckily, by then Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne had received an invitation from his Indian Counterpart to visit New Delhi for bilateral talks. Finally at a meeting with the Indian High Commissioner and his Deputy and President Premadasa and our Foreign Minister an agreement had been reached on the parameters of the talks and the delegation led by our Foreign Minister who left for New Delhi on July 28 itself. The New Delhi talks were successful; some major concessions had been won which included the commencement of the withdrawal of the IPKF July 29 itself. It had also been agreed that the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka should visit India to prepare a schedule for the total withdrawal of the IPKF. Thus the crisis ended before the Indian and Sri Lankan Armies confronted each other. President Premadasa had proved that he could take a bilateral issue to the brink without backtracking. He had shown an unwavering determination to stand by principle.

Historic Sacred Relics exposition at Temple Trees
The exposition of the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha brought from India and Pakistan, opened at Temple Trees on Sunday evening.
The revered Relics from Sarnath in India and Taxila Museum in Pakistan are kept for public exposition.
The opening of the public exposition of the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha was attended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
At the exposition at Temple Trees, the public will have the opportunity to pay homage to the Sacred Bone Relics of the Buddha enshrined at the Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranth in India, the Relics enshrined in the Taxila Museum in Punjab in Pakistan, Relics from a Museum in Nagarjunakondai of Madurai and the Neelagiri Relics found from Sri Lanka.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and other ministers and parliamentarians visited Temple Trees on Sunday evening to pay homage to the Relics.
Prime Minister addressing the media during the inauguration of the public Exposition of the Relics said as some of the Sacred Relics are preserved in India and others in Pakistan, the Relics were not exhibited together for the public before.
Sri Lankans will not get another historical moment like this to pay homage to these Sacred Relics, he said.
The Relics from Taxila in Pakistan were found by Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. Later, the Relics were brought to Kolkata and Delhi in India. Then, Anagarika Dharmapala requested to give some Relics brought from Pakistan to the Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranath in India and the then Governor of India also agreed to his request, he said.
The Premier thanked the Indian and the Pakistani governments for their support to bring the Relics to Sri Lanka.

India resist Australia overtures for Adelaide day-night Test
SYDNEY, Monday: Australian cricket chiefs are still trying to convince reluctant India to play a day-night Test in Adelaide this year after releasing their international playing schedule on Monday.
Cricket Australia have scheduled the opening Test of the four-Test India series in Adelaide from December 6-10, with hopes it will be a pink ball match following concept successes against New Zealand, South Africa and England in recent years.
Australia believes day-night Test cricket is the future of the sport and perhaps the only way to save the format despite boom television ratings and record crowds.
But the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have so far resisted CA's overtures.
CA will play a pink-ball Test against Sri Lanka in Brisbane from January 24-28 next year, but chief executive James Sutherland said he was still negotiating with India.
It is our preference that we play India in a day-night Test match in Adelaide, but we are still working through this detail and hope to have an answer on this in the coming weeks, he said.
Sutherland has been pushing hard at International Cricket Council level for the new Test Championship schedule to include day-night Tests, but the powerful BCCI has a big say in outcomes.
CA confirmed Australia will face South Africa in a Twenty20 international on Queensland's Gold Coast, while the new Perth Stadium and Canberra's Manuka Oval will both host Test cricket for the first time. But Hobart misses out.
The international season starts on November 4 with the first of three ODIs against South Africa before the one-off T20 against the Proteas on the Gold Coast, which will be followed by three T20s against India preceding the start of the Test summer.
Our men's international season structure changes slightly this summer, with one-day and T20 international matches against South Africa and India in November, Sutherland said.
Adelaide opens the Test series against India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and Perth Stadium will host the second Test, before the series moves back to Melbourne and Sydney for the traditional Boxing Day and New Year's showpiece games.
Following the Tests, there will be three ODIs against India in a seven-day window before a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in Brisbane under lights at the Gabba and a second match in Canberra.  AFP

Iran nuclear deal: UK backs deal despite US and Israel accusations

Britain has backed a "vitally important" nuclear deal with Iran, after Israel and the US accused the Iranians of pursuing atomic weapons.
Israelclaimed it had evidenceshowing Iran covertly sought nuclear weapons - an accusation rejected by Iran.
The US said Israel's claims are "consistent" with its own intelligence.
Six nations signed an accord in 2015 lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for the Iranian's abandoning a nuclear weapon programme.
Iran said it only sought nuclear energy, not weapons.
A British government spokesman said inspectors appointed as part of the accord are providing a "vitally important way of independently verifying that Iran is adhering to the deal".
The spokesman added: "We have never been naive about Iran and its nuclear intentions."
Britain, Germany and France all still support the accord, which was also signed by China and Russia.
On Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what he said were "secret nuclear files" proving Iran once covertly pursued nuclear weapons.
He said thousands of pages of material obtained by Israel showed Iran had deceived the world by denying it had ever sought nuclear weapons.
Iran responded that Israel's revelations were a "childish" stunt to influence President Donald Trump's decision on whether to remain in the nuclear deal, which he is due to make by 12 May.
Trump has asked the European signatories to the agreement to "fix the terrible flaws" with it or he will refuse to extend sanctions relief on Iran.
In a statement, the White House said Israel's information provided "new and compelling details" about Iran's alleged efforts to develop "missile-deliverable nuclear weapons".
The US statement said: "These facts are consistent with what the US has long known - Iran had a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people."
According to Iranian state TV, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organisation, said he hoped Trump "comes to his senses and stays in the deal".

Man City close in on points record with 4-1 win at West Ham
LONDON, Sunday - Manchester City secured a comfortable 4-1 win over West Ham United at the London Stadium on Sunday to move within two of the Premier Leagues single-season points record.
PFA Young Player of the Year Leroy Sane got City  confirmed as Premier League champions two weeks ago  up and running in the 13th minute as his strike from the edge of the penalty area was deflected in by Patrice Evra.
Former City defender Pablo Zabaleta put through his own net 14 minutes later to score Citys 100th Premier League goal of the season before Aaron Cresswell curled home a 42nd-minute free kick to get West Ham back in it.
Second-half goals from Gabriel Jesus and Fernandinho made sure of the win, leaving West Ham three points above the relegation zone in 15th.
Citys tally of 102 goals for the season is one off Chelseas Premier League record set in 2009-10. They have 93 points, two short of the Premier League best which was also set by Chelsea in 2004-2005.
We wanted to win today so that we can get the record of 96 points at home when we get the trophy in front of our people next week, City manager Pep Guardiola said.
Adrian started in goal for West Ham, with loanee Joe Hart unable to face his parent club, but the Spaniard could do nothing as Sane  back in the team at the expense of David Silva  saw his powerful strike go in off Evras head.
Soon enough it was two as Zabaleta put through his own net against his former club.
We didnt do things as well as we should, West Ham manager David Moyes said.

May Day messages
Salute workers for relentless struggle: President
Marking the May Day today, President Maithripala Sirisena said he takes this opportunity to salute the working force of the country for its relentless struggle to intelligently and collectively work towards the economic progress of the country, while leaving aside communal or religious differences and work for the betterment of all the people.
Issuing the May Day message, the President said, I extend my warm good wishes to their rightful struggle.
Full text of the message:
I send this message of greetings on the International May Day, which symbolizes the fact that the great force of united people clamouring for freedom could break the strongest iron shackles as witnessed on the day of historical Chicago March of the working forces. I salute all those who sacrificed lives and shed blood over the years for the freedom and rights of the people and the workers of the world on this occasion.
Human civilization evolved with the courage of the people who did not surrender before challenges. Wonderful inventions of the human civilization, which were held by a privileged few became available to the entire mankind thanks to the courageous persons who relentlessly fought for the rights of the masses.
The May Day reminds us the true fact that the wide space we enjoy in our lives today is due to the sacrifices of blood and sweat by those great people.
Furthermore, this May Day is also an occasion to remember the lessons we learned in the history of the three-decade-long communal conflict, which was followed by a period of autocracy and the efforts made over the past three years to take the nation forward as a free, strong and democratic country.
Sri Lanka works in accordance with the agreements, treaties and regulations adopted by the International Labour Organization and other related institutions. In line with those, we have taken steps to provide houses to estate workers, impose minimum wages for private sector workers, include domestic workers under labour laws and remove disparities in maternity leave rights to provide the respect and dignity to the labour force.
I take this opportunity to salute the working force of the country for its relentless struggle to intelligently and collectively work towards the economic progress of the country, while leaving aside communal or religious differences and work for the betterment of all the people and I extend my warm good wishes to their rightful struggle.

Commit to rewrite history: PM
Marking the May Day today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called on all workers to be radical in the accomplishment of their responsibilities and commitments in order to rewrite a history for the Workers Day.
The full text of the message:
Human labour is widely recognised and valued with the communication and technological advancement in the present world. Workers are not merely the labourers or farmers like in the 80s but a whole set of people in different ranks of professions and in different strata of life. Concerns and conversations on individual rights and discharging particular responsibilities to the nation in return are equally important. Not surprisingly workers riots in worlds history have been able to meet many of the demands of the workers. The sacrifices of so many people who fought for the rights and dignities we enjoy today cannot be forgotten.
Yet today we have the challenge of finding other means for our gains. We can end up our fighting for a win-win solution. The workers today have to be radical in the accomplishment of their responsibilities and commitments in order to rewrite a history for the workers day.
I take pleasure in hailing the whole working community on this day and I wish the fulfilment of their own rights while bestowing valour and vigour on them in accelerating the course of the countrys development.

Media-savvy President
The Seventh SAARC summit held in Dhaka in April 1993 over, Bangladesh President Abdul Rahman Biswas hosted a state banquet in his official residence in honour of the outgoing chair of the SAARC, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The media corps from Sri Lanka who were in Dhaka to cover the important event too were invited to this state banquet as the guests of President Premadasa.
Observing a traditional protocol germane to the occasion, at the inception, the Bangladesh President introduced his guests to our President and presently it was President Premadasas turn to introduce his guests to the Bangladesh President and that countrys Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.
Amazing memory
Addressing the Silumina Poetry Awards ceremony audience
There were over 30 media personnel from Sri Lanka representing electronic and print media invited to the event and this writer was among them as the Daily News representative.
We all queued up to be introduced to the Bangladesh President and the Prime Minister and President Premadasa began doing the honours.
My friend Suresh Perera from The Island was ahead of me in the queue and President Premadasa introducing him to the Bangladesh President and the Prime Minister said: Meet Mr. Suresh Perera, an outstanding journalist from Sri Lanka!
Then it was my turn to be introduced to the Bangladesh President and the PM. Our President introduced me by name adding a similar complimentary comment about me.
What amazed us all on this occasion was President Premadasas uncanny ability to remember the names of all media personnel who accounted for most of his guests and add some appropriate complimentary remark when introducing each of them!
Journalist friends
The late President knew practically all leading journalists in print and electronic media so closely he used to address them by their first name. Some of such journalists were longstanding friends of his.
Premadasa was not a leader who had a meteoric rise to the highest office in the country under fortuitous circumstances. He started his public career as a social worker at Sri Sucharitha Vyaparaya, he himself founded was the vehicle he used for carrying forward the activity of his movement. During the initial stage of his career as a moral rearmament activist he closely moved with poets, writers, and artistes and years later as a powerful authority, he extended his ready patronage to them by taking concrete steps to serve their causes.
It appears that the late President began cultivating good relations with the Press and the journalists after making his debut into politics as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council. Maybe that he did not go out of the way to befriend journalists, but chance meetings with them over the years as the Deputy City Mayor, an MP, a Minister, Prime Minister and finally as the countrys Head of State, no doubt, led him to win their affection and goodwill.
I wanted to be a journalist like you!
As the Daily News reporter assigned to cover the late President Premadasa from the time he was appointed Prime Minister up to the day of his tragic demise, opportunities came in the way of this writer to know always something new about his cherished aspirations in life.
Most journalists who had occasion to maintain a close rapport with the late President may endorse this writers view that the great man had some kindred feeling towards journalists and media in general. This writer recalls in this context something the late President told him during an informal brief chat he and a colleague of his, Saman Chandranath Weerasinghe, had with the great man at his private residence at Dias Place, Colombo where he lived even after becoming the President. Asked what kind of a career would he have taken to if he did not become a politician, he replied after a moments reflection, Someone like you! A journalist! I had a hankering to write poetry and features on various topics from my young days. But thats as a hobby. A career is different. I would have been happy if I could become a journalist like you!
Soft corner for journalists
During an SLBCinterview in 1955
By the way, Premadasa had brought out in print several books in prose and verse as a social worker and he had written his better-known work, Peramaga Lakunu in 1976 after entering active politics. This work embodies the great mans vision of national development.
It is a well-known fact that President Premadasa took a personal interest to help journalists who sought his help. And many journalists took advantage of his soft corner for them by obtaining apartments in urban housing schemes he himself took the initiative to set up.
He had gone out of the way to offer a flat in the city to even a newspaper cartoonist who had been caricaturing him day in and day out to give weight to critical comments being made about him as a matter of editorial policy of that newspaper.
He seldom missed the funeral of a journalist or that of a family member of a journalist. This writer still remembers well that the late President took the trouble, despite being on a tight election campaign schedule, to attend the funeral of his Dinamina colleague Piyaratne Colombage who was killed in a road accident at Padukka in 1988. This incident occurred at the height of JVP insurgency and many of Colombages colleagues could not attend the funeral due to the difficulties that resulted from the highly tense situation.
Janatha column
Perhaps, the late Presidents first significant tie with print media goes back to the days when he built up a rapport with the rate-payers in the city by answering queries raised by them as the Deputy Mayor through a popular column run in the Lake House Evening Daily, Janatha.
Perhaps, there had been no political leader in the countrys recent history who made use of the media so much to build his own image and to communicate with the masses as the late President Premadasa.
Media rapport
Says the late Presidents Press Secretary S.J. Anthony Fernando in a commemorative article carried in a national English Weekly a few years ago: Premadasa knew the importance of media in communicating with people. He always maintained a healthy rapport with the media
The late President had also realised the value of media not only as a medium through he could communicate with people and share their pulse but also as a source which could provide him with important information about various glaring shortcomings in his administration. Whenever he spotted a news story highlighting a shortcoming in his administration or a serious problem that the people in some part of the country was facing, he got his aides to send the cuttings of such stories to Ministry secretaries and departmental heads concerned for immediate remedial action.
First to read newspapers
Anthony Fernando also says in his commemorative articles: Evans and my work was made easier because it was President Premadasa himself who was the first to read the newspapers at 4 in the morning. He adds: very often he would chide us saying, I say, I have become the Press Officer too.
So, it was the first citizen in the country who was the first to read the days newspapers as a general reader!
It is a well-known thing that the late President, a regular early riser, would wake up political and administrative authorities in the wee hours to discuss important issues highlighted in the newspapers.
President Premadasa would very often contact the newspaper Editors and News Editors himself to compliment about a news story or a news feature he was pleased with or to make a clarification of a matter referred to in a news story.
Premadasa here!
Here, this writer recalls how an incident where a telephone call from President Premadasa received at the News Desk of the Daily News one day gave rise to a humorous situation.
The time on the day in question was about 7.30 in the morning and I had just walked into the editorial. By this time only one or two editorial staffers had turned up at the News Desk. Staff photographer Roland Perera who was pacing up and down, on seeing me nodded to me by way of greeting.
You are to go out on an assignment, Roland I asked him.
Yes, AS. I am supposed to go with Wijesekera. I am waiting for him. We are already late. I cant understand why the hell is he getting late! Roland sounded exasperated.
Meanwhile, the telephone on Deputy Editor N R J Aarons table started shrilling.
Ah! That must be him! said Roland and took the receiver and was answering the call.
Good morning, thama! Mama mehe thamuse ei kiyala kochchara Welabalagena unnada! Den wedeta parakkuth wediy! (How long had I been waiting for you here. Now we are almost late for the assignment!)
Rolands angry tone suddenly changed into a meek and humble tenor.
Ane, Sir, mata samawanna! Mama hituwe ape Premadasa Wijesekera kiyala! (I beg your pardon, Sir. I thought I was speaking to our Premadasa Wijesekera.)
When Roland turned to me, there were beads of sweat on his forehead and he was a picture of utter shock and dismay.
It was with the greatest difficulty that we later got out of him the cause behind his flabbergasted look.
The caller had been none other than President Premadasa and as usual, he had said: Good morning. Premadasa here! And Roland was in such an angry and impatient mood that he immediately mistook him for his colleague Premadasa Wijesekera.
The late President had immediately recognized Roland s voice and had explained that he wanted to speak to the New Editor or some other responsible executive.
Two-pronged strategy
The late President Premadasa followed a two-pronged strategy in building a close rapport with the masses of the country: by meeting the people in their villages in person and at public functions and addressing them through the mass media. In fact, he would proudly declare very often: There is no village in this country which I have not set my foot on.
Media attraction
However, he depended more on media to familiarize and educate the masses on his pet development and good governance programs.
As the Prime Minister and the President of the country, practically every day he was out at some public function somewhere in the country. It could be the opening of a Udagama model village or a new garment factory. At the public rallies held to mark such events, the late President would be the last speaker to address the gathering. It this writers personal experience that the peasant crowds would patiently wait rooted to the spot until late hours in the night to listen to their leaders speech.
He knew that the print media expected him to come out during his address with some sensational or news-making statement which would make either a good page one lead or a page one story. And Premadasa seldom disappointed them.
Administration at the doorstep
This writer remembers President Premadasa depended much on media to create an awareness among the people about the Pradeshiya Sabha and the Divisional Secretariat systems which could be described as his brainchild, on the eve of their introduction to the country.
He made pithy comments at public rallies to send home to the people the importance of these new changes.
Referring to the Pradeshiya Sabha system, he told the people that they would soon get their own Gramarajayas.
Explaining the merits of the Divisional Secretariat system he would say: We are going to bring the administration to your doorstep.
Peerless politician
The former top civil servant K H J Wijayadasa who was closely associated with the late President Premadasa as his secretary and even when he was the Prime Minister describes the late great man as an extraordinary man, philosopher, a thinker and a patriot.
As a journalist, this writer wishes to say that with the tragic and untimely death of the late President Premadasa the media in the country lost a peerless great friend.

Messi hat-trick seals Barcas 25th title in style
MADRID, Sunday - Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde was delighted that his side finally wrapped up a 25th La Liga title with four matches to spare, after a Lionel Messi hat-trick secured a thrilling 4-2 victory at Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.
Valverde's men completed a league and cup double after thrashing Sevilla 5-0 in last week's Copa del Rey final, regaining the Spanish crown from Real Madrid and relegating Deportivo in the process.
When you chase it for so long you say finally, he told Spanish television.
I feel very happy because in the end the league is very long, it starts in August... and when spring arrives everything is decided, we have passed everything.
We've been pursuing it since the beginning, we have been in the lead, we've finished well, with a big margin... It's the first La Liga that I've won.
The only blip on the Catalans season was the stunning Champions League quarter-final loss at Roma when they blew a 4-1 first-leg lead.
The elimination (by Roma) marked us a little bit because it was unexpected, but out trajectory has been extraordinary, added Valverde. There is always a small but, but we'll try again next year.
Barca knew they just had to extend their record unbeaten streak to 41 La Liga matches to seal a seventh title in 10 seasons, and Philippe Coutinho fired them into an early lead.
Messi's 38th-minute volley made it two, but Lucas Perez pulled one back for Deportivo before half-time and Turkish winger Emre Colak stunned Barca with an equaliser midway through the second period.
Barca finally saw off their stubborn hosts, though, as Messi pounced after a brilliant one-two with Luis Suarez before slotting in to complete his 30th La Liga treble. The Catalan giants now hold an unassailable 11-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid, who have just three games to play, and are closing in on becoming the first Spanish side to go through a top-flight season without tasting defeat.
We have managed an almost perfect league campaign, without losing so far. I hope we can continue, midfielder Sergio Busquets said.
Andres Iniesta was surprisingly left on the bench after the midfield great announced earlier this week that he will leave the club at the end of the season. But it was his expected long-term successor Coutinho who broke the deadlock in the seventh minute, bending an exquisite finish into the top corner for his third La Liga goal for the club since signing from Liverpool in January.
Deportivo had to win to stave off relegation for another week, but Clarence Seedorf's men were denied an equaliser when Perez was flagged offside after tapping in from close range. Messi went close to doubling the advantage just before the half-hour mark, only for home goalkeeper Ruben to pull off an excellent one-handed save to turn his free-kick around the post.
Deportivo were causing Barca plenty of problems at the back, though, and centre-back Fabian Schaer should have levelled as he headed over when unmarked inside the six-yard box.
But Messi drilled a curling Suarez cross past Ruben at the keeper's near post to score his 30th league goal of the campaign, before on-loan Arsenal striker Perez swept home to halve the deficit just two minutes later. Despite the close scoreline, Barca were playing as if the second half was a pure title party, with centre-back Gerard Pique even performing a few keepie uppies on the left wing.
Their complacency cost them in the 64th minute, as Celso Borges unselfishly squared for Colak to score.
Suddenly the champions-elect were desperately trying to hang onto their unbeaten record, as goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a smart stop from another Schaer header. But Barcelona showed their class as Suarez and Messi combined to terrific effect with eight minutes to play -- the latter clipping the ball in off the post.
Suarez again sent the Argentinian racing clear three minutes later, and the 30-year-old made no mistake to complete a hat-trick.
The 33-year-old Iniesta came on to a standing ovation in the 87th minute as Barca closed out a successful title-winning campaign in style.  AFP

New dharmashala inaugurated at Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya
The National Vesak Festival  2018, which was held at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya premises under the aegis of President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday (28), coincided with the inauguration of a new dharmashala (preaching hall) which was constructed by Sri Lanka Army troops of the Security Force Headquarters  West (SFHQ-West) and Corps of Engineer Services (CES).
The construction work was carried out under the instructions of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake in close coordination with the Buddhasasana Ministry and other stakeholders.
The new dharmashala spans an area of 9,656 sqaure-feet [142 ft (length) x 68 ft (width)] and is capable of accommodating over 1,000 devotees.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake had recently conducted an inspection tour to the construction site at Bingiriya and had reviewed the progress of the project together with officers and engineering troops.
Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Mallagane Aththadassi Nayake Thera was the adviser to the project. Accordingly, 143 Brigade troops under the 14 Division of the SFHQ-West undertook the construction of the lecture hall.
President Sirisena at the auspicious minute on Saturday, unveiled the plaque of the preaching hall, while simultaneously inaugurating the National Vesak Festival.
1 Corps of Engineer Services (CES) troops, together with the support of the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) and Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) troops, participated in the construction and renovation work.
The Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya in the Kurunegala district is one of the ancient temples in Sri Lanka and its history dates back to the 3rd century BC.
143 Brigade Commander Brigadier Palitha Perera was behind the realisation of the project under the supervision of Security Forces  West Commander Major General Sathyapriya Liyanage.
In addition, the 143 Brigade troops facilitated all arrangements of the Bingiriya Vesak zone.
The Tri Nikayas Maha Sangha, Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, other ministers, tri-service senior officers and Buddhists devotees were present at the ceremony.

No play on second day of Kent v Pakistan
CANTERBURY, Sunday - Persistent drizzle and bad light meant play on the second day of Pakistan's tour opener against Kent at Canterbury was abandoned without a ball bowled on Sunday.
When the players should have been taking the field at 11:00am local time (1000 GMT) for the second day of four, they remained in the pavilion, with the pitch and square under protective covers while the floodlights shone brightly against a gloomy sky.
The umpires then announced they would take lunch 45 minutes early in the hope of making a prompt start to the second session.
But with the bad weather firmly set in, the umpires called off play for the day at 1:30pm (1230 GMT).
Kent are 39 for one in reply to Pakistan's first innings 168, a total in which Imam-ul-Haq's 61 was the top score.
Uncapped at Test level, Imam's inclusion in the tour squad generated debate because the 22-year-old left-hander is the nephew of Pakistan chief selector and former international batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq.
But there was no denying Imam's talent or application as he struck nine fours in a 111-ball innings played in typically English overcast and swing-friendly conditions that favoured the bowlers, with medium-pacer Will Gidman taking five for 47. Kent were one for one in reply when Hasan Ali, one of the stars of Pakistan's one-day Champions Trophy tournament win in Britain last year, had Daniel Bell-Drummond lbw.
But Sean Dickson 24 not out and Kent captain Joe Denly 12 not out saw the hosts through to Saturday's close without further loss.
After this match, Pakistan face Northamptonshire before providing the opposition for Ireland's inaugural Test, in Malahide, from May 11-15.
Pakistan then recross the Irish Sea for a two-Test series against England at Lord's (May 24-28) and Headingley (June 1-5).

OMP to meet affected families from May 12: Peiris
The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) will begin speaking to the families of disappeared people from all parts of the country from May, OMP Chairman Saliya Peiris, PC, said.
Pieris told the Daily News on Monday that the Commissioners would meet with families in Matara, Kandy, Kilinochchi, Mullaithivu, Trincomalee, and Jaffna from May to July. Their first meeting will be held in Mannar on May 12.
The OMP will from May onwards visit different places to speak to families of the missing and disappeared to share our plans and obtain their views on how we should proceed, he said.
The families of disappeared people have been protesting on the roadside for answers about their lost loved ones in many of these districts for over a year. They are demanding that the government release a list of all people who surrendered at the end of the war, as well as the location of any secret detention camps.
In the South, families have gone decades without answers about people kidnapped by the Security Forces during the two JVP insurrections in the 1970s and 80s.
Pieris said that his office will consult the families as they begin creating a mechanism to receive and investigate complaints.
He said although the OMP is a fact-finding body, it does not have powers of prosecution, and that the information it discovers cannot be used in a court of law.
The OMP can refer certain cases to law enforcement authorities at its discretion.
The eight-member OMP officially began operating in February out of a temporary office in Nawala, after its Commissioners were appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The OMP Chairman said they plan to create multiple regional offices to field investigations.

President Premadasa left an indelible mark in peoples hearts - President
President Maithripala Sirisena in a message to mark the 25th death anniversary of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa which falls today said that former President Premadasa is among the few statesmen who left an indelible imprint in the hearts of the common man in the country.There are a few humans who leave incredible legacies and live on in the hearts of the people.
Former President Premadasa is one such great human being, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He set an example by hailing from humble beginnings to become the President of the country through sheer dedication and commitment to the service of the people.
President Sirisena further said that President Premadasa always camapaigned against social injustice and emerged as a leader of the common man.
He was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council in 1950 contesting the St Sebastian Ward and ascended the top rung of the country overcoming innumerable hurdles and hardships.
The President added that President Premadasa was magnanimous in victory and never disappointed in defeat.
He dedicated every single moment for the welfare of the people and was ready to listen to the grievances of the people.
President Premadasa knew the pulse of the people and was a good organizer.He together with Late President J.R.Jayewardene succeeded in reviving the United National Party whenever the party suffered a set back in politics.

He succeeded in overcoming challenges and obstacles that stood in his way through his political experience and sheer discipline.
He faced many hurdles and hardships efeectively and overcame those challaenges successfully.
There were instances when he was closer to the members of the Opposition than the MPs of his own party.
He was so popular that he maintained very close rapport with all MPs alike. The former President inaugurated a number of projects for the benefit of suppressed which included massive housing programme, granting of pension to artistes, development of marshy lands for the benefit of people at grass root level and granting of free uniforms and mid day meal to the school children.

The quintessential politician
The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was the second leader of the country to be assassinated while in harness, the other being S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike (the country's first Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake too did not die of natural cause while yet holding the reins).
It is exactly a quarter century ago that President Premadasa was killed by an LTTE suicide bomber while directing the UNP's May Day procession at Armour Street. The incident, no doubt, will be still fresh in the memory of most Lankans who went through those turbulent days in the early 1990s, as the country marks the 25th death anniversary of the late President.
Premadasa had just survived an impeachment attempt against him by his own party men and was in the process of a damage control exercise in order to wrest the political initiative that appeared to be slipping away from him. Though he brought the second JVP uprising under control and earned the plaudits of many, there were those who continued to demonize him for the means adopted to quell the violence, particularly his political enemies.
Revival
Whatever said of the late President Premadasa he was the quintessential politician of the masses who broke the mould of the hitherto elitist UNP and brought it closer to the common man. The Grand Old Party was in the doldrums after the route it suffered at the hands of Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1970. It was left to JRJ and Premadasa to gather the pieces and rebuild the party into a winning outfit. In Premadasa, JRJ had an able lieutenant who took the fight to the enemy. The duo went around the country in the task of rebuilding the grassroots machinery of the party and lifting the morale of the party cadres who were a dejected and despaired lot after the humiliating defeat.
Premadasa, with his mesmerizing oratory laced, homespun wisecracks and colloquial banter was the ideal foil for the measured tones of JRJ. The duo proved to be a winning combination.
The UNP swept the board winning over 140 seats at the 1977 General Election and Premadasa emerged victor by the highest majority overall in his Colombo Central constituency.
It was no surprise when JRJ made Premadasa the Prime Minister. It was the first time in the party's history that a commoner was elevated to that high office. Though the Executive Presidency relegated the post of Prime Minister to a virtual figurehead entity (Premadasa often used to claim that it was like the post of a peon) he nevertheless warmed to the task and went about his business in a style that is unique to Ranasinghe Premadasa, his legendary commitment to whatever task he set his sights on producing the results that would have been unattainable to lesser mortals. But the area in which he gained fame and recognition was for his signature housing programme, his ambition being to provide a shelter of their own for every family in the country and was the prime mover in having the UN declare a World Habitat Day each year.
His populist programmes, common man persona, skilled oratory, energy for hard work and charisma, no doubt gained massive public support for him and it was only natural that JRJ would nominate Premadasa to take over the mantle from him to lead the country.
Non- conformist
The rest, as they say, is history. Premadasa won the Presidential election, albeit narrowly, at a time the country was practically in flames with the JVP uprising causing rivers of blood to flow in the South while the LTTE was waging a separatist war in the North that was taking a heavy toll on the lives of the soldiers.
Despite these twin challenges, Premadasa also had to contend with the presence of foreign troops in the country in the form of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) that was a major irritant to his rule. He was in any event a fierce opponent of the Indo-Lanka Accord (he boycotted the signing ceremony) and was constantly clamouring for the exit of the Indian Army from Sri Lankan soil. This he eventually achieved in the second year of his Presidency.
The late President Premadasa was a non- conformist and the unconventional manner he requested the IPKF to leave the country was condemned by his critics as offensive to diplomatic protocol.
Unparalleled service
It is this unconventional, unorthodox style that gained him acceptance in whatever he strove to do for the benefit of the public, be it opening of garment factories in the far flung areas of the country or telling a nosy British Commissioner where to get off when the latter was found interfering with the country's electoral process. It was this same unorthodoxy he employed in overcoming the impeachment proceeding against him.
True, he had his faults and was rightly criticized for some of his actions, but Ranasinghe Premasada, it is agreed by most in this country, left an indelible impression in the political landscape of this country. His services to the poor and downtrodden were unparalleled to this day. His memory, no doubt, would continue to live in the hearts of thousands in this country who benefited from his services.
Had the cruel hand of an assassin not snatched his life in the prime of his Presidency this country may have turned a new page by now in the sphere of development and progress.

Ranasinghe Premadasa
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, whose 25th death anniversary is being commemorated today, was a legend in his own lifetime. A champion of the poor who hailed from the working class himself, Premadasa rose through the ranks of the United National Party (UNP) to become Prime Minister and later, Executive President. His rise to the top enabled the UNP to shed its earlier Uncle Nephew Party image and become a truly peoples political movement.
President Premadasa was a phenomenon in local politics which was dominated by politicians from the aristocratic class who were far removed the trials and tribulations of the working masses. The fact that President Premadasa was assassinated on May Day  a day dedicated to the working class  was no coincidence. Despite security concerns, he preferred to mingle with the masses at all times rather than ruling from an air-conditioned room. His assassin took advantage of this sterling quality to carry out the cowardly bomb explosion.
The people were at the centre of President Premadasas unique brand of politics. Having gained a firm foothold in people-centred politics at the Colombo Municipal Council, President Premadasa went on to reach greater heights, eventually becoming the countrys second Executive President. But well before achieving that ultimate milestone, Premadasa championed two programmes that are still primarily associated with him  Gam Udawa (the Village Re-Awakening Movement) and Jana Saviya (Peoples Strength), the Poverty Alleviation Programme.
President Premadasa gained international recognition for the Gam Udawa concept, which aimed at providing housing for everyone who did not have a home. In fact, the United Nations declared 1987 as the Year of Shelter for the Homeless based on his proposal. This was a singular achievement for a Sri Lankan leader. President Premadasas avowed aim was to build one million houses. Although he could not fulfill this aim before his death, his son, Minister Sajith Premadasa, is successfully continuing the programme.
The main feature of Gam Udawa is that it relies mostly on the voluntary efforts of villagers. The Government supplies the funds, material and construction machinery, but it is up to the villagers to get together and help each other to build their houses. This was President Premadasas way of ensuring that bonds among villagers were strengthened. Janasaviya too followed a similar theme. The idea was not to give the poor families a dole or allowance for life, but rather to make them self-reliant. This way, they could eventually emerge out of poverty. Janasaviya and its successor Samurdhi (Prosperity) have drastically reduced poverty levels in Sri Lanka over the last 25 years.
President Premadasa also pioneered the concept of taking the Government to the villages through Mobile Services which continue to this day. He was aghast that poor villagers had to travel to Colombo or to the biggest city in their province to get even a simple document. He virtually took the entire Government machinery, from the Department of Registration of Persons to the RMV, to a selected village and attended to the villagers problems for a couple of days. He could usually be found in one of the kiosks personally supervising the whole operation. He also realised that some of his aims could not be achieved with the existing Government institutions, so he created entirely new ones such as the National Housing Development Authority, Urban Development Authority, Central Environmental Authority, the Janasaviya Trust Fund, the Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Institute for Construction Training and Development, among others.
President Premadasa was a perfectionist who demanded results, be it Gam Udawa, Janasaviya or a village development project. He had an ear to the ground and was known to read the days newspapers early in the morning. He always took note of news items that highlighted various shortcomings in villages, such as dilapidated roads and called ministers and officials demanding prompt remedial action. He would follow through a few days later and sometimes even visit the village in question to see the progress. He was very much a hands-on leader who never took no for an answer. He always had a positive attitude  in his book, nothing was impossible. This attitude pervaded through his life and politics.
The biggest challenge he faced in his chequered political life was the Impeachment Motion brought by a section of MPs in the latter part of 1991. Addressing the new session of Parliament on September 24, 1991, President Premadasa alluded to the Motion, saying no misconduct on my part has been established. We all know that no person is considered guilty of any offence merely because a charge has been levelled against him. It is therefore necessary that the accused has to be considered innocent till he is proved guilty. I have not been found guilty of any offence. The Speaker dismissed the Motion on October 8, 1991, citing a lack of valid signatures and the impeachment saga ended with the President firmly in the saddle. His assassination just two years later changed the political landscape virtually overnight, but his legacy and countless achievements will live on in the hearts and minds of all Sri Lankans.

Rebellion Crushed
Twenty five years after he fell victim to a terrorist bomb attack, the memory of Ranasinghe Premadasa lingers on, his place in post-independence history still not properly delineated. Premadasa was always a divisive figure in Sri Lankan politics but even his harshest critics will agree that he handled Sri Lankas worst constitutional crisis- the impeachment motion against him- with characteristic precision and efficiency.
In hindsight, the saga of Premadasas impeachment has its roots in the lead up to Premadasas elevation to the Presidency in 1989 at time when the country was crippled with twin insurrections: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the North and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the South.
Although Premadasas predecessor, J. R. Jayewardene briefly toyed with the idea of amending the Constitution and running for a third term of office, saner counsel prevailed: Jayewardene, then 83 years of age, retired.
There were many in the UNP who held the view that two ministers in Jayewardenes Cabinet, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, possessed more political and intellectual maturity- as opposed to Premadasas gung-ho, street smart style- to succeed Jayewardene as the UNPs leader.
To his credit, Jayewardene stuck with Premadasa, the man who had toiled long and hard with him as he re-organised and rejuvenated the UNP after Dudley Senanayakes demise. Premadasa- unlike Athulathmudali and Dissanayake- was no lawyer turned politician born into a reputed family with political connections. His was a hard grind to the top, breaking down the elitist class and caste barriers of the UNP.
Popular leader
Premadasa was immensely proud of what he had achieved. Once he reminded Anura Bandaranaike in Parliament that he, Premadasa, was once the boy who sold lavariya in Kehelwatte. As he himself proudly declared on numerous occasions, Premadasas political skills were not honed in the halls of academe but from the university of life.
Even so, despite being a seasoned campaigner and a platform orator voters flocked to hear, the 1988 presidential election was no cakewalk. The JVP had threatened voters with death. Sirima Bandaranaike, with her civic rights now restored, was a formidable opponent. The burden of incumbency from a UNP government that had been in office for twelve years was beginning to take its toll. The Indian Peace Keeping Force was in occupation in the North and East, giving the majority community a siege mentality. Still, Premadasa won, polling just over 50 per cent of the vote.
If Premadasas election campaign- spearheaded by the promise of Janasaviya and including the ingenious me kawda mokada karanne poster campaign- was a spectacular success against all odds, his subsequent choices in deciding his government were equally monumental blunders, culminating in the impeachment motion against him.
It is no secret that, in the aftermath of Premadasas ascension to the Presidency, both Athulathmudali and Dissanayake made separate overtures to the President-elect to seek the Prime Ministers post. Premadasa rebuffed them both. Had he chosen one over the other, his Prime Minister would have been loyal to him at the expense of the other candidate.
Premadasa though was an instinctive, rather than an intellectual politician. He opted for the mild-mannered, soft spoken, silver haired Dingiri Banda Wijetunge as his Prime Minister. Wijetunge had all but retired from active politics and was serving as Governor of the Wayamba Province when he was recalled to Parliament and appointed Premier. It could be argued that Premadasa would have felt insecure had either Athulathmudali or Dissanayake become Prime Minister and would have feared being undermined by them.
Premadasas choice of Cabinet posts for his perceived rivals tend to support this view. Athulathmudali was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Food and Co-operatives (and later, Minister of Education and Higher Education) while Dissanayake was assigned the Ministry of Plantation Industries.
Rebellion
Having handled the high-profile Ministries of Mahaveli Development and Trade and Shipping respectively in Jayewardenes Cabinet and having been overlooked for the Premiership, both Dissanayake and Athulathmudali were livid. It was a rebellion waiting to happen. It was only a matter of time before they pooled their resources to try and oust Premadasa.
That came in the form of the Motion of Impeachment, the first and only one, so far- of its kind in Sri Lanka, in August 1991. The motion accused Premadasa of treason, violating the Constitution but also included nebulous insults- such as claiming that Premadasa ordered the construction of a gold-painted replica of the throne used by ancient Sri Lankan kings for official functions, that he falsified his personal history by establishing a museum with fake personal effects and that he claimed credit for ghost-written books to portray himself to be an author, poet and an intellectual.
At the outset, it was clear that the entire parliamentary group of the SLFP had signed the motion. There was a guessing game on as to who, if any, from the UNP had signed the motion. Premadasa first learned of the crisis when Speaker M. H. Mohamed informed him that an impeachment motion against the President had been received.
The very next day, Premadasa summoned all 125 MPs of the UNP parliamentary group. Premadasa shook the hand of each MP individually and asked them whether they had signed the motion. All of them said no. Obviously, that included many who had signed the motion. Later, in an attempt to portray that he still commanded the support of the UNP parliamentary group, Premadasa posed for a photograph with them on the steps of Parliament.
Nevertheless, the issue was snowballing into a crisis. To stall this momentum, Premadasa then took the next option available to him: he prorogued Parliament. The Constitution specified that once an impeachment motion is received, the President cannot dissolve Parliament. Unable to dissolve Parliament, Premadasa used his right to prorogue Parliament, re-summoning Parliament on September 24, 1991.
In that period between late August and September 24, speculation reached a feverish pitch. The rumour mill went into overdrive. The public were regaled with fantasy-like tales of Premadasa resorting to witchcraft to defeat the motion when it was scheduled to be debated in Parliament.
Since Parliament had been prorogued, Premadasa was required to address the ceremonial sitting when it reconvened. He was advised by parliamentary officials that he could be heckled by SLFP MPs who were making the most of the discord in the UNP. However, Premadasa was determined to have his say and be heard.
Apart from the fact that an impeachment motion is sought to be brought against me, no misconduct on my part has been established. It is the practice in our country that a person is considered innocent until he is found guilty of any offence. We all know that no person is considered guilty of any offence merely because a charge has been levelled against him. It is therefore necessary that the accused has to be considered innocent till he is proved guilty. You all know that I have not been found guilty of any offence. Premadasa was to tell Parliament that day.
New political party
The heckling came but Premadasa was up to the challenge, not yielding to the invective that came his way but delivering his speech in full, raising his voice from time to time to rise above the din. The session concluded as he left the chamber after his speech.
The next day, on September 25, 1991, the Speaker M. H. Mohamed made a statement at the commencement of proceedings. I wish to inform the House that I have been given notice of a resolution under Article 38(2) of the Constitution. Having satisfied myself that the resolution is in order I decided to entertain it. Subsequently written and oral representations have been made to me questioning the validity of the signatures on the resolution. I am looking into this matter at present. My decision will be conveyed to the House soon, Mohamed said.
That was also the same day that Athulathmudali made a personal statement and resigned from the Cabinet. Shortly afterwards, Athulathmudali, Dissanayake and a host of others- G. M. Premachandra and Samaraweera Weerawanni among them- were expelled from the UNP. They went on to form the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), a new political party with the eagle as its symbol.
Speaker Mohameds statement to Parliament only added to the speculation. There were suggestions that Mohamed was being influenced and prevailed upon to reject the motion. There were many behind the scenes moves made by the Premadasa camp to canvass support from parliamentarians who were thought to have signed the motion.
Athulathmudali and Dissanayake meanwhile were challenging their expulsion from the UNP in court. The Supreme Court noted that Athulathmudali had not been totally truthful when, asked by Premadasa at a Cabinet meeting whether there were any signatories to the impeachment motion, he did not identify himself. Their expulsions were upheld.
The end of the impeachment saga was somewhat of an anti-climax. It came in the form of another announcement from Speaker M. H. Mohamed to Parliament, on October 8, 1991. Further to the announcement made by me to the House on Sept. 25, 1991, regarding the notice of a resolution under Article 38(2) of the Constitution, I wish to inform the House that having inquired into the matter, I am now of the view that the resolution does not have the required number of valid signatures, and therefore it cannot be proceeded with, Mohamed said, shedding very little light on the exact basis for his decision.
Since the Constitution required 150 MPs to endorse an impeachment motion for it to be entertained and since Speaker Mohamed at first announced that he was entertaining the motion, it can only be assumed that the motion submitted to him did have 150 signatures. However, he did say that the veracity of some of the signatures had been called into question.
Mohameds subsequent statement in October suggests that he came to the conclusion that some of those signatures were not genuine and that only some of those signatures were considered valid. It was on that technicality that the attempted impeachment of President Premadasa came to an abrupt end.
Premadasa never made amends with Athulathmudali and Dissanayake again. Ironically, he was assassinated eight days after Athulathmudali was gunned down at an election rally on April 23, 1993. In Premadasas last public speech, he defended himself against accusations that he was responsible for Athulathmudalis death. Assassinate me if you wish but dont assassinate my character, he was to say in words that turned out to be tragically prophetic.
Dissanayake did return to the UNP after Premadasas death but he too perished eighteen months later, while campaigning for the Presidency, running against Chandrika Kumaratunga. Ironically, Athulathmudalis widow Srimani was to later support Kumaratunga and join her Cabinet as a minister.
They key players in the impeachment saga- Premadasa, Athulathmudali, Dissanayake and Mohamed are all no more now, Mohamed having passed away two years ago, in April 2016. The impeachment crisis however did fracture the once solid political monolith that the UNP was in its heyday and there are those who argue that it has not quite recovered fully from that debacle- even to this day.

Religions are to guide, not to fight!
Religion is defined as the set of beliefs, feelings, dogmas and practices that define the relations between human being and sacred or divinity. Though there are atheists, mostly, each and everyone has some faith in his or her own religion. At the same time, one should respect each others religion. However, above all religious rites and practices, love is God.
Be that as it may, whatever calamities take place in turn in our country, some miscreants are still there to create the ethnic and religious conflicts, when looking back the history or past incidents. Obviously, some bad eggs, politically strengthened mob, mislead the younger generation by poisoning their delicate minds for their own benefits. They fail to realize that they are pouring kerosene on ablaze. As a result, younger generation ruins their lives by engaging themselves, obliviously, in violence, brawl and picketing for their demands for various reasons.
For instance, at Vavuniya Campus, a group of students created an unrest situation by placing an idol case to seat a Buddha statue at the Campus premises without the prior approval of the Campus Authority. So far, no land has been given to any religious construction though the premises are allowed for all the religious activities of the students from all the religions for the last two decades.
The land for the activities of all the religions has been allocated in the Master Plan of the Campus, waiting for the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education. Then only the lands can be utilized by the students of respective religious faith. Instead of waiting for the approval, they violated the law and order of the Campus. As a result, the students created the disharmonies by misbehaving and bullying the authority using unparliamentary language. This resulted in closing the Campus indefinitely to bring the situation under control, with the intervention of the police. Unfortunately, nearly after a two-month time of the non-academic strike, the educational activities started smoothly just two days back.
Most importantly, Buddha teaches about love and harmony, in contradiction, sadly, every time somewhere in the country, the extremists create a tragedy using the Buddha statue to disturb the peace of the country. This unpleasant situation is not a good sign, after bitterly experiencing a three-decade of war losing a large number of lives and limbs. Frankly speaking, Tamils are not at all enemies of Sinhalese or rejecting the Buddhas statues or his principles. After all, the Hindus believe that Buddha is incarnate of Lord Krishna. We, Tamils, spiritually admire his philosophy of love, and we care for our Buddhist brothers and sisters, no doubt. Recently, the whole country shivered because of the Kandy incident. University students are here for learning and they should not be used, at any cost, as means by the political parties to disrupt the tranquillity of the country. In universities, there should not be any interference of religious or ethnic politics at any level to destroy the students future.
Religions were formed to maintain the harmony among the people and not to bring clashes among them for many reasons. The Buddha should be a symbol of love and sheer harmony and no one should turn it a symbol of bloodshed and disharmony. All responsible citizens have the bounden duty to protect our nation from politicizing the religious issues.

Remembering Ranasinghe Premadasa: The legend and the legacy lives on
Ranasinghe Premadasa was one of the most inscrutable and dynamic statesmen of our time whose services to the nation and the people surpasses that of any leader to date. He was a remarkable personality, a man of strong character who was hounded by his peers for his humble origins from both within his party and the opposition.
Beginning his political career two years after independence in 1948, Ranasinghe Premadasa became a Labour Party member of the Colombo Municipal Council and later, deputy Mayor. He joined the United National Party (UNP) in 1956 and impressed party leaders with his no-nonsense ability to get things done with smooth efficiency. Four years later he won a seat in Parliament and was named a minister when his party formed the next Government. He was appointed a Cabinet Minister when the UNP held power in the late 60s. He subsequently became the chief opposition whip after the re-election of Sirimavo Bandaranaike as Prime Minister in 1970.
Premadasa was appointed Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction when Junius Richard Jayewardene won the 1977 general election and the following year took on the added responsibility of Prime Minister when Jayewardene created a bastardized presidential form of government. It was Premadasa's continuing position as housing minister that largely fortified his political support. He made a determined effort to provide universal housing and was astute enough to be sure that his photograph was given equal prominence to that of the President in all of the subsequent publicity.
As Prime Minister, starting in 1978 and after becoming President in 1989, Premadasa worked tirelessly to alleviate poverty in Sri Lanka. Among his pet projects was the building of model villages with clean water, decent roads, schools and health centres. He also encouraged the establishment of small-scale industries, mostly garment-related, in neglected backwoods locales by providing factory owners low-interest loans and a share in textile quotas for the United States and Europe.
Potential challengers
His opponents charged that coupled with this seeming concern for the impoverished masses was a political ruthlessness that saw potential challengers expunged from his party. His devotees insisted that his iron-fisted stance was a necessary element for his own survival and that of the nation. They contend it also served him admirably when quelling an armed insurrection by Sinhala militants in the south and in his endeavours to strike a political deal with the Tamil Tiger terrorists.
For several years many considered Premadasa as Jayewardenes heir apparent, despite his humble non-patrician roots. The UNPs J. R. Jayewardene and the SLFPs Sirimavo Bandaranaike both belonged to the same Anglicised elite in Colombo, as did many of the leading ministers in both these major political parties. Highly popular, capable and hardworking, Premadasa displayed a common touch that Jayewardene and most of the partys elite upper-class lacked and had proved himself a major vote-getter for the party. Unsurprisingly, many of the partys aristocratic political heavyweights were chagrined that Jayewardene held Premadasas political skills in high regard. It was obvious that Jayewardene depended on his Prime Minister to a great extent and worked closely with him.
The attitude of many largely princely Sinhalese UNP leaders towards Premadasa was condescending and distant. Yet they had to admit that he was a vital political weapon for the UNP against their socialist opponents, because he had been so successful in building his own massive political power-base. As such, it was impossible to prevent him from eventually attaining the highest rungs of political power in his own right.
To be sure, he displayed unprecedented temerity to keep even his ruling party and Cabinet colleagues in line. Cracking the whip he made every endeavour to establish total control over the entire shebang. Soon after being installed as Executive President he prohibited Cabinet ministers their earlier concession of choosing their own senior civil servants for their ministries. He even went to the extent of sidelining politicians in favour of trusted senior civil servants in the decision-making process. Even his fiercest detractors at the time had to admit that he was head and shoulders above his former Cabinet colleagues as a workaholic and perceptive leader. During his tenure as President not once did he leave the country for whatsoever purpose. The same rule was applied to his ministers who were forbidden gallivanting on foreign junkets. They were kept firmly grounded and on a tight leash, a constraint at which they chafed and fumed and which eventually prompted some of them to conspire to impeach him.
Economic reforms
As president, Premadasas first task was to put down the revolt among the Sinhalese majority by the Janata Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), whose terrorism nearly brought Sri Lanka to a standstill in 1989. He then took over the market-based economic reforms initiated by his predecessor Jayewardene, but at the same time conspicuously redirected state resources towards the rural poor instead of the Colombo population. After his demise Sri Lanka faced a period of drift in policymaking. On the economic side, Premadasa carried out sweeping reforms, privatising much of the flabby, failing public sector, cutting back a huge budget deficit and lining up private investment. At the same time, he balanced this with a populist programme of social engineering to alleviate rural poverty.
International lenders and aid donors claimed that more was needed to be done in cutting back the state sector and bringing inflation under control. Yet a weaker, less politically adept leader would never have been be able to sell such measures to the country as Premadasa did, especially with colleagues clamouring for election-winning handouts.
Premadasa was also a gifted orator who possessed the facility to speak at length in all three languages.
Without a doubt, some of his speeches were fiery and could be abrasive when the situation warranted. Of course, he had more than his share of detractors such as Ronnie de Mel, a former Finance Minister in his Cabinet who defected to Sirimavo Bandaranaike's party. Minister De Mel derogatorily called him 'a Tammany Hall politician.' Tammany Hall was a New York City political organisation that endured for nearly two centuries. Although its popularity stemmed from a willingness to help the city's poor and immigrant populations, Tammany Hall became known for charges of corruption levelled against its leaders.
At a Colombo May Day rally Premadasa boldly endeared himself to the concourse saying: I am the servant of the people. They are my masters. It is the people of this country who could tell me what to do. No one else. Coming from any other political leader in Sri Lanka, that statement would have been written off as pure political rhetoric. But in the short period he had been in power, Premadasa had rapidly acquired a reputation for being tough, independent and very much his own man.
Even his fiercest critics had to concede that the man was an absolute stickler for discipline who would not stomach tardiness in any form.
Emblem of sheer resilience
His long-time Media Secretary the late Evans Cooray had this to say of him in this regard: He was never one minute late for an appointment, nor a minute early. Sharp at 7 am he called all of us to his room upstairs adjacent to his bedroom. His instructions to us were short and precise, giving the impression of a military field commander who knew what he was about and as always, though cordial, his voice rang with authority and power, commanding compliance.
Decades later, the countrys present President Maithripala Sirisena, an opposition member of parliament during Premadasas tenure as Head of State, paid him the highest tribute at a commemoration of the late President on May 1, 2015 with these words: The political character of President Ranasinghe Premadasa is an example to the present politicos.
Ranasinghe Premadasa ran the gauntlet of seemingly insurmountable odds because his ascension to the top was without the patronage of powerful genealogical connections. Yet, his imperious spirit and indomitable will spurred him on to storm the local political area, progressively hold key ministerial portfolios and eventually succeed in being elected to the highest office in the land. To his disparagers he was an upstart, ambitiously battling his way among entrenched elitist political forces. To his adherents he was an emblem of sheer resilience whose nobility of character far exceeded the appeal of his upper-crust peers.
A pity we will never see his like again!

Rich in poor mans thoughts
Ranasinghe Premadasa was the first Sri Lankan leader to emerge from the working class, with all his predecessors having represented the aristocratic class. This put him in a unique position vis--vis the common people, whose problems he could immediately identify. He did not need the advice of ministers and officials to understand the problems faced by the common masses. He did not want to rule from an air-conditioned room in Colombo and was very much a hands-on Prime Minister and President.
Once he became Prime Minister in 1978, Premadasa lost no time in seeking solutions to two of the biggest problems that existed in the country back then: abject poverty and the dearth of housing. Two of the most endearing  and enduring  programmes of the 1977 UNP Government came out as his plans for these sectors  the poverty eradication programme, later to be called Janasaviya (Strength of the Masses) and the Village Re-Awakening Programme, which later became known as Gam Udawa. The Village Reawakening Programme was launched in the 1980s with the principle that shelter is fundamental to people's physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. His aim was to build one million houses eventually.
The very first Udaa Gama or Re-wakened Village was opened in Badalgama, which was a poor village in Yapahuwa electorate, Kurunegala district. Each village was given an appropriate name that evoked something special about the area, such as Isuru Gama for Village of Prosperity. He personally went to each opening ceremony, apart from the occasions when he was abroad on official business or indisposed.
Champion of the poor
President Premadasa always reached out to uplift the living conditions of the poor
President Premadasa rightly earned a reputation as a champion of the poor due to his commitment to the Gam Udawa programme. Gam Udawa will forever be associated with the name of President Premadasa and indeed, his son Sajith is passionately carrying forward the Gam Udawa programme under the Governments Vision 2025 concept after a re-launch in 2016. Thus the first Gam Udawa village to be opened in 22 years was vested with the people in Weli Oya in that year.
The Gam Udawa concept was rather simple. Officials identified the poorest families in a given village who had no housing facilities. A proper land area was identified and developed. Then the Government, through the Housing Ministry, stepped in to build 25-50 housing units with all facilities for these families at the given location. The construction phase itself was a collective effort of the whole village. While the Government supplied the funds and earthmoving/construction machinery, the villagers themselves had to get together to build each house using their time and labour. This brought the entire village together, enhancing their bonds of friendship. This is how the Gam Udawa concept works to this day.
Gama Hada Rata Hadamu
Seen in this light, the very meaning of Gam Udawa becomes clear  it is not only about housing, but also about developing the whole village through a purely voluntary effort. He also popularized another slogan  Gama Hada Rata Hadamu (Lets Build the Village to Build the Nation), which highlighted the place of the village in the overall development effort. A Gam Udawa exhibition was held in each district once a year to showcase the Governments housing and other development programmes.
Gam Udawa gained international recognition rapidly and several other countries emulated the programme with success. In fact, the United Nations recognizes President Premadasa as one of the Asian pioneers of the Shelter for All programmes. It was President Premadasa who proposed at the United Nations, to declare an International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. The proposal was unanimously accepted at the 37th session of the United Nations General Assembly and the year 1987 was declared as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. The Gam Udawa concept was recognized globally by the United Nations for its outstanding contribution to human progress.
Gam Udawa became immensely popular as it addressed one of the most basic requirements of the people. The shelter has been recognised as basic human right globally and Gam Udawa was a movement that sought to address the housing shortage. President Premadasa was keen to see all slum dwellers in Colombo resettled in their own houses, in single houses or multi-storeyed flats. While this has still not happened completely, he laid the foundation for better housing conditions for the slum dwellers.
Massive development programmes
Innovative development efforts: Garment factories were set up to improve the quality of life of the poor
Housing was just a part of his multi-pronged strategy for development. He was deeply affected by the popular slogan Kolambata Kiri Apita Kekiri (Milk for Colombo, Pumpkin for outstations) that arose from the embers of the 1988-89 insurrection and sought to address other inequalities that created a huge gulf between the city and the village. He was instrumental in launching many other welfare measures such as free school uniforms. He knew that the path to development and poverty alleviation lay through education for all children. He also laid the groundwork for a massive water supply, infrastructure and urban development programme that covered the entire island.
The one other thing that brought him closer to the people was his oratorical skill. Gam Udawa took him to all four corners of the island (except perhaps the North which was cut off due to the conflict after 1983) where he invariably addressed Jana Hamuwas (public meetings) after each event. He had the unique ability to speak directly to the hearts and minds of residents of any given area, identifying their wants and strengths. He would sometimes speak for over an hour but every word had a purpose. Having covered many of his meetings for the Daily News, I recall that there was something new to write every day.
Conversant in Tamil
He was keen to address the Tamil speaking communities in that language and learned Tamil, but used an interpreter to make it more engaging to the audience. Once, his interpreter made a mistake, but before any of the Tamil-speaking Ministers present on stage could point it out, he told the interpreter that his translation was wrong and asked him to give the correct meaning.
On another occasion, another speaker was taking a bit too long. Someone came up to the stage and gave him a chit, which obviously was to ask him to cut the speech short. When his turn to speak came, President Premadasa recalled that he too faced a similar experience in his ministerial days when someone gave him a chit that simply said: stop the speech now. Knowing very well that everyone in the audience practically knew what the chit was about, he has simply said: I just got a chit that tells me to speak longer and make it even more interesting. But unfortunately, I have to go to another meeting and I will stop my speech now. That showed his ability to adapt to any situation, but even more importantly, his sense of humour. He always peppered his speeches with a joke or anecdote that sent ripples of laughter among the audience. His speeches were thus never boring or uninteresting.
He felt right at home in both palatial mansions of the rich city folk and daub and wattle huts of poor villagers. It is in the latter that he felt the pulse of the common people and listened to their grievances. He made it a habit to speak to the villagers and accept their letters wherever he went however trivial their requests were. He freely mingled with the crowds wherever he went despite the advice of his security detail  which would ultimately cost his life on May 1, 1993.
An avid reader of newspapers, he took note of news items on various shortcomings in villages (dilapidated roads, lack of community halls, lack of school facilities etc) and urged officials to take immediate remedial action. This earned him a reputation as an action-oriented leader and many ministers and officials learned to be ready with answers well before the Presidential call came early in the morning.
That was the hallmark of President Premadasa. He wanted concrete action, not idle talk. Naturally, this kept ministers and officials on their toes and ensured that the whole country could enjoy the dividends of accelerated development. He did not believe in Colombo-centric development and urged his ministers and MPs to go to their villages and identify projects/ideas worth funding. His life was tragically cut short before some of the goals he envisaged (such as one million houses) could be realised, but 25 years from his assassination, his legacy still lives on in the hearts and minds of Sri Lankans everywhere.

Risen from the rank
As a young man interested in politics, there were people I looked up to. There were people I believed had unique qualities. Ranasinghe Premadasa was not one of them.
Indeed, my opinions about his policies and style of governance were a permanent source of friction between myself and his Press Secretary of thirty years, my uncle Evans Cooray. Much to the chagrin of Evans, I was openly critical of President Premadasa while he was in office, unable to resist the urge to contrast his brash and populist leadership style with the more learned and erudite ways of his political rival Lalith Athulathmudali.
In his frustration, Evans cautioned me with words that today are no less true than the inevitability of sunrise at dawn: Some-day, when there are no more leaders like him, you will appreciate the leadership qualities and commitment of a man like President Premadasa. Today, you are so young and inexperienced that you take them for granted, he snapped. I was confident that time will prove Uncle Evans wrong.
Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed exactly 25 years ago, on May Day. He is the only elected Executive President to be assassinated. Some would no doubt say that he himself was to blame for one of his glaring errors of judgment was giving arms to the LTTE. The LTTE was not his only enemy. He holds the dubious distinction of being the only President in our history to have confronted a motion of impeachment by Parliament, one which he survived only through the most unprecedented and fortuitous political and constitutional manoeuvring. One notes also, that among these firsts there is the fact that he is the last President elected from the United National Party, D. B. Wijetungas ascension being procedural consequent to Premadasa being assassinated.
Today, as I reflect on Ranasinghe Premadasa twenty-five years after he was killed, the words of Evans Cooray haunt me. They haunt me because I know of leaders and leadership, and I know what is lacking. When I reflect on such things, I remember Premadasa.
Premadasa was alone among elected presidents or leaders of the United National Party, unlike anyone else, had to struggle for everything he ever accomplished. He did not hail from a political family, nor did he have the benefit of a first-class education. In his era, many held against him what was then known as his caste, a snooty reference to his humble roots. As with so many others around the world, it was in these flames of adversity and discrimination that the tenacity, determination and leadership style of President Premadasa was forged.
He saw the promise of the garment industry and made it a national priority for growth, taking radical measures to ensure that a fair share of the spoils of this thriving export industry made it to the villagers and workers whose skill and sweat allowed that industry to thrive. President Premadasa was the architect of the revitalized Samurdhi programme, which is still the backbone of our national poverty alleviation effort.
While many can better expound on his accomplishments than I, my intimate relationship with perhaps one of his closest confidants Evans Cooray has left me with a unique appreciation for how Premadasa accomplished so much in so short a time.
He had an eye for talent, surrounding himself with none but the finest administrators and public servants of his era. He identified and brought into his circle rising stars such as R. Paskaralingam, Bradman Weerakoon, K H J Wijeyadasa, Evans Cooray and Susil Siriwardena. These were dedicated, hard-working and disciplined government servants, who appeared to outsiders to exist for no other reason but to serve the institution of Premadasa around the clock. These are not qualities that they brought to Premadasa, but ones that they shared with him.
Ranasinghe Premadasa believed in discipline and hard work above all else. Rarely did he wake after 3.30am. Whatever he lacked in intellectual capacity and finesse, he sought to make up for with sweat. He knew that discipline involves sacrifice, and eschewed the luxuries and trappings of the presidency to spend his time building a legacy and achieving results. Whenever he was faced with adversity or disapproval, his solution was simply to work harder.
His loyalty to those around him was unparalleled but conditioned on performance, best exemplified by his daily morning phone calls to his closest advisors, which more often than not, were made between three thirty and four thirty in the morning. Every day, he expected progress on his directives from the previous day, and he spared no quarter for his ministers or advisors who failed to perform.
It was this ruthless pragmatism that won him the support of many doers in the country. People who could perform and deliver results were drawn to Premadasa, who found room for them in his ranks. Being known as a villager himself, surrounded by the trappings of Colombo, Premadasa prioritized poverty alleviation above almost all else. Under his direction, several amenities that were taken for granted in the capital were brought to villages across the country  from clean water to pothole-free roads, schools and medical facilities.
As a leader, he held his people accountable for not just results but also for their conduct. Under no circumstances would he have sanctioned a government where nearly every supporting Member of Parliament was appointed to the cabinet or given a State or Deputy Ministerial portfolio. He kept an intimate cabinet and expected the rest of his MPs to focus on delivering in their electorates, ensuring that they had access to the funds and resources to do so.
It is almost amusing to imagine how President Premadasa would have reacted to discovering that a number of his ministers and officials were gallivanting across the world with public funds at the drop of a hat, or spending our tax rupees on expensive furniture and adornments for their ministries and official residences. It is less amusing to recall that during his time, no public servant would have dreamt of participating in such abuses, which have become all too commonplace today.
Never satisfied with any particular accomplishment, Premadasa believed that a government, political party or individual had to keep growing in order to succeed. Not comfortable resting on his accolades, and despite lacking the formal educational background of most of his predecessors, he constantly struggled to adapt and surmount newer and greater political challenges.
Premadasa was a man who has struggled a lot in his life so he was objective and practical. He had extraordinary determination. He believed that if you can see it in your mind you can hold it in your hand. He never ever gave up. He was a tough man to work for but he would stand by his team members in a way no other leader would; thus did he secure their loyalty.
He could sway people with his oratory. He was a disciplinarian and was effective because he himself was disciplined. No president and no leader since or after him have followed up on matters the way he did. This is how, in just four years at the helm of the country and the UNP, Ranasinghe Premadasa became seen by many of the countrys rural citizenry as a demi-god, the man who single-handedly lifted millions of Sri Lankans out of poverty and brought them dignity and hope.
Ranasinghe Premadasa had extraordinary energy, determination and skill. Indeed, in the words of Evans Cooray Premadasa himself was not a man, but an institution.
Many years ago I did not have much regard for Ranasinghe Premadasa. Today, when I reflect on May Day 1993 and what followed, I remember what Evans Cooray told me. If I made my uncle, turn in his grave over my opinions of Ranasinghe Premadasa, I am convinced he will now rest in peace. He will rest in peace because today I am able to say with full conviction that he was right.

Sarfraz Ahmed dismisses Underdogs tag for Pakistan
Ever since Pakistan managed to defeat India in the Champions Trophy final under the inspiring leadership of Sarfraz Ahmed, their status in the limited overs format has changed drastically.
With the resurgence of players like Mohammad Amir and also some good young talents like Shadab Khan, Fakhar Zaman, they certainly are a strong unit to cope with.
Pakistan, as per the recent schedule released by ICC, will play their opening game of the campaign against the wounded Windies. Theyll combat arch-rivals India at the iconic Old Trafford, Manchester on June 16th.
Speaking to the press, the 30-year-old suggested their team is trying to iron out the few deficiencies in the remaining one year.
The World Cup is important for all teams. Our first match is against the West Indies. The first match is always important, so all our preparations are geared towards that match and the tournament. We are trying to iron out our deficiencies during this period, Sarfraz said as quoted by The Express Tribune. Talking about their under-dogs status going into every World Cup, Sarfraz reckons people will remember that they won the Champions Trophy. Pakistan always go into tournaments as underdogs but I dont think it will be the same this time because people remember that we have won the Champions Trophy, he said.
Talking about the importance of World Cup, Sarfraz said that big players are born during such huge tournaments. Pakistan previously won the World Cup in 1992 under the leadership of the legendary Imran Khan.
Later on, they managed to reach the finals once in 1999 and they lost to India in the semifinals in the 2011 edition. He also said that importance of certain players is realized during this tournament.
The World Cup is one event in which the world is watching you and everyone is following you. The importance of players is realized during this crunch time. The World Cup gives birth to heroes and superstars, he said.

THILINA KANDAMBY
The stocky left handed Thilina Kandamby was in the reckoning for a regular place in all three formats of Sri Lanka cricket not so long ago. Unfortunately two factors blocked his path to glory. Once was, the time when the naturally gifted Mahela Jayawardene and the workman like Thilan Samaraweera stalwarts of Sri Lanka cricket then and established pillars in the middle order and as a result space to get in was restricted to an extent, according to Thilina the selectors at the time were also instrumental in side stepping him!This was unfortunate since Thilina was ready made to step into Arjuna Ranatungas shoes as a solid middle order left hander.
Be that as it may, Thilina had clocked 39 ODIS and scored 5 fifties with a top score of 93 n.o against India at The Kettarama Stadium.He had the honour of captaining a solitary T20 for Sri Lanka against England.He also stressed the fact that he has been a reserve in the Lankan Test team for 17 times which in itself could be record of some sorts. Thilina pointed out that he got three hundreds against the touring English, the New Zealanders and the Indians.This goes to show that either the luck or something else was not on his side.
Thilina gave up all forms of cricket only a few years back, there was no point carrying on since the financial remuneration was not adequate stated Thilina. In 2013 a club player could earn only LKR 300,000/= per season, where as a top level player could earn US$ 5000 per match for Tests and US $ 3000 per match, this is an indication of the yawning gap in earnings between a club player and the true blue professional Test cricketer. There are of course the added fringe benefits in sponsorship packages.
Chandika Hathurusinghe helped Thilina to join Sampath Bank and Thilina pointed out some interesting facts about the Man of the Moment and he was none other than Chandika Hathurusinghe. In his own words Thilina said that Hathurusinghe was a one to one man in the sense he preferred to talk to the players without the other players or staff in attendance, Thilina was all for this approach since the player could open out more. But if he was rubbed the wrong way he was quite capable of coming out with choice language, even a late stalwart well known for his sarong jhonie taunts would blush like a teenage schoolgirl. Hathuru however was a strong silent character without any false airs about him. Thilina stated that he would even look into the personal problems of not so well to do players and helped them with cash and kind.
Thilina also noted that famous ex cricketers or legends as they say are by and large not good in the coaching stakes since they have an ego issue and they expect  to demand respect than to command respect. I was taken back when Thilina was of the view that Anjelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga ( in my opinion both thorough breads in their day who should be left to stud by now) both have two good years left in them, he went still further and noted that in the recent IPLs 4 out of 5 matches were lost due to the heavy scoring on the 20th over and if Lasith Malinga was there he would have easily plugged the run flow in those final overs. Now since the T20 is gaining a lot of ground with the ICC and they are trying to make this cricket carnival go round the world(Americanization of cricket) which to me the author is a farce.
Back on track Thilina Kandamby thought that having Lasith Malinga back in the fold would definitely be a plus for the Lankans in their future endeavors in T20S.
I found Thilina Kandamy to be well versed not only in cricket but in other cricket related affairs as well. He pointed out that Sooriyawewa Stadium in Hambantota was built at a colossal cost however, not a single div 1 school team or a single div 1 team was to be found and in comparison at Gampaha with many schools engaged in cricket only a few turf wickets were to be found and that meant Gampaha has got step motherly treatment.
Royal Thomian Fever
At present Thilina is coaching the Royal Cricket team and I managed to get hold of him at Nalanda grounds at Nathaniels place(there is name change now) where I had the good fortune of Flogging(this term was used by Late Berty Wijesinha reporting to the Evening Observer in 1964) the strong Bens, just to refresh the readers- I came when our strong top oder including A.G.Perera, Duminda Siriwardene, the former was by and large the best opener in schools and the latter a brilliant all rounder the best in the business again in schools at the time and late luxman de Silva were back in the hatch, so I walked in the score board read 4 down for less than 10 if my memory serves me right.From the word go I started lashing them and there was this left arm fast bowler called Withanachchi who time and again fed me with medium pace left arm in swingers which was cannon fodder for me since I was a srong onside player favouring the on drive and executed the pull shot to good effect when their tired shoulders flagged and bowled short, it was my day I suppose and ended up un beaten on 122 no. Poor Sunil Fernando who was the wicket keeper was also floundering behind stumps.
Fast forward and Thilina noted that the Royal old boys were only interested in their team nearing the Royal Thomian and thereafter their enthusiasm just fizzled out.This goes to show that they were interested only in the tamasha of the Royal Thomian be that as it may but the Tamashas going around will one day ruin this country, why not infuse cash and kind to the village schools and the North and East

Tribute to Dr Lester James Peries: Long-lived revival
As the curtain falls in years and decades, the living episodes become history. And history evolves too. The Ceylonese Independence will gradually become a distant history in three decades when it reaches the centennial milepost.
Dr Lester James Peries epitomises that distant history. In a few years  or maybe decades  he might become an obscure historical figure confined to the chronicles of cinema. The Sri Lankan cinema has gone far ahead and would be even farthest ahead in the next century. The cinema chronicles of this country will be updated with many episodes rewritten and revised. Yet the Lester James Peries episode will remain as a bulwark. For he is among the pioneers who syringed originality into the local cinema tainted with the South Indian influence.
Less than one month ago, we penned a tribute to Dr Lester James Peries on April 5 on the occasion of his 99th birthday. The sight of him in public was a luxury on the birthday as his wife, Sumitra Peries, premiered her latest film Vaishnavee. The birthday cake was cut in absentia. The legend was not to move about on medical advice.
Dr Peries enjoyed the ideal lifespan in comparison to many other artistes who had to depart the life at young ages. Although the well-wishers had not made it a habit to visit him at his Dickman's Road (later named after him) residence, Dr Peries would oftentimes share his life events. Mostly personal memoirs, but brimming with insights for any creative artiste, Lester was such an inspiration. As you enter the premises, you naturally push yourself into a hibernate mode owing to the No Horn signboard erected in front of his residence.
Quality vs quantity
Media will wallow in obituaries and tributes on Dr Peries in the next few days. What has he done to deserve such admiration What makes him a cut above the rest Dr Peries filmography includes 20 feature films and five documentaries. There are his juniors who could be accredited with a larger number of films.
It is the quality, not the quantity, that matters in the assessment of the Lester James Peries legacy. It is Dr Peries unconventional approach that shot him to the legend-dom. The revolutions that took place in 1956 had a great effect on the subsequent decades. Freeing from the reins of the colonial masters, Sri Lanka began its search for its own identity. The Bandaranaike policies (the Sinhala-only for instance) entered the scene in such a backdrop.
Bandaranaike cannot be considered the high priest of that cultural renaissance. He was one of them. Chitrasena, Sunil Santha, Amaradeva, Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Lester James Peries and Martin Wickramasinghe came to the forefront to capsize the cultural capsule, while Bandaranaike continued to plough the land. He did not last long though his mission did. All masters of that revolution, but one, are long gone. And the master who was on the verge of a century just left us!
Technically speaking, Rekawa (Line of Destiny), Dr Peries first feature film, could probably be the least sophisticated film. But it was the turning point of the Ceylonese cinema industry in its long sprint to its own identity. It was the line of destiny that bordered the countrys cinema on the plain of originality from the mere imitationism.
Breaking grounds
Rekava, officially premiered in 1956 incidentally coinciding with the Bandaranaike revolution, broke the prevailing grounds. The film was shot out of the studio premises and was confined to Ceylon. The dialogues were more natural. The storyline provoked more emotional nuances. Ultimately it went on to be the first feature-length film down the local cinema annals. It gained entry into the Cannes Film Festival in 1957  an international honour denied for the films hitherto produced. Disappointments must have come his way, but he glommed on to his ideals. Yet, this was not consummation. Dr Peries was still experimenting with the subject.
The second feature film, Sandeshaya, was one step ahead, handling a more intricate plot outline: history. That was 1960. Three years later, Peries took over a new trial: a film based on a novel. Gamperaliya was a few steps ahead with Tissa Abeysekara (known for his natural dialogues, and a revered scriptwriter whose posthumous films continue to emerge), and Reggie Siriwardana entering the scene as writers to the screen. That was a more groundbreaking work with a number of performers such as Tony Ranasinghe, Henry Jayasena and Trilicia Gunawardane later earning a brand name in their own right. It received a widely acclaimed appreciation from the critics such as Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Reviewed Professor Sarachchandra: At last a Sinhalese film has been made which we could show the world without having to hide our heads in shame. I want to say a great film has been made of a great novel.
Film by film, Dr Peries planted a fresh seed in the industry. Film by film, Dr Peries introduced a new wavelength. He did not deliver art. He delivered a whole generation. That whole generation did not think outside the box. They formed a box for the industry. The likes of Gamini Fonseka, Tissa Abeysekara, Titus Totawatta and Sumitra Peries saw the light of the industry in Dr Lester James Peries cubicle. And that created the tunnel for emerging contemporary filmmakers such as Prasanna Vithanage, Ashoka Handagama and Vimukthi Jayasundara.
Dr Lester James Peries was the first filmmaker who led the Ceylonese cinema into an international platform. That acclaim made things easier for the subsequent Sri Lankan cinema. Film after film, Dr Peries offered lessons on how indigenousness could be employed in filmmaking. That was a gradual, yet steady, path. Regi Siriwardana cannot be more accurate when he defined Rekawa as an event of tremendous importance. Though it may not be a masterpiece, it ushered in the tradition Dr Peries wanted to be instilled. With Rekava, the Ceylonese audience was done with the unoriginality.
We do not miss him anymore because he has contributed more than enough to the cinema industry and his legacy is still alive. Yet we miss him for he would have made it through to that coveted century in a twelvemonth.

Walking the talk!
It was the first time that a reporter and a poetess were appointed to a government commission by the Executive. Subsequently she and I were among the seven who inquired into youth unrest and rebellion, primarily in the predominantly Sinhala south in 1988/89 and told the then Second Executive President R Premadasa that our people wanted the abolition of the executive presidency.
Monica Ruwanpathirana the Sinhalese poetess is no more. She translated that report into Sinhala. Premadasa knew that like all government commissions before us, we worked and talked in English, and he was not going to go before the nation without a Sinhala translation, like the competent translation of Monica on which the public credibility of that sensitive report depended.
R Premadasa under siege was still the practical man in every sense. He was under siege as no other head of state since Independence. The LTTE was in control of much of the north and the east. Indian troops (Indian Peace Keeping Force) were in control in many areas concurrently, and the Sri Lankan armed forces were in camps. With the BBC-led western press virtually talking the language of an emergent separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka, the JVP-led the Sinhalese youth in rebellion, saying the Indian troops were here to create another Bangladesh.
When I assisted Monica with her translation, it was pleasure to invoke the poetess in her with the words of Wordsworth Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven .Wordsworth was in France at the dawn of the French Revolution and believed that the flow of blood would eventually result in a more just social order he would live to see, I told her. All of us within the commission wanted to believe that somehow we were on the threshold of a new dawn, and that we had been entrusted to write its script.
The two heavyweights of the commission were G L Peiris and Radhika Commaraswamy, armed with doctorates in Law from Oxford and Harvard. Lakshman Jayathilake, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, an Engineering don and Chairman of the Commission was an intellectual in his own right.
When the Jayathilake Commission opened its doors for public sittings opposite Temple Trees (next to the Colombo Swimming Club), the JVP was one of the first to send its killer squad, the DJV to intimidate us. The young man who walked in unannounced flaunted his credentials and said, if anything was to happen to me while I am here or on the way out, none of you would live till tomorrow.
He preached to us that a human body consists of cells which were constantly destroying themselves, and when the JVP was removing unwanted elements from society, they were only accelerating the natural process of the destruction of cells, for the greater good of society. I watched as Jayathilake listened and spoke calmly as a monk. If it was your fathers cells that you were asked to accelerate in the processwould you.
The DJV gunman was visibly rattled, as much the rest of the members of the commission. Before he left Jayathilake told him we have been commissioned by the Executive President to seek the opinion of the general public, and we will answer the call of duty of the incumbent government. As he made his hurried exit the messaging to the JVP leader Wijeweera was clear. The Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Youth Unrest and Rebellion was on its way.
President Premadasa was a tough taskmaster. The government was communicating to LTTE leader Prabhakaran that we needed to sit in Jaffna, and that it was a genuine independent effort that he as the Executive was initiating. The commission was asked to sit in public in the north and in the south, where blood flowed freely, and the bodies of young people were burning on tyre pyres, and submit a report of its findings in three months.
In our public sittings in the south Monica Ruwanpathirana (also a poverty alleviation catalyst) and renowned educationist the late R I T Alles played a key role at sensitive moments of discourse, with the confidence they could inspire with their public reputation and experience in handling young people. In the north and the east that role was played by Commissioner Mohamed Ali, a senior executive of a state bank who was fluent speaker of Tamil.
The man who was tasked with the logistics of the operation was a senior Foreign Service officer, Lal Warnakulasooriya. He was assigned a single-handed round the clock operation due to security and other concerns, and remained the unsung hero of the commission who made it all possible.
The commission made an early breakthrough when the LTTE announced that Prabhakaran had accepted Premadasas proposal. In a sensational turn of events, the Sinhala press reported a government commission was going behind enemy lines. We were hurriedly flown to Jaffna in a military transport aircraft.
At Pallali the army put us in an Air Force chopper and flew us to an IPKF controlled area, and the IPKF drove us to the outskirts of Jaffna and handed us to the LTTE. We were driven to the Palm Garden Hotel by Tiger child soldiers, with sub machine guns and wearing cyanide capsules around their necks.
The underlined cause of youth unrest and rebellion in the north and the south had a complex, often unspoken qualitative difference. It was about Tamil nationalism or racism and about Sinhala nationalism or racism. In a corresponding plain there was a commonality in the demand for greater democratization of the political process, and radical reform to the mismatch between education and employment, which created the frustrations that could easily be made the fertile ground for recruitment for causes advocated either by the LTTE or the JVP.
My involvement in the commission, as its youngest member, probably had its roots in my Peradeniya days in the early eighties. As the Secretary of the Arts Faculty Student Union in those turbulent days when an undergraduate was shot dead by the police on campus, most of us in student politics failed to realize that we were seeing the early stages of a second Sinhala uprising in the making.
The JVP activism which some of us opposed had yet to have the control of the Universities. In the early eighties when Prime Minister R Premadasa drove through Peradeniya, my generation of undergraduates jeered at him.
JVP activists did not take kindly to the village re-awakening (Gam Udawa) programme aimed at building a million houses for the poor, as it would seriously damage their vote base.
Premadasa had wanted one of the rebels to sit on the commission, and he had been looking for a Peradeniya graduate, after the Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University was chosen as its Chairman.
I got to know President Premadasa as a Daily Mirror reporter covering his village re-awakening across the land. When I was asked to serve on the commission, he was aware that it was my generation at Peradeniya that was leading a Sinhala rebellion for a second time since April 1971. Many of the student activists I had known and ideologically opposed at Peradeniya in student politics, perished in the 1988/89 uprising and I met many others behind bars in rehabilitation camps.
The commission laid emphasis on recommendations made to it by experts on the cause and effect of education and employment, as it was the practical way forward. The Chairman of the Commission later became the first head of the National Education Commission and pursued the implementation of these recommendations of the commission from 1991 to 2001.
As much as the national question or nationalism or racism remained beyond the mandate of the commission, its key recommendation was of a political nature calling for greater democratization primarily aimed at the transfer of power from the executive to independent commissions.
The commission summoned and sought the expertise of those who could address this vital political position, and decided it will recommend to the Executive that there was a public demand for the democratisation of the powers of the Executive, as the concentration of such powers in the Executive and the abuse it had led to, was perceived widely as a root cause that perpetuates youth unrest and rebellion.
The only living individual we did not summon before the commission, but thought it fit to visit and explain our stance was the former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. We visited her at her residence at Rosemead Place and briefed her that we would be advocating the dismantling of the executive presidency, as was the aspiration of the greater general public.
Neither Premadasa nor Bandaranaike as a former head of state opposed this key political recommendation of the commission of 1990. As a fundamental transfer of power from the executive to the people, the commission sought the setting up of a constitutional council which in turn would set up independent commissions in a greater process of democratization.
This was to lead to the 17th Amendment under the Chandrika Kumaratuga government in 2001, its reversal under the 18th Amendment during the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in 2014, and finally to the reversal of the 18th Amendment by the 19th Amendment under Sirisena-Wickramasinghe government in 2015.
On February 14, 1990, President Premadasa announced the acceptance of the commissions 51 proposals to end youth unrest in Sri Lanka. The report said in the past two years, violence from extremist youth groups bent on overthrowing the government and retaliation from government security forces and unofficial vigilante groups have devastated the country.
It said, political power had been abused in the recruitment of personnel for public services, in the granting of public contracts and licenses to supporters of the ruling party and in the undermining of existing democratic institutions, and cited political interference in the day-to-day administration of government institutions.
President Premadasa was assassinated by the LTTE on May 1, 1993.
In 2001 the Chandrika Kumaratungas UPFA government which enacted the 17th Amendment to the constitution made provision for the setting up of independent commissions incorporating the key recommendation of the commission. G L Peiris as Foreign Minister, who along with President Chandrika Kumaratunga survived an assassination attempt at the hands of the LTTE, during their time in office of the same UPFA government, never fully implemented the key recommendation of the commission.
Subsequently the Mahinda Rajapaksa government actively dismantled the provisions of the 17th Amendment with the passage of the controversial 18th amendment in 2014. It was then left to the SLFP-UNP unity government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickramasinghe to reverse the 18th Amendment with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 2015, and re-establish the independent commissions in the most meaningful manner to date, stemming from the Youth Commission recommendations.
The amendment was a result of promise made by President Maithripala Sirisena leading up to the 2015 Presidential Election. The main prospect of the amendment was to repealing the 18th Amendment which gave the President extreme powers and to reinforce democracy in the country. It establishes a Constitutional Council which will exercise some executive powers previously held by the President. The 19th Amendment restores many components of the 17th Amendment letting the Constitutional Council to set up the proposed Independent Commissions:
1. The Election Commission.
2. The Public Service Commission.
3. The National Police Commission.
4. The Audit Service Commission.
5. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.
6. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
7. The Finance Commission.
8. The Delimitation Commission.
9. The National Procurement Commission.
10. The University Grants Commission.
Radhika Commaraswamy as a member of the Constitutional Council which is instrumental in appointments to the independent commissions still survives within the process of greater democratisation created by the Youth Commission in 1990.
Ironically, now in 2018 the JVP is to bring in a 20th Amendment to the Constitution as a private members motion, to abolish the Executive Presidency.
My reporting for the Daily News in the aftermath of the Youth Commission, on issues raised by the commission report was interpreted by interested parties within sections of the government as pro-JVP. Following the murder of Richard de Zoysa, a one time fellow reporter for the Daily Mirror and state television (SLRC) allegedly linked to the JVP, my reporting on matters connected to his death led to my being sacked from the Daily News. The next day there was a front page box story, asking the general public to disregard my recent reporting, as it was the work of a subversive element.
Premadasa had been very angry about my sacking and the way I was sacked from the Daily News. By then my friends in The Island (where I was a founder staffer) wrote an editorial calling it a political sacking, and those who determined that I was a subversive element, issued me with death threats, if you do not ask your friends in The Island, to shut up.
Looking back over the last quarter century similar recommendations for reform as those contained in the Youth Commission Report have been brought to the forefront by other forums such as the LLRC (Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission) and the most recent Lal Wijenayake led Public Committee on Constitutional Reforms which transformed parliament in a constituent assembly, once more advocating greater democratisation and the abolition of the executive presidency, in preference for a Westminster style democracy.
But there are many within the house that is hell bent to prevent it, in the name of Race Religion and Caste without saying it exactly on those terms! or as Brecht said, For we went changing our country more often than our shoes.

Young graduate finds farming a lucrative career
The interviews for recruiting unemployed graduates to the government service as development officers were held between April 16 and 30. According to the Sri Lanka Freedom Graduates Association (SLFGA), the government received around 55,000 applications for these vacancies. The applications were called in August 2017. This graduate scheme is implemented by the Economic Affairs and National Policies Ministry. The government implemented graduate schemes in 1999, 2000 and 2012 as well.
In the meantime, the Joint Federation of Unemployed Graduates staged a protest on April 24 demanding that the government absorb all unemployed graduates in available vacancies in the public sector.
Agriculture as an occupation
While there is an unwavering high demand for pensionable government jobs in Sri Lanka, Sandun Abeywickreme, an ambitious young man with a university education, dreams of becoming a full-time farmer. Abeywickreme who resides in Chandrika Wewa Gowi Janapadaya in Embilipitiya, cultivates paddy, brinjal, bitter gourd and snake gourd in an area of some six acres. He hopes to begin banana cultivation in the near future as well. With substantial experience in the marketing and advertising field, Abeywickreme says that his life as a farmer is not an easy one. There are many people who are seemingly very enthusiastic about agriculture and cultivation. They love the idea of greenery, farming and a rustic life. But that ends there for many fair reasons, I would say. Only a few people actually choose this field, and we as farmers have to fight not only with harsh land and unpredictable weather, but also with unsystematic services, bureaucracy and politically driven agendas.
Abeywickreme says that he is not surprised that young people are reluctant to choose agriculture and farming as their occupation. To be frank, I am not surprised at all. I personally do not believe that there is an overall promotion of the agriculture sector in the country. Even if there is, the so-called system lacks a methodical, research-based approach. Farmers in the country have a good deal of issues. None of the governments that held office in the country introduced a proper supportive system of the farmers. But this does not mean that farmers are doomed. If they go into the business with a considerable commercial capital and proper production tools, the farmers can surely profit from cultivation.
He also pointed out that farmers struggle with management issues since they are not provided with training. Many farmers have no basic training in cultivation. Most, including me, learn through our errors. But we cannot afford that. There are government-initiated programmes directed by divisional secretaries. However, I am not sure how many of those programmes actually reach the grassroots levels. For example, the farmers here lack awareness of water management and soil management. They need to be educated in agriculture, farming and cultivation. They are the ones who deal with the practical aspect. Or else, young people who study agriculture should come into cultivation. Most of them opt for advisory or similar positions. I think we have enough people to give advice and support to farmers, if the supportive system is regularized. We need more people coming into the field level and filling the gap. Who is better than people with a sound education in agriculture Abeywickreme questioned.
Structural changes needed
Speaking about his future ambition of becoming a full-time farmer, Abeywickreme explained that the biggest issue he has is the lack of land. I have an adequate plan to expand my cultivation, but I dont have enough land of my own. In order to execute my plan in full, I need 1015 acres of land. Its not convenient to cultivate on lands owned by others. It creates various kinds of problems.
Speaking further, Abeywickreme said that there are essential structural changes needed if the agriculture sector is to attract potential young farmers.
For one thing, no one to my personal knowledge has researched on or measured the daily vegetable demand recorded by the main markets in Sri Lanka. Due to this gap, some vegetables are in abundance in the market, whereas some others are not available. It would be a great assistance to farmers if there is some sort of a research report to understand the dynamics of vegetable consumption in the country and cultivate accordingly, he said.
There is a significant price issue when it comes to vegetable cultivation as well, Abeywickreme said. If you take the price of banana for example, when banana is harvested, the farmers sell them to mediators for a very low price. But when I travel from Embilipitiya to Colombo, I buy the same bananas for a way higher price. I personally bring my harvest directly to the Manning Market. So I get a fair price. Not all the farmers have the means or understanding to do so. This is why I emphasize on the need for a proper system to facilitate farmers in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the media secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Graduates Association Piyal Darshana Guruge, responding to the Daily News, stated that drastic changes are needed to the education system prevailing in the country, to create dynamic graduates with updated knowledge and skills. Lets take Arts students for example. In other countries there is a pool of subjects from which the Arts students can choose. In Sri Lanka, we only have a very limited choice of subjects. These subjects are taught using old syllabuses. Nothing is updated. We cannot blame the graduates looking for job opportunities in the government sector. They have done their best with the limited resources they have. So we should stop the blame game and restructure our education system.
Guruge also pointed out that underemployment is a major problem faced by the graduates who are awaiting a job compatible with their qualifications. These unemployed graduates do get an income from working somewhere. There are graduates who are even involved in manual work. So what they basically seek is a job appropriate to their educational qualifications.
Changes in education
The SLFGA Chief Secretary Manula Perera, at a recent press briefing, observed that there are number of matters relating to the recruitment process of the graduate scheme. He demanded consistency in criteria and consideration of the nature of the degree when allocating marks at the interviews. Perera also said that a better designed training programme should be provided for the development officers who will soon be recruited. He also raised concerns about the period of time these officers have to undergo training. He observed that the proposed two-year training programme is too lengthy and pointed out that all previous schemes had only a one-year training period.
Meanwhile, Unnathi Samaraweera, a Senior Lecturer (Transitional) at the Sociology Department, University of Colombo, added her thoughts on this disposition. Samaraweera noted that the degree of economic development of the country directly or indirectly influences opinion about the attractiveness of government and private jobs.
Sri Lanka, as a developing country, faces a number of challenges in the job market which are directly or indirectly linked with the development of the country, Samaraweera said. Unfortunately, progressive social attitudes about government jobs also indirectly discourage citizens from taking private jobs which have their own pros and cons. In terms of job security, leave opportunities, other benefits such as pensions, EPF, and ETF, it is agreeable that every educated youth prefers a government job rather than a private one. What is unfortunate here is that, we as citizens of the country tend to forget that a job is not only for our betterment, but also for the development of the country, which most of us have forgotten at the moment. Each individual as a citizen should take upon the responsibility to work towards the common goal of increasing the Gross Domestic Product, while working towards their own individual goals.
On the other hand, requirements for private jobs are quite different from those of government jobs, where language skill and IT proficiency are highly expected in private jobs compared to a government one, he said. The majority of persons with those sought-after skills would still prefer a government job if given a choice, for reasons mentioned earlier. This whole approach is an issue which we should revisit and clarify properly as citizens of this country.
While stressing the importance of social responsibility on the part of citizens, Samaraweera said that the countrys development goals should be given priority.
The government also has a responsibility to work for the betterment of society, and so development goals should be given priority continuously, Samaraweera pointed out. The fact is, no matter whether it is a government or a private job, the basic requirements of each individual should be fulfilled through the occupation, including job satisfaction and social competence.
In the meantime, each individual should be concerned about the fact that he or she is a part of a larger labour market in the country which directly as well as indirectly leads to development. Then the private versus government job dichotomy would be lessened and development goals would be given the priority.
On the same note, President Maithripala Sirisena recently promised to takes steps to provide employment for all the unemployed graduates, within the next six months. President Sirisena also stated that the government was focusing attention on making changes in the education system through new education policies.
