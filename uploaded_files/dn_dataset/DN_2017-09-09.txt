Anuradhapura to become major soya bean production zone
The government has planned to make Anuradhapura District the country's major soya bean production zone.
The Agriculture Departments soya crop leader, Assistant Agriculture Director Buddhika Abesinghe told the Daily News that it has been proposed to limit the importation of soya as much as possible to enable farmers achieve the set targets under the first phase of the soya cultivation promotion venture. Soya is to be grown in 25,000 hectares. Arrangements are being made to cultivate soya in 15,000 hectares in Mahaweli 'H' area, Huruluwewa and Galenbindunuwewa areas during the forthcoming Maha cultivation season following the long drought.
Soya is not vulnerable to severe drought conditions. Incentives such as the free provision of high quality seeds to farmers, offering lucrative marketing facilities, fertilizer subsidy etc will be offered to cultivators.
Soya is essentially required to produce Thriposha which is now produced on a commercial basis. A large consignment of soya is needed for manufacturing animal feed. There is an increasing demand for soya oil. There is focus to start a number of soya oil manufacturing plants, Abesinghe said.
Farmers in Thambuttegama Mahaweli 'H' area have overcome the drought by harvesting more than 380,000 kilograms of soya in the 2016/2017 Maha season. This consignment is sufficient to fulfill the national soya seeds requirement.
We hope to distribute seed soya free and the food promotion board, the farmers trust fund in collaboration with recognized private sector dealers are contributing to the soya cultivation plan, he added.

Addressing a media conference, veteran artiste Rohana Beddage condemned the statement made by Fonseka on Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera.He said it cannot be accepted.
He said that it was not anyway civic to insult a monk who had done tremendous work during war time and in present.
He has been critical whenever there is injustice and wrongdoings. See the way this so-called minister has insulted Gunawansa Thera regardless of his dignity and the good rendered to society. It is heartbreaking, Beddage said.
Veteran artiste Cyril Wickramage said the President should make his consideration on the incident as it was a massive blow to all Buddhists monks.
That monk is mad. Thats all I have to say, This is how Mr. Fonseka addressed Gunawansa Thera. It is really disgraceful and disappointing thats all I have to say about this rude person, he added.

Autobiography: Crazy: My Road to Redemption
The first night in prison was the hardest time  Chris Lewis:
I remember going into jail the first time, Chris Lewis says in a plush hotel on Park Lane in Mayfair. Coffee cups chink and, in the lounge across the marble lobby, a lonely pianist plays tinkling old standards to himself. But Lewis, the former England cricketer who served half of the 13-year prison sentence he received after being arrested for trying to smuggle cocaine worth 140,000 from St Lucia into Britain in December 2008, is back inside.
Talk about acute fear, the 49 year old says more intently than if he is describing his Test debut in 1990 or opening the bowling in the World Cup final two years later in front of a crowd of 100,000. My mind is trying to find any information I have about jail and it all comes from films. Youre scaring yourself and the first night you dont know whether you can stand it. That was the hardest time. You dont know how youre going to survive.
Lewis survived and, six and a half years later, in June 2015, he was released. But the stigma of jail and the complications shrouding the life of any former prisoner remain. Over the next two hours Lewis is a compelling witness to his own incarceration. Once the worst happened you either face it or bail out. At first I thought Id absolutely fall apart but when I got sentenced I had the strength to deal with it. There was more fortitude than youd imagine. There was also a cathartic experience because at first you think: Its their fault. But the truth dawns: The constant here, mate, is you. The person to blame is just you.
Lewiss autobiography Crazy echoes this tone and strives to explain why an England cricketer, who played 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals, ended up thinking he could carry three cans of liquid cocaine through security and customs without hitting trouble. The suggestion is that lack of money at the end of a sporting career was only one reason. An angry and disillusioned Lewis had fallen into a pattern of bad decisions.
The book captures the twists and turns of his life  from a childhood in Guyana, to moving to England aged 10, to discovering a new life in a strange country through cricket. It also depicts him as being often misunderstood and unfairly stereotyped  and draws a link between his fateful offence and the hurt he suffered after reporting an approach made to him by a match fixing gambler in the summer of 1999. Lewis refused and the next morning he met the England and Wales Cricket Board to divulge this information. He also went to the police.
It was the following summer that the story turned sour. This was the start of the dark times, Lewis writes. The general feeling was I had maliciously made-up stories about England players being involved in match-fixing for financial gain.
Lewis looks hurt as he revisits a chaotic saga in which he believes the ECB let him down. All my dreams blew up in flames. No part of the dream involved being booed or perceived as somebody lying about my team-mates. It was the end. Cricket was a tainted space. I was angry. I was upset. Id been unfairly treated. But if you lift your head above the parapet, and talk about match-fixing, youre unlikely to come off well.
Lewis was often regarded as aloof or arrogant, especially during his fractious time at Nottinghamshire, which was so different to playing for Leicestershire and Surrey. People asked: Why do you have to have a fancy car Are you trying to show youre better than us The answer was: No  its because I want it. Its not that deep.
He laughs before becoming contrite again. With hindsight, in their position, I wouldve had those same thoughts about me. Were all in our sponsored cars but thats not enough for you From their perspective, it was me being a poseur and showing off.
A thoughtful Lewis appears the opposite of a show-off today. Jail has also rubbed away at his identity. Under the rules of his early release his passport has been confiscated and now I cant call up my pension company and request the details of my pension. Unless I offer the relevant identity documents it seems that, essentially, I dont exist.
The travel ban is four years so were halfway through. Its not a moan  its a realisation. I hear that nice saying: Youve done your time so move on. But doing the time doesnt end the consequences.
Lewis is upset more by his belief that, having always fought against stereotypes, I walked into the worst one of the black man ending up in jail. But I put myself there. If you wanted to get deep, Id say its the pain of disappointing a whole race. Im 100% sure every black person that knew me cringed when they heard about me in prison. The black community feels its judged as a whole because other people say: See We were right.
He is also pained by another racial stereotype which suggested he was naturally athletic but devoid of dedication. That still prevails. Im sensitive to the language and flippancy I still hear. Years ago people said: These West Indians are so athletic, theyre natural fielders. But where are the great West Indies fielders now Has God suddenly stopped giving that athleticism to the West Indies and passed it to everybody else Other cricketers are just working harder. Back then black players felt it. Youre saying I havent had to put in any work And then later you tell me how lazy I am
It ate away at me because there wasnt space for an argument. People were 100% sure and you could only talk about it with other black athletes. If I bowled fast I would sometimes read I was like a gangster. But I put myself in a position where everybody who wrote those pieces can now say: I told you so.
Lewis was a fine player and he worked hard to find his way as an immigrant into the heart of English cricket. I wouldnt necessarily use the word consistent, he says of his Test career. I had my days but I needed to develop consistency. I scored one Test hundred. Wouldnt it have been nice if it was four
He was mainly a bowler who could bat and so he remembers his century, in India, with amusement. It was one of those anomalies. I was compromised. Id been out the night before because it was my birthday and I was dehydrated and didnt feel 100%. I walked out with a lazy thought process: I got out in the first innings for a duck. Im not in the mood to muck around. My head is hurting so if he pitches it up Im whacking him. I whacked him, it worked and I carried on. I wouldnt call that perfect preparation.
There were other days where you see the ball really well and youre so disappointed not to have scored more. You think: I need to apply myself, I need more mental strength. I didnt play the ball. I played Shane Warne. As a bowler Id say anything to a batsman  to give him more luggage to carry. The trick as a batsman is to stay light and focus on yourself. Over the course of my career the person who nailed that was Sachin Tendulkar. He never engaged in your shenanigans. I got him out a few times but he would not let me into his head.
But we have to talk about Brian Lara. Brian was so greedy for runs. Who dreams of beating Garry Sobers [1958] record [of 365 runs in a Test innings] Who wakes up and says: Today Im beating it [as Lara did against England when scoring 375 in 1994].
When it got beaten [by Matthew Hayden who scored 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003] Brian showed a different mindset to everybody on the planet: Ill score 400 in a Test and take back that world record.
England suffered again in 2004 when Lara hit 400no. Lewis had been out of international cricket for six years but he was still remembered for bowling the ball in 1994 which allowed Lara to pass the Sobers landmark. Everyone claimed I bowled a gimme but he actually stepped on his stumps [while hitting Lewis for four]. The bails flew up but dropped back in place. He could have been out for 362 but Brians will got him there.
How did Lewis feel when, last week, West Indies beat England  after losing the series opener disastrously and being derided as the worst Test team in 50 years. Everybodys in shock, Lewis says, grinning. Its great. I represented England but Im of West Indian descent, so the last 20 years have been painful. You want West Indies performing to a standard we became accustomed to for so long. It was so nice watching this team perform to that level, especially as Id been making jokes about the fact Ive got a book signing on Saturday at Lords. I was wondering if the Test [starting on Thursday] would last that long. But they were tremendous. This wasnt just a lucky win. Their challenge now is to do it again.
Would he have enjoyed playing cricket today The IPL would have been made for me. Many of my issues were with fitting in and behaviour. That goes away if Im self-employed. But heres the flipside. I would love the IPL but everything is micro-managed and going out for a boogie at night would definitely be a no-no. How would I survive
Lewis laughs. Maybe the 1980s and 90s were ideal for me. You were still allowed a good time. Now the perception in sport seems to be that, as Im paying you so much money, your arse is mine. Im not sure that would have worked with my mentality.
He now plays club cricket in Bromley, south-east London  the most challenging parts are the umpires and wickets but Im enjoying playing again  and away from the game Lewis is trying lots of bits and bobs, adding: I coach when I can and Ive been working in the office at a construction company in Nottingham.
I hope I can help younger people and Ive got an interview coming up with the national prison agency and Im also involved with my friend Colin Salmon , the actor, and his Cage Cricket scheme.
In the meantime, there is lingering remorse he ended up in prison. Im not sure that ever goes away  until this becomes a happy story.
I would like to one day say: Actually, Im glad these things happened because, without it, I wouldnt have reached X, Y, Z. Im not at that point yet and I dont know if you ever get there. Going to jail is never a blessing because its uncomfortable but perhaps those lessons could help you and everybody around you. So I hope, one day, to get rid of that stigma. But until then all you can do is keep moving, keep trying. - theguardian

Birmingham beats Liverpool to be UK candidate
London: Birmingham has beaten Liverpool in the race to be England's candidate to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, ministers announced on Thursday.
The Midlands city must now convince the British government to approve the bid and underwrite the event's costs.
The 2022 event became unexpectedly available in March, when the Commonwealth Games Federation stripped the South African city of Durban of the right to stage the quadrennial showpiece for failing to meet "key obligations"."I am grateful to the bid teams from both Birmingham and Liverpool for their hard work in making the case for their respective cities as potential Commonwealth Games hosts," said sports minister Tracey Crouch.
"Now, after a comprehensive assessment process, the government will look at the final bid proposal from Birmingham and decide if a formal bid will be submitted to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF).
"We need to be completely satisfied that the bid offers overall value for money from hosting the Games and that a strong economic and sporting legacy can be delivered from it."
The federation's final decision on where the Games will be held is expected by the end of the year.
The chairman of Birmingham's bid committee said: "This is a great endorsement by the UK government of Birmingham's credentials to host the Games and recognition of the city's resolve to deliver a memorable event." The Commonwealth Games are restricted to countries that are members of the Commonwealth.

Blue-Green celebrations struck by a War Hero attack
While the two parties of the National Unity coalition are in a celebratory mood with the SLFP marking its 66th anniversary, and the UNP reaching its 71st anniversary this week and due to celebrate at Ratnapura tomorrow (10th), the War Hero protection pledge has raised new challenges to coalition politics, as government moves to third year.
President Maithripala Sirisena had cause for satisfaction at the success of the SLFPs 66th anniversary celebration at Campbell Park, Colombo, last Sunday, with the question of party unity moving to background and the Rajapaksa challenge to SLFP leadership becoming increasingly unreal. Public statements by Mahinda Rajapaksa about blue brigades contesting future elections from the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP), and reports of a massive success in the SLPPs membership drive, show the Lotus Bud planners are thinking away from the SLFP, and the new political realities emerging.
With a sizeable crowd from all parts of the country with SLFPs grass roots membership and organisation abilities helped by government connections, President Sirisena emphasized the need for the SLFP to be strengthened as a democratic party and a wide political movement, recalling the initial slogans of its founder SWRD Bandaranaike  and its initial image as the party of the Sangha, Physicians, Teachers, Peasants and Workers  Sangha  Veda Guru - Govi  Kamkaru  and emphasized the need for the party to also embrace scholars and intellectuals, with a patriotic commitment to democracy.
He was strong in defense of the SLFPs current alignment with the UNP, especially in the context of those in the party who said they wont or cant participate in party activities as long as it was associated with the UNP. He emphasized that consensual government was in the larger national interest, and not narrow political interests and such an alignment had brought good relations with the international community and helped the economy.
He stressed the need to fight fraud, corruption and malpractice as well as attempts at dynastic rule, and that power given by the people should not be used by politicians for personal benefits and agendas, but only to benefit the people and the country.
Vision 2025
The celebratory mood of both parties was seen with the launch of Vision 2025, the eight year economic and social development plan, by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the BMICH last Tuesday. It is a major socio-political move that looks at the wider goals of the Unity Coalition formed in August 2015, and seeking realization of The Empowered Sri Lanka concept, seeking structural transformation of the country and society, in the context of the modern aspects of development changing societies worldwide.
Presented by the Unity Government, Vision 2025 is a major move by the UNP and the Western liberal thinking forces looking at new ways of changing Sri Lankan society, through major economic and technological transformations, to push back the old and seedy thinking that has dominated political attitudes and the methodology of progress.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe responding to queries from youth at the BMICH event was clear that youth need to be given new and constructive approaches to meet the needs of today and tomorrow. The governments move is to improve the economy by creating one million jobs for youth, through a strategy already initiated. He emphasized the two main parties had to come together to implement important pro-national and people policies, and the need for political stability to bring good development in the country.
The Prime Minister was also emphatic the policies of Vision 2025 would transform Sri Lanka into a hub in the Indian Ocean with a knowledge based, highly competitive, social market economy.
The knowledge based economy must be the key aspect of Vision 2025, because Sri Lanka needs a major push to be a knowledge based and knowledge driven society, which will require the rapid advance of technological knowledge, moves into areas Artificial Intelligence, and importantly the wider knowledge of English, without keeping it confined to the better and richer schools.
Apart from its larger goal for development, such as the expectations held by the Mahaweli Diversion Project and earlier colonization projects in the Dry Zone areas by UNP governments, Vision 2025 is also a means to keep the unity coalition in place despite the rivalry between the SLFP and UNP; with the hope for those in government, from both parties, that economic progress of a larger magnitude in socially transformative means is the promise of the future.
War crimes challenge
The success of the SLFP anniversary celebration also brought new problems for the President and government, with the responses of the international community to statement by President Sirisena that he would not allow anyone in the world to do anything to Retd. Major Gen Jagath Jayasuriya, the former Army Commander or any of Sri Lankas military commanders or war heroes. The surge of the blue flags at Campbell Park would have moved the President to state this in the same speech that he said how the international community is having better understandings and relations with Sri Lanka, due to the reconciliation policies of the government. The Presidents statement is important in local politics, in the context of Field Marshal and Minister Sarath Fonsekas statement of readiness to give evidence against his successor as Army Commander.
The JO is already talking of a motion of No Confidence against Minister Sarath Fonseka. The call for his removal from the Cabinet have come from many quarters, including sections of the Buddhist clergy, and Wimal Weerawansa and Vasudeva Nanayakkara, too, showing the diversity of advantage in War Hero politics. The question that needs to be asked is who would bring charges against Maj. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya in Sri Lanka, and in what Sri Lankan court would it be. Sri Lanka has made it clear it will not accept the jurisdiction' of any foreign court on these matters. It is necessary to have some sense of sanity in this debate of rage on the so-called threat to War Heroes, whether it is posed by foreign accusers or Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Those now crying for Sarath Fonsekas political blood have forgotten that it was he who did lead to War Heroes to militarily defeat the LTTE, just as Mahinda Rajapaksa gave the political lead.
The speed with which the foreign media picked up the story of President Sirisena speaking in defense of Maj. Gen Jagath Jayasuriya could well lead to a new avalanche of criticisms from foreign Human Rights and anti-War Crime organisations, as well as the UNHRC and other forces that will take up this issue. The agency story headlined Sri Lankan leader will protect general accused of war crimes -- was carried in the Washington Post, New York Times, Kansas City Star, West Plains Daily and many others newspapers in the USA, and commented on by major TV news services.
The time is certainly not the best for those who wish to boast of good international relations in the context of reconciliation and peace building.
Electoral system
Minister Faizer Mustapha has said it is proposed to hold parliamentary elections under a 60:40 ratio electoral system, introducing the same system to Provincial Councils, to ensure a consistent method at all elections. It is 60% for First Past the Post (FPP) and 40% under Proportional Representation (PR).
Having a single system for all elections is good, as we move away from the wholly undemocratic PR system we use under the 1978 Constitution. But the move for 60% on FPP, as it is, does not bring democracy to the electoral process. There are many examples, such as the UK government today, to show that FPP does not get the majority representation to Parliament or any other body.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, answering questions at the Vision 2025 launch, said when Mr. SWRD Bandaranaike won a two-thirds majority in 1956 his party polled only 48% votes, and, when the UNP under JR Jayewardene won a five-sixth majority in 1977, it also secured only 51 per cent of the votes. The Prime Minister spoke of the need for political stability to bring about progress.
The Government should certainly look at the French and similar methods, where FPP is not done in the non-democratic way we have done it, and countries such as the UK and India, still continue. It is better to think of having elections in two rounds, with anyone who polls more than 50% in round one being elected at once, and the two leading candidates who did not get 50% contesting in the next round, which will ensure one will definitely get more than 50%. That will be a true majority vote, unlike the FPP we know, which can elect a person who gets just 25%, when all other candidates share the majority of 75%. If elections could have been delayed for so long, a delay to ensure a better democratic process will not be opposed by anyone.

Contempt of Court case against Dr. Padeniya fixed for Nov. 10
The Court of Appeal yesterday granted further time for Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya to file written submissions regarding the preliminary objections raised by him regarding a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet was in open court served on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer had informed Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the Court stenographer.
Two-judge-bench headed by Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B.Dehideniya fixed the matter for objections on November 10.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal had issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised island wide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr.Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.
They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing
further contemptuous statements/articles scandalizing the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond issue that he will be representing Arjun Aloysius at the commission. Accordingly, Aloysius will be represented by both Marapana PC and Premaratne PC.
Chairman of the Commission Supreme Court Judge K. T. Chitrasiri initially informed Premaratne PC that he has to be ready with his clients affidavit by next Monday (11).
Premaratne PC requested at least 48 hours to prepare the affidavit starting from the time when Aloysius complete giving statements to the CID officers attached to the Treasury Bond Commission. Statements were recorded from Aloysius both yesterday and day before by the CID, each day over eight hours.
Premaratne PC argued that his client is being interrogated for long hours and for days, so that they will need time to prepare the affidavit. Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri informed Premaratne PC, recording of statements will be finished by next Sunday (10) and agreed to grant 48 hours to Premaratne PC to prepare the affidavit of Aloysius.
Commissioner Chitrasiri further told Premaratne PC to prepare the affidavit on time, so that the commission could start examining Aloysius by next Tuesday, to which Premaratne PC said that they are making a submission. Justice Jayawardena: Mr. Premaratne, are you objecting to giving an affidavit or giving evidence
Premaratne PC: I am objecting to giving evidence. JJ: Well, it is up to you.
JJ (continues): If you are reluctant to give evidence it is your choice. You have to think very carefully about it.
Later on, explaining his position, Premaratne PC told Daily News that they are questioning the compellability of his client to give evidence in a case where he is a defendant.
We will be making the submission on whether we are compellable to give evidence, Premaratne PC said.
Aloysiuss counsel is to cross examine PTL CEO Kasun Palisena next week.

Education Minister to appoint committee to improve school cricket
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam addressing officials of the Sri Lankas Schools Cricket Association said that one of the reasons of the Sri Lanka National teams disastrous performance was due to the inability of the authorities to pick talented school cricketers in the junior teams.
The officials of the Schools Cricket Association have failed to identify outstanding cricketers from rural areas and absorb them into the national junior pool which has resulted in school cricketers being unable to reach international standards when they are picked for the national team. He said that the Education Ministry hope to form a committee comprising former cricketers and coachers to get their advice to unearth rural cricketing talent and nurture them.
So that they would go on to represent the national team. He said a special meeting has been scheduled for September 12, Tuesday at 3.00 pm at the Education Ministry which will be attended by well known former Sri Lanka cricketers and coachers to get their views on how to improve school cricket in the country.

Eheliyagoda barren lands breeding mosquitoes
Although over 90 percent of the villagers in Eheliyagoda try to keep their home gardens free of mosquito breeding sites, barren lands as well as some rubber estates have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, Eheliyagoda PHI Tharanga Jinasena said.
He said so at the Eheliyagoda Coordination Committee Meeting held recently at the Eheliyagoda Divisional Secretariat auditorium.
The meeting was headed by Presidential Special Project Director Sarath Sandanaike and Eheliyagoda UNP Chief Orhanisor Siripala Kiriella.

He has also worked with Dolphins (formerly Natal) in South African domestic cricket, and Kent in England.
I am really excited to be a part of this new era in Irish cricket, Ford said. I have always enjoyed working with decent people and, in their attitude, character and camaraderie, the Irish cricketers have always come across as such.
With my knowledge and experience I believe I can genuinely make a difference. All my efforts will be dedicated to assisting the players to improve and achieve their full potential while playing an enjoyable brand of cricket.

Former judge says not indicted...
With reference to our news item under the heading District Judge indicted in fraud case, that appeared on August 25, 2017, former District Judge D. A. R Somasinghe has sent the following clarification.
I have been indicted by the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery and Corruption under section 23 of the Bribery Act which I consider to be arbitrary, malicious and capricious.
I filed FR case No 407/16 against the said Commission on 11.11.2016 for not concluding the inquiry before my retirement. When I was in service I challenged them to indict me if materials are available.
Having recorded four statements, from the manager of the Horana People's Bank I have been indicted having hidden my lawful income. Therefore, I have filed second FR case No 276/17 against the said Commission to get the arbitrary indictment quashed.
"I appeared on 24 August 2017 before High Court Colombo and I was served the indictment.
"I regret to complain to you that the Daily News on 25.8.2017 reported District Judge indicted in fraud case. I have never been indicted in fraud case as alleged by the paper.
The word Fraud is a crime which is defined in the Penal code. I have not committed either crime under Penal Code or Bribery Act. This is only a fabricated case which was filed against me to show Supreme Court that the said Commission has not violated my human rights. By disseminating this incorrect report, without paying due diligence an irreparable damage has been caused to me by this report", Somasinghe said in a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission.

FR filed against COPE report re-fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera challenging the various findings and statements made in a report prepared by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the bond issues by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the year of 2015 and 2016 was yesterday, re-fixed for support on January 26 next year by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
The petitioner Vice Secretary of the Sri Lanka Mahabodhi Society Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thera had cited 26 members of COPE including its chairman Sunil Hadunnetti who have been tasked by Parliament of Sri Lanka to investigate and report on matters pertaining to certain Treasury bond auctions, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, the Governor of the CBSL, Chairman of the Tender Committee of the CBSL and Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the CBSL, the Auditor General of Sri Lanka and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner stated that consequent to being elected in September 2015, Parliament appointed the members of COPE to conduct an investigation into certain Central Bank auctions of Treasury Bonds which occurred in February 2015 and March 2016.
The members of COPE have submitted their final report to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016.
The said COPE report maintains that; the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th 18th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report in general without the footnotes. The 6th,7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 20th, 23rd and 25th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report with the footnotes.
All members of the Committee (the 1st to 26th Respondents) unanimously agreed to the recommendations given at the end of the report.
The Petitioner expressly pleads that notwithstanding that the said COPE report was presented to Parliament on or about October 28, 2016, the same remained inaccessible to the general public and the Petitioner for some time. The Petitioner pleads that the said COPE report only became accessible to the Petitioner on or about November 24, 2016.
In the circumstances aforesaid, the Petitioner pleads that the Petitioner could not file this application sooner as the COPE report was inaccessible to him, and he was not aware of the contents of the same, until November 24, 2016. The Petitioner further stated that in any event the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest.
The Petitioner pleads that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled.
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing Treasury Bonds viz the direct and private placement from the month of January 2009, the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury bond auction process.
The Petitioner further stated that instead of reporting the above to Parliament and the general public, the said COPE report is littered with inconsistencies or contradictions or misrepresentations, which the Petitioner pleads makes certain findings and statements in the COPE report unsafe, or prejudiced or biased, and a violation and infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.
The Petitioner and the general public of Sri Lanka are entitled to receive a fair, impartial and truthful investigation into such matters, which is free from bias and ulterior/political objectives. The Petitioner states that by the glaring contradictions or inconsistencies or misrepresentations contained in the said COPE report, the members of the COPE committee (the 1st to 26th Respondents) have not fulfilled their duties and obligations to the Petitioner and other members of the general public of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner is seeking an Order or Declare that any express or implied finding and statement and suggestion in the said COPE report that the direct and private placement method in the issue of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank has been properly, lawfully and correctly used by the Central Bank from the month of January 2009 up until the date of the COPE report, is wrongful.
The petitioner is further seeking an Order or Declare that as at the time of the Treasury Bond auctions of the Central Bank that was held on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016, the proper, lawful process or method as regards the issue of Treasury Bonds was the auction process/method, and not the direct/private placement process/method.

IAEA, BRICS defend Iran nuclear deal
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came to the defense of Iran in announcing that Irans nuclear programme is being subjected to the worlds most robust nuclear inspection regime.
IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano made the remarks at a panel discussion on global nuclear governance in the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia earlier this week amid Washingtons pressure on the agency to request access to Irans military sites.
Amano hailed the important role played by the UN nuclear agency in the finalization of the landmark accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), saying that the JCPOA represents a clear gain for nuclear verification.
Iran is subject to the worlds most robust nuclear verification regime. Our inspectors are on the ground 24/7. We monitor nuclear facilities, using permanently installed cameras and other equipment, he added.
Under the deal, Amano said, Iran has accepted restrictions on its nuclear programme and the IAEA has expanded access to its sites and information.
The deal demonstrated that even complex issues can be resolved if all parties were committed to dialogue aimed at achieving results, he said. The remarks came at a time when Washington, which is a party to the agreement, seems to be laying out a case for abandoning it.
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley travelled recently to Vienna to press the IAEA on accessing Irans military sites.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has commented that the US was openly hostile toward the JCPOA and determined to undermine and destroy it.
The IAEA has recently reaffirmed Iran's adherence to its commitments under the nuclear agreement. The Trump administration has twice certified Irans compliance with the deal. The next deadline is in mid-October.
In a joint statement issued during their latest summit in the Chinese city of Xiamen on Monday, the BRICS countries  Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa  also defended the accord saying, We firmly support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear issue and call upon all relevant parties to comply fully with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and stability.
The JCPOA was reached between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries  namely the US, Russia, China, France, and Britain plus Germany  in July 2015 and took effect in January 2016. Under the deal, Iran undertook to put limitations on its nuclear programme in exchange for the termination of all nuclear-related sanctions against Tehran.
Church leaders condemn Israel action
Patriarchs and heads of local churches in Jerusalem condemned the Israeli military court ruling that allowed settlers to take over properties belonging to the church as unjust and politically motivated.
In a statement addressed to Christians around the world, church leaders accused Israel of failing to protect Christian rights in the holy land. They also appealed to Christians, as well as the heads of governments, and all people of good will, to support them in their efforts to ensure that no further attempts are made by Israel against the Palestinian Christian community.
The ruling allowed settler groups to seize two hotels and a large building in the Old City of Jerusalem, which belongs to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.
Now Palestinian Christian population only make up two percent of the population of both Israel and Palestine  the number used to be around 15 percent. In Bethlehem alone, the Christian population has slumped to 7,500 from 20,000 in 1995.
Yusef Daher, executive secretary of the World Council of Churches says that the sharp decline in the number of Christian Jerusalemites is a result of Israels attempt to Judaize Jerusalem and slowly erode its Christian and Muslim Palestinian heritage: The Israeli government policy throughout the whole history has been unilateral: turning Jerusalem both into a Jewish city and into the capital of Israel, while getting rid of all the Christian [and Muslim] Palestinians,.
Similar concerns were raised in the joint statement by the patriarchs and heads of local churches.
Venezuela donates flood relief to USA
Strangely enough Venezuela under added US sanctions and under threats of US to topple the regime has donated US$5 million to aid recovery efforts in the US states of Texas and Louisiana, which have been battered by the countrys worst hurricane in decades.
Let's not allow war or threats to be imposed, but instead let's impose solidarity. We will always be with the people of the United States and the peoples of the world in difficult times, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said. He also said Venezuela offered to send Venezuelan aid workers to the disaster zone, including doctors and emergency personnel.
In addition, a percentage of all gasoline sales from Citgo, the US subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA based in Houston will be dedicated to the construction of homes for victims of Hurricane Harvey.

If I ran into a good guy I felt Id lose - Federer
Roger Federer said he never felt in a safe place physically or mentally during a US Open campaign that ended with defeat by Juan Martin del Potro.
The Argentine 24th seed won their quarter-final 7-5 3-6 7-6 (10-8) 6-4 in Wednesdays night session.
Third seed Federer had struggled with a back injury in the build-up to New York and confirmed he never felt 100% fit.
It was one of those matches where if I ran into a good guy I was going to lose, I felt, said the Swiss, 36.
I dont want to say I was in a negative mindset, but I knew going in that Im not in a safe place. It might have depended too much on my opponent - and I dont like that feeling.
I had it throughout the tournament, and I just felt that way every single match I went into.
Federer has enjoyed a stellar year, ending his five-year wait for a Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and adding an eighth Wimbledon victory in July.
The 19-time major champion added: I didnt have that feeling at Wimbledon or at the Australian Open, and thats why rightfully so Im out of this tournament.
I wasnt good enough in my mind, in my body and in my game to overcome these three pillars.
Having skipped the French Open, Federer arrived at Flushing Meadows unbeaten in Grand Slam matches and with just three defeats all year.
However, the back injury he picked up in Montreal last month disrupted his preparation, and two five-set matches in the first two rounds suggested he was not at his best.
The defeat by 28-year-old Del Potro ended Federers hopes, for now at least, of winning a 20th Grand Slam title and taking the number one ranking from Spaniard Rafael Nadal.
It should hurt, and it does, rightfully so, said Federer. But I think my perspective at this age, and with the season that I have had, its easier to grasp faster, so Ill be fine quickly.
The Swiss had his chances against Del Potro, notably four set points in a dramatic third set tie-break that could have swung the match in his favour.
Im OK with it, and I tried until the very end, he said.
Smashing certain stuff in the net that I normally wouldnt, smashing forehand volleys into the back fence, I mean, that stuff sucked. Honestly, it was terrible.
Juan Martin did well. He served well, had some big shots when he needed to. That was the part that he did so much better tonight - and thats why he deserves to win.
I feel I have no place in the semis and he will have a better chance to beat Rafa, to be honest.
The result not only brings his Grand Slam season to an end but it denies the Flushing Meadows crowd a first meeting between Federer and 15-time major champion Nadal.
It is the sixth time in 10 years that they have missed out by one match on seeing the great rivalry play out in New York.
I didnt even think about it as I lost that match, said Federer.
Im dealing with just trying to understand what happened and just to overcome this in the next few hours, days, weeks, whatever it is. Ill be fine.
Of course it is a pity, but Juan Martin deserves it more.
Federer says he hasnt felt well enough in either body or mind over the past fortnight, his confidence affected by the back injury which hindered his preparation.
He looked an unlikely champion when labouring to five-set victories in the opening two rounds and when faced by a competitor like Del Potro he was made to look very uncomfortable and very uncertain.
There were some spectacular misses by Federer, who too often presented himself at the net and invited Del Potro to pass him with his fearsome forehand. The Argentine took Federer up on his offer repeatedly, and served consistently well throughout the match.
And so Federers attempt to win three Grand Slams in a year for the first time in a decade has ended at the quarter-final stage.
The ever popular Del Potro, who has had wrist surgery four times since winning the title here in 2009, is one win away from a return to the final of his favourite Grand Slam.

CPRFU says Kandy has a problem with rugby grounds
In the Kandy district there is a major problem with lack of rugby playing grounds and most schools are handicapped and are unable to play their scheduled rugby fixtures says CPRFU. A few weeks back the All Island U/16 tournament was held at Satneeshi - Digane New Sports Complex and at Trinity College Pallekele grounds with much difficulty.
At the last moment when the tournament was to begin, there was no rugby goal posts. The CPRFU Rugby Development Officer Abdul Rasheed came to the rescue and overnight fixed the goal posts for the tournament. These are practical difficulties faced by Kandy, the Kandy Sports Club who enjoys a fully fledged rugby grounds are never generous in sharing their grounds. Their charges for hire are so exorbitant that schools can least afford it. When the lease agreement with Kandy Municipality was drawn up many years ago, it very clearly stated that the grounds are released on lease provided the adjoining village is also granted access to the grounds. When the former president late Dr. S. Kapuwatte was in charge, he knew the clause and was very liberal and allowed all schools to use the grounds. Its high time the club administrators change their attitude and be more agreeable to promote rugby in Kandy.
Total Fitness Bay  Kandy
A gym called Total Fitness Bay will be opened in Kandy in the near future, which will benefit young sportsmen and women.

James Anderson joins 500 wicket club
LONDON Sept 8: James Anderson became the first England bowler to take 500 Test wickets and just the sixth in history when he dismissed West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite on the second day of the third Test at Lords on Friday.
Anderson, who started West Indies second innings on 499 Test wickets, reached the landmark when, with the last delivery of his second over, he bowled Brathwaite for four with a big inswinger that demolished the right-handers stumps. A capacity crowd at Lords rose to give Anderson a standing ovation, with the Lancashire swing bowler having started his Test career by taking five wickets in his debut innings against Zimbabwe at the home of cricket in 2003.
Anderson was just the sixth bowler and only the third paceman to have taken 500 Test wickets. He is also the only active cricketer in that elite group, with the spin trio of Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralitharan (800 Test wickets), Australias Shane Warne (708), Indias Anil Kumble (619), as well as Australia seamer Glenn McGrath (563) and West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh (519) now all retired.
Ben Stokes followed his Test-best bowling figures with a rapid fifty as England gained a first-innings lead of 71 runs against West Indies in their series decider at Lords on Friday.
England, at tea on a rain-marred second day, had been bowled out for 194 in reply to West Indies first innings 123 to leave the match finely balanced with this three-Test series all square at 1-1.
Kemar Roach took five for 72, with West Indies captain and fellow seamer Jason Holder following up with four for 54.
Left-handed batsman Stokes made 60, his fifty coming off just 51 balls, including 10 fours.
That followed the Durham all-rounders six for 22 on Thursday in overcast conditions ideal for his lively right-arm swing bowling.
But it might have been a very different story when, just two balls into the second session after a rain delay, Stokes, on 24, edged Shannon Gabriel only for Kraigg Brathwaite to drop a tough chance as he dived far to his left at second slip.

MAMMOTH SAVING FROM CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY
PM in special ministerial statement to House says :
Rs. 25 B REDUCED THROUGH TALKS WITH JAPANESE COMPANY:
Behind-the-scene agents displeased by our achievements:
Tourism development project, IT park, industrial zone also proposed :
The government managed to cut down construction costs of Phase Three of the Central Expressway by Rs.25 billion following negotiation with Japans Taisei Corporation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Making a special statement in parliament, the Prime Minister rejected allegations made by a media group that project costs had been inflated and proper procedures had not been followed.
He said the Taisei Corporations initial estimate stood at Rs. 159 billion but the government through negotiations with the construction company brought it down to Rs. 134 billion thereby making a huge saving. He reminded the House that the Colombo-Kandy Expressway was an election pledge of his government and noted that it was also a part of the proposed town development project.
A tourism development project and an IT park will get off the ground with Kandy as its centre.
An industrial zone is also proposed in the same area, he said.
The Prime Minister pointed out that constructions of Phase One of the Central Expressway has been undertaken by a Chinese Company, Phase Two by a Sri Lankan company, Phase Three by two Japanese Companies and Phase Four by an Indian company making it a truly multi-national effort.
Elaborating on Phase Three from Pothuhera to Galagedara, the Premier said the section contained three tunnels, elevated roads and 14 bridges. Special measures had to be taken to minimise the environmental harm. The project is carried out with a loan from the Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank. The exact amount was yet to be finalised. He said main contractor, Taisei, would carry out the construction jointly with Fujita Corporation. The work is scheduled to be completed in three years.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the government hoped to pay compensation for the land acquired for the expressway by raising loans from local banks.
He severely criticised a private electronic media group accusing them of distorting facts and violating media ethics to discredit him and his government. Why are they attacking me. Are they attacking me because I was able to reduce the cost by Rs. 25 Billion. Are they hurt by this achievement,  the Premier asked in parliament. He challenged the private media organisation to carry his statement in full.
We are proceeding with this project to benefit the public. The peoples representatives from the area, including ministers Sarath Amunugama, Lakshman Kiriella and Rauff Hakeem are aware of this reality. There are business tycoons who want to deprive the public of these benefits, he stressed.
There are some elements who act as agents of foreign companies.Some do it openly while others do it behind the scene. For agents like that, a reduction of Rs. 25 billion is a colossal loss to them. Everyone should understand that using their media strength to advance hidden business agendas is unethical, the Prime Minister added. The Prime Minister explained that only Japanese companies could bid because the project was funded by Japan. Responding favourably to a request by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, the Prime Minister also agreed to a parliamentary debate on the project.
The Prime Minister also noted that the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank had informed the Sri Lankan government that the country could not expect concessionary funding after 2019. We will have to think about our way forward and how we are going to finance our development projects after that, Wickremesinghe added.

There are 1,258 schools in Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts of the North Western Province and out of them about 650 schools lack drinking water facilities.
Therefore, steps will be taken soon to provide monetary aid to such schools to obtain drinking water. A sum of Rs. 25,000 would be granted to each school with the help of World Bank funds as students suffer due to non-availability of drinking water.
About 45 water bowsers belonging to local bodies within Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts would be utilized to supply drinking water to these schools from this week, said Provincial Education Minister Sandyakumara Rajapakse.

Responding to concerns raised by various entities, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the government has not taken any decision to handover the running of Expressways to private entities.
There has been no decision or measures to hand over the running of Expressways to private entities the Minister said in a statement.
The Minister said that there have been concerns raised by various parties who had alleged that the Ministry was to hand over the running of the Expressways from Kottawa to Godagama on the Southern expressway, and the line from Kottawa to Kadawatha on the Outer Circular Expressway. However, the Minister said that the government is in the process of exploring avenues to administer the Expresways in a more efficient manner.
We are currently looking at using modern technology to ensure the Expressways which fall under the Road Development Authority are more productive and efficient. We are also looking at attracting Foreign Direct Investment in developing the existing Expressways and to invest in new Expressways we intend constructing, he said.

Pakistans Ali seeks to bowl out Amla at cricket World XI
LAHORE Sept 8: Pakistani bowling sensation Hassan Ali said Friday he wants to bowl out South Africa's Hashim Amla when he plays an international before a home crowd for the first time at next week's World XI tour in Lahore.
Ali, 23, the highest wicket-taker at the Champions Trophy which underdogs Pakistan won earlier this year, said he can't wait to take on the star-studded World XI in the three-match Twenty20 series.
It is the highest-profile international fixture to take place in Pakistan since a deadly militant attack eight years ago drove international cricket -- and most other sports -- from the country.
This is my first international match on my home ground in Pakistan. I'm very excited to play in front of my home crowd on my home ground, he told reporters after a practice session at the stadium Friday.
The attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in March 2009, which killed eight people and wounded nine, isolated Pakistan, forcing it to host its home fixtures in neutral venues.
Ali said he was sad about this, but put the international players who are coming for the World XI on notice: especially Amla.
The World XI is a good team, it has very good players, I will try to bowl well to all of them. Especially I would like to out brother Hashim Amla, it would give me more pleasure, he said.
He said he would partner with strike bowler Mohammad Aamir to take as many wickets as possible.
There are partnerships in bowling too just like batting. If one bowler in the pair is being thrashed, the other tries to contain, so there is no competition. He said coaches were working on fitness and his reverse swing at training.
Pakistan is preparing to deploy several thousand security forces in Lahore for the series, scheduled to begin on September 12. - AFP

Sabaragamuwa PC Secretary procures incorrect facts to present in Parliament
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapa yesterday, suggested that Parliament should take action against the Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, for procuring incorrect facts to the Minister to be presented in Parliament.
He made this proposal yesterday when Kegalle District UNP MP Sandith Samarasinghe brought to the notice of Parliament that the Secretary of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had procured some nonequivalent statements along with the Auditor General's report and forwarded it to the Minister to be presented in Parliament.
Sandith Samarasinghe stated that according to the Auditor General's report, the former Sabaragamuwa Provincial Transport Authority Chairman had deployed five buses to transport commuters without route permits and another 19 buses without log entries. He also questioned as to what measures the minister would take in this connection.
Minister Musthapa said that he did know only what the Secretary to the Provincial Council procured for him and he only could inform the matter to the Governor.
When Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that the Minister could at least make his (minister's) Secretary to investigate into the matter, the Minister responding positively, suggested that Parliament could take action against the Secretary to the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, if he had procured incorrect facts to the Minister to be presented to Parliament.

Parliamentarians request Speaker to divulge list of MPs names
Declaration of assets and liabilities:
Many Parliamentarians yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to take measures to divulge the list of names of members who have declared their assets and liabilities,to the media.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that he would act accordingly after taking a list of the Ministers who have declared their assets and liabilities to the Presidents Secretariat as the Ministers have to make their declaration to the President.
The members made their request to the Speaker following the latters statement to the House that a section of the print media had carried a misleading news item on the number of the members who had declared their assets and liabilities.
The Speaker stated that the same news item had misleadingly carried that 219 members had not declared their assets and liabilities for year 2017.
He also said that considerable number of government and opposition Parliamentarians have declared their assets and liabilities. Then, the same news item appeared on some TV channels.
The same paper had carried a correction on September 4. Why are they attacking me Are they attacking me because I was able to reduce the cost by Rs. 25 Billion Are they hurt by this achievement  the Premier asked during his speech.
We are proceeding with this project to benefit the public.The peoples representatives from the area, including Ministers Sarath Amunugama, Lakshman Kiriella and Rauff Hakeem are aware of this reality.There are business tycoons who want to deprive the public of these benefits, he stressed.
There are some elements who act as agents to foreign companies behind the scenes.For agents of that nature, Rs. 25 Billion is a colossal loss. Everyone should understand that using their media strength to advance hidden business agendas is an unethical act, the Prime Minister added.
At this juncture, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the Ministers make their assets and liabilities declaration to the President by handing it over to the Presidential Secretariat.
We cant be blamed despite the fact that we have make our declaration, Minister Jayasekara said. So we request the Chair to reveal a list of the members who have made the declaration.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the Speaker could get a list of the ministers who have made their declarations of assets and liabilities before he reveals the list. He added that the Speaker could do so as the Ministers too are Parliamentarians.
He also said that his party members make a declaration to the Speaker as well as to the Election Commission. It is suitable because when the assets and liabilities of Shirani Bandaranayake was taken up during the previous regime and most of the Ministers had not made their declarations on the assets and liabilities, MP Dissanayake said.
A special lecture was held at the Mahavli Centre to the Ministers on how to make their past declaration on assets and liabilities.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that they too are sensitive to the same issue. We too request the Chair to take a list from the Presidents Secretariat and divulge the list to media. But the issue is with the media personnel who carry such news, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. The media had carried that only nine MPs had made this declaration.
MP Ravi Karunanayake said that the media personnel too have to make their and assets and liabilities.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said that the Chair should reveal a list of the MPs who had made declarations. The President would reveal the list of the Ministers who made the declaration of the assets and liabilities.
At this stage, Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said the Chair could get a list of ministers from the Presidential Secretariat as the Ministers too are MPs and then the list be released to the media. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the Ministers too are MPs and that he would act according to the request of the members.

Prisons Dept fails to respond to RTI request
The Prisons Department has failed to respond to a request under the Right to Information Act seeking information about inmates held in remand prisons.
The anti-corruption nonprofit Transparency International Sri Lanka said it was looking for confirmation from the department of unofficial reports that large numbers of people were being continuously detained in remand prisons for failing to pay bail or being refused bail.
They filed an RTI request with the prison departments information officer on July 13.
But a spokesman for the organisation said they have heard nothing from the agency since. That is longer than the 14-day window required by law.
In response, Nadim Majeed, an advocacy consultant with Transparency International, said his organisation filed an appeal with the department on Friday.
Were looking for their answer, he said. This is a significant story, with implications on the whole prison system.
If the department continues not to respond to the request, its officers could face judicial proceedings in front of the countrys RTI Commission.

According to M. G. S. K. Melegoda, who is a former ANCL newspaper agent in Matuwagala, says his precious collection of lozenges contained in 72 small-sized bottles, was presented to him by his father prior to his death.
My father was a grocer and these lozenges were presented to him by a friend who was a lozenges dealer prior to World War II, Melegoda said.
He added that several lozenges and toffee manufacturers had offered him large sums of money for his precious collection, but he had refused to sell them.
My father preserved this collection for us. So, it is my duty to protect this for our future generations," he said.

Rs. 13,000m spent for improvement of rural infrastructure: Minister Musthapha
Vast development in rural infrastructure has been initiated by the North East Local Services Improvement Project (NELSIP) whichhad been implemented by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. But so far, no publicity had been given to these development projects. Accordingly, we could reestablish the activities of the civil society in the North East areas which had declined due to the 30 year long war.
The main aim has been to improve the services rendered by local Authorities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, in an accountable and responsive manner. Through these implementations, the keen intention was to clear the mindset of the community.
Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha said so, addressing the gathering at a progress review meeting of the NELSIP which was held recently. This meeting was held at the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and all heads of the Local Authorities in Northern and Eastern provinces attended the meeting. Local Authority heads pointed out that finances of the underprivileged Local Authorities have improved due to the funds allocated by these projects. (NELSIP)
The amount invested in 101 Local Authorities in the North Eastern, North Central, North Western and Uva Provinces was Rs. 13,000 million. 1190 development projects have been completed. This includes rural roads of 852 km, 140 markets and fairs, 14 water supply projects, 74 parks and play grounds and 36 multi-functional buildings.
The projects was funded by the World Bank and the Australian Government. New programmes such as Divisional Audit Committees, Village Planning Committees and Village Development Plans were introduced. These newly introduced programmes would be extended to other Local Authorities too, According to a press release.

A salutary verdict
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge is the first high profile figure under the Rajapaksa regime to suffer punishment for the abuse of office, in this instance for misappropriating public funds. He, together with former Telecommunication Regulatory Commission Director General Anusha Palpita, were each sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment. In addition, the duo were separately fined Rs. 2 million and each ordered to pay Rs. 50 million to the TRC. Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga found both guilty for misappropriating Rs. 600 million belonging to the TRC, which was used to purchase sil redi, for distribution among temples island-wide, on the eve of the last Presidential Election.
Delivering the order, the judge observed that the public servants tendency towards illegal activities, under the political culture that prevailed at that time, was obvious, in obtaining Rs. 600 million from the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, without the approval of the Board of Directors, to distribute sil redi, giving it priority, though it was not an urgent need, clearly indicating the dishonesty of the accused. The judge also added that the accused failed to justify the circumstances that led to the distribution of the sil redi during the election campaign, with funds allocated as a matter of priority and that distribution of this material should have been suspended during the election campaign, even if it had been a routine activity.
In mitigation, counsel for both accused claimed that they did not personally benefit by even a single cent from the transaction, which apparently failed to impress the judge, who, in essence, declared that it was an election bribe at the expense of the public.
The predicament of the one time highest ranking public official in the country, who was no less than the Secretary to the all powerful Executive President, hopefully will act as a deterrent to all public officers, against carrying out illegal orders, issued by their superiors. We say this because there is already a campaign that is being carried out by the pro-Rajapaksa media that the fate of the Weeratunge-Palpita duo will hold back public officials from even executing their legitimate duties, which will affect the smooth functioning of the government machinery. These elements claim that a public official will now think twice before placing his signature on any document, fearing the consequence that may visit him in the event of a change of regime.
However, in our book, public officials are not obliged to carryout illegal orders from a minister or political panjandrum and has only to perform his duties true to his conscience. There were public officials in the past who refused to carry out orders against their conscience, and, while, some suffered dire consequences, there were still others who gained the respect of the authority who issued such orders. One recalls an instant where, a recently deceased police officer, refused to carry out an order of a once powerful politician from the south. When the politician came to the station to inquire as to why, he was promptly shown the door by this highly respected police officer. One also recalls an instance where former SSP Nihal Karunratne, head of security of ex-President Chandrika Kumaratunga, exerting pressure on the then OIC Peliyagoda, Inspector Samudrajeewa to release the notorious criminal Beddegane Sanjeewa, but drew a blank at the other end. These are just two illustrations to indicate the calibre of public officials we had in our midst, who refused to toe the line of the authorities.
One cannot wash his/her hands of wrongdoing by saying he/she was only carrying out orders, or, in the alternative, he/she would have been thrown out of his/her job. This is an all too easy excuse to wriggle out of responsibility. Equally if, one knowingly executed an illegal order he/she should face the consequences. In the Nuremberg trial, all those who carried out Hitler's orders to massacre innocents were executed. In the Ali Bhutto murder trial, the soldiers who allegedly carried out Bhutto's orders to assassinate a political opponent suffered the same fate.
An attempt is being made by the JO to throw dust in the eyes of the public vis-a-vis the punishment of two powerful officials under the Rajapaksa regime. Rajapaksa himself says that the duo has been made to suffer for the assistance they rendered to Buddhist affairs Bauddha katayuththakata sambandha wunu nisa, in a clear attempt at obfuscation, when the sil redi was distributed as an election bribe on the eve of the Presidential Election. Why wasn't this Bauddha katayuththa carried out at another time during his 10 year tenure as President. An attempt is also been made to compare the Rs. 600 million with the astronomical sum involved in the Bond scam. Those making the comparison has failed to realise that the Bond scam is being priced open under a government in power, with State Counsel of the Attorney General's Department going to the extent of naming and shaming powerful ministers, while the sil redi episode would certainly have not come to light had Rajapaksa won a third term.

Second phase of drought relief distribution in Anuradhapura delayed
Drought affected families in the Anuradhapura district complain that they have not received second quota of the free dry food ration still. A few weeks ago 157,593 families received first portion of the ration to the value of Rs. 2,500 each.
The Disaster Management Ministry reportedly had postponed delivering the food rations saying that recipients in 22 Divisional Secretaries have to be rechecked for their eligibility to receive the second portion.
Anuradhapura District Secretariat sources said 157,503 families selected for the relief but that number has been reduced to 138,000 on the grounds that they had not taken part in social work at drought relief work sites as directed by the authorities. The sources said reports in this regard were already submitted to the Ministry and the second phase would commence on September 15.
The Acting Government Agent said distributing drinking water through bowers had been slowed down since the drought affected areas were now receiving rains. Earlier 28,000 families were supplied drinking water and now only 17,000 families receive water from the bowsers. Thambuttegama and Thirappane are not supplied water from bowers at present.

Some thoughts on 20th Amendment
Speaking recently, at an internal meeting President Maithripala Sirisena asked those present to brace themselves for the Local Government and Provincial Council elections, it is learnt. However the President has told the meeting that though the government had come up with the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to postpone the Provincial Council elections due this year, it all comes down to the determination by the Supreme Court.
Large number of cases has been filed against the undemocratic suggestions included in the amendment. Still he said the party should be ready and waiting for elections to both the local authorities and the provincial councils to be called at any time.
In the mean time PM assured that everything will be resolved democratically. The government will hold elections to the nine provincial councils before the end of 2018 by re-wording the 20th Amendment which was rejected by several provincial councils, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said. That means government is prepared to revise the 20th Amendment proposal.
We are ready to introduce a fresh clause to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution compelling the government to hold the Provincial Council elections before the end of next year, the Prime Minister has said. He has added The 20A was prepared to ensure that elections to the nine PCs will be held under the mixed electoral system on a single day prior to the end of 2018.
Constitutional Amendments
When the proposal for 20th Amendment to the Constitution was revealed, Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran said after studying that there was no possibility of them supporting the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution in that form.
The Chief Minister expressed these views at a meeting held at the Provincial Council Complex in Kaithady, Jaffna. He said even at that stage that the government was attempting to take over the powers of the Provincial Councils and hand it over to Parliament by the Constitutional Amendments. Therefore it is necessary to consult the people of the Tamil homeland. Therefore he demanded that the people and the legislators of the province should be consulted when drafting the document. He was supported by the Chairman of the Council C. V. K. Sivagnanam, latter made arrangements to summon the Councillors as soon as possible to discuss and to make a decision regarding the draft.
Western Provincial Council (WPC) also protested about the ill effect of 20 Amendment and postponed the debate and the vote on the draft bill on the 20th Amendment several times under protest.
North and South PCs
The Governor had pleaded the Council to convey its decision on the draft Bill before September 12. However, Chief Minister Insure Desapriya said more amendments are to be included in the Bill and therefore, the debate should be postponed till the amendments were finalized. The postponement was approved by 77 councillors while five members objected to it. Two members did not vote.
Above mentioned conflicts in both North and South PCs show that new solidarity has come among all PC members to defend the devolution and the powers given to them. Almost all are for autonomy and the chauvinist rivalry has gone out of the window. It is pleasant to see Wigneswaran and Isuru fighting together, for more autonomy.
Lankan Provincial Councils are legislative bodies of the nine Provinces established by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. In accordance with that, the provincial councils have legislative power over a variety of matters including agriculture, education, health, housing, local government, planning, road transport and social services. The constitution also gives it powers over police and land but successive central governments have refused to devolve these powers to the provinces. Even though on November 14, 1987 the Lankan Parliament passed the 13th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution and on February 3, 1988 nine provincial councils were created by order, the elections were not held on the same day. The first elections for provincial councils took place on April 28, 1988 in North Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva Provinces. On June 2, 1988 elections were held for provincial councils for Central, Southern and Western provinces. However present Yahapalana government has decided to hold all Provincial Council elections on the same day due to basically economic and financial reasons. Hence an amendment to the constitution has been proposed.
Democratic activities
The proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution seeks to amend the law relating to elections to the provincial councils to ensure that these are held on a single day and not on an ad hoc basis. If the proposal is only for this time, as a tentative requirement then it may not create a problem of altering the autonomy of the provincial councils, but it is not. The government has explained that this would lead to a reduction in the costs of elections and give more stability to governance.
The economic argument can only be tentative, otherwise no democracy could function as all democratic activities are very costly. The stability argument is also inherently dictatorial as it is against very devolution. While the government is entitle to express these views as short term suggestions these are against fundamentals of devolution. Many organisations in addition to TNA have opposed this proposal and pointed to the disturbing elements within these proposals. Democratic movements have been demanding that the police and land powers should be given to the provincial councils. Though Ranil agreed to this demand, Maithri has not committed still, and discussion is going on within the SLFP.
In that scenario this amendment has created a substantial disturbance within the Yahapalanaya. The proposed law if enacted will create a problem to those provincial councils whose terms of office lapse early. Three Provincial Councils have their terms ending by October of this year. Some other provincial council, on the other hand, will have their terms continue until 2019.
The proposed law if enforced, vests the power to administer provincial councils whose terms have ended, with the central authorities until such time as elections are held. Latter is unacceptable as it is again departure from the fundamentals of devolution and autonomy.
The design of the provincial councils was a result of the quest for a political solution to the Tamil national problem and was meant to ensure political autonomy and self rule on a limited basis to the provinces. The provincial council system was originally established in 1987 to deal with the escalating war against the Tamil liberation struggle led by the LTTE. The anti-terrorist Tamil national parties have sought to utilize it to as a building block to progress to a greater sharing of power while functioning within the existing unitary constitutional framework.
In this context, tampering with the provincial councils, by postponing the elections to them, and by further reducing their devolved powers even temporarily, should be opposed and pressed with mass actions.
On the other hand the provision in the 20th Amendment to vest governance of a provincial council whose term has ended in the central authorities if implemented becomes a violation of the basic principle of devolution of power. However the government will hold elections to the nine provincial councils before the end of 2018 by re-wording the 20th Amendment which was rejected by several provincial councils, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said recently. So we have to wait and see.

Stephens ousts Venus, to face Keys for US Open title
New York: Americans Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys, both struggling with serious injuries just three months ago, advanced to their first Grand Slam final at the US Open on Thursday.
Stephens, who missed 11 months with a left foot injury before returning in July, outlasted seven-time Slam champion Venus Williams 6-1, 0-6, 7-5.
"I'm super happy to be in a Grand Slam final," Stephens said. "To do it here, my home slam, is obviously more special. I think this is what every player dreams about."
US 15th seed Keys, who had left wrist surgery for the second time in 10 months after a first-round French Open exit, routed US 20th seed CoCo Vandeweghe 6-1, 6-2 in 66 minutes to complete the first all-American US Open final since Serena Williams beat sister Venus in 2002.
"It still doesn't feel real. I'm still shaking," Keys said. "I played pretty well.
There's a lot of things in my head right now so I'm struggling to come up with words.
"I knew I had to rise to the occasion. I'm just happy to be in the final."
The friends and Fed Cup teammates will meet Saturday at Arthur Ashe Stadium in the biggest match of either's career for a top prize of $3.7 million (3.07 million euros).
"I've known her for a long time. She's one of my closest friends on tour," Stephens said. "I love her to death. And it's not easy playing a friend."
Stephens, who was wearing a walking boot in June and ranked 957th in July, has won 14 of her past 16 matches, with semi-final runs at Toronto and Cincinnati.
"I have no words to describe what I'm feeling, what it took to get here, the journey I've been on," Stephens said.
"It's incredible. I don't know how I got here. Your guess is as good as mine. Just hard work. That's it."
Stephens beat Keys in the second round at Miami in 2015 in their only career meeting.
"Sloane is a new person right now," Keys said. "She's so excited to be out on the court again. I'm excited we get to play each other in the US Open final."
Stephens needed a thrilling break at love in the penultimate game and closing hold of serve to deny two-time champion Williams her first US Open final in 15 years.
"I just worked my tail off and tried to run every ball down and here we are," Stephens said. "It required a lot of fight and a lot of grit."
Now 83rd, Stephens is the lowest-ranked Slam finalist since unranked Justine Henin at the 2010 Australian Open and the lowest at the US Open since unranked Kim Clijsters won the 2009 title.
Stephens, who beat Williams in the first round of the 2015 French Open in their only prior meeting, will jump into the world top 25 next week with the victory.
US ninth seed Williams could not overcome 51 unforced errors that doomed her bid to become the oldest women's singles finalist in US Open history at age 37.
"It was definitely well competed," Williams said. "In the end she won more points than I did and that's what it added up to.
"Just made so many errors at the end there... I wasn't playing well. Just wasn't playing well."
Williams will return to the top five in Monday's world rankings for the first time since 2011, the year she was diagnosed with strength-sapping Sjogren's Syndrome.
Stephens, 24, is 4-0 in WTA finals, having won titles in 2015 at Washington and last year in Auckland, Acapulco and Charleston.
The only cautionary note for Keys, 22, was a medical timeout to have her right leg taped three games from the end. "I definitely started to feel it," she said. "I felt if I went too far it might be something more."
It was the first all-American US Open women's semi-finals since 1981 and the first at any Slam since Wimbledon in 1985.
On Friday, the men return to Arthur Ashe Stadium with 15-time Slam champion Rafael Nadal, the world number one, seeking his fourth trip to the New York finals against 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro, the 24th seed from Argentina.

Stop genocide against Muslims in Myanmar: EP
The Eastern Provincial (EP) Council unanimously passed a proposal brought by its Opposition Leader M.S.Uthumalebbe urging the Sri Lankan Government to take steps to stop the genocide of Muslims in Myanmar by drawing the attention of organisation like the UN towards the massacre.
He brought the proposal at the 83rd Council meeting held on Thursday in Trincomalee.
"The Sri Lankan Government has to urge the United Nations and the Government of Myanmar to stop killing Muslims in Myanmar," Uthumalebbe said.
"The Myanmar Army kill innocent children and women.
They are not allowed to settle in Bangladesh. All the countries witness the genocide taking place in Mynmar at present, but no one take any action to stop the mayhem," Uthumalebbe said. "UN has many branches to address humanitarian issues in other countries. They sent relief and support teams when a country faces disasters.
But they do not say a word against the genocide of Muslims," Uthumalebbe said.

Teacher shortage affects provincial education very much: NCP CM
Lack of teachers affects provincial education very much. I am doing my best to provide a permanent solution to this shortcoming. When I was appointed NCP Chief Minister, the province lacked over 5,000 teachers. I recruited 1,800 teachers. A member objected my action and even filed a case against me, North Central Province (NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara said.
He was addressing the gathering after opening a new building for the Kekiwara, Galkiriyagama Primary School constructed at a cost of Rs. 5 million.
The Chief Minister said he was not feared of mudslinging, lawsuits and newspaper criticism. He said he performs his duties towards the people at any cost. The Chief Minister said a solution was not provided in the past to the teacher shortage in the NCP where 300,000 students from poor farmer families seek education.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena took steps to allocate Rs. 7,000 million recently to develop the provincial education.
"The Principal of the Galkiriyama Primary School carried out a commendable service by completing development work worth Rs 3 million with Rs. 5 lakh that PC granted to the school under 'Pasan Thakshilawa' programme," he said.

Jonathan Trott (74) battled hard, but Tim Groenewald's 3-34 and two late wickets from Dom Bess left Warwickshire on 172-6, needing 230 runs to win.
Lancashire added valuable lower-order runs to post 290 all out against Essex before reducing the Division One leaders to 115-4 at Old Trafford.
Jamie Porter (5-73) completed a five-wicket haul by removing Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed (88), who added only three to his overnight score. Tom Bailey (34 not out) and Kyle Jarvis (26) put on 57 for the 10th wicket.
With bad weather also preventing any play on day one, a draw looks the most likely result between the two Championship title challengers. Unbeaten Essex began the match 36 points clear of second-placed Lancashire, with both teams having three more matches to play this season.
Surrey will take a slender lead of 45 runs into the final day after Gareth Berg led a Hampshire counter-attack.
Beginning day three on 129-7, Hampshire made 290 - a first-innings lead of 90 - with runs from Berg (80), Ian Holland (51) and Kyle Abbott (37 not out).Liam Dawson (2-24) continued his good bowling form to reduce Surrey to 51-3.
Bad light and rain limited Yorkshire and Middlesex to only 45 overs of play on day three as their Division One game at Headingley headed for a draw. Resuming on 317-7, Yorkshire secured a fourth batting bonus point before being bowled out for 358.
Middlesex openers Sam Robson (47) and Nick Compton (42) put on 73 for the first wicket of their reply. But Ryan Sidebottom took three wickets to leave the visitors on 108-3 when play was abandoned.
Unbeaten Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire are on the verge of defeat by fellow promotion contenders Worcestershire at Trent Bridge. The visitors ended day three on 123-2 in pursuit of 226 for victory and need 103 more runs with eight wickets left.
Veteran captain Read received a guard of honour from the Worcestershire players as he entered the field for his final innings at Trent Bridge before he retires at the end of the season.
Liam Norwell took five wickets to keep Gloucestershire on course for victory at Leicestershire before bad light stopped play at Grace Road. Gloucestershire added 150 runs to their overnight total of 218-3 before being bowled out shortly after lunch. The hosts continued to struggle as they closed on 154-7 when play was abandoned, a lead of eight runs.
Tom Latham and Graham Clark extended Durham's lead to 156 runs before rain stopped play against Kent on day three. Latham (64 not out) and Clark (49 not out) moved the score onto 145-2 without losing a wicket in a important 106-run partnership for the hosts. But rain and bad light stalled the progress of Paul Collingwood's side as only 28 overs were bowled in the day.
Sussex's batsmen staged a late fightback to maintain hope of salvaging their Division Two game against Northamptonshire at the County Ground.
Sussex started on 34-1 after being made to follow on, trailing by 220 runs. Angus Robson (72) and Chris Nash (66) frustrated Northants, but their side were in trouble at 246-8. Jofra Archer (74 not out) and David Wiese (61) gave Sussex some hope by the close, with an aggressive 127-run stand taking them to 382-9.
Derbyshire were restricted to 236-9 against Glamorgan as their Championship match finally got under way after two blank days. Lukas Carey was the pick of the visitors attack with 3-49, despite three dropped catches off his bowling.

Water bills of Samurdhi recipients will not be increased: Hakeem
"Water bills of Samudhi recipients will not be increased. The revision of tariff for the first 15 units will be minimum," Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday. He said the present tariff of water has a issue and the Government should take a decision on that.
He said a date was not given to add revisions to water bills.
Minister Hakeem pointed out that the customer pays only one fourth of the total expenditure of producing one unit of water and pipe-borne water is provided for 47.7 percent of the people in the country. :It will increase by 60 or 65 percent in the next three years," he said.
"Supermarkets charge Rs 60 for a bottle of water but the Water Board charges only Rs. 12 for 1,000 litres of purified drinking water.
The Board expects to produce bottled drinking water in future, he said.
