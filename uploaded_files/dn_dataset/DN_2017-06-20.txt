I am a complicated person
Aadhi is returning to Tamil cinema after two years with Maragatha Naanayam and among the first things he says about the film is that its not hero-centric.
The film appealed more to the moviegoer in me, says Aadhi. The story revolves around five characters.
The film will see him team up again with Nikki Galrani with whom he paired up in his last Tamil outing, Yagavarayinum Naa Kaakka.
Ive been part of films where, after diplomatically exchanging pleasantaries, the heroine goes into her caravan, but Nikki is a lot of fun. She and I chat a lot on the sets. My comfort with her creates a certain energy in the scenes we do. The film is releasing in both Tamil and Telugu, and has garnered good buzz ahead of its release. Its all because of the audio launch which we organised sooner than usual, he says.
While there are heroines who effortlessly balance work in both Tamil and Telugu cinema, there arent too many heroes like Aadhi.
He smiles, and says, I think scripts are of two types: heart-driven and mind-driven. The latter results in commercial films. The former is where the filmmaker tries to make a difference to cinema. The Tamil and Telugu industries have filmmakers in both categories, but in Telugu cinema, the budget is bigger and piracy isnt really an issue. Im glad Im relevant in both.
Aadhis connections with cinema go a long way. His father, Ravi Raja Pinisetty, is a well-renowned director who has done more than 50 films. His brother, Sathya Prabhas Pinisetty, is also a director. So, theres no dearth for advice.
Though I go with my gut feeling about scripts, Id be a fool not to use my dads experience, he says. Thats why he thinks hes able to figure out the good roles from the bad.
I have a knack for finding negative roles especially, like the one I did in Allu Arjuns Sarrainodu. It was a character who was willing to do anything to protect the image of his family. Its not like I played an alcoholic or a womaniser. In fact, Ill be doing a similar role in Pawan Kalyans next film too, says Aadhi, who has been getting bombarded with negative roles ever since he made his debut in Tamil cinema with Mirugam.
But the actor isnt in a hurry to do films. Im complicated that way (laughs). To me, its all about doing what Im happy with. With Tamil audiences being more open to innovative content than they ever have been, Im now planning to do more films.

## Title: If injury can be kept at bay

If injury can be kept at bay
Injury is one of the commonest causes of morbidity and mortality in the ages between 15 to 44 years. In Sri Lanka, injuries (particularly, due to motor vehicle accidents) rank as the 11th commonest cause of death. The loss of young and economically active members of society has resulted in lost productivity at work as well as high societal cost in terms of consumption of medical services.
Apart from strengthening the clinical management of these injuries, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, recently highlighted the importance of injury prevention and control as one of the multipronged approaches in dealing with this emerging trend.
To tackle the problem, the Minister said that a National Policy and strategic framework on injury prevention and management will be introduced soon. However, on August 3, 2010, the Ministry of Health under the previous Government also released a similar National policy. It is not clear whether the present Government is going to adapt that policy (with or without revisions), or generate completely a new one taking into consideration todays scenario.
There is no credible information that the 2010-policy was activated. If it had been implanted with a genuine cross sectoral involvement and whole-hearted coin an adequately resourced whole of government commitment to implementing that policy, by now, it would have created a big impact on the population level indicators of injury.
National policy
This article is written on the assumption that a new policy would be forthcoming. In such a scenario, this writer wishes to present few broad measures to be undertaken in creating an effective platform for the reduction of the burden of injury in Sri Lanka.
According to the Health Ministry sources, every year nearly a million people are treated for injuries in emergency departments and majority of them require long-term hospitalization. The unintentional injuries and related deaths in the last 20 years have been increasing year after year, yet the resources directed at reducing injury were not commensurate with the burden it posed to the society.
There are number of reasons for this tragic situation. Most prominent among them are unsafe conditions at home, road and workplace, lack of access to high-quality treatment and rehabilitation services, limited stakeholder involvement, inadequate allocation of resources and an absence of performance measures.
Public health model
Any framework for reducing injuries should be based on the public health model  a model that is used for preventing many other diseases. The public health approach includes identifying the magnitude of the problem through surveillance and data collection, identifying risk and protective factors, and, on the basis of this information, developing, implementing, and evaluating interventions, and promoting widespread adoption of evidence-based practices and policies.
Interventions can be implemented during various time frames before, during, or after an adverse event. For example, safety latches on medicine cabinets provide protection before an injury event, child safety seats minimize injury during the injury-causing event, and effective emergency response speeds treatment and improves outcomes after an injury event has occurred.
The intended policy should lay out a vision to guide actions that are pivotal in reducing the burden of injuries in Sri Lanka. These guidelines should be relevant to all those with an interest in citizens health and safety, including, local government bodies, philanthropies, businesses and NGOs, schools, educators and private health care providers and policymakers.
Focus
The plan also should help align priorities, to capitalize on existing strengths, to fill gaps, and to spark action across the nation. Such action will result in measurable reductions in death and disability, and diminish the financial and emotional burden of childhood injuries in families and society. Needless to say, this outcome can only be realized if all relevant stakeholders act on the plan.
The priority focus of the policy needs to be on actions that would influence (1) those injuries that are most burdensome to society, (2) those for which there are feasible evidence-based interventions, (3) those for which outcomes can be most easily measured, and (4) those for which partners and stakeholders are likely available. Such injuries include, motor vehicle-injuries, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, burns, falls etc.,
Six fields
According to this writers opinion, the Policy could be structured across six fields, which eventually becomes a blueprint for action. Each field may consist of three to five objectives. The actions recommended in each objective lay out broad areas for improvement.
Data and surveillance
Systematic surveillance is essential for accurate needs assessment. Only with good data can one estimate the relative magnitude of problems in order to set priorities. Current data collection systems in our health sector are imperfect and incomplete. Better data can lead to better decisions, increased effectiveness (doing what works) and efficiency (avoiding waste).
We should have better data standardization, (so that it is comparable across geography and time), better data quality, (so that it is reliable and believable), and filling gaps, (information about circumstances of injury events, outcomes, costs, and other information). Information systems must allow for making existing data more available to those who can use and share it to design and implement interventions.
Some of the actions include developing an online access to key databases, collecting better data on the costs of injury, improving links between police, hospital, and emergency department data, and standardizing data collection and reporting.
Research
Effective research to improve the prevention efforts is needed at three different levels: (1) foundational research (how injuries occur), (2) evaluative research (what works and what doesnt work to prevent injuries), and (3) translational research (how to put proven injury prevention strategies into action throughout the nation).
Because research is a shared public, academic, and private endeavour, better coordination of research efforts will minimize waste and maximize return.
Research can also help reduce health disparities through better understanding of the relationship between injuries and factors such as socio-economic status, demographics, race and ethnicity.
Some of the actions should include creating a national injury research agenda, developing a national clearinghouse of injury research, identifying key indicators related to injury disparity, and increasing the number of injury researchers through training grants.
Communication
Raising awareness about injuries is important at multiple levels. It can often trigger action, or support policies intended to reduce injuries. Better communication will better inform the actions by policy makers (enacting legislation), organisations (approaching injury prevention in a coordinated way), and by families (implementing evidence-based injury prevention strategies at home, on the road, on the playground, and in the community).
A balanced, coordinated communication strategy must be culturally appropriate, and use both traditional and innovative channels ranging from public relations campaigns to social media.
Various strategies can be used to deliver health messages to specific audiences. Some of the actions include creating and implementing local and national campaigns on safety, establishing web-based communications tool kits, finding local young people to be spokespersons for prevention, and using local businesses to support communication efforts to employees and their families.
Education and training
Education and training is a cross-cutting strategy that can impact other facets of injury prevention. While some overlap between communications and education exists, education is considered here in a more formal context, with the intention to motivate change.
Training specifically refers to the acquisition and use of skills. Education and training in injury prevention can benefit patients, health care providers, public safety officials, and other professionals such as engineers, architects, journalists, teachers, and scientists.
Education and training are intertwined because educators need to not only be deeply familiar with the topic they are teaching, but they need to know how best to transfer that information to the client (skill training). Identifying educational gaps and developing training capacity are current challenges.
We need to integrate injury prevention education into broader educational programs, develop effective educational materials, cataloguing and sharing what works (best practices) with others, and paying attention to educational needs and gaps at all levels from primary education to professional continuing education.
The use of community based organisations to deliver education and training are also important to make educational opportunities more accessible to public health practitioners.
Health systems and health care
Health care providers (both public and private) treat injuries, but they are also partners in prevention through health care systems. While responding to and treating trauma, health care providers are critical for accurately documenting external causes of injuries and circumstances.
Beyond the clinical setting, health care providers are credible advocates for safety and can facilitate change in communities and families. Health care systems can address injury by providing anticipatory guidance to health care providers and collecting clinical data.
Trends and changes to health care delivery models, including adoption of electronic medical records and quality improvement efforts should all be utilized to augment injury reduction goals and objectives by improving data collection. Best practices for delivery of preventive services should be identified and disseminated. Furthermore, opportunities exist for new technologies and information systems to improve injury outcomes.
Information systems can equip providers with evidence-based data to strengthen the quality of clinical decision-making and improve trauma care.

India beat Pakistan in field hockey
LONDON, Sunday: India may well have suffered a 180-rout at the hands of Pakistan in the Champions Trophy cricket final but they came out on tops on the other side of London -- in field hockey.
India ran out 7-1 winners over their old rivals in a World Hockey League fixture at Lee Valley in east London just as Virat Kohli's cricketers were enduring defeat at the Oval in the south of the city, 10 miles (15.7km) away.
Harmanpreet Singh fired home the first goal for India with a double from Talwinder Singh taking the score to 3-0 at half time.
Harmanpreet made it 4-0 early in the third quarter before Akashdeep Singh and Pardeep Mor chipped in.
Shortly after Pakistans Muhammad Umar Bhutta netted a consolation goal, India completed the scoring through Akashdeep Singh, who claimed his second of the match.
I thought Pakistan were the better team in the first quarter and they created more opportunities but after we scored the first goal we started to play according to our plan, said India coach Roelant Oltmans.
We scored some great goals and when we score the type of goals that we did today, that is what makes a coach happy.

Interdicted public officials will not be allowed to get off scot-free

No public official interdicted for alleged misappropriation of public or State property will be allowed to go scot-free, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and the State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The law will be implemented to the letter them. Not only will they be sent to jail but action will be taken to forfeit all the robbed state property, he said.
The Minister said that under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, nobody would be able to steal public property.
Allegations have been leveled against the government by various groups that claim the government has failed to take action against those who committed crimes and corruption during the previous regime.
Investigations are currently on-going with regard to the alleged crimes and corruptions. But the government cannot intervene with the legal procedure. True facts with respect of the CBSL bond scam issue have now been revealed, the State Minister said.
The good governance government was not formed to safeguard thieves, he further reiterated.

iPad Pro 2017 models outperform MacBook Pro models
Apple's new iPad Pro models are as capable as the refreshed MacBook Pro models, matching, and even surpassing the laptops in certain benchmarks. Bare Feats, a benchmarking blog, posted some CPU and GPU test results that pitted the 2017 MacBook Pro models against the new iPad Pro 12.9 inch and 10.5-inch models.
The devices were tested with a series of benchmark tests like GeekBench and GFXBench giving an idea about the CPU and GPU performance of the new iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models. The tests also included older 2016 MacBook Pro and iPad Pro models to get a better idea about the improvements that the new hardware brings to the hotel.
In terms of GPU performance, the new iPad Pro models outperform the MacBook Pro (2016 and 2017) models in Geekbench 4 Compute Metal test. The test results showed the 10.5-inch iPad Pro model scoring 27,814, and was closely followed by 12.9-inch iPad Pro which scored 27,597. MacBook Pro 2016 and 2017 models came third and fourth with a score of 27,631 and 26,353 respectively.
In the single-core GeekBench 4 tests, the all-new MacBook Pro 13-inch was seen scoring 4,650, which outperformed the new iPad Pro models which scored around 4,000 mark. Though, the test also saw that the 12.9-inch and 10.5-inch iPad Pro models scores were on par with the older MacBook Pro models.
In the multi-core CPU tests, the 2017 MacBook Pro models yet again outperformed all the iPad Pro models with a stunning score of 10,261. The new iPad Pro models, however, beat the 2016 MacBook Pro models, which can be seen as a big improvement for the tablets.
The benchmark scores may indicate that the new iPad Pro models can match CPU and GPU performance of MacBook Pro though we want to stress that these scores aren't indicative of real-world usage usage.
To recall, Apple refreshed the 12.9-inch iPad Pro model at the WWDC 2017, and also launched the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. The company also refreshed the entire MacBook lineup, including a new 13-Inch MacBook Pro configuration. (Gadgets)

Ireland eye end to long wait for Test status
Belfast: They have beaten West Indies, England and Pakistan and now Cricket Ireland are targetting London on Thursday when they expect to be given Test match status by the International Cricket Council.
In February, the ICC agreed in principle that this weeks meeting in London had the potential to include additional Full Members (Ireland and Afghanistan subject to both meeting Membership criteria).
Cricket Ireland understand there have been no hiccups since and they stand ready to take their place alongside the games established powers.
It is all a far cry from the years when the highlight of Irelands season was the visit for a one-off match by the touring Test team to England or, in alternate years, a two-day game at Lords against MCC, invariably made up of Minor County players.
The old Irish Cricket Union was founded in 1855 Phoenix Cricket Club, founded 25 years earlier, is one of the oldest in the British Isles but it was not until more than a century later that the Ireland team first made the rest of the cricket world take notice.
On July 2 1969, Ireland dismissed the West Indies for just 25 at Sion Mills in a match recorded for all time by television. It has gone into folklore that the West Indies, who had flown in the night before, after the conclusion of the Lords Test, had immediately availed themselves of some typically generous Irish hospitality.
But whatever the truth of that, they were bundled out in 25.3 remarkable overs.
Ireland knocked off the runs for the loss of one wicket, but with the game over so quickly, the teams agreed to play on and West Indies even had a second innings, reaching a more respectable 78 for four, after Ireland had declared on 125 for eight.
Ireland were admitted to Englands 60-over one-day competition, the Gillette Cup, in 1980 and almost made a dramatic impact, reducing Middlesex to 67 for five when the county replied to Irelands modest 102.
But it was to be another 17 years before Ireland claimed their first victory in the competition, ironically in a home match against Middlesex, when the late South Africa captain Hansie Cronje was Irelands overseas professional. By that stage, Ireland had been given Associate Membership of the ICC and after three failed attempts to qualify for the World Cup, they used home advantage in 2005 to reach the finals in the West Indies in 2007. It took only two matches for them to make their mark on the world stage.
After tying with Zimbabwe in their opening fixture, they turned up on St Patricks Day to see a green pitch at Sabina Park for their match against Pakistan, and a sea of green in the crowd as thousands of Ireland fans took over the ground.
Ireland bowled out the number-four ranked team for 132 and won by seven wickets in what was Bob Woolmers last match as Pakistan coach.
Tragically, the former England batsman was found dead in his hotel room the following morning.
When, three weeks later, Ireland beat Bangladesh in Barbados they joined the ODI rankings table and have been there ever since.
The celebrations back home in Ireland after the Pakistan win were nothing compared to those four years later when England were toppled in Bangalore, the day Kevin OBrien became a world famous name with a 50-ball century - still the fastest ever in a World Cup as Ireland chased down Englands 327. The 2015 World Cup finals saw Ireland claim two more Full Member scalps as Phil Simmons inspired his adopted team against both his native West Indies and then Zimbabwe, each time with totals over 300.
Given all these achievements, its little wonder Ireland feel ready to be put on a level playing field with the other 10 Full Members. AFP

ITAK withdraws petition of no-confidence Wiggie and Sam call it even
The Illankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) has withdrawn the petition of No-Confidence submitted to the Governor, against Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran.
Wigneswaran yesterday ceded to the call of the leader of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and agreed to permit two ministers to continue to work, until the fresh probe is concluded.
The issue which brought the North to a standstill and the TNA almost left in tatters, came to a temporary halt after Wigneswaran agreed to permit Balasubramaniam Deniswaran and Dr. Pathmanathan Sathiyalingam who were to be subjected to a fresh probe, need not go on leave until the inquiry is complete.
There was no punitive action taken against the two Ministers concerned. They are entitled to draw their salary and use their vehicles etc.
It is in order to give protection to the Witnesses that it was said that they should take leave while the Inquiring Committee sat,wrote Wigneswaran to Sampanthan yesterday.
There are new charges too against them. I understand your inability to give guarantees with regard to the conduct of the two Ministers. But I am glad you have undertaken to advise them that they should not impede an independent legal inquiry. It is to ensure the independent legal inquiry and to commit the two Ministers that I designed the formula of taking leave for one month, he further added.
The CM who then agreed to take Sampanthans word that he advised the two ministers not to interfere in any inquiry added that, The two Religious Dignitaries have insisted that the two Ministers must co-operate by not interfering with the course of justice.
On Monday, prominent religious leaders such as Srila Sri Somasundra Thesika Gnana Sambanda Paramachchariyar Swamy Peedathipathy of the Hindu Nallai Aatheenam and Catholic Bishop of Jaffna, Rev. Justin Bernard Gnanapragasam visited Wigneswaran to sort out the issue in an amicable manner.
Furthermore, Selvam Adaikalanathan, Dharmalingam Sidharthan and Suresh Premachandran, wrote the CM, had undertaken last night in the best interests of the Tamils to speak to the Hon Ministers, to make sure they will not interfere with the course of justice nor interfere with nor threaten witnesses nor tamper with evidence etc. In the light of these undertakings, I will not insist on the conditions relating to leave, concluded Wigneswaran.
A corruption probe on all four ministers of the NPC initiated last year had cleared the two ministers Deniswaran and Sathiyalingam while finding the other two; Thambyrajah Gurukularajah and Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan guilty of corruption. Wigenswaran thereafter had insisted that the former two ministers that a new committee would be appointed to investigate the exonerated ministers further. Until such time, he had asked the two ministers to go on compulsory leave.
This stirred 15 members of the ITAK, the main constituent party within the TNA in the NPC, along with five opposition members to submit a Motion of No-Confidence against the CM. Sampanthan who stepped into resolve the crisis had asked that Wigneswaran act in a fair manner and that he could have his investigation but let the two exonerated ministers carry on with their work. Wigneswaran however had asked that Sampanthan give him a written guarantee that the two ministers would not interfere in the probe, to which Sampanthan refused and said he would simply advise them not to do so. As the CM and TNA Leader clashed, cracks within the TNA has become more apparent with minor parties such as TELO, PLOTE, TELO and EPRLF even threatening to sit independently of the TNA within Parliament if the No-Confidence Motion was not withdrawn.
Wigneswarans latest stance however is expected to patch up things within the TNA and have the ITAK withdraw its Motion against the CM.
Jaffna based Academic, Prof S. Ratnajeevan H. Hoole speaking to Daily News however observed that all compromises would be temporary, If it works, it will work for a short time but the differences are basic. The policies of the two groups are incompatible. Some of them are still carrying anger over the old Federal Party Divisions and they want to break the Federal Party, he said. The TNA consisting of the ITAK, PLOTE, TELO and EPRLF, he explained had come together because of an electoral need but there is nothing common thinking to keep them together, added Prof Hoole.
As a consequence, the single largest political group in the North will no longer have one voice represent it in Colombo,
While Sampanthan is negotiating within the extremist groups within the TNA, he is also taking a moderate position and dealing with the government.
He will be weakened by a split and will not be able to negotiate with the government. Many of Sampanthans requests are just but the government is under pressure not to give in as it keeps looking at the Sinhala vote. If there is a break, Sampanthan wont have much to offer in terms of cooperation if Parliament, said Prof.Hoole.
The recent fiasco in the NPC however has also shown the rising popularity of Wigneswaran and his views, His popularity is growing because the government is not delivering on many of their promises. In Jaffna many of the upper class people tend to align with him. While it is mostly the poor who have suffered due to issues over land and disappearances, the government has done little in terms of governance and there are still very few Tamils recruited to government service- these are all problems of the middle and upper middle classes, added Prof Hoole.
He further pointed out that it was mostly doctors, university staff and university students who were supporting the Chief Minister, the loud crowd came from the University, said Prof Hoole.
Wigneswaran had created a serious problem for Sampanthan who brought him into the party and then betrayed him, he said.

Korean culture in focus
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Korea and Sri Lanka this year, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, the National Unification Advisory Council South West Asia Chapter, the Korean Residents Association of Lanka, and the Korean Businessmens Association in Sri Lanka are co-organizing a variety of programs on two separate occasions  in July and November.
One upcoming event is the Korean Cultural Festival 2017 which will be held at the Bishops College Auditorium on July 1. The event is organized in partnership with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Culture Affairs of Sri Lanka, and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.
In recent years, with the growing popularity of the Korean Wave, epitomized by K-Dramas and K-Pop, many Sri Lankans including young people have shown a deep interest in Korean culture and language. Responding to this love for Korean culture, the Embassy has organized the annual Korean Cultural Festival over the last few years. And it has proved to be a successful way to further deepen the friendship and goodwill between Korea and Sri Lanka.
The 2017 Festival consists of two main events: (1) the Quiz-on Korea and (2) the K-Pop World Festival. The Quiz-on Korea (13:30  16:00 on 1 July) is a survival quiz competition where the questions will be on generic topics on Korea, including Korean lifestyle, traditional culture, history and language. The winner will be invited to learn and experience Korea this September, and compete with national representatives from different countries around the world to win the top prize. The K-Pop World Festival (17:00  19:30 on 1 July) is a K-pop performance competition, for which the Embassy has invited talented Sri Lankan vocalists and/or dancers to show their K-pop spirit on stage. Winning team(s) will stand the chance to go to Korea for the final round and compete internationally this September, following a screening process. They will also be able to meet and perform together with K-Pop stars.
The Korea Week will start on the 40th anniversary day (November 14) and go until November 19. During the Korea Week, the following events will take place: cultural performances of Nanta (BMICH, November 14 and 15), the Korean Film Festival 2017 (NFC Theatre, November 17 to 20), the Korean Cultural Experience Event (TBC, November 18), the Korean Language Speech Contest (TBC, November 18), an issuance of commemorative stamps (November 14), a television documentary screening on the diplomatic ties (Rupavahini TV, November 18), and the Korean Ambassadors and Kukkiwon Cup Taekwondo Championship (TBC, November 19).
Meanwhile, celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties, the Korea Navy Cruise Training Task Group is also scheduled to visit Colombo Port (26-29 October).
* NANTA, derived from the traditional Korean instrumental performance Samulnori, is a musical performance gaining popularity worldwide.

Lankan rewinder receives permanent Australian residence
A Sri Lankan immigrant who has been working in Kalgoorlie for nearly six years has won the right to live and work permanently in WA, after a Federal Minister intervened and prevented him being deported.
Electrician Edwin Asariyas, 60, was facing deportation after his application to stay permanently in Australia was rejected last month. It left him unable to work in the country since May 12, having failed at three attempts to become a permanent resident. At the end of his final bridging visa, he was set to be deported on Monday and had to provide proof of his airline tickets to immigration authorities by 4.00 pm, Friday.
That was before he received word about 1.00 pm that Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Alex Hawke had intervened and would grant his permanent residency, three years after the specialist electrical motor rewinder first applied.
Asariyas works for Kalgoorlies Prestige Universal Mining Pumps, where he has worked since arriving in the Goldfields from New Zealand on a 457 Visa in 2011, sponsored by employers Sam and Andy Grigg.
He said he was thrilled to be able to remain with his Goldfields 'family.'
Im very happy and great thanks for Andy and Samthey did a big job. They were involved straight away, Asariyas said. As an employer, to me, he (Andy) is more actually like family. So Im very happy because for another few years, I can work for him, he added.
Grigg said, it would have been impossible to replace Asariyas at the business. It would have been a massive effect on our business because we had chased Edwin for two years before we got him. Rewinders are just about impossible to get and Edwin has been a part of our business nearly six years now, so it would have drastically affected our business.
Id have 10 more of himI dont think Edwins had a sick day since hes been with us. Its the sort of thing that should be promoted, not deported, he added
Federal OConnor MP Rick Wilson and State One Nation Upper House MP Senator Peter Georgiou took up Asariyas case and arranged a meeting with Hawke.
While I support jobs for locals first and foremost, I think this particular case was special being in a regional city and given the fact that Asariyas had spent the past six years of his life in WA, I knew the government needed to take a closer look, Senator Georgiou said.
"I have spoken to Asariyas and his employer and he is a man of high integrity and will be of invaluable service to the local community," he added.
Asariyas wife and two other children still live in Colombo, Sri Lanka, but if he had been sent back, his daughter may not have been able to continue her studies.
His oldest daughter, 23-year-old Ann Quintas Asariyas, studies medical science at Edith Cowan University at a cost to Asariyas of about $26,000 a year.
In Colombo, he estimates his average wage would have been just $2,000 a month.
That came after spending about $20,000 fighting the battle in legal and administrative fees.
Having returned to Sri Lanka for a total of five months in the past six years, Asariyas hopes to start the process of bringing the rest of his family to Australia after his youngest child finishes her exams in August.
My plan is for my family to be accommodated in Perth. I will work here and maybe once a week, twice a week I will see them, that is better than once a year, Asariyas said.
Senator Georgiou intends to meet Asariyas when he visits the Goldfields-Esperance region this month.
A spokesman for Hawke confirmed he had intervened to grant Asariyas the right to stay in WA, but could not comment any further due to privacy reasons.

Mano Ganesan ready to intervene in NPC crisis
National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said he is willing to intervene in finding a solution to the crisis in the Northern Provincial Council by visiting the North if required.
He was speaking to the media after attending a ceremony held to mark the laying of foundations stones for the new market complex in the Hatton town on Sunday.
Ganesan said certain quarters were pointing an accusing finger at the South for the problem which arose in the NPC.
The present crisis in the Council was the result of problems among TNA Council members reaching bursting point. There was no point in accusing the President or the Prime Minister for this situation because they have enough surmounting problems and issues to deal with rather than creating problems in the NPC. Minister Ganesan said in his capacity as the leader of the Tamil Democratic Union, he would request members of the NPC to resolve their problems through discussion and continue the Council work in a peaceful manner. The Provincial Council system was introduced to find solutions to problems in the Northern and Eastern provinces. The duty of the NPC was to handle development work in the North. Kandyan New Villages Development Minister Palani Digambaram who organised the ceremony and Education State Miniser S. Radhakrishnan were also present.

Music takes you to the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself
You can travel into the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself through music, says Nadeeka Guruge. He points out that music is a huge phenomena, and he himself is the promise of this wonder. He is a man who has proved himself in the music industry due to his huge and devoted following in Sri Lanka.
Music has been my way of expression since I was a kid. I was away from my family in a hostel during my young age. Whenever I was homesick I used to whistle the melodies and the songs that my family used to listen to and the songs that we used to sing together. So it was kind of a nostalgic feeling for me, said Guruge.
Music was certainly therapeutic to him.
And I remember that I felt better as I just let the music carry all my sadness away from me. So at the beginning Music was a kind of nostalgic thing which could take me away from real life. As I grew up, I felt that I needed more ways to express myself musically, so I started playing the "Harmonica". Both my father and my elder brother used to play the Harmonica beautifully. And then as my musical thoughts grew bigger I needed to learn to play the Guitar. When I was about 12 years old myself and my elder brother were sent to a piano teacher but fortunately or unfortunately we both never enjoyed the piano lessons, stated Guruge
In the end they both ended up playing guitars.
Traditional Sri Lankan folk music
After my school education I moved to Colombo from Nuwaraeliya and joined legendary Sri Lankan composer maestro Premasiri Kemadasa's choir as a bass singer. Under him and a few other leading Vocal instructors such as Christeen Perera and Ivor Dennis, I studied both western Classical and Sri Lankan Folk Music. After about 2 years I went back to Nuwaraeliya and started researching Sri Lankan folk traditions. In 1999, me and my elder brother Sumudu Guruge produced an album with a Bolivian Folk Musician Marcello Titto Li.
It was a collection of traditional Sri Lankan and Bolivian folk music and applied music. I eventually entered Sri Lankan Sinhala theater and composed music for many stage plays since late '90s. From the theater I moved to television drama and then to cinema. I think its not only music that made me an icon I am now. It is being a social activist and being in many other platforms as well, pointed out Guruge.
Music was for Guruge, a way of getting away from the real life.
But eventually it became the other way around. I started seeing society and people closely, I knew it was not what I saw. I started to express what I saw and experienced in society through a musical context. When I started composing for stage plays, television drama and especially for cinema, I used more musical materials to construct my view. From that point music really became the most essential part of my expression, added Guruge
Love and sexuality
Initially Guruge wrote songs about social inequality and other social issues.
I started as a song writer and a singer. I wrote songs about the love and sexuality in the hidden culture and the surface. One of the earliest songs of mine was called "Romeo Married ( Wedikawe)" it was a good example for my early writings and music. I make it a point to write my own songs, at least I used to. I always believe that I cannot feel life the way that someone else would do. But recently I sang a song called "Lelasiye" written by Chaaminda Rathnasuriya who is a revolutionary Sri Lankan Lyricist of the Millennia. I do a Concert once in every 2 years called "NostalGuitar". You can listen to all my songs at the concert. We are planning on having it on the August 2017, explained Guruge. Guruge has so far produced one album called "Sanyugma/ Encuentro" which was not released officially as the Music producers at that time said that it's not Marketable.
I have written and composed many songs and recorded some of them. My hardcore fans find them and share them with each other. It was a big moment for me when I was awarded the "Best Stage Drama Music" for the first time at the State Drama Festival in late '90 s. Since then I have got the Best Music Award for Stage drama till 2010. Another milestone is my first ever movie score got selected for the most appropriate Category at the UK film awards in 2005. And the movie won "Camera D'or award" in Cannes International Film Festival.
Since then almost all my Movie scores have been awarded or recognized both locally and at International Film Festivals. I remember there was a review in the New York times Magazine one the Movie "Sankara" 2008. They called the Score "Divine Music". I won the OCIC Cygnis award for the score. In 2013 I received most prestigious "BUNKA International" award from Japan for my Contribution to Sri Lankan Cinema, shared Guruge.
Broader dimensions through musical expressions
Guruge tries to explore broader dimensions through musical expressions.
I have written some music for different types of instruments to explore these wider dimensions. Movies are a good platform to work on in that case. In a movie score you have a type of a freedom to bring out the inner soul of the Movie. For example I wrote a String Quartet for a movie called "Swaroopa" by legendary Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja, based on the famous "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka.
Music is the first ever medium that early man expressed feelings with each other. Language came long after. Actually music is the fundamental element of language say the Anthropologists. Music has been in us through our evolution. Rhythm comes with bipedalism. Its really interesting to know that man who lived 30,000 years ago, also showed "Musical Behavior". Anthropologists have identified a part of a flute made out of the bone of a bird in a cave which was inhabited by Homo Neanderthals 30,000 years ago in Slovenia. This shows how much music meant to mankind. Music most importantly is intrapersonal communication.You can travel in to the deepest and the darkest parts in yourself through music, explained Guruge. Music is a huge phenomena. Anyone can express their feelings musically and lyrically.
All over the world there are fans for each and every type of music from classical to metal. In Sri Lanka we shouldn't forget that our contemporary music culture is very young comparatively to Indian and Western music. During the last decades of colonization only the Sri Lankan Elite realized that we no longer have our own Musical identity. It was all gone with the transformation from old feudalism to neo-feudalism. Some went to Europe in search of our musical roots and some went to India in search of elements to create a Sri Lankan Musical tradition. It's a long story, noted Guruge
Different types of audiences
During the 60's and 70's there was a new wave of Sinhala pop music emerging with the direct influence of the "Capital" or the "Producer".
These two streams represented the socio political inner self of the society. By the 90's the semi classical genre was overtaken by the "pop" genre with modern technology. The Millennia marks the emergence of neo modern pop music all over the world. Young musicians and singers even lyricists got under the direct influence from the icloud but still we see a lack of creativity in that genre. But technique wise young musicians got themselves well equipped by the youtube and other sources. It took about one week for us to listen to a song and to pick up a guitar lick on radio back then. But now you can pick a lick in a second on youtube. You can put down the tempo and figure out the exact fingering patterns and the techniques. I see a lot of better guitarists in our generation as a result of that. But again we need more creativity also, clarified Guruge.
Guruge has traveled abroad and displayed his prodigious talent.
It was in 2002 when I first traveled abroad for a Folk Music Festival in Norway called "Furde Music Festival". There I performed with 3 Kenyan Musicians and 3 Norwegian Musicians. It was mainly for the Folk Musicians from all over the world. After that I traveled to a couple of places like Egypt, Switzerland, India and Australia. When it comes to differentiating between audiences abroad and here there is no big difference I would say when it comes to loving music. All over the world there are different types of audiences for different types of musical genres. Obviously you cant complain after singing Folk to a Heavy Metal Audience, pointed out Guruge Guruge considers himself fortunate to grow up in a remote aria called Nuwara Eliya.
It was not a big town back then in early 80's with less people to associate with and less musical or social events to attend. All we had was the record player, radio and later on the Cassette player. My father and mother were talented musically even though my father was in the agriculture field. He could play the Guitar, Harmonica and could sing and whistle beautifully. My mother sang in the school choir, so she could sing beautifully. I remember the days that we used to sing sitting by the fireplace. I have two sisters and two brothers and we all used to sing, He summed up the conversation.

One dead as van rams pedestrians near London Mosque
UK: A van ploughed into a crowd of Muslims near a London mosque early on Monday, leaving one person dead and injuring 10 others in what was being treated as the latest terrorist attack to hit Britain.
The 48-year-old driver of the van, who police believe acted alone, was detained by people at the scene and then arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The Finsbury Park mosque in north London said the van deliberately mowed down Muslim men and women leaving late evening prayers at the mosque and the nearby Muslim Welfare House shortly after midnight.
Others linked the attack to an increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, particularly since the London Bridge rampage on June 3 that left eight people dead, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.
This was an attack on London and all Londoners and we should all stand together against extremists whatever their cause, said Neil Basu, senior counter-terrorism officer for the Metropolitan Police.
He added that it had all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.
It unfolded as a man was receiving first aid from members of the public in an unrelated incident. The man later died, though it is not yet clear if his death was linked to the attack, Basu said.
Ten people were hurt, all of them Muslims, with eight of them requiring hospital treatment.
Two of them were in a very serious condition, police said.
A witness, Abdiqadir Warra, told AFP that the van drove at people and that some of the victims were carried for several metres along the road.
He was shouting: All Muslims, I want to kill all Muslims, another witness, Khalid Amin, told BBC television.
Amateur video footage seen by AFP showed at least three people laying on the ground, including one who was receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Basu praised the local communitys actions, adding that their restraint in the circumstances was commendable.
Prime Minister Theresa May said that her thoughts were with the victims and their families, and that she would chair a Cobra emergency cabinet meeting this morning.
The use of a vehicle to mow down pedestrians drew horrifying parallels with the London Bridge attack, when three men drove a van into pedestrians before embarking on a stabbing spree, as well as with another car and knife rampage in Westminster in March.
This time, however, the attacker appears to have deliberately targed at Muslims.
Over the past weeks and months, Muslims have endured many incidents of Islamophobia and this is the most violent manifestation to date, said Harun Khan, head of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), an umbrella body.
Mohammed Kozbar, chairman of the Finsbury Park mosque, described it as a cowardly attack which is no different from the attacks in Manchester or London, referring to the suicide bombing in Manchester in northwest England on May 22, which left 22 people dead.
Our community is in shock, he said, urging people attending prayers to remain vigilant, a warning that was echoed by police.
Extra policing resources have been deployed across London in order to reassure communities, especially those observing Ramadan. I would urge everyone to remain calm and vigilant, Basu said.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was a horrific terrorist attack aimed at innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan.
Police, including armed officers, could be seen manning a wide cordon around the area, while others searched the area with sniffer dogs.
A group of Muslim men were praying on the pavement nearby.
The Finsbury Park mosque was once a notorious hub for radical Islamists but has changed markedly in recent years under new management.
Its former imam, Abu Hamza, was jailed for life in New York on terrorism charges in 2015. Hamza preached there from 1997 to 2003 before being jailed for inciting violence and later extradited to the United States. In 2015, the mosque was one of around 20 that took part in an open day organised by the MCB to promote better understanding of Islam after Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks in Paris.
Despite the change in leadership and the focus on bolstering inter-faith relations, the mosque reported that it had received a string of threatening emails and letters in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris.
After the London Bridge attack, Khan said there had been a 40 percent increase in racist incidents in the city and a fivefold increase in the number of anti-Muslim incidents.
As locals woke up to the horror Monday, some came onto the street in support of the mosque, holding up signs saying We love our mixed community and Leave our Muslim neighbours alone.
Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the local MP for the area, said he would attend prayers later in the day at the mosque.
I call on everyone to stand together against those who seek to divide us, he said. - AFP

Only 50 Trucks which are 20 years old at CMC for garbage collection
The Colombo Municipal Council(CMC) yesterday said that the council was in possession of only 50 compactors and trucks to collect garbage and they were over 20 years old.
The CMC said that the Provincial Council had allocated funds to provide the Council with more compactors and trucks, but they are yet to materialise.
Colombo has seen a stark increase in garbage visible in many parts of the city. Residents and shop owners said the garbage was not collected for days by the Council. However, V.K. Anura insisted that they non collected was due to many residents not segregating the garbage.
He said that more than 50 people have been arrested over dumping garbage on ad hoc manner within the Colombo areas.
He added that legal action would be taken against the citizens failing to segregate their garbage.
Contrary to what many residents of Colombo told the Daily News the CMC claimed that garbage collection in and around Colombo has been resumed in a systematic manner, many roads and junctions are stocked with piles of garbage yet to be cleared by the CMC. Large amount of garbage were spread all over the area as CMC had not collected them for the past few days.
The Commissioner also said dumping garbage on ad hoc manner in Colombo was an organized act.
Some people are purposely dumping garbage on roads in the Colombo areas to pollute the environment. The CMC intends to take legal action against those individuals with the help of the Army and the police, he said.
Anura further said that the CMCs aim is to reduce the amount of waste that people produce every day and added that at present around 400 tonnes are collected within the Colombo areas.
Continuous raids will take place in all the areas to monitor the waste segregation process with the help of the Army and the police, he said.
Anura emphasized that the Army was not used to collect garbage but they have been helping CMC to create awareness among the public.
He said that CMC has requested the public to separate their waste as degradable waste, Recyclable waste and non- recyclable waste. Commissioner claimed that only bio-degradable garbage was being dumped in the compost yard in Muthurajawela.
He further said 400 tonnes of degradable waste, 100 tonnes of recycle waste and 200 tonnes of non-recyclable waste are collected every day.
Responding to a question raised by a Journalist about garbage collection tenders that have been out sourced, Commissioner said CMC cannot award tenders to clean streets of Colombo annually.
The tenders have to be awarded for a period of four years, he said.
He explained that the tenders were out sourced in 1990 as young people refused to work in this area and CMC could not recruit individuals above the age of 60.
They are around 1200 CMC employees are engaged in garbage collection and cleaning process with in the Colombo.
The Commissioner however said that they are taking measures to replace them.

Operation Barbarossa
The German nation is sick of principles and doctrines, literary existence and theoretical greatness. What it wants is power, power, and more power. And who ever gives it power, to him will Germany give honour, and more honour than he can ever imagine- Julius Frobel-1859
In 1933 when Adolf Hitler founded his Third Reich most Germans believed they had found their man of destiny. Humbled, despite their mighty efforts against the combined forces of many, including America, Britain, France, Russia in the First World War (1914-18), suspecting betrayal by both external as well as internal forces, their once strong and orderly country reduced to near anarchy, in 1933 to many Germans the National Socialist Party of Hitler seemed like the benediction the nation had fervently prayed for.
Under Hitler, by 1939 the efficiency, abilities and the discipline of the Germans had once again created a mighty nation with an awesome military machine. The capable, martial race was armed and ready. Led by its extraordinarily able General Staff, which both friend and foe considered a corps d elite, Hitlers Wehrmacht was easily the best fighting machine in the world at the time. It was said of the German officer class that they were men of outstanding intellectual ability and physical stamina, governed by a code of ascetic self-discipline. Their strength lay in their complete self-effacement to the point of anonymity. They were expected in times of peace to devote themselves wholly to knowledge and education. In war, total commitment: outstanding bravery and capability were demanded of them.
European nations
As the war drums rolled across Europe the aggressive German army triumphed with surprising ease over once vaunted armies of Poland, France and other strong European nations. In the case of the French, the enemy in fact outnumbered the Germans in many strategic aspects such as in men and tanks. But in military thinking they seemed stuck in Napoleonic times when the cavalry charge won the day. The Germans on the other hand were ready for mobile warfare fought with mechanized armoured forces, closely supported by deadly accurate air and artillery power. The French were conquered in a few short weeks. The British were never more thankful for the English Channel! After a halfhearted attempt to subdue the stubborn island with air power alone, Hitler turned his eyes to the East. The stage was now set for the greatest human conflict in history.
The Soviet Union, the largest country in the world, and which perhaps maintained the biggest army at the time, was shrouded in mystery. The secretive Stalinist system did not provide statistics at information bureaus. But it was obvious that in comparison to Western Europe their land was poor and primitive. The Soviet roads were not anything like what the motorized German army had used in Europe. There were very few all-weather roads in the country, proving a terrible obstacle in the bad Russian weather conditions. And unlike other countries the Germans had vanquished in the previous summers, the Soviet Union was much too large to be brought under in one aggressive dash.
But the German army, full of confidence after its remarkable achievements in the previous campaigns, had come to believe that nothing was impossible for the German soldier. Addressing the higher echelons of the army Hitler boastfully predicted that when Operation Barbarossa, the name given to the German plan for the impending campaign against the Soviet Union, commenced, the world will hold its breath. One good kick on the door and the entire rotten structure will collapse, he further emphasized his conviction that the Soviet Union was no match for the proven, battle hardened German war machine. This confidence was reflected in the astonishing fact that the German army launched the war against the Soviet Union where it was expected to conquer an area of about one million square miles in one summer campaign with just a few more divisions more than it had deployed in the previous summer against France (1940), a country of approximately 150,000 square miles.
For the good kick on the door the Germans gathered in secret almost four million soldiers on the Russian border. Provided air cover by the vigorous Luftwaffe, supported by nearly four thousand pieces of heavy artillery and most importantly given the cutting impetus by the brilliantly led panzer divisions, the German armys campaign in the East was indeed going to open with a breath taking fury.
In view of the immense land area it had to conquer with human resources Germany could not afford to keep in uniform for too long, the Wehrmacht had to gain a decisive result in that summer of 1941.With this strategic goal in mind, its military planners aimed at fatally wounding the Red army west of the Dnieper River. The Germans, committing themselves to a huge undertaking with a numerically weaker army, were gambling on the skills and capabilities of its soldiers to bring them a quick victory.
Russian defensive barriers
For operational purposes they divided their forces in to three large army groups. The Army Group North under the command of Field Marshal von Leeb was to capture the Baltic area and Leningrad. The Army Group Center under Field Marshal von Bock was to drive to Moscow through the Russian heartland. Field Marshal von Rundstedt leading the Army Group South was to bring the fertile Ukraine under its heel.
After a few nervous postponements, the date for the opening of the campaign was fixed for the 22nd of June, the same day that Napoleon, in 1812, launched his ill-fated invasion of Russia. Starting their eastward thrust at about 03 AM on that day, the Germanic war machine once again gave an almost flawless display of its awesome prowess. Within forty-eight hours more than two thousand Russian fighter planes were down. The German Panzer divisions exploiting the gaps punched by their opening salvos in the Russian defensive barriers drove relentlessly eastward with the aim of achieving strategic dominance, leaving the task of destroying the shocked and confused stragglers of the enemy forces to the rapidly following infantry divisions. By mid-July, in just three weeks of fighting, Russia had lost 3,500 tanks, 6,000 planes and more than two million men.
The famous German tank commander General Heinz Guderian leading a powerful armoured Corp attached to the Army Group Center noted in a memorandum that the Russians were severely hampered by political demands of the State leadership and suffered a basic fear of taking responsibility. This, combined with bad coordination meant that orders to carry out necessary measures, counter-measures in particular, are issued too late. Soviet tank forces were insufficiently trained and lacked intelligence and initiative during the offensive. In these early stages of the war, to many observers, it appeared that the Wehrmacht had once again delivered a death blow to a powerful adversary well before it could even comprehend the attackers diabolical intentions.
Although German propaganda portrayed the average Russian as a semi-Asiatic primitive with sub-human qualities and no match in the battlefield to the masterful Teutons, it did not take long for the German soldiers to realize that in the Russian vastness they were facing a fight to the death with this Slav/Mongol race. On that bloody battlefield German skills confronted Russian stubbornness, the attackers courage was met by the defenders recklessness and the conquerors contempt was matched by the hatred of resisters. The eastern campaign that began so dazzlingly for the invader on June 22, 1941 raged on in the mind-boggling hugeness of Russia until early1945. The young soldiers of the two nations were locked in a war of savagery on a scale rarely witnessed in human conflict. Russia alone suffered more than twenty million deaths in those four years of relentless combat.
War against terrorism
Nazism and Communism, the ideologies professed by the two armies that clashed with such bitterness in 1941, are dead in these countries today. Germany has rebuilt and is one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Russia after her failed experiment with Communism is yet struggling to find a place in world affairs that befits its size and potential. But they both surely remember the four years when the best of these two brave nations fought on a terrible battlefield and often died a soldiers death.
War is a terrible thing. Here in our little island we too learnt in our drawn-out and bloody war against terrorism, the tragedy and the waste of it all. But paradoxically, war often brings out some of the best qualities in man.
The titanic clash that began in that summer of 1941 demanded of the combatants, super human effort, amazing physical endurance, boundless courage, iron discipline, selfless comradeship and finally the unflinching sacrificing of one self. To this day, the bind boggling size of the battlefield and the heroism of the human actors of that bloody drama inspire awe by its sheer scale, intensity, wickedness and heroism.
Two things have altered not, since first the world began, the beauty of the wild green earth, and the bravery of man.

Pakistan pressure go to India, says Kohli
LONDON, Sunday: India captain Virat Kohli said the pressure created by Pakistan's bowlers proved too much for his title-holders to handle in a stunning 180-run Champions Trophy final defeat at The Oval.
After Kohli won the toss and, surprisingly, opted to field first, Pakistan posted an imposing total of 338 for four featuring Fakhar Zaman's maiden one-day international hundred, an innings where he might have been run out for one and was caught off a no-ball on three.
It all left India needing to set new tournament record for a team batting second to win if they were to retain the title they won in England four years ago.
Ironically, the mark they had to top was the 322 for three made by Sri Lanka in seven-wicket win over India at The Oval on June 8 -- the lone group-stage loss suffered by Kohli's side.
The already considerable scoreboard pressure became impossible for India to cope with when Mohammad Amir reduced them to 33 for three. The Pakistan left-arm quick's brilliant burst of three for 16 in 28 balls saw him snare opener Rohit Sharma lbw for a duck and have Kohli, the world's leading ODI batsman, caught off a leading edge for just five.
They made us make those mistakes with the way they were bowling, creating that pressure, Kohli told reporters.
If left-handed opener Fakhar rode his luck at times, he also produced an array of superb shots, notably in a first-wicket stand of 128 with Azhar Ali. When players like that get going on their day, it becomes really difficult to stop them because I think 80 percent of his shots were high-risk -- and they were all coming off, said Kohli.
As a bowler and as a captain when that is happening ... sometimes you have to sit and say the guy is good enough on the day to tackle anything'.
We certainly tried to make them hit in areas that we felt it would be uncomfortable, but we just didn't have anything going our way in that partnership.
Meanwhile, reflecting on India's tournament as a whole, Kohli insisted: We can (still) be very proud ... and we leave here with our heads held high.
Credit to everyone for standing up and showing that resilience and reaching the finals -- (but) we were outplayed in all departments.
In the end ... you have to accept and admire sometimes the skill of the opposition, Kohli added sportingly. - AFP

Pakistan hailed by media after confounding everyone
Islamabad: Jubilant photographs of Pakistan cricket fans dancing in the streets were plastered all over national newspapers Monday after their eighth-ranked team produced a thrilling win against arch-rivals India in the Champions Trophy final.
Pakistan inflicted a massive 180-run defeat upon title-holders and favourites India at the Oval in London on Sunday to win the tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international nations.
A Pakistani vendor arranges morning newspapers featuring front page coverage of Pakistans victory against India in the ICC Champions Trophy final cricket match played in London, in Islamabad on June 19. AFP
The victory was splashed across most major newspapers, with leading English daily Dawn proclaiming: Pakistan breaks jinx, trounce India in dream final.
While the countrys largest paper, the Urdu-daily Jang, announced: Pakistan Champions, trounced Indian team.
Pakistan made 338 for four, with the cornerstone being opener Fakhar Zamans 114, his maiden ODI hundred.
Mohammad Amir then reduced India to 33 for three by dismissing their much-vaunted top three, with Rohit Sharma out for a duck and opposing skipper Virat Kohli, the worlds top-ranked ODI batsman, falling for just five.
India eventually collapsed to 158 all out as they suffered their heaviest defeat in terms of runs in 129 ODIs against Pakistan.
Banks, government and other organisations ran full-page advertisements congratulating the team for their historic win.
In an editorial titled Victory is sweet, the Express Tribune said: When you are an underdog in a high-octane tournament final and your highly-regarded opponent is the defending champion, hardly anyone has any expectations of you -- except of course your cricket-mad 200 million plus compatriots.
The News, in a piece headlined Champions, said: When Pakistan was thrashed by India in its opening match of the Champions Trophy, the obituaries were already being written.
But if there is one thing you can say about the Pakistan cricket team, it is that it exists to confound everyone.
In India almost all print media went easy on Kohli and his team, crediting Pakistans performance though the front-page of the Hindustan Times screamed Obliterated at the Oval: India humiliated by Pak.
The Times of India proclaimed: The Unpredictables Rise Again.
Former India captain Ravi Shastri said: The better team won. Cricket-mad Indian fans resorted to humour to sweep away the disappointment. Twitter user Prachi Dasin said This is cheating, Fakhar Zaman is out of syllabus! Top industrialist Harsh Goenka sent a message to Indias foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. 11 Indians stranded in Oval, London. Madam Sushma Swaraj please rescue them, he tweeted.
Some news channels showed handful of fans smashing a television in the street after the match -- but the antics appeared to have been staged.
Pakistan have been forced to play most of their home matches overseas since a 2009 terror attack on Sri Lankas team bus in Lahore. But the International Cricket Council are planning to send a World XI to play in Pakistan in September. AFP

Pico Sri Lanka joins with Vision Care Nethralokana Sathkara Project
Sri Lankas premier eye-care specialist Vision Care celebrated its 25th anniversary on February 5. The significant milestone which has been reached by the best eye-care provider in the country is further commemorated through a series of events and CSR activities.
One such magnanimous venture is the Vision Care Nethralokana Sathkara Project. The pioneering initiative saw the distribution of 25,000 spectacles to the deserving folk in various parts of the island at zero cost, restoring their sight and putting a smile on their faces.
Following the tests which were conducted by qualified Optometrists at Vision Care in the host cities, the applicant will receive either a reading or prescribed pair of spectacles at the awarding event.
The benevolent scheme was launched as mega events targeting the main cities of Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna and Colombo, with parallel programmes being held in the regional cities and branches around these main cities which strengthened the projects island-wide reach.
The project which spanned over three months will culminate in a mega event in Colombo to signify the conclusion of the project which will be held in June and July at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC) in Colombo.
SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka), which is nestled in the heart of Colombo, which is considered the business hub of the island, was established over two decades ago with the sole purpose of hosting a wide range of events. With extensive experience and know-how, SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka) is considered the number one location for events of magnitude and exhibitions which could accommodate a large capacity of people. The management of SLECC (Pico Sri Lanka) was inspired to come on-board as the Venue Partner for the Colombo Mega Event after witnessing the philanthropic effort initiated by Vision Care.
Expressing his views about their significant initiative, Vision Care Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer, Dasantha Fonseka said, The culmination of this debut venture of significant proportion will result in enhancing the vision and the lives of the truly destitute. This prerogative of Vision Care has resulted in the awareness and education of vision impairment and preventable blindness among the hoi polloi. It further complements the Governments goal to eradicate avoidable blindness from Sri Lanka by 2020 through Vision 2020.

Players wont budge on pay demands - Warner
Sydney: Australias cricketers will not back down in a bitter pay dispute, David Warner has warned amid fears their October tour of India is looming as a flashpoint.
As the June 30 deadline for a new memorandum of understanding between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association fast approaches, the Australia vice-captain insisted players wont budge on their demands.
Well from July 1, were unemployed, Warner told Channel Nine late Sunday.
Weve been threatened with that. Were hopeful theres going to be an agreement done, its a sticky situation.
CA has threatened not to pay contracted players beyond the expiry of their current financial deal at the end of the month if they do not accept a new offer, with the governing body determined to scrap revenue-sharing after 20 years.
With a Test squad for an August tour of Bangladesh named last week, Warner was adamant that a lockout was possible.
From our point of view I want to play for Australia and so do the other boys, he said.
But if theres nothing thats put in place for what were trying to achieve here, from both point of views, were not going to tour Bangladesh, there might not be an Ashes if we dont have an MOU.
For all the concerns about the Bangladesh tour, and the uncertainty about the home Ashes series, cancelling the five ODI India tour in October could cost Australian cricket more than it can afford to lose.
Offending India could jeopardise the nations reciprocal agreement that has the Indians touring Australia in 2018-19, The Australian newspaper reported.
Indian tours generate big money and Cricket Australia risks forgoing the rivers of gold that will flow from hosting four Tests against the world cricket powerhouse, it said.
The outspoken Warner conceded captain Steve Smith could probably push a little bit more when it comes to stating the players case.
While standing with his colleagues, Smith has taken a less strident approach than Warner, diplomatically trying to downplay the prospect of industrial action.
From where I stand and the position I take on this, I try to take as much heat off (Smith) as possible, Warner said.
He does lead us on the field, and rightfully so off the field as well, he does a great job.
In this circumstance Im willing to go out there into bat for everyone.
Yeah, sometimes he could probably push a little bit more, but I think hes doing a great job, as well as the other players like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood as well.
Pay talks between CA and the players union are set to continue this week with both sides saying they are committed to striking a new MOU before the June 30 cut-off. AFP

Prices of dengue blood tests at private hospitals reduced
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed all private hospitals to reduce charges from June 19 (yesterday) for the blood tests to diagnose dengue.
All leading private hospitals have already implemented the new charges. From yesterday, (19) a Full Blood Count Test cost a patient Rs. 250 and a Dengue Antigen Test cost Rs. 1,000. Earlier, a Full Blood Count Test cost a patient Rs. 500 and a Dengue Antigen test cost Rs. 3,000.
The new charges imposed by the Health Ministry will be valid until further notice.
The Minister took steps under the Private Hospital Regulatory Programme considering the increasing number of dengue patients in the country. A Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Dengue Control Unit said the Dengue Antigen test (NS1) can be positive within first 24 or 48 hours following infection. A negative test result cannot be accepted if fever and symptoms continue to be present after two or three days.

He said this addressing a meeting held at Muwanwewa in Lunugamwehera for the vesting of a sewa piyasa. A sum of Rs. 2 million was spent for the construction of this sewa piyasa.
Only forty five months are left for us to serve the people; within that period, we must provide jobs to the jobless and solve other problems pertaining to education and other spheres, the minister said
During the previous regime, alcohol was served to people during elections to gain votes. Taverns and liquor sales outlets were opened in alarming proportions. Thousands of families in the country were destroyed as a result of the alcohol menace, he said.
Thousands of precious lives were lost as a result of drugs, which is why we must concentrate on minimising it, he added.

The robbed that smiles
Somewhere in the outskirts of this very same city, a bank robbery is about to happen. A young man from a lower middle-class family suddenly crashes into a bank. But the robbing is not going to easy. A lot of distractions stand in his path. A relationship grows between the robber and the bank staff to an extent of calculated intimacy. Later the police were to enter followed by the media crowd.
That leaves the audience in a shock!
You wont simply be able to make head or tail of what is taking place on the stage, enshrouded in fantasy. Because Kapila Kumara Kalinga likens it to the fantasy that rules us all: to rob a bank.
What happens on Kalingas latest stage play, Banku Weeraya, is not what is supposed to take place in a usual bank robbery.
Everyone wants to rob a bank. We may not actually walk that fantasy, but we certainly need money more than we earn. Most of us live only half. If we only can rob a bank, we think we can live a full life, Kalinga notes, taking a hint from the consumerist order marked with a full-throttled chase behind money.
The presence of media adds a touch of humour to the breakdown of scenes. The media can craft heroes out of villains, Kalinga remarks. Whenever a criminal incident happens, the crim receives full publicity free of charge. Their crimes are exposed in graphic details, offering free lessons to would-be successors.
The bank robber, starred by Dharmapriya Dias, is questioned by the media as to why he wanted to rob a bank. To leave the country, comes the reply, with the money robbed. I love Sri Lanka, the villain turned hero responds, but Sri Lanka does not reciprocate that love.
That is the typical idea that we live with. We all love this country, but we think that this country does not return our love. I am trying to build up that argument through seven characters, Kalinga clarified.
Kapila Kumara Kalinga has been engaged in a slow-pedalled voyage as a copywriter and a writer. He left the theatre territory 15 years ago. He makes the re-entry with Banku Veeraya to a new audience which he segregates into two main schools.
One school is about 50 percent of people who do not have the slightest idea of what theatre is.
You can easily please them with light comedy that runs for about half an hour. We have so called dramatists catering to that crowd. I do not approve of it, Kalinga remarked.
The remaining 50 percent, on the contrary, would not easily fall for light entertainment. Kalinga is optimistic about this crowd. Though few in numbers, they are omnipresent in the society. They include university undergraduates, teachers and other commons with some intellectual capacity.
That changes as we move towards outstations, Kalinga hastened to add. The 50 percent goes down to about 25 percent. The majority just want some light entertainment to please themselves. They are not bothered about what they will be as they leave the theatre.
Kalingas mission is to reach out for the optimistic percentage and increase its volume.
In Sri Lanka, Kalinga sees a tradition of theatre. It is a tradition that passes on from one generation to another. The contemporary dramatists offer a flicker of hope to Kalinga.
Our theatre has a bright future, though we cannot expect the whole 10 million to come and watch. It does not happen anywhere in the world.
But Kalingas worry is something else: why should some dramatists try to force something on the audience just for the sake of more commercial gains A vendor cannot go on selling substandard items. Arts should be brought to the fore from such plains, Kalinga recapped. His worry rests with the percentage that is not optimistic.
They have messed up the performance with dramas. They just need to watch some play about half an hour and laugh. They are not used to longer dialogues and durations. This should not happen.
Then what should happen The spectator should leave the theatre for a higher philosophical pedestal, and see life in a different perspective. That objective is not achievable as long as dramatists produce plays of inferior substance just for the sake of keeping up the theatre tradition.
Kalinga is more into the serious entertainment industry as a scriptwriter. But the industry suffers from a severe dearth of scriptwriters. The performers, producers and directors steal the show with budding artistes clinging on to that plush position. But the upcoming scriptwriters are rarely  if not, never - heard of.
This is simply because we do not have time to chill out, hence no time for reading. That is why we do not get to hear about brilliant writers.
Then what is Kalingas way out
My first principle is watching, if you are writing for the screen. You need to watch and learn. But the stuff available for reading is so much. We wont be able to finish them off in this birth itself, probably. But then again, we can choose our favourite writers who write good stuff and study them repeatedly, Kalinga reiterated.
Thats Kalingas job which he does in a raised podium. It should have been impossible if producers in the calibre of Priyankara de Silva (of Sadaya Marai Salli Hamarai fame) are not ready to take up the gauntlet of bucking the trend against commercial trends of the local theatre. Interestingly, de Silva is also professionally nestled in the banking sector. Despite his links with finance sector, de Silva has lent his generous hand to the countrys theatre industry for the past 15 years.
Banku Weeraya will be staged at Western Aesthetic Institute (NADA) on June 25 at 3.30 and 6.45 pm.

Sarfraz hopes Champions Trophy triumph ends Pakistan exile
LONDON, Sunday: Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed said he hoped his side's stunning 180-run Champions Trophy final win over arch-rivals India would be a catalyst for the full return of international cricket to his homeland.
Bottom-ranked Pakistan produced a breathtaking display at London's Oval on Sunday in the climax of a tournament featuring the world's top eight one-day international nations.
They piled up 338 for four, with Fakhar Zaman making a dashing 114 -- the left-handed opener's maiden hundred in just his fourth match at this level since a debut in Pakistan's group-stage win over South Africa.
Mohammad Amir then reduced India to 33 for three by dismissing all the members of the title-holders top three, with Rohit Sharma out for a duck and opposing skipper Virat Kohli, the world's leading ODI batsman, falling for just five.
Pakistan cricket fans celebrate winning of the ICC Champions Trophy in Lahore. AFP
There was no way back for India, who collapsed to 158 all out with nearly 20 overs of the match as they suffered their heaviest defeat by runs in 129 ODIs against Pakistan.
With the exception of Zimbabwe's tour two years ago, Pakistan have had to play all of their home matches outside their own country since a 2009 terror attack on Sri Lanka's team bus in Lahore. I hope this win will boost Pakistan cricket and hopefully all the (major) playing nations will come to Pakistan, said Sarfraz.
This Champions Trophy went ahead as scheduled despite a terror attack at a pop concert in Manchester, northern England, on May 22 that killed 22 people.
And it continued even after another deadly attack at London Bridge, barely two miles from The Oval on June 3 in which eight people died. But after the victims were remembered with a minute's silence by a capacity crowd, fans at The Oval were soon engrossed by an extraordinary match.
I think great things went for me and my team and my country, Sarfraz told reporters after a win made all the more astounding by the fact Pakistan had suffered a 124-run defeat by India in their tournament opener at Edgbaston on June 4.
Hopefully this win, everyone will remember, not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but for a very long, long time, added the wicket-keeper/batsman.
Sarfraz paid tribute to the influence of a coaching staff led by Mickey Arthur, who took charge shortly before Pakistan's tour of England last year, where a Test series was shared but the ODI campaign lost 4-1.
They motivated us, explained Sarraz, also Pakistan's captain when they beat India in the 2006 Under-19 World Cup final in Colombo.
When we arrived here (in England), we were No 8 and now we are the champions, said the 30-year-old gloveman. Pakistan, who will aim for more ODI glory in England at the 2019 World Cup, looked anything but tournament winners after their opening loss.
But Arthur insisted that reverse had been an aberration.
We just had to keep believing ... they kept on believing, trusting their roles (and) trusting the gameplan that Saffy (Sarfraz) and I had set up.
Arthur played down his own role by adding: This isn't about me and my career; it's about 15 unbelievable players in that dressing room.
I was telling somebody the other day that I've had five semi-finals with South Africa and never got to a final. I got to one final with Pakistan, and eventually got a medal.
Amir, whose career was nearly ended on the other side of London's River Thames by a ban and jail sentence for his involvement in a spot-fixing scan during a 2010 Test at Lord's, made a brilliant comeback after a back spasm forced him out of the semi-final victory over England. Amir was the guy that could do that for us, said Arthur.
We were always thinking there was one spell in there somewhere, and the spell came thankfully at the start of a final.
It says a lot about his personality ... but what I do know is that Mohammad Amir is a big-match player.

The Signal..!
Now let me tell you Ive had my fair share of cars over the past few years. Theyve all done me yeoman service and Ive rewarded them by either sending them to another kindly owner or retiring them for life!
But theres one in my stable who seems to have a permanent place: My scooter.
Bob, people ask as they come over to my house, theres an ancient machine downstairs
Mine! I say with pride.
You not planning to dispose it
Nope!
I guess theres a story behind it! they say and settle down to listen.
If you notice, I tell them, its a scooter with a single long seat!
Whats that
He means that unlike most scooters which have two single seats, one for the rider and the other for the pillion, this has one seat! says somebody in the audience.
Like a motorbike
Thats it, I say, just like a motorbike!
And why so asks the same inquisitive person.
So that the pillion rider and he can be as close as possible, chuckles the other person and I smile. Which means you must have carried a lot of pretty pillions Bob
I smile again. I made a deal, I said, with my scooter that as soon as it decided it liked any one of my pillions it would signal me!
You mean like tell you, hey Bob, this is a good one
Yep, I said, scooters know these things better than we men, they know how a woman fits in the back seat; is she selfish with her space, is she shy, abusive with the sides of the bike, caring, compassionate!
Scooters know all this
You bet! I said, so there was Prema and Susan, Vera and Tina, Kamala and Geeta, but never once did my scooter utter a word!
She didnt like them
Didnt feel they were good enough for me, I smiled. Till one day going up Malabar Hill she conked off!
With a pillion behind
Yep, I said, and I cursed, and cussed, kicked and threw a silent tantrum, but it didnt budge. Just refused to start on the middle of the hill!
So what happened
We pushed the bike up the hill!
We
Yes, the pillion rider helped me push!
She helped you
She did, I said, and I swear as she helped me, I saw my scooter grin; This Bob, is the woman wholl love you like nobody else will!
So the conking off by your scoter was the signal
I smile and look at my wife who appears by my side: Today weve been married thirty- five years! I say and then hear my scooter downstairs ask, I didnt let you down did I master
You got me the best..! I reply.

Slow growth in first half of 2017 on account of floods, says analyst
Sri Lankas first-half growth will be affected by the drought and the floods, but is expected to pick up in the second half, according to Atchuthan Srirangan, a senior research analyst at First Capital Holdings PLC.
But slower growth this year will cause a higher loan-to-GDP ratio, which is a concern, he said.
Inflation could rise in the short term, especially due to crop damage and difficulties in distributing fresh food produce and staple food items, analysts said, after the recent floods and landslides caused by the worst torrential rains in 14 years.
Sri Lankas economy grew by 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2017, slowing from the previous quarters 5.3 percent, the state-run Department of Census and Statistics said last week.
Meanwhile Sri Lankan shares rose on Friday for the third straight session to hit a near four-week closing high as investors picked up blue chip stocks.
The Colombo Stock Index ended 0.36 percent higher at 6,718.83, its highest close since May 22, and recorded its first weekly gain in four weeks.
Analysts said investor reaction to slower economic growth in the first quarter was mixed.
Foreign investors were net buyers of Rs. 63.3 million worth of shares, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to Rs. 20.71 billion.

## Title: Soaring to great heights via secured digital transformation

Soaring to great heights via secured digital transformation
Pubudu Basnayake, Microsofts OEM Director for New Markets in Southeast Asia, commenting on the call for fundamental changes to existing cybersecurity strategies in this era of digital transformation, believes that rather than focusing on digital disruption, consumers and enterprises should emphasize 'caution' and deliver 'genuine digital transformation solutions with built-in security'.
Its safe to say that the next industrial revolution is here. And for businesses trying to play a part in it, they must transform digitally. Equally, if businesses are to survive in this digital world, their IT infrastructure and security demands the utmost attention to the hyper-growth of technologies that surrounds them.
This is why digital transformation is like a double-edged sword - a crude analogy, but true nonetheless.
Todays overwhelming use of personal and work-related smart devices is a phenomenon of digital transformation.
For such devices have caused disruption in many industries throughout the world, unlocking competitive threats and a treasure trove of opportunities depending on how businesses responded.
The Internet of Things (IoT) demonstrate such transformation in a contemporary way. And while some companies always fare better than others, the importance of legitimate digital transformation solutions, the use of fortified technology to radically improve performance and reach, has never been greater than it is today.
But there are risks and threats to IoT devices. Hyper-growth in the number of IoT, poor security hygiene, and high value of sensitive data are potential threats of disruption can be lethal to any enterprise.
From the rise of smart devices to IoT, from growing mounds of data to the emergence of advanced analytics, from machine learning to augmented reality, the challenge and opportunity for business leaders to harness the disruptive force of technology has never been more clearer.
They must navigate the expectations of a changing workforce, address evolving cyber security threats and manage a host of other challenges.
As caretaker of Microsofts broad hardware and software partner ecosystem, Basnayake is responsible for stimulating hardware and software advancements, while also sustaining a healthy and vibrant hardware ecosystem to create substantial business opportunities for local and international partners.
In other words, he helps push technological boundaries so as to bring rich computing experiences to life.
Basnayake says, Local businesses understand the importance of digital transformation. But I often see an alarming gap between planning and action, especially with regard to the short timeframe organizations have in order to adapt to massive technological shifts. Without the right IoT capabilities, businesses are investing in obsolete marketing, sales and customer relationship management channels.
To be successful in digital transformation, a business must choose a platform designed for the key attributes in intelligent devices. These devices must have natural and intuitive user interfaces to enable ease of interaction for the end-user.
Businesses must have robust firewalls, encrypted data storage features and secure transmissions. To communicate with a multitude of other devices, an intelligent device must also be interoperable and service-enabled. And finally, it has to be easy to deploy and manage without extra burden.
Basnayake says by choosing Windows 10 IoT, customers can enable intelligent device capabilities to make a significant impact. The Windows 10 IoT operating system brings one converged system that powers IoT devices and provides an optimized platform for management, security, and application development. Windows 10 IoT is the family name for the Windows 10 operating systems that run on a wide range of devices - from small intelligent devices to industry machinery.
Businesses wanting to survive disruption must evolve and cater to changing lifestyles through legitimate digital transformation solutions, with built-in security. To support this process and increase IoT initiatives, Microsoft works with multiple device partners to provide innovative device offerings. The software built into such devices is either given free of charge or at little cost. Partnerships like these help increase our reach to empower people with the tools they need to survive digital disruption, Basnayake says.
Interestingly, his attempt at setting a new direction and outline for digital transformation comes as a result of his keen interest in mountaineering.
People often climb mountains to conquer them. Sometimes, though, climbing a mountain can end up exerting an influence over a person, a kind of influence one might never quite expect. In my experience, this influence had everything to do with nurturing caution. Businesses need to expand their accountability for security and focus on protection against known threats, he said.
Basnayake says that reliability, security and privacy are 'must haves' to support key uses of digital technology.
"In order for businesses to be relevant, competitive or profitable five years from now, they need to adapt to the new tools of business," he said. "This shows that any business, large or small, can take advantage of this window of opportunity to reposition themselves ahead of the technology curve and see their digital transformation efforts rewarded."

## Title: Sri Lankas domestic barriers to trade
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Tuesday, June 20, 2017 - 01:00
Sri Lankas domestic barriers to trade
In the recent past, Sri Lanka has focused on negotiating FTAs as a means to revive its export sector. FTAs address external barriers that Sri Lankan exporters face in the importing country. However, trade barriers are found not only at the border of the importing country, but also at the border of the exporting country.
Using agriculture products as case studies, Verit Research identifies such domestic barriers. Findings reveal that domestic barriers to trade significantly undermine the export capacity and competitiveness of Sri Lankan exports. Hence, addressing them is important to unleash the countrys export potential.
Following is a summary of the report:
The export sector of Sri Lanka has performed poorly since the turn of the century. Exports to GDP ratio has declined from 33.3% of GDP in 2000 to 12.8% of GDP by 2015. Additionally, from 2011 onwards, exports have declined in terms of absolute value. In response, the Government of Sri Lanka has made it a priority within their economic policy agenda to revive the ailing export sector.
Reviving the export sector requires identifying and addressing trade barriers that undermine export competitiveness. Trade barriers refer to factors beyond the exporters direct control that adversely affect the cost, quality, quantity, or timely delivery of products. Such barriers found at home are termed domestic barriers, while those found abroad are termed external barriers.
The governments recent focus has been on reducing external trade barriers and improving market access through FTAs. In comparison, little attention has been paid to domestic trade barriers that affect export competitiveness. To unleash the full potential of the export sector, it is important to reduce both external and domestic barriers.
This study aims to identify the prevalent domestic trade barriers found at the Sri Lankan border and analyse their impact on agricultural exports. The agricultural exports, valued at US$ 2.5 billion in 2015, accounted for 25% of total exports. Tea accounted for 50% of total agricultural exports; coconut and spices accounted for another 33%; and fruit and vegetables, cut flowers and foliage, minor crops, and fisheries products constituted the remaining 17%.
The study finds that the domestic trade barriers are a significant impediment to the growth and diversification of the agricultural exports. The negative effects of these barriers are especially pronounced in the case of perishable agricultural products. Their quality and shelf life can be irreversibly affected due to delays caused by such barriers. Removing these barriers can go a long way in boosting exports.
Interviews with exporters revealed that improving the efficiency of border procedures could cut cost of products by as much as 25 to 30%.
The study identifies trade barriers the exporters face when importing inputs (e.g. seed, fertilizer) and exporting the final output. These trade barriers are divided into three broad categories namely, (i) regulatory barriers; (ii)procedural barriers; and (iii) informational barriers. Case studies in each category provide examples of such barriers and make clear their impact on exports.
RegulatoryBarriers
Commonly referred to as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, regulations governing agricultural trade aim to safeguard the health and safety of human, plant and animal life. The challenge for any country is to ensure that these regulations maintain the safety of traded products without unnecessarily impeding trade. Ensuring that regulations are 1) developed based on research and stakeholder consultations; 2) regularly reviewed and updated; and 3) designed in a manner that leaves less room for discretionary interpretation, will help overcome this challenges to a significant extent. The study identifies several weaknesses in the regulation making process in Sri Lanka, which not only impedes trade but also compromises the safety of agricultural products traded.
1. Weak stakeholder consultation
Consulting stakeholders when making regulations enhance legitimacy and credibility of regulations, helps improve their effectiveness, and enhances voluntary compliance. The study finds that the absence of stakeholder consultation is a key reason that makes regulations a barrier to trade.
For example, the use of advisory bodies is one of the most widely utilised approaches to stakeholder consultation. The proposed National Seed Council (NSC) under Seed Act No. 22 of 2003, comprising all key public and private sector stakeholders, is expected to function as an advisory and oversight body on all matters relating to production and supply of seeds and planting material. The study identifies a number of issues pertaining to seed and plant material imports that undermine the countrys export potential, which the NSC could help to address.
However, 14 years have passed since the enactment of the Act, and the NSC has yet to be set up. Failure to establish the NSC has prolonged the problems and delayed their solutions.
Advance notification and seeking comments from stakeholders on proposed changes is another widely-used approach to stakeholder consultation. This enables accurate assessment of regulatory impact, enhances compliance and minimises implementation costs. A ban on a broad-spectrum weedicide, glyphosate, was introduced in October 2015 and the impact of the ban clearly illustrates the implications of failing to undertake such consultation. The ban severely affected exporters of cut flowers and foliage to Australia, where glyphosate is the only dipping treatment permitted. The ban, coupled with the lack of alternatives, was identified to have caused a significant drop in the yields of certain crops.
Lack of alternatives also meant that agricultural producers were forced to shift to manual weeding which increased cost of production significantly. Furthermore, reports of glyphosate being smuggled into the country raises questions about effectiveness of the ban.
2. Failure to regularly review and update regulations
Regulations on agricultural trade must be reviewed in line with changes in economic, environmental and technical conditions surrounding the products they regulate, in order to ensure their relevance and usefulness. The need for review and update applies especially to the list of prohibitions and restrictions governing the export and import of plants.
The regulation protecting the countrys flora from foreign pests and diseases has not been reviewed for the last three and half decades. This raises serious concerns of the relevance and usefulness of the protection extended through the existing list of prohibitions and restrictions. Furthermore, failure to review makes traders subject to restrictions that may no longer be relevant or useful, making such regulations unnecessary barriers to trade.
3. Poor design of regulations
Failure to assess the impact of the regulations and consult stakeholders at the design stage can result in poorly designed regulations, leading to unfavourable outcomes. A clear example is the guidelines issued by the Horticultural Crops Research and Development Institute (HORDI) of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) for the testing of imported vegetable varieties.
The guidelines in effect create monopolies for seed companies over seed varieties, and thereby restrict the choice of farmers in terms of both seed suppliers and varieties. The system creates an unfair advantage for existing seed companies and creates insurmountable entry barriers for new players entering the market.
The case demonstrates how regulatory systems can fall prey to bureaucratic prerogative and vested interests in the absence of wider stakeholder consultations and impact assessment at the design stage.
Remedial measures:
Sri Lanka can learn from the measures taken by other countries to overcome
identified barriers. For example, many countries have put in place systems to notify the public in advance and seek comments prior to implementation of regulations.
ProceduralBarriers
Efficient, predictable, and transparent regulatory procedures enhance compliance and facilitate trade. Sri Lankan exporters suffer from inefficient procedures at the border. This is reflected by the countrys global ranking in efficiency of border procedures, measured by the Global Trade Enabling Index.
The ranking went down by ten places within just two years, from 87th place (2014) to 97th (2016) out of 136 countries.
The study identifies inefficiency, unpredictability, and weak inter-agency coordination to be key procedural barriers to trade.
1. Inefficient procedures
Every additional hour that perishable products spend in transit because of inefficient procedures adversely affects their quality and commercial value. Several case studies serve to illustrate the negative impact of delays caused by inefficient procedures on export competitiveness.
The physical inspection process in place for perishables that go through the Katunayake International Airport is a case in point. The cargo goes through four separate inspections conducted by four different authorities.
In most instances, the inspections are carried out by officials who are not trained to handle perishable cargo, and pilferage is a frequent occurrence. The inspections are conducted in areas without any temperature control, and in some instances in open-air areas, exposing products to heat and contamination.
The result is longer transit times and damage to cargo, which significantly undermines the competitiveness of perishable exports.
2. Weak inter-agency coordination
Poor communication between agencies results in delays to exporters, which adversely affects their export competitiveness. For example, seafood exporters report of significant delays in getting the Health Certificate required to clear cargo because of weak coordination between National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) and the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DFAR).
3. Unpredictable procedures
The ability to know with confidence if listed documents are submitted, outlined procedures are followed, and the cargo can be cleared within a given period is a key determinant of trade competitiveness. The fertilizer import procedure in Sri Lanka illustrates the impact of unpredictable procedures where the traders are unable to assess with confidence the time taken to process the documents and clear the cargo.
Fertilizer importers report of frequent delays despite following the due process outlined by the National Fertilizer Secretariat (NFS).
The process itself is lengthy and cumbersome and delays are an added burden. This does not bode well for agricultural productivity and the export competitiveness of a country that meets most of its fertilizer needs through imports.
Remedial measures: The ability to profile the risk of non-compliance of a shipment with regulations and introduce mitigatory measures proportional to the level of risk can help reduce the frequency of physical inspections. For example, in the UK, the Import Risk Assessment System assigns each consignment to a risk category. Only the consignments categorised as high risk are subject to 100% inspection. Medium risk categories are inspected on a case-by-case basis, while low risk categories are cleared without any inspection.
Additionally, improved coordination and cooperation of border agencies can help to significantly reduce compliance and enforcement related time and costs.
Countries are also increasingly adopting information and communication technology to cut down red tape.
Informational Barriers
Access to accurate and timely information on regulations and procedures in a user-friendly manner is critical for export success. Not having the right information at the right time can lead to significant delays and losses for the trader.
Further, the time and money spent on finding information can be a significant barrier to trade as well. The study finds difficulty in accessing trade related regulatory information to be a major barrier to trade.
1. Limited access to information online
Making information available through the web can help reduce the information search costs significantly and enhance transparency. It is the most non-discriminatory way of making information available to the public, since access is not restricted by time and location.
Instant and convenient access to government information through websites is especially beneficial to small and medium industries and businesses located outside Colombo, who would otherwise have to visit Colombo in person to obtain the necessary information. The research finds that in Sri Lanka, information made available through websites is often limited and outdated.
Thus, traders must often call relevant organisations, or visit their offices in person to obtain the required information.
The report analysed the online availability of basic information such as contact details, application forms, procedures, list of restrictions, fees and timelines for seven key agencies related to agricultural trade. According to the study, only 36% of the required information was available online. The remaining 64% of information had to be obtained by either physically visiting the premises of the respective agency or via phone call.
2. Failure to notify traders of changes in advance
Many traders interviewed in this study experienced ad hoc changes in procedures, often with a change in the Head of the relevant regulatory authority. As the traders are not informed of changes in a timely manner, they consequently do not have sufficient time to adjust to new procedures.
An importer of special fertilizers, for example, was not informed of the need for additional approvals from the Department of Agriculture prior to the arrival of shipments at the port. As a result, a shipment took three months, instead of the usual three days, to be released from the port, which resulted in significant demurrage costs.
3. Failure to provide information in a user-friendly manner
To enhance accessibility of information, it is important to publish the information in a user-friendly manner. In Sri Lanka, finding information online can be cumbersome. It is not unusual to find information on different aspects of a single procedure related to a single product scattered over multiple websites.
Increasingly, countries are introducing online search engines where traders can find information by entering product code or name, especially for taxes and trade data. In Sri Lanka, most agencies have yet to introduce such systems. At present, soft copies of the most updated data on trade, which is organized by HS code is not available online and must be purchased from Sri Lanka Customs.
Furthermore, the taxes applicable at the point of import by HS code are not made available online in a user-friendly manner.
Remedial measures: Many countries have introduced a Trade Information Portal as a means of facilitating trade and increasing transparency. A Trade Information Portal is expected to enable traders to access all relevant trade rules, regulations, procedures, fee schedules, and forms from all border management agencies through a single user-friendly web site.
In its 2017 Budget, the Government of Sri Lanka made a commitment to establish a National Trade Information Portal. It is important to note, however, that maintaining a website of this nature is challenging as information needs to be continuously updated to ensure that it remains relevant and useful.
Therefore, putting in place institutional arrangements to ensure a proactive supply of information from the agencies to the Trade Information Portal is critical for such a portal to be an effective solution to the current information problem.
In conclusion, there is much that can be done at home to realise the untapped potential of agricultural exports. The study revealed many of the barriers that currently exist to be symptomatic of a deeper lack of communication between the three major players in the trade-related policymaking space, that is, 1) the policy makers who formulate the regulation; 2) regulatory agencies, who are unaware of the barriers created by procedures or are unwilling to address them due to the perks and privileges the existing system offers; and 3) private sector traders, who often resort to private solutions to address the barriers. Many of the barriers described can be easily resolved, as demonstrated by the experience of other countries. However, arriving at long-term, sustainable solutions requires a willingness of the government to recognise the importance of domestic barriers and work towards eliminating them. It also requires the persistence of the private sector in holding the regulatory agencies involved in trade accountable in delivering such solutions.

Sri Lankan cricketers should undergo training at an Army camp, says Sports Minister
The Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekera speaking at a certificate awarding ceremony for six hundred students who had completed a six months sports diploma course said that he had suggested to Sri Lanka Cricket to give a six months training at an Army camp for Sri Lankan cricketers as he feels that they lack physical fitness.
Some cricketers are unable to run once they get 25 runs as they suffer from cramps and they have to either continue batting or return to the pavilion as the new ICC rules prohibit the use of a runner. If they are unable to run till they get 50 runs then they should go home. The foreign coaches of the National Team have said that not to over exert the cricketers as they may get a muscle strain but you can see they have put on weight when they remove their shirts.
Some people are saying that just because a catch is dropped a match wont be lost. But in reality the matches are lost due to dropped catches as they are too fat and are unable to dive and take the catch.
Sportsmen and women should indulge in physical fitness from a young age which would keep them in good stead when they are picked for the National Team. That is why I suggested that they should be sent to a Army camp to gain physical fitness. The selfishness of the coaches has resulted in the decline of the sports standard in Sri Lanka as they do not allow young coaches to come up. Still they are using the coaching techniques which were used in the 1960s.
He said children from 6,440 schools are being picked to be trained at 316 schools till 2028. The Sports Ministry will also recruit 23 coaches each from 23 districts and to find out those who could produce athletes who could represent the country at Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games.

A stunning victory
Pakistan stunned the cricketing world by dumping arch rivals India to lift the ICC Championship Trophy to riotous scenes at the London Oval on Sunday. Even its most ardent fan would not have bet his money on a Pakistani victory going by its poor record against India in recent times and especially given its performances in the earlier games in the tournament. On the other hand, India was on a roll (though it lost to Sri Lanka) routing Pakistan in the group stage and all set to deliver the killer punch on the big day, or so it was thought. Hence it is no exaggeration to say the feat achieved by Pakistan would have caused much heartburn to the millions of Indian fans who treat their cricketers as virtual demi-gods.
The victory was reminiscent of the one achieved in 1992 when Pakistan virtually came from behind to beat England in the World Cup final in Melbourne, Australia, under the legendary Imran Khan. On that occasion too the Pakistanis were written off as no hopers after being thrashed in the earlier round of matches before staging an almost miraculous comeback to lift the trophy in the final. Virat Kohli, no doubt, would have rued the couple of no-balls bowled by his front line bowler, if otherwise, would have dismissed the eventual centurion who gave Pakistan a flying start. But that is how the game goes.
Sundays feat would have been doubly significant for the Pakistani cricketers whose country was a no go zone for other test playing nations and had to be content to playing matches in the Middle Eastern deserts all these years since the terrorist attack on the bus transporting the Sri Lankan team members in March 2009. What is more, Pakistan was given the cold shoulder by India refusing to play even at this third country venue due to the increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan, centred on the Kashmir issue, making the victory that much sweeter for the Pakistanis. Another man who must be the happiest at the achievement no doubt will be the Pakistans South African born coach Mickey Arthur who was shabbily treated by the Australian cricket authorities by terminating his contract for taking disciplinary action against some of the Australian cricketers during their tour to India a couple of years ago. It appears that those scorned against had prevailed in the end.
Any cricketing encounter between India and Pakistan is fraught with tension and stakes are high to achieve victory by either side, the hostility naturally having its genesis in the bifurcation of India, giving birth to the nation of Pakistan. There have been attempts to mend fences by way of cricketing diplomacy by leaders of both countries, given the popularity of the game with the public. During the 20111 World Cup hosted by India then Pakistans Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gillani visited India at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Sing to witness the encounter between Indian and Pakistan.
It is hoped that Sundays victory by Pakistan would see a reversal of its cricketing isolation by India. We say this because there is no better electrifying rivalry than when the two old foes meet on a cricket field. The revival of the encounter between the two sides could be the best thing that can happen to the game of cricket which has been losing some of its lustre in recent times. The meeting of the two sides could also help the thawing of relations on the political front and keep the cricketing fans of both countries focused on the game rather than dwell on their historical rivalry wherein the two countries had fought three wars.
Sri Lanka could make common cause with Pakistan in that both sides beat the mighty Indians in the tournament which no doubt is going to make a not inconsiderable dent in the invincibility enjoyed by Indian cricket in recent times. The Indian team no doubt is always under tremendous pressure to win whenever they step onto a cricket field. The mind boggling fortunes earned by some of the Indian cricketers through lucrative sponsorship deals, the heavy overdose of publicity given to the players by Indian sports channels have all exacerbated this pressure, which no doubt is taking a heavy toll on the players, with unforgiving fans expecting nothing less than victory. Thankfully, there have been no incidents where the homes of Indian cricketers have been attacked, as in the past, when they have failed to measure up to expectations of the fans. Kohli and his boys, no doubt, must be mulling on what might have been if only lady luck smiled their way. It would do the cricketers a world of good if the Indian media go easy on the players without promoting them in such a manner that raises the bar on public expectations. Cricket, after all, is only a game and should be considered in that spirit, the glorious uncertainties and all that coming into play. You cannot win all the time.

He was addressing the gathering during the world Blood Donation Day celebrations held at the BMICH in Colombo recently.Senaratne pointed out that the Health Ministry established 19 blood transfusion centres countrywide at a cost of 22 million Euro.
Now Sri Lanka exports blood plasma to foreign countries in order to produce drugs. Soon, an American company will commence producing drugs in Sri Lanka using blood plasma. Human Placenta will also be used to transplant cells.
Unlike in the past, Sri Lanka does not destroy blood donated by donors. The blood donated by donors is kept for ten years. All data of the blood donors will be computerised soon, he added.

Tangible sense of optimism in Lanka - Oxford Business Group
There is a tangible sense of optimism in Sri Lanka, with new trade deals in the pipeline and a shift in the economic landscape towards service-led industries, said Oxford Business Group Managing Editor for Asia, Paulius Kuncinas.
Sometimes overlooked, Sri Lanka has a fascinating story to tell, which most recently includes 15 years of continuous growth, he said.
With ambitious plans that include transforming the country into an international transport hub and driving new growth in the greater Colombo region, the governments bid to take Sri Lankas development to the next level looks to be well on track.
Commenting after the launch of its Report on Sri Lanka 2017 recently, Kuncinas said the Groups report indicated that the reforms that are needed to help Sri Lanka reach its long-term goal of securing sustainable and inclusive economic growth were taking shape.
While the post-war years have brought impressive economic expansion and investor interest, pockets of poverty and inequalities remain an issue, he said.
Our findings suggest that Sri Lankas new government is already moving to realign its economic policy and address these weaknesses, while embarking on an infrastructural overhaul that will undoubtedly sit well with investors eyeing the countrys many opportunities.
The Report marks the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group.
The publication assesses trends and developments across the economy, including those in macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and others.

Treasury bond auction:  AG quizzed on basis of loss calculation
Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva yesterday questioned the basis of the loss calculation done by the Auditor General on the questioned Treasury bond auction which took place on February 27, 2015. De Silva suggested that the basis on which the AG has done the calculation seem rather nave.
Auditor General H.M. Gamini Wijesinghe denied the suggestion and said the loss calculation was done on the basis that the government incurred a loss by shifting from direct placement method to a full auction based method when issuing Treasury bonds.
AG Wijesinghe was then requested to explain the formula with which he calculated the possible loss incurred by the government at the 27 February 2015 auction.
One element used in the formula to calculate the loss was the amount of bids offered at a Treasury bond auction, it was revealed. The amount of bids offered is advertised prior to the auction date. The amount of bids offered was used as the cutoff point in the calculation formula, AG wijesinghe said.
Arjun Mahendrans legal counsel Chanaka de Silva asked AG Wijesinghe, if it is correct to take the bids advertised as the cutoff point and should not the AGs department calculate losses incurred by all the Treasury bond auctions, where the accepted bids supersedes the advertised amount of bids.
The Supreme Court Judge Justice P.S. Jayawardena said the formula is based on a simple method, to which De Silva said he would rather suggest the term simplistic. Justice Jayawardena said, the common wisdom is that simplicity is a virtue, adding some amusement to the serious questioning directed against the Auditor General on his report to COPE committee.
It was also pointed out there is no formula or a method followed to decide on the amount of bids advertised prior to an auction. De Silva also questioned AG Wijesinghe on his opinion that the hypothesized loss incurred at the questioned auction was caused by the change into the auction method from the direct placement method.
De Silva asked why the Central Bank still issue treasury bonds using the auction method, if the auction method cause losses to the government.
It was also revealed at the Commission that the Auditor General had not included the official option sheet submitted to the Tender Board at the 27 February 2015 board meeting.
There are two option sheets regarding the 27 February 2015 auction. The first sheet was not submitted to the Tender Board, which was initially prepared by the Public Debt Department. This sheet suggests accepting 2.068 billion from the auction. The Public Debt Department has prepared the second option sheet when a directive was given by former Governor Arjun Mahendran to accept 10.5 billion. This option sheet, which was submitted and approved by the Tender Board, is accepted as the official option sheet for the 27 February 2015 auction.
Asked as to why the official option sheet was not incorporated in the report submitted to the COPE committee, AG Wijesinghe said, they were not aware of such an option sheet. We did not receive such a sheet when we were conducting the audit and preparing the report, AG Wijesinghe said.
AG Wijesinghe said his department only got to know about the second option sheet verbatim from the COPE report.
Former Governor Mahendrans lawyer also pointed out to the Commission that the AG has also not incorporated the Time Sheet of the questioned auction in his audit report submitted to the COPE . The Time Sheet depicts the times at which the Central Bank has received the bids of every Primary Dealer.
De Silva asked AG Wijesinghe if it was not important to annex the Time Sheet, when he has stated that the bids received at the last eight minutes of the questioned auction appeared suspicious.
Commissioner Justice Jayawradena pointed out, that these documents should have been incorporated in the audit report submitted by the AG to the COPE inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.
De Silva suggested that the AG has misled the COPE and the Sri Lanka Parliament, by not providing all the information in the report and by reaching to conclusions regarding the questioned auction only at surface level. AG Wijesinghe denied the suggestion.
De Silva pointed out to the Commission that there are striking similarities between the COPE report on the questioned auction and the AGs report on the same matter.
The two documents that were not included in the audit report were included in the analysis of the questioned auction, provided to the Commission by AG Wijesinghe.

Unraveling the magic of Mannar
The Book Launch Discover Mannar by Amrith Gnanam left absolutely nothing to the imagination. From what the authors father and Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda said and from the leaflets handed out at the book launch, it was like discovering one of those lost lands. We all know and have heard about Mannar but the way the place was presented at the Book Launch, it was like one of those mythological lands that some say are real. But Mannar definitely is real and it is one of Sri Lankas most exciting destinations.
This book contains everything you need to know about the Gulf of Mannar. It has rich biodiversity and complex eco-systems, created thanks to a unique mixture of forests, inland wetlands, coastal, marine and agricultural lands. The book is a product of extensive research and fervent exploration done over the years, said Amrith Gnanam.
Gnanam did not dream that the book would turn into such an extensive endeavor.
We do have regular visitors to this isolated spot in the country and Mannar has been making a regular appearances in the local newspapers. Sadly none of the history books give it its due importance. In my opinion this is a missed opportunity. Mannar is rich with history and abundant in nature. I have made sure that what is presented in the book is accurate and reliable and have visited the place several times. I can confidently say that it is very precise. I hope this book will fulfill its purpose which is giving publicity to Mannar. I feel it is interesting and exciting. I thank god for creating such a beautiful place in Sri Lanka. I feel I am very lucky getting the chance to write about Mannar which is an experience that is wondrous, explained Gnanam
At the Book Launch were told that Mannar, though known to be a birding hotspot, is actually a potpourri of hidden attractions to enchant every type of traveler, whether he/she is a birding enthusiast, archaeology fanatic or an adventure seeker.
It is lovely that this project has been realized. I am proud to have been consulted on this. The importance of documenting living history including our rich bio-diversity, with the intention of attracting real nature lovers and for future generation to refer, ultimately contributes to conservation. I want to point out a few facts that are not in the book but some that I think would be of interest. The reason Mannar has become a place of historical interest is because it was very much the center of the classical maritime silk route. In addition to that kind of commerce, Mannar also became a destination for rich Cinnamon. Sri Lanka was reasonably known at that time. And we know those commodities made their way into the West. Mannar is also known for its pearl fishing. There as a time when pearl fishery was hugely important. Mannar is also a site for beautiful relics  bits of Chinese pottery and ancient coins, stone inscriptions, bangles and chains  an incredible wealth of history dating back to the time of Christ. This beautiful heritage must be preserved. It is a unique site worth visiting, said leading naturalist Rohan Pethiyagoda who accepted the first copy of the travel guide.
Raja Gnanam the proud father of Amrith Gnanam in his address pointed out that book is a great discovery of Mannar highlighting the natural beauty of Mannar
Sri Lanka as an island has so much to offer. So much to discover. So many different species. We have so much to offer that is found nowhere else in the world. Mannar is the largest island in our island. This little island is packed with so many gifts of nature. What we have in Mannar is the stuff of imagination. And the book encapsulates all of this. The landscape of Mannar is simply magnificent with so much exploration to be done and so much more to discover. When you talk about animals it has the wild donkeys, wild horses and ponies. In the seas you have the Dugongs. One thing that cannot be forgotten is that it is an excellent site for bird watching and you can see the raptors. It is not only the raptors but a wide array of birds can be seen there, said Raja Gnanam.
The travel guide comes very close to a coffee table book complete with a captivating collection of photographs by the author himself and his two collaborators, Ajith Ratnayaka, little-known yet outstanding nature photographer and celebrated naturalist Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne. The three of them each give a unique perspective to walk the traveler through a picturesque idyll all set to charm everyone who is interested to Discover Mannar.
Ajith Ratnayaka shares a rare set of photos taken during his many visits to this nature lovers haven, Mannar, covering the full range of forgotten places of historical importance, the natural beauty of the island and a vast variety of migratory and local endemic birds.
Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne, no stranger to wildlife and photography, and a champion of the cause to make Sri Lanka an all-round wildlife destination describes the hidden potential of Mannar as a tourist hub that is yet to be fully explored.

Violence and hate speech are threats to reconciliation: Zuhair
With a debt burden of 83% of the GDP, this country cannot afford another ethnic or religious confrontation. Extremist violent attacks and hate speeches are serious threats to the on-going programme of national reconciliation and integration, said former Member of Parliament M.M. Zuhair.
He said this at the Breaking-Fast-Ifthar gathering organized by the Medical Students Muslim Majlis of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo at the faculty auditorium at Kynsey Road on Saturday, where he was the chief guest. Medicine Faculty Dean Professor Jennifer Perera, Professor Rizvi Sheriff, Professor Shalini Sri Renganathan, Medical Faculty Senior Lecturer Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa and Majlis President M.S.M Arshad presided.
Recent floods and landslides destroyed over 213 lives with tremendous damage to properties. Restoration of the damage is said to cost Rs. 9 billion and the government is compelled to seek foreign donations. Thirty two people were killed, earlier on, in the garbage dump tragedy. Extremist violent attacks on the minorities will strike at the root of the countrys unity and the peaceful co-existence of the people. It will cause irreparable damage to the economy against the background of the heavy burden of loan repayments, he added.
Zuhair urged Muslims to avoid isolation and establish closer cordial relations with other communities. "Sinhalese are tolerant and compassionate people influenced by Buddhism. A small minority is attempting to divide us into ethnic and religious factions. Sri Lanka is still paying the price for the July '83 riots which led to the diaspora confronting internationally, every Sri Lankan government that came to power since then. We cannot afford another disaster. It is important that we join hands as Sri Lankans and strengthen unity and good understanding," he said.
Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Professor Jennifer Perera said, none of the four major religions support conflicts. All the religions encourage good conduct and a disciplined society. Tolerance and understanding of differences strengthen national unity.
The Ifthar or breaking fast get together, attended by medical students belonging to all religions is a good example of ethnic and religious unity.
She commended the Muslim Majlis for organizing this fellowship.
Guest Speaker Ash-Sheikh Fazil Farook said fasting helps to medicate our hearts. There is an element within us that directs us towards the good and the bad. Good conduct is the key for peace and harmony. Fasting helps to discipline ourselves. Without discipline, we cannot progress as a nation.
Senior Lecturer of the Faculty Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa explained the activities of the Majlis. He said the Majlis encourages extra-curricular services for the benefit of all the people.
Students get the opportunity of moving beyond their studies for public service, independent of ethnic or religious considerations. Majlis President M.S.M. Arshad and Secretary Fathima Saneeja also addressed the gathering.

Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa said at Sevanagala, it was people of Sri Lanka that utilized rainwater without waste during ancient times. But today, it is Thailand that collects water methodically.
The minster said so addressing a meeting at Sadarajamaha Vidyalaya at Kiribbanara in Sevanagala.
We must concentrate on renovating the existing tanks and reservoirs and setup new reservoirs and rain water-harvesting methods.
At the same time, major and minor irrigation complexes should be renovated and given a new lease of life. There is a sector of people who hold protest campaigns against these with the assistance of NGOs and other institutions, he added.
The minister said, when a reservoir is set up anew, several houses have to be relocated and animals and the environment suffer, but it has to be done by paying due compensation to the people who lose their dwellings.
He added that during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, he went to commence construction of the Kubukkanoya project, but there was a strong protest against it.
Certain MPs there said that if the Kubukkanoya project was implemented, seventy thousand square miles in the area will get inundated, the minister said.

World Cup final 2015-New Zealand vs Australia
This was it, the big occasion; Australia fronted up with New Zealand, in front of a massive crowd of 100,000, there next door neighbor on March 29, 2015. The atmosphere was electric; New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat.
Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum strode out to the crease to open and Starc opened the bowling for Australia. Martin took first strike for the Kiwis and opened scoring with a nudge down to third man, the next ball was a late in dipper and had McCullum beaten all ends up and the very next one had his castle shattered, with this wicket of McCullums New Zealands hopes were somewhat shattered.
Kane Williams was the next man in and Josh Hazelwood was the other bowler, 6 for 1 off 2 overs. Starc was hitting the bat hard and Guptill reached for the ball which was overpithed and stroked it through covers for four, 11 for 1.
Guptill was going pell mell, and top edged a miscalculated hook for a six off Hazelwood, 17 for 1 off 4 overs. Williamson at the other end was dawdling along without scoring for 11 balls and then edged Starc for a single. Starc was bowling line and length swinging the ball either way making life difficult for Williamson in particular, his tactics to keep Guptill calm was to bowl outside the off stump moving the ball away from him,this enabled the score to be kept at 23 for 1 after 7 overs. Australian fielding was spot on and must have saved about a dozen runs.
It was 24 for I after 9 overs, Williamson at last managed to drive Hazelwood past mid-off for four, Australia was calling the shots at the moment, Johnson was beating Williamson back to back with late swing but without luck, then all of a sudden Guptill went, getting bowled playing up to a pitched up ball.
Ross Taylor the next man in was greeted with a juicy full toss and dispatched it to the long off boundary for four, 38 for 2 off 12 overs. Williamsons misery ends when he lobs a return catch to Johnson, 41 for 3 off 12 overs. Grant Elliot was the new man in. Hazelwoods pinpoint accuracy seems to bother Taylor, 47 for 3 off 15 overs, James Faulkner came to the attack to join Hazelwood and runs seems to run dry, at this stage New Zealand could not lose a wicket as these two were the last of repute. Elliot cuts loose and drove Starc through mid-off and extra cover for four and then cut Maxwell for four and he moved to 22 off 25 balls, 77 for 3 off 22 overs, run rate was found wanting at 3.5. Elliot now took the bull by the horns top edged Starc for six and hoisted Maxwell over cover for four which brought the fifty partnership off 69 balls.
Elliot sparkled again this time through the covers for four and he was on a run a ball 45 and up went the hundred for New Zealand, Taylor played the anchor role but treated the loose balls well, he guided a short and wide ball from Watson through vacant slip for four. The batsmen at that moment was dealing with only threes and twos mainly due to the huge size of the ground coupled with the brilliant fielding of the Aussies. However Elliot was daring and he tipped Hazelwood for four over slips which brought the hundred partnership up, 144 for 3 off 33.3 overs. Elliot tipped Watson past the keeper for four, 150 for 3 off 35 overs, Ross Taylor went caught behind by Haddin off Faulkner and Anderson got yorked by the same bowler for 0, 150 for 5 off 35.3 overs, Ronchi came and went, 152 for 6 off 37 overs. Finally New Zealand reached 183, thanks to a brave knock of 82 off 83 balls by Elliott. It was an outstanding effort of bowling and fielding by Australia.
The Australians started their innings rather shakily, Finch got out to a Bolt inswinger for 2. Warner and Smith put on a fifty run partnership, 56 for 1 off 10 overs, New Zealand tried hard to break this partnership but the batsmen were well set. Warner got too adventurous and tried the hook shot once too often and paid the price, caught by Elliot at mid-wicket for 45.
It was a historic moment now as Clarke came to the wicket for the last time on his one day career. After a scratchy start Clarke was on song, and unleashed his full repertoire of strokes, he was out for 74, and got a standing ovation from the massive crowd.
Micheal Clarke has always been a gentle type of a captain, an emotional type unlike Steve Waugh and Allan Border, this I feel adds sanity to the proceedings rather than the win at any cost attitude, adopted by even the Indians today. The Indians recently got the beating of their life from the Sri Lankans by trying to be too cocky and emotional and the Sri Lankans showed their metal in the end upsetting all odds.

Govt spent Rs 7 bn for natural disasters
Tissa Jayawera, past Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, said that the Government was very unfortunate as it was forced to spend around Rs.7 billion for various uncalled for natural disasters this year.
These along with the global downturn led the country towards a lower economic growth rate of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2017, he said.
He said that for the recent floods alone, Government had to spend around Rs. 3 billion.
In addition, the drought situation prompted the Government to spend around another Rs. 2 billion and a near Rs. 1 billion for the Meethotamulla garbage issue.
He said that the Salawa blast along with several other similar man-made and natural disasters also forced Government to move away from investing in infrastructure. (SS)

Harm and spells can do nothing to President
No damage could be done to President Maitripala Sirisena by so-called callous means of harm and spell as long as he enjoys the love and faith of masses, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
He made the above assertions in response to a question raised by the media regarding certain rumours spread over the country about harm and spell stories connected to the President these days.
Since ancient times, people of the country believed in harm and spell practices. In the contemporary society also, there are sections of people who trust these occult practices.
However, no harm could be done to any politicians who have won the real and enduring love and faith of public. President Maitripala Sirisena is such a political leader who is greatly loved by the people. He is well-protected by peoples love and affection against any forms of harm and spell Chief Minister observed, the minister added.
President has obviously declared that he could not be discouraged or dispirited by such mean occult practices.
Owing to such malicious schemes, President becomes more fortified and resilient in his forward march. No one can stop him in his firm robust political journey, he said.

Importers suffer cargo damage, loss at ports
The Sri Lanka Shippers Council called for a total liberalization of the maritime sector where all walls have to be brought down if Sri Lanka is to benefit much more from the maritime sector.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Shippers Council Immediate Past Chairman Sean Van Dort alleged that their importers suffer cargo damage, loss of cargo at container de-stuffing points and corruption at all levels because the infrastructure in ports has been developed only for ship handling.
Everyone has forgotten about backyard operations, he said. In order to expedite their clearing process, happy money seems to be the only way out.
He further noted that there will still be agency networks required to handle ships and husbanding requirements since terminals are privatized. Commenting on the e-documentation initiative, he said that the commitment of Government is required to make it possible by the end of this year.
To this end, draconian laws of the Customs Ordinance and the Ports Authority Act must be looked at strongly with willingness to change.

Luxury real estate sector in Colombo may see oversupply soon
Sri Lankas real estate sector in the luxury segment in Colombo city may see an oversupply in four years time, said Paul Dwyer, Director, Indola Group, which is building Dusit Thanis Beachfront residencies in Balapitiya.
This is the reason we decided to invest in the real estate sector out of Colombo which has proved to be very successful. The first tower with 40 apartments has already been sold out, mostly to foreign buyers, he said.
He was speaking at Lamudis Third Real Estate Expo last Saturday at the North Lawn, Taj Samudra.
Acquest CEO Chandaka de Soysa noted that over the last four years Sri Lankas real estate market has experienced tremendous growth driven mainly by local demand.
All the large-scale projects have sold well in relation to the stage of construction they are currently in.
De Soysa anticipates demand to remain strong in the medium term with increased interest from Sri Lankan expatriate buyers and growing domestic demand.
Constructing an ideal platform for all real estate requirements, the leading property portal Lamudi launched its first-ever real estate exhibition in May 2016.
The event received immense popularity and responses which led the company to introduce its second expo in September 2016.
During the event, Raintree Residencies launched its latest upcoming projects while developers like Capitol Twinpeaks, HomeLands Skyline, Iconic Galaxy and Global Housing too displayed their latest projects.
Visitors were able to view and discover these projects in 3D models obtaining a clear vision of every project.

A new taxation bill will be presented to Parliament within the next two months to introduce a consistent and a stable taxation act, Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikotha, United National Party (UNP) Headquarters yesterday, he said that actions would be taken to reduce and completely abolish several taxes gradually over a period of time, while the Value Added Tax (VAT) would be unaffected under the new act.
The State Minister said arrangements would be made to omit tax holidays according to the new taxation act and tax concessions would be provided only for few selected fields.
Taxes are the main source of income for a government to fund development projects of a country and it is a compulsory payment made by every citizen without any partiality.
Therefore, a governments aim must not be to adapt a taxation policy accepted by every citizen but develop a simple and a consistent policy to refrain from creating any uncertainties in the future, he said.
He said nine commissioners including retired judges of the Supreme or the Appeal Courts and officers with the experience in finance management and taxation would be appointed to the Tax Appeals Commission to overcome the shortage of expertise to handle issues related to taxation in the country.

Arthur eager for World XI visit to Pakistan after Champions Trophy triumph
LONDON: Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said he hoped a proposed World XI visit to the country later this year went ahead after his side served notice of their enduring talent with a stunning Champions Trophy final win over India.
Bottom-ranked Pakistan produced a breathtaking display at Londons Oval on Sunday to inflict a 180-run defeat upon arch rivals India, the title-holders, in the climax of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international nations.
Pakistan made 338 for four, with Fakhar Zamans 114 -- the left-handed openersmaiden ODI hundred -- the cornerstone.
Mohammad Amir then reduced India to 33 for three by dismissing all the members of their much vaunted top three, with Rohit Sharma out for a duck and opposing skipper Virat Kohli, the worlds leading ODI batsman, falling for just five. India eventually collapsed to 158 all out as they suffered their heaviest defeat, by runs, in 129 ODIs against Pakistan.
With the exception of Zimbabwes tour two years ago, Pakistan have had to play all of their home matches outside of the country since a 2009 terror attack on Sri Lankas team bus in Lahore.
However, the International Cricket Council are set to send a World XI to Pakistan in September. That team could find themselves acting as a path-finder for the resumption of tours of Pakistan by major cricket nations.
Giles Clarke, the president of the England and Wales Cricket Board and head of the ICCs Pakistan task force said, in comments reported by the Guardian in March: The desire is to give the cricket-starved Pakistani supporters the chance to see some of the worlds finest players in live action.
Furthermore, the terrorists cannot win and cricket must not give up on Pakistan. Arthur for one was looking forward to the series.
Were scheduled to have a World XI in Pakistan in September for three Twenty20 games, he said.
So hopefully that starts paving the way for future tours. We can only hope. Pakistans victory on Sunday was all the more astounding given a 124-run defeat by India in their tournament opener at Edgbaston on June 4.

Attention to accident prevention
The country is witnessing rapid urbanization and as the city expands further into the hinterland, it brings with it various pitfalls, and the biggest one of all is lack of emphasis on management of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH).
Last month, the country was shocked at the collapse of the Excellency building in Wellawatte. For a few weeks, many tracked down the authorities that had granted permission for such a building to be built and many put out theories on why it had collapsed. Few however, looked into the victims of the collapse; the construction workers themselves who came to be in such a dangerous situation. A handful looked into the wider issue of occupational safety within industries and construction sites in general, and this issue has been ignored by the relevant authorities though safety management is all about preventing occupational injuries and creating a safer environment for the employees.
We definitely have serious lapses in the existing occupational safety sector where Sri Lanka is concerned, said National Institute of Occupational safety and Health (NIOSH) Director General Dr. Champika Amarasinghe, speaking to the Daily News.
They do not understand that the injuries can cause health impairment. Injuries cause destructive consequences not only to the victim but also to the family and to the society as well, she added.
Occupational injuries  not considered as a major issue
The number of injuries as a result of lack of attention to health and safety has increased considerably over the years. As a result, the Non-Communicable Disease Unit, the National Focal Point for Injury Prevention in the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, has formulated the National Policy and Strategic Framework on Injury Prevention in collaboration with other relevant ministries, professionals and civil society.
In the Cabinet memorandum on the National Framework, the Health Ministry revealed that road traffic accidents were the number one cause for injury related deaths claiming around 2,500 lives annually.
Moreover, accidents related to poisoning, falls, drowning, violence, suicides and homicides also claimed more than thousand lives annually. While more than a million people get inward care, many more are affected due to injuries.
Health Ministry data also further noted that trauma was the leading cause of hospitalization in Sri Lanka; accounting for almost 600,000 patients per year in government hospitals.
The ministry thus highlighted that the burden of injuries was projected to increase in the next decade as a result of the rapid changes in lifestyles of people due to urbanization, industrialization, mechanization and infrastructure development if appropriate preventive strategies were not implemented.
Despite the wide consultations however, the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations which is the responsible authority to regularize industrial safety and health, one of the officials attached to the ministry said that they were not consulted when formulating the above national policy.
He said that the ministry on its own was taking measures to prevent injuries caused to the work force.
Occupational injuries are not reported regularly
The National Institute of Occupational safety and Health (NIOSH) is a self-financing body under the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union Relations. This institute was formed upon the need to promote total physical and emotional well-being among working Sri Lankans by providing information, training, education, research, surveys, solutions and management systems that ensure progressive safety and health in working environments.
Amarasinghe said globally, 2.3 million people die due to work related accidents and yet in Sri Lanka, very little attention is paid to this sector.
There is also a view that injuries are caused only in constructions sites, which is not true, she said. She further explained that road accidents have been ignored and they are not considered as occupational injury or death caused while working.
Road accidents of drivers should also be added to the occupational fatalities. But, they are neglected, she said.
Amarasinghe claimed that as a result, occupational injuries are not reported accordingly.
Accident information collection does not function well and many cases are not reported. With the increase of high rise buildings, the issue has been taken to another level. There are no proper statistics to reveal or there are no evidence to speak in numbers, she said.
Need to ensure safety and health at construction sites
Amarasinghe highlighted that according to the Factories Ordinance, the injuries need to be reported by the employer, but that has not been happening.
The occupational injuries especially at the construction sites are not being reported, she said.
Meanwhile, the Labour Ministry official said that the system has not been active, but the ministry was taking several initiatives currently with the increase in high rise buildings and construction sites in the country.
Amarasinghe said the work force of Sri Lanka was around 8.7 million and it is the responsibility of the relevant authorities to create awareness and assist the labour force of the country.
Factory Inspecting Engineers attached to the Ministry of Labour and Trade Relations are responsible with regard to checking on the quality of construction and ensuring the safety of the employees. And yet, ministry sources revealed that they do not have enough Factory Inspecting Engineers and that they need to increase their cadre.
The source said that with the increase of construction sites and development buildings in Colombo and other areas, it has been a challenge for the officers to manage it all.
Sometimes, the employers try to hide the work related injuries caused to the employees and they settle the issue by providing them compensation. The existing system has to be strengthened further, he said.
Meanwhile, Amarasinghe said, Sri Lanka did not have proper guidelines and no national standards to ensure occupational safety and health.
She further said that NIOSH had the authority to inspect the places only if the employer or the company requested the institution and even then they did not have powers to take legal action against the employer and added that the power to inspect the construction sites and factories lay in the hands of the Department of Labour. Amarasinghe said the public were also not aware of these and they do not tend to inform it to the relevant institution.
The NIOSH thus far has been able to train nearly 1,500 safety officers.
We do training programmes when the industries or the employers request us to do so. Even the industrial owners have a responsibility to reduce the amount of occupational accidents, she said.
Healthy workers equal productive workers
Industrial Hygienist Ramya Jamburegoda said that the work place needed to be safe and hygienic to minimise occupational injuries and accidents and to prevent workplace diseases in order to improve the productivity of the industry by a healthy work force.
It should create an environment for the employees to work with minimum danger. Dust and noise are two major problems in the occupation sector. The employees face many long term health impairment due employers failing to test and take measures to ensure their health and well- being, she said.
Speaking further on the hygiene and health safety in the construction sector, she said the government authorities with power and the employers are responsible for the well-being of the employees.
She said that as a developing country it was necessary to ensure the safety of the Sri Lankan work force.
B.P.L.M. Ranjith, a Construction Engineer from Colombo in the meantime, explained that while they always insisted that the workers wear their boots and helmets while working, they tend to ignore their advice.
He agreed that they did not usually inform the Department of Labour when an employee was injured.
We try to solve it among ourselves. We do not report it, the employer would give compensation and solve the problem, he said.
A.P. Gunawardena an engineer who also supervises more than three high rise buildings in Colombo said that recently the government institutions have been more concerned whether the constructions are authorised or not but they do not check on the occupational safety of the employees.
I have been involved in the construction sector for more than two decades. I have seen the consequences of improper hygiene and safety in the construction field. Therefore, I always ensure that the employees wear all the required equipment while they are engaged in work, he said.
Gunawardena further said that safety measures are usually taken by the employers and the construction engineers and added that they do not seek help from any government institution to ensure safety.
We need not want to tarnish the name of our construction company, therefore we ensure that our employees are safe and healthy, he said. Another engineer from Colombo M.L. Weerakoon said that it was very hard for him to convince the employees at the construction site to wear helmets.
They did not want to wear helmets before, but now it is slowly changing. We finally managed to convince them to wear helmets, he said.
As the country gears towards steady and incremental economic growth, Amarasinghe pointed out that it was very important and timely to invest and improve the health of the workers who would be taking Sri Lanka forward.

Baywatch : Tanked!
Baywatch has had much hype and has been much looked forward to due to two reasons: the remaking of a well loved television series in new light and Priyanka Chopras debut to Hollywood. However as the wafer-thin plot unfolds all expectations go down the drain.
Firstly the movie does not have anything unique to offer. It is also not done cleverly enough to be enjoyed by the matured moviegoer. The movie takes a comic approach and revolves around an elite lifeguard crew, headed by Mitch Buchannon, who must stick together to keep their shores clean and secure from baddie Victoria Leeds.
Impossibly muscled Dwayne Johnson plays Mitch Buchannon, leader of the lifeguards. His exchanges with Zac Efrons disgraced Olympic swimmer, Matt Brody, get only a few sniggers. Then there is Alexandra Daddario, who is Summer Quinn, a new recruit, who looks like Annabeth Chase in skimpy clothes. Priyanka Chopra is the evil Victoria tossing her hair, pouting and wearing slinky little numbers with plunging necklines. Sadly she does not even get a bikini moment in the tale.
Lack connection
Slapstick comedy is expected when Ronnie tries to woo the hot looking C J Parker. The editing too is not done well as Victoria and her two lame sidekicks entrance seem out of place. The scenes lack connection and the characters have zilch chemistry. This is one of the main reasons why the film finds it hard to stay afloat.
There is too much focus on the perfect bodies of the lifeguards. However the sad fact is that both Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach are very forgettable as babes in red. They cannot compete with the likes of Pamela Anderson or any of the other legendary Baywatch cast who were breathtaking in their attire a couple of decades back.
One of the highlights in the movie is members of the previous television show: David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson making cameo appearances. However the downside of the matter is that they seem rather lost in the process.
Lively action
Director Seth Gordon should have taken an original path in the movie and made a production with sea, sun and sand with a psychotic shark thrown in. Then we could have had some lively action in Baywatch. However with the hero-villain approach found in almost every movie that hits the big screen, Baywatch tires it audience. It seems to drag on and we can only heave a sigh of relief as the story ends.
Unfunny, cheaply-produced, and let down by a cast which lacks oomph, it is not difficult to see why there were no clearer skies for Baywatch.

With the begging bowl
The Grenfell Tower blaze where most of those who perished, or who lost everything in the flames, were Black and Minority Ethnic people, and they were all poor living on a council estate triggered this article. What happened at Grenfell Tower is part of a larger issue of structural inequality in general, and housing in particular, in which the poor are pushed out of quality housing in favour of regenerating the city for affluent and largely white renters and buyers.
The tragedy of Grenfell Tower is one of both race and class. Earlier this year, the Conservative Party voted down a bill that would have required to make landlords provide liveable housing, and its easy to understand why. By the Guardians reckoning, 39% of Tory MPs were landlords, with nearly a quarter of MPs across all parties owning rental properties. The residents of Grenfell Tower didnt have much of a voice in Parliament, and they dont have much of a voice in the local council. They are however fighting back with anger in the community on the manner in which the poor are treated.
Vagabonds ordinance in Sri Lanka
We in Sri Lanka have also dealt with the poor over the years. A survey on the problem of beggars was made in 1954 in then Ceylon. Based on the information in XI Sessional Papers of 1956, the question of poverty was addressed along with the recommendation made by the special subcommittee appointed the Minister to eliminate shortcomings in the Vagabonds Ordinance, and as a result detention homes were set up.
The detention homes that functioned under the Vagabonds Ordinance and the Detention Homes Ordinance vested in the Department in 1950 was housed in Gangodawila Detention Home and an additional Detention Home was commenced in 1975 in Ridiyagama, Hambantota. Arrangements were made to set up a home in Senapura, Anuradhapura to rehabilitate destitute families in 1988.
Department of Social Services
The issue of Food Stamps under the destitute relief programme was vested with the Department of Social Services in 1985. Accordingly more than half of the entire population was served by the Department of Social Services Department.
When the Department of Poor Relief was set up in 1990 relief work was entrusted to the Department of Poor Relief. The main functions at the beginning of the Department in 1948 was the implementation of a monthly public allowance, disaster relief, Workmens Compensation, maintenance of Homes for the Elderly, providing financial support to voluntary organisations.
A scheme to provide a monthly allowance to obtain nutritious food for poor people who suffered from tuberculosis was started in 1953 and in 1959 a similar scheme was started to assist leprosy patents. In 1996 Circulars were issued to assist thalassemia patients by providing assistance in a sum of Rs.500.00.
Homes for the elderly were established in Koggala in 1951, in Anuradhapura in 1952, in Kaithady in 1954 and in Mirigama in 1957.
What do experts say
Freedom - from poverty, hunger and exploitation - of the lowliest, the poor people in the country remains a struggle. The poor have neither the skills nor the assets to respond to market signals. Hence markets have very little relevance to them.
Criticising the WTO agreement - which brought agriculture within its framework for the first time - as inherently unequal among nations, Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, the renowned agricultural scientist has stressed the need for India to become livelihood secure from being food secure.
Amartya Sen observed on some occasion, The design of public services depends in any country on what the powerful groups of that society see as important and imperative. For example, generally infectious diseases tend to receive much more attention than other maladies such as undernourishment do. The battle against infectious diseases has been a success story in the world - eliminating small pox, vastly reducing malaria, cutting down cholera and so on. Even the poor get a lot of attention and support when they have infectious diseases - partly for good humanitarian reasons but also because the possibility of the diseases spreading to others worries the more privileged members of the society. I sometimes wonder whether there is any way of making poverty terribly infectious. If the privileged could catch poverty from the poor they meet in the street, I do not doubt at all that poverty would be eliminated with remarkable speed.
World Bank senior economist, David Newhouse commenting on Sri Lanka says, efforts to further improve living standards of the poor should focus on promoting further structural transformation and urbanization. Roughly 28 percent of the workforce, and about half of the working poor, toil in the agriculture sector. Many of the poor live in peri-urban areas  over half of the poor are estimated to live within 30 km of a main agglomeration area.
Policies that help connect these workers to productive employment opportunities off the farm can contribute to sustainable poverty reduction. This is a long term agenda, however, and it will take years if not decades to reduce agricultural employment below 10 percent.
In the meantime, poor farmers and agricultural labourers need help to generate the income to allow them to invest in the human capital of their children. Farmers and agricultural labourers could benefit greatly from practical infrastructure investments, such as water storage tanks, irrigation facilities, fertilizer and seeds, electricity, and roads that would make them more productive. In addition, microfinance programmes that offer loans at reasonable interest rates that can be repaid post-harvest, rather than every month, could also facilitate productive investment among smallholder farmers.

BMICH awarded Green Certification
Re-asserting its longstanding commitment to the environment, the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike National Memorial Foundation (BMICH) was recently recognised with the prestigious ISO 14064-1:2006 pollution control certification, awarded by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund.
The ISO 14064-1:2006 certification specifies principles and requirements at organisation level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals.
It includes requirements for the design, development, management, reporting and verification of an organisation's GHG inventory.
Awarded locally by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund, a private-public partnership company under the purview of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, this standard was developed in 2006 by the Switzerland-based International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).
BMICH earned this important accreditation through its stringent and careful management of GHG, limiting them to 1472.85 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions across all direct and indirect sources for the period in question.
We are honoured to be selected as Sri Lanka's first convention and exhibition venue to be awarded the prestigious ISO 14064 certification. The award is a welcome recognition of the BMICH's many initiatives to restrict carbon emissions, ensuring a better future for all Sri Lankans, said a spokesperson.
BMICH also participated in Earth Hour 2017 as a part of its holistic green efforts.
BMICH is the winner of the coveted Gold Century International Quality ERA Award - Geneva 2016. It was also adjudged the Leading Meeting and Convention South Asia Venue at the South Asian Travel Awards last year.

Brooks Koepka wins 117th US Open
Erin, Monday: Brooks Koepka produced a back-nine birdie blitz to win the US Open here Sunday, becoming the seventh consecutive first-time winner of a major with a record-equalling four-shot victory at Erin Hills.
The 27-year-old from Florida fired a five-under-par final round 67 to finish on 16 under for the tournament following a tense duel with compatriot Brian Harman that was settled on the home stretch at the rural Wisconsin course.
Koepkas 16-under-par total equalled the record for the lowest winning under par total at a US Open set by Rory McIlroy at the 2011 championship.
Thats probably one of the coolest things Ive ever experienced and to do it on Fathers Day its pretty neat, Koepka said afterwards.
I didnt exactly get my dad a card, so this works.
I felt confident all week. So to feel as confident as I did on a Sunday of a major and coming down the stretch was pretty neat.
Third round leader Brian Harman, who had led by one-shot at the start of the round, finished second on 12 under after an even-par 72. He tied with Japanese world number four Hideki Matsuyama, who shot a superb six-under-par 66.
It bites a little bit right now, Harman said afterwards. But Brooks played so well today. The conditions were so tough.
Englands Tommy Fleetwood was alone in fourth place on 11 under after a level-par final round of 72.
Harman and Koepka spent much of the round locked at the top of the leaderboard.
But the turning point in a gripping war of nerves came just after the turn when Harman struggled through back-to-back bogeys on the 12th and 13th.
World number 22 Koepka then uncorked a brilliant trio of birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th holes to surge into a four-shot lead and virtually assure himself of the title.
That was kind of lights out, Harman said. I mean, youve got to tip your cap. He went and won the golf tournament on the back nine. Ive done it before, but he did it today.
Koepkas win extended a remarkable run of victories by players who had never previously won a major. Since Jason Day lifted the 2015 PGA Championship, every major championship has been won by a first-timer.
Koepka, a close friend and training partner of world number one and 2016 US Open champion Dustin Johnson, had only won one title on the PGA Tour since turning professional in 2012.
With strong winds buffeting the 7,721-yard layout at Erin Hills earlier in the day, Mother Nature had appeared poised to bite back after three days of benign conditions which led to a feast of low-scoring.
But with the gusts gradually weakening over the course of the afternoon, Koepka and Harman picked up where they left on Saturday, seamlessly getting into the groove early on to jump ahead of the field.
Koepka was the first to strike, making a birdie on the first to go to 12 under and take a share of the lead. He then chipped to a few feet for a straightforward birdie to move to 13 under.
Harman, playing in the final pairing immediately behind Koepka, then rolled in a 29-foot birdie putt on the third to join Koepka at the top of the leaderboard.
As the front nine progressed, it looked increasingly as if it would come down to a question of who would blink first.
Koepka landed the first blow on the par-four eighth, draining a magnificent 33ft putt to move one clear at 14 under.
But the American then paid the price for an over-aggressive birdie attempt on the 10th which sailed past the hole leaving an awkward putt to save par. He duly missed to drop back to 13 under.
Koepka then frittered a golden chance to regain the lead on the 11th, but was unable to convert a nervy nine-foot putt for birdie.
Another birdie chance lipped out on the 12th as the tension mounted.
The deadlock was broken when Harmans tee-shot on the 12th landed into the deep fescue, forcing him to hack out onto the fairway. Unable to get up and down Harman bogeyed to leave Koepka clear on 13 under.
Koepka then turned the screw with a nerveless trio of birdies to seize the crown. AFP

Champika demands strict action against hate speakers
Megapolis and Western Development Minister, Jathika Hela Urumaya Leader Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday demanded to take strict legal action against those who are attempting to destroy harmony by making statements that arouse religious or racial dissension.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU Office in Battaramulla, Minister Ranawaka said the General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena organisation Galagodathe Gnanasara Thera is not the only person who makes statements that arouse religious and racial dissension and such statements made in Tamil language were not publicised.
Things done by Gnanasara Thera have not violated the democracy of the country and he will also appear before courts. But if any person or a group deals with international terrorist organisation by exceeding the boundaries of democracy, that will be very harmful for all the ethnic groups living in this country, and it is a threat to the national security as well as the future journey of the country, the Minister said.
He said the behaviour of some Tamil politicians badly affected the development of Jaffna. Jaffna was not able to attract investors and it remains isolated due to harthal and other things done by political extremists.
The Minister said the Mahinda gang is attempting to sling mud at the JHU claiming that they are helping BBS General Secretary Galagodathe Gnanasara Thera to remain in hiding.
He said Ven. Gnanasara Theras lawyer is the best person to ask where the Thera is. He said the Attorney who is defending Gnanasara was the chief Attorney of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Gnanasara Thera left the JHU 13 years ago and then he backed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka during the elections. Therefore, its better to ask them about the BBS leader before questioning the JHU, the minister said.
Gnanasara Thera was a very good member of the JHU and he contested for the general election. The Thera contested the 2004 general election from the JHU, but didnt make it to Parliament. Then he left the party. Sometimes, he was used to attack the JHU, Minister Ranawaka said.

Tax them heavily
All TV channels in our country heavily depend on advertisers and their advertisements for the survival of business. However, we see that most consumer product advertisements, especially of the multi-national companies are just foreign advertisements dubbed in either Sinhala, English and Tamil. By doing this, the local industry is greatly deprived of the opportunity to come out with innovative and creative productions and the local media teams consisting of artists, production/technical staff, make-up artists and very many personnel directly and indirectly connected are deprived of their share of the media industry.
If all these advertisements are produced within the country without foreign copies being dubbed, a total value addition will be done within the country opening up new avenues and creating new opportunities to local media industry.
In view of the above, and at a time the Finance Minister is looking for every opportunity to collect additional revenue, I suggest that heavy taxes/levies be imposed to advertise foreign advertisements in the media.

ComBank launches needs responsive disaster relief programme
A comprehensive multi-level assistance programme designed to help families affected by the recent floods to recover from their ordeal has been launched by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
The Bank took immediate action to provide relief to those affected in the vicinities of its branches,but also concentrated on organising a customised post-flood relief programme to provide basic amenities that will help flood and landslide victims to start rebuilding their lives.
A disaster relief team appointed by the bank accompanied by staff of the Bank's Neluwa and Morawaka branches and Grama Seva and Samurdhi officers visited affected areas to assess the needs of beneficiary families.The Banks CSR Trust has released funds for a relief programme structured on a needs based assessment carried out by the Banks representatives after visiting and interviewing families.
As a result, 169 badly affected families in the Morawaka and Neluwa areas in the south of Sri Lanka received essential household items such as mattresses, pillows, bed sheets and pillow cases, mosquito nets, kitchen utensils, gas stoves and gas cylinders, rice cookers, electric irons and similar items identified by them as immediate needs.
Meanwhile, Commercial Banks Southern Regional Office distributed more than 3,800 litres of drinking water in Akuressa, Morawaka and Matara, while the Ratnapura branch donated a similar amount of water to the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council for distribution to needy families. The CSR Trust also presented a cheque to the Ministry of Home Affairs for the purchase of rice for affected families.
These efforts were in addition to relief efforts organised by individual branches in flood affected areas, and the voluntary donation of a days salary by staff of the Bank towards disaster relief efforts.

Dengue kills over 200
A new strain of the dengue virus has claimed over 200 lives, with 63,987 patients detected, during the first half of the year. The new virus, identified as Type 11 is distinct from the ones which affected the country during the past five years.
This is in marked contrast to the figures diagnosed last year. By the end of 2016 a total of 54,727 dengue patients and 78 deaths were reported for the entirety of last year. Hospitals including the Jayawardanapura Teaching Hospital, and the Infectious Deaseas Hospital (IDH) rejected patients diagnosed with dengue due to lack of space. The Epistemology Unit confirmed that 27,272 patients were reported from the Western Province. The Colombo district recorded the highest number of dengue patients 14,189 in the country while Gampaha district recorded the second highest number of dengue patients which is 9,370.
The Trincomalee district recorded a total of 4,318 dengue patients which is the third highest number of dengue patients recorded in the country.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported a total of 2,740 dengue patients during this year by June 16,2017. Other areas in the Colombo district recorded 11,449 dengue patients. The CMC in a report released yesterday said that 52% of those diagnosed with the virus were under 18 years of age. The Jayawardenapura hospital did not admit patients last afternoon but was scheduled to reopen for the patients in the evening. Since June 15th, dengue patients were diverted from IDH to NHSL, Colombo North and Colombo South Teaching Hospitals, Thalangama, Piliyandala and Wethara hospitals to ease the congestion of the IDH.
However, speaking to Daily News, Dr. Anil Jasinghe the Director of the National Hospital Colombo said they were fully equipped and were providing all the treatment to patients affected by the fever.
Dr.Jasinghe said that the Hospital has increased its surge capacity and allocated a cubicle with eight beds from each ward exclusively for dengue patients. A nurse with specialized training manages each cubicle, he said.
According to Dr.Jasinghe, two beds from each cubicle function as a High Dependency Unit with all facilities for monitoring and managing serious dengue patients. The total number of 120 beds have been allocated for cubicles from 15 wards.
The nurses who manage cubicles are especially trained for the task. Shortly a total of 60 High Dependency beds will be available in NHSL for dengue patients. The present number is 30 beds .
A total of 32 nurses and a group of doctors had been trained at IDH by Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, one of the leading dengue specialist in the country.
Now they are serving dengue patients receiving medical treatment in cubicles. The Director of the IDH had been informed to divert dengue patients from its OPD to NHSL, he said.
Dr.Harith Tissera the Cordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme said the new type of fever was in stark contrast to the previous fevers the country experienced.
Dr.Tissera said the current epidemic is of Type 11 of the virus. Since 2009 the country was affected by the Type 1 virus.

Fairway Waste Management (Pvt) Ltd and the Waste Management Authority of the Western Provincial Council recently signed a concession agreement to form a Public-Private Partnership that would create a sustainable model for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) processing at Karadiyana in the Western Province.
A subsidiary of Sri Lankas leading conglomerate  Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, Fairway Waste Management recently joined in the task of ensuring that Colombo will soon be transformed into a waste-free city, with the support of leading global expertise and modern technology.
The 22-year Concession Agreement is a key legal document and testimony of confidence and solidarity between the developers, investors and the Government of Sri Lanka.
While addressing the treatment of biological waste, which is hazardous to the public (odor, methane emissions, water pollution etc.), the agreement paves the way towards a major reduction in the diversion of waste to landfills. This also marks a new beginning for the residents of the areas around these landfills who are forced to deal with the ill effects of an unhealthy environment caused by open dumping.
As the Concession Agreement is for a Public-Private Partnership, all current managers of the site will remain in active partnership with Fairway Waste Management for the duration of the project.
Further the company intends to build up local capacity in waste processing technologies by creating new employment for Sri Lankans during the construction, operation and maintenance of the waste-to-energy plant at Karadiyana.

FM focuses on improving soft infrastructure in driving economy forward
Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera who is currently attending the Asian Infrastructure Investment Banks (AIIB) Annual Meeting in Jeju Islands, South Korea, held discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Kim Dong-yeon.
These discussions focused on issues of mutual interest and underscored the importance of closer bilateral relations between the two countries.
The Minister has also pointed out that they are focusing on boosting investments to make the country an export-driven economic and financial hub of the Indian Ocean,
This is by improving its soft infrastructure, the Minister said.
Developing physical infrastructure must be done along with administrative and legal frameworks to ensure required policy or regulatory support to streamline and boost public and private investments, Samaraweera said at a meeting of China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Korea.

Sri Lanka was aiming to be an export-driven economic and financial hub of the Indian Ocean, with a high level reform agenda in key sectors of the economy to help the private sector drive growth.
If we are to meet this challenge, we must incorporate climate-resilient concepts into all future infrastructure development projects, Minister Samaraweera had said.

Grand-pop on the hoppity-hop!
Fathers Day has come and gone. Yes, and usually Grandfathers too have traditionally been on the radar when planning gifts and celebrations. And as radars go Grandees are on top of the heap, or rather the beep in this digital age. After all, grandfathers have been considered the top guns or shotguns of the family while the dads are actually pop guns in comparison.
And as usual the weeks before D-Day, meaning Dads Day, the cash registers have been jangling incessantly. Yes Siree, it is another day tainted by commercialism and heralded with a surfeit of marketing initiatives by calculating companies to cash in on the general emotions of all you mushy descendants out there.
The number of useless and impractical objects on display in the guise of gifts would be sure to give you a whole lot of Dad-blasted fits. Rest assured that dads and grand-dads never return their Fathers Day gifts to the exchange counter. This in no way would mean we are satisfied with the bizarre well-intentioned offerings. Rather we appear too ashamed to let anyone see what we received.
Even before I attained grand-fatherhood, I was known as the fearless, peerless baby-sitter. That is what they called me and with darn good reason too. But arent grandparents, people who think your children are wonderful even though theyre sure youre not raising them right But maintaining a successful reputation that precedes my advent into new climes is not as easy as one would imagine.
There is a snide minority that feels I spoil the kids rotten. Okay I am aware that a puddle is a small body of water that draws other small bodies wearing dry shoes into. So I dont reprimand the grandkids when they splash through it. But I do look for some water on tap somewhere to help them clean up.
But these do not worry me as much as the sly lot who maintain that I manipulate the little uns and make them do and say the most precocious things to the amazement of everyone. Sure, I concede that I have been responsible for the verbal retorts of a good many little charges who have come under my delightful influence. They learn only too well.
Still you have to mind your language particularly when the nippers are around. Because anything you say, may be repeated at the most inappropriate time. Besides, those same maledictions may be thrown at you personally by disgruntled scamps. To be fair, I have enlightened dozens of kids in the stimulating art of conversation when the only vocabulary they had going for them before was lisping, inconsequential baby talk.
Kids are totally outside the experience of certain parents who simply cannot fathom the bewildering complexity of the child mentality. In adult minds, perhaps, it is a question of spoil the child or be driven up the wall.
To say that I am a great guy with kids is an understatement and even my fiercest detractors must concede that my methods, though somewhat unorthodox, are decidedly efficacious. Spoiling brats is one thing but there must be an element of discipline that goes with indulging them.
Yet, as a grandfather, one has to administer justice to sweeping claims by aggrieved snivellers, supported by a barrage of infantile evidence. It often happens that the aggressors have their own counter claims, conducting their own defence to make them look the aggrieved. Any attempts to conduct oneself with a measure of frosty, judicial dignity become forlorn at this stage.
Besides, where on earth does one find midget-sized strait-jackets or handcuffs for tiny wrists, if justice is to be administered suitably At times like these when the nasal whines become insufferable and the sarcastic tones infuriating, I have been obliged to instinctively flirt with some extreme methods of keeping the tykes quiet such as offering them lollipops laced with a mild soporific.
Some years ago my wife and I were babysitting the grand ones, Rex Tharindu (6), Moya (4) and Kingsley (2). Presently the clock ticked to 8.30 pm. My wife called out: Ok children its beddy-bye time! Rex Tharindu looked up and asked: Why Mum-mum Its so early yet!
Mum-mum fired her logical answer: Your father said your bed-time is eight and now its eight thirty. Moya took up the argument: But Mum-mum you dont have to listen to him. Grand-mother Mum-mum now speaking firmly: And why not Sharpshooter Moya returned fire :  Because you are his mother!
Still I must admit that I have been driven into some extremely delicate indiscretions while attempting to get one over the kids. Meaning it sometimes doesnt pay to shoot from the lip. Kingsley, called Kingco for short, once told me: Dada, If you buy me that toy Ill be really good! I almost bit my tongue after I realised what I had shot back at him: Oh, yeah When I was your age, I was good for nothing!
When Kingco was about three, I was giving him a ride on my shoulders in a crowded mall. I felt a series of painful tugs on my mane! I warned him sharply: Baby boy, if you keep pulling my hair, you will have to get off my shoulders! I felt another tug as the voice of my tiny rider replied: But Dada, I am just trying to get my bubble gum back!
But Kingsley at four did push the limits of grand-parental patience during a family word game. You know, the type of diversion, a collection named from an old pencil and paper parlour game we used to play before the goggle-box came into living rooms. You pick a letter then make a list of bird, beast, fish, fruit, flower, boys name, girls name, countries and cities among others. It all went smoothly until Kingco began striving frantically to come up with a name of a flower beginning with the letter F.
Struggling for the name of a bloom he kept mouthing inconsequential bloomers that went something like: Flick, flack, flock... And then suddenly in complete frustration he dropped the F-Bomb which exploded in the living room with vicious volatility.
Justice was administered swiftly and fairly. He was sentenced to the corner punishment chair. He took it like a man, accepting the verdict with astonishing equanimity. But for sure hell make a great lawyer someday. Leaning forward from his seat of imprisonment he addressed me: Hey Dada, if I have to sit in the corner for saying it you can at least tell me what it means!

Green spot for the Summer
Swim Week Colombo 2018, presented by OLU Tropical Water, will showcase the latest swimwear collections of 11 progressive Sri Lankan designers and three international designers. As demonstrated in its previous editions, Swim Week Colombo is the foremost platform for swimwear designers in Sri Lanka as well as the region and brings together some of the leading minds in the fine art of swimwear the world over. Swim Week Colombo 2018 will take place from June 27 to July 2 with runway shows taking place on 30 June and 1 July.
Swim Week Colombo was established in 2015, with the vision of creating a global platform for swimwear and positioning Sri Lanka as the swimwear capital of the world. Sri Lanka is renowned globally for its world-class swimwear manufacturing capabilities, which has engineered and produced swimwear for some of the worlds finest swimwear brands. This existing knowledge and expertise, along with Sri Lankas strategic position as an island with world-famous beaches and holiday attractions, lends itself the potential to become a global swimwear hub.
Swim Week Colombo is a strategic fashion development project which aims to showcase Sri Lanka as an expert is swimwear, resort and active wear. This year we are adopting a positioning which is close to our heart and creates an ecosystem based on Green Consciousness. This is another level of activities, says Ajai Vir Singh  Founder of Swim Week Colombo.
Swim Week Colombo is strongly attempting to take the position of the worlds first eco-ethical fashion week, and branding has been developed as Swim Week Colombo, Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive. To qualify this, three pillars of impact have been detailed; Impact on Garment, Impact on Supply Chain and Impact on the environment.
This season, each participating designer needs to implement any one or more of the above impacts to participate. So every collection is in some way contributing to being Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive.
Over the last decade, swimwear has been identified as one of the strongest categories in the global fashion industry, with an estimated worth of more than US$17.6 billion. Although once a status symbol of the elite, high-quality swimwear is now more accessible than ever due to the rise in the number of designers who are branching out to swimwear and the introduction of innovative fabrics and silhouettes that target a wider audience. The rise in beach culture, ease of travel to holiday destinations throughout the year and social media influencers have also lead to the rise of swimwear as a versatile, essential piece of clothing in the wardrobes of discerning fashion consumers.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said that the Health Ministry needs a better political leadership that gives priority to solving health issues and not prioritizing political agendas.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Office, he said that the Health Ministry should end its ineffectiveness and give required technical leadership to control dengue in the country.
The GMOA will submit a set of proposals with five main proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena next week. The proposals will be formulated on scientific facts. The current dengue control activities should be based on more scientific background, he said.
He said a more scientific approach was needed to tackle dengue as the number of deaths from dengue is on the increase and gas reached 200 within the first six months of this year.

Hendersons win at Meijer Classic was a family affair
Grand Rapids,Sunday: Canadian teenager Brooke Henderson became the youngest winner of 2017 on Sunday, closing with a bogey-free 66 for a two-stroke victory at the rain-hit Meijer Classic.
The 19-year-old Henderson claimed the fourth LPGA Tour win of her career by finishing with a 72-hole total of 17-under 263 at the Blythefield Country Club course.
I was kind of surprised when I looked at the leaderboard and I had a two-shot lead on the 18th green, Henderson said. Super happy and Im just glad its done and I finally have my fourth win.
Henderson also won on Fathers Day, so it was fitting that her dad was in the gallery watching her charge to victory.
This morning, (my Dad) said, Do it for me, so this is definitely for him, said Henderson, who also had her 26-year-old sister Brittany as her caddie. Hes my coach, my best friend and a great father, so thank you, Dad!
Americans Lexi Thompson (69) and Michelle Wie (65) finished two strokes back of Henderson at 15 under.
Thailands Moriya Jutanugarn shot a 66 to reach 14-under 266 and was tied for fourth with Swedens Madelene Sagstrom (65) and Australias Oh Su-Hyun (64).
Organizers had to make changes to the course because of heavy rains. Par was reduced to 69 because of flooding at the number five that turned the hole from a par five to a par three.
Henderson, whose first victory came in 2015 at the Cambia Portland Classic as a non-LPGA member, also became the 15th different winner on the LPGA Tour in 2017.
Just super-excited right now, Henderson said. I played really steady golf today. The leaderboard is packed. There are so many great names up there, so to finish on top is really exciting. AFP

High Court release six arrested over Keith Noyahr abduction

Six army intelligence officers arrested for allegedly being involved in the assault and abduction of journalist, Keith Noyahr were ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by Colombo High Court today.
 Accordingly, each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.35,000 and three sureties of Rs.1.5 million each.
They were barred from leaving the country and High Court observed that bail can be cancelled if they interfere with evidence and witnesses in the case. They were further ordered to appear before CID on every Sunday.
On March 20, the Mount Lavinia Magistrate issued an order to release the suspects on bail despite the strong objections of prosecution on which the CID was yet to conclude investigations.
 However, the CID filed a revision application in the High Court challenging the Magistrate's order to release the suspects on bail.
 Following the revision application filed by the CID, the High Court issued an order to suspend the Mount Lavinia Magistrate's order and further ordered to remand the suspects.
 Keeth Noyahr who was Deputy Editor of The Nation was abducted on May 22, 2008, was mercilessly beaten by an unidentified group and was held for over seven hours.
 The CID arrested six Sri Lankan army personnel attached to the Army Intelligence Directorate, in connection with the assault on Noyahr.
A Major of the Intelligence unit is also among the suspects.
