Speaker responsible for Parliaments disruption
Going by the happenings in Parliament today, one can expect one or two Parliamentarians to lose their lives in the future. If that happens the Speaker should be held responsible for it, because he has created this situation in the House, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was speaking at a meeting of the Angunukolapelessa SLFP Bala Mandalaya, at his residence on Saturday. About 2,000 SLFPers attended the meeting.
Minister Amaraweera said the Speaker had no powers to appoint a Prime Minister or a Cabinet of Ministers to dissolve Parliament. Only the President was empowered to take such action by the Constitution.
A Speaker ought to be an impartial. He cannot pass judgements on actions taken by the President. But the opposite was happening today.
Today, the Speaker was trying to act beyond the powers vested in him. President Maithripala Sirisena used his Constitutional powers and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister because he commanded a majority in Parliament. If it was considered wrong, the UNP should have gone to the Supreme Court to get an interpretation about it. Without doing such a thing, the UNP went on a shouting spree to disrupt Parliamentary proceedings.
For the first time in Parliaments history, a Speaker arrived in the chamber escorted by a battalion of policemen.
That was the reason why government MPs were agitated in Parliament. Government MPs would not have acted in this manner if the Speaker arrived in the Chamber according to normal tradition.
The so-called no-confidence motion was passed in a most unparliamentary manner. The way it was adopted was against all Parliamentary norms. The rowdy scenes in Parliament were caused by actions taken by the Speaker against standing orders.
The President had already announced the procedure to be adopted in passing a no-confidence motion. If that was done, the President would abide by the decision taken.

UNP has no candidates for polls
The UNP feared to go for a general election not only due to its impending defeat, but also due to the crisis it faced in finding candidates to contest under its symbol, National Freedom Front (NFF) electoral organiser for Yatinuwara D.U. Senarath said.
A person who loved his country, nation and religion would never contest under the banner of a party aspiring to divide the country and sell national resources to foreigners.
Senarath was speaking at a meeting to mark the launch of the NFF womens organisation in Yatinuwara named Lakmawa Diyaniyo recently.
Senarath said that if the President did not intervene and halt the so called yahapalana government programme of selling national assets to foreigners, the country would have been in deep economic crisis before long.
Ranil Wickremesinghe who knew that the party leadership would go to Sajith Premadasa tried to obstruct it by creating a crisis in Parliament through the Speakers intervention. Former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had no right to speak about democracy because people were aware of his actions during the 1988 period of terror.

President to Ministry Secretaries:
Work must go on
President Maithripala Sirisena directed heads of government departments and institutions to continue public services efficiently according to plans and projected targets without allowing it to get weakened at any time.
The President issued this directive at a special discussion attended by Ministry Sectaries, Chief Secretaries and other heads of department held at the Presidential Secretariat on November 17 morning.
The President who noted that the current political problems would be settled in due course said it was the duty of all public servants to carry out public services with strength until then.
The President who expressed the hope that all public servants would carry out their duties in a fair, just and impartial manner, said he was happy to note that no complaint had been received in this respect against any public official so far.
When several Ministry Secretaries informed the President about certain problems which had cropped up with regard to Ministry duties, he asked them to carry out their duties in future as per instructions given by him.
The President who stressed the importance of carrying out essential services including that of ports, petroleum, health and food supplies without disruption, said unless proper decisions are taken today the country would face problems in another three to four months.
The President who requested public servants to pay attention towards implementing major public sector development programmes including the Gramashakthi peoples movement added that he had instructed governors to supervise those matters.
The President said the country was today receiving adequate rainfall after a four-year drought and requested public servants to dedicate their efforts to ensuring the success of agricultural programmes including the national food production drive by considering the rains as a blessing.
The progress of financial matters in respect of Miniseries and district development programmes were also reviewed at this meeting and the President said problems highlighted would be discussed at length and instructions would be issued to Ministry Secretaries thereafter.

Academics say General Election the best option
Holding a Parliamentary election at the earliest, is the best option to overcome the current political impasse, a group of University Academics said yesterday.
All political parties should agree to hold a General Election and let the peoples sovereignty prevail, the academics said.
Enable the people to decide who their representatives should be. Hold elections to let the people enjoy their sovereign powers to elect a government of their choice.
Attorney-at-Law Raja Goonaratne, the head of the Legal Studies Department at the Open University said addressing the media in Colombo.
The University Academics also condemned Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas conduct during the current political crisis and called his action illegal and politically driven.
Goonaratne said the Speaker had violated Parliament standing orders, the Constitution and Parliamentary traditions during the last few days.
Goonaratne stressed that the President had acted in accordance with the constitution when appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
He went to say that the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and Speaker has no right to decide who should be the Prime Minister.
The Speaker does not have any legal or Constitutional power to appoint a Prime Minister. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had been appointed by the President according to the Constitution, he added.
Goonaratne said the Speaker had violated Parliament Standing Orders when acting on the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Rajapaksa.
In the Standing Orders, there is a clear procedure to follow when presented with a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister. First a letter on the motion should be presented to the Speaker with the signatures of at least 20 MPs, then the Parliament Secretary General has to accept it and should be referred to the Parliament Sub-Committee to be included in the Order Paper, then a decision should be taken whether the matter will be given priority status and later should be included in the order paper. Then it should be printed and circulated among all MPs before finalizing a date for the debate, followed by a vote he explained.
Gooneratne added that the Speaker had not followed any of the above. He also accused the Speaker of dancing to the tune of officials of some of the western nations in Colombo. He said the Speaker has held several rounds of discussions with the diplomats of some western nations in Colombo.
Meanwhile, Kelaniya University Lecturer Ven. Kapugollawe Ananda Kiththi Thera said the behaviour of Parliamentarians within the Chambers during the last few days should be condemned.
The Thera said the Speakers conduct had contributed to aggravate the situation. The Thera also called for an early general election as a solution to the current political imbroglio.
Meanwhile, Lecturer Prasad Serasinghe said the Speaker has set a wrong precedent by refusing to acknowledge the appointment of the new Prime Minister.
He said the appointment of a new Prime Minister by the President was in accordance with the Constitution.
He also said that now elections should be held to let the people have their say.
The Academics said they have filed several cases in the Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption against the matter and also against the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Over 25 University Academics attended the media briefing held at the Mahaweli Centre in Colombo.

AIDS awareness for school students
All senior school students countrywide should be educated on sexually transmitted diseases that are fast spreading in the country. About 2,300 education programmes on AIDS and its preventive measures have been planned for schools in the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts during November and December, said W.M. Balasooriya, Kurunegala District senior Director of Education speaking at a meeting of school heads of the district at Wariyapola Teachers Resources Centre.
In 2017, 285 positive AIDS patients were detected across the country. About six new AIDS patients are detected every week by health authorities.
The Health Ministry has estimated that there are around 4,200 positive AIDS infected patients in the island by now. These patients are between the ages of 15 and 42. The aim of the government is to wipe out HIV and AIDS by 2025. All school heads and parents of the North Western Province should assist the Health Ministry and the Education Ministry to implement these education programmes successfully. About 760 PHI s and 140 resource personnel would be deployed for carrying out these education programmes, he said.

Educational activities at the Akurana Aswer National School in the Katugasthota educational zone have been obstructed due to shortage of teachers, members of the School Development Society said.
The school needs at least 28 teachers to streamline its tutorial activities and the Society has deployed a small batch of voluntary teachers to tide over the situation. They expect the attention of the relevant authorities to solve this issue.

All about apples!
When we think of French food, images of smooth foie gras, flavorful duck confit, sumptuous cheeses and fluffy cream puffs instantly come to mind.
But apples A more unexpected association. Convinced of the limitless culinary uses of the forbidden fruit, brothers Daniel and Emmanuel Dayan opened Pomze in Paris in November, 2006 in a converted Haussmanian apartment in the eighth arrondissement, where more than 120 apple varieties are worked into their seasonally updated offering. Approximately 600kg of apples are delivered each week to satisfy client demand, proof that the fruit-focused hotspot has garnered a loyal following.
Both the head chef and pastry chef are Japanese and pride themselves on a meticulous attention to detail, presentation and service. In the romantic upstairs dining room, with beige walls lined with black and white photographs of apple orchards, guests discover the range of textures and flavors in everything from draught Cider from Northern Brittany to wasabi marinated salmon with Granny Smith apples and apple crpes with calvados flamb. Apples elegantly pervade the sophisticated space right down to the freshly baked warm rolls that hint of cinnamon and pack bits of apple in the center.
For those with modest appetites, both the stone cider cellar and ground-floor lounge create a relaxing atmosphere for a post-work apple cocktail with friends. But no experience is complete without perusing the impressive selection of apple-based products, from chutney to apple brandies, in the gourmet shop. One caveat: do not be misled by the seemingly empty entry lounge; all the action happens upstairs.
Abounding in both apples and inventiveness, Pomze leaves an indelible impression on even the most discerning of taste buds.

APEC leaders seek unity after U.S., China spat
PAPUA NEW GUINEA: Leaders from 21 Asia-Pacific nations battled to paper over gaping differences Sunday after an unusually sharp exchange of words between the groups two most powerful members, the United States and China.
Wrapping up a two-day summit, leaders will strive to craft a statement on the uncontroversial parts of their agenda -- pushing for deeper economic integration.
But with just hours remaining, officials were still scrambling to forge enough of a consensus to issue a formal joint statement and were admiting privately that it might not be possible, amid yawning differences on trade policy.
The annual gathering has been overshadowed by speeches on Saturday from Chinese President Xi Jinping and US Vice President Mike Pence, which appeared to represent competing bids for regional leadership.
Pence warned smaller countries not to be seduced by Chinas massive Belt-and-Road infrastructure programme, which sees Beijing offer money to poorer countries for construction and development projects.
The opaque loans come with strings attached and build up staggering debt, Pence charged, mocking the initiative as a constricting belt and a one-way road.
He urged nations instead to stick with the United States, which doesnt drown our partners in a sea of debt or coerce, corrupt or compromise your independence.
In a speech to business leaders just minutes before Pence, Xi insisted the initiative was not a trap and there was no hidden agenda -- amid criticism that it amounts to chequebook diplomacy in the region.
Xi also lashed out at America First trade protectionism, saying it was a short-sighted approach that was doomed to failure.
The feisty barbs on a gleaming white cruise ship moored in Port Moresby set the scene for a potentially fiery meeting between Xi and US President Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this month.
But Xi and Pence, who both wore shiny, red shirts provided by the Pacific island did have a brief tete-a-tete Saturday night at the leaders gala dinner.
Some attendees voiced concern about the growing rivalry for influence in the region, with fears a trade war between the two rivals could cripple the Pacific Rim economy.
Business leaders do not want to speak out, but behind the scenes here, they are talking over dinner saying how has this happened said Denis OBrien, the billionaire chairman of Digicel.
Its a very forced situation, one country is trying to force all the other countries to change tariffs agreed over years, OBrien told AFP.
Trump -- and Russian President Vladimir Putin -- both decided to skip the gathering, leaving the spotlight on Xi who arrived two days early to open a Chinese-funded school and road in Papua New Guineas dirt-poor capital Port Moresby.
Xi has been the star of the show, front and centre at official photos whereas Pence has kept a lower profile, only deciding at the last minute to stay overnight in Port Moresby -- shelving original plans to fly in and out from Cairns in Australia.
As if to counter Chinese largesse, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan on Sunday announced a project to boost electricity capacity in Papua New Guinea. The project aims to raise the percentage of the PNG population with access to electricity from 13 percent to 70 percent. And as the US and China vie for influence in the region, the statement dangled the prospect of similar projects for countries that support principles and values which help maintain and promote a free, open, prosperous and rules-based region. With the official business of the summit relatively low-key, much of the focus has been on the unlikely venue of Port Moresby, which is hosting its first international event of this scale. The city is on lockdown with hundreds of police and military patrolling the streets of the notoriously crime-ridden capital. Warships are stationed just off the coast to provide security for the leaders, and delegates and media have been housed in enormous cruise ships due to a dearth of hotel rooms. - AFP

Sarath Malalasekera
He was an iconic journalist
By the time todays edition of the Daily News hits the news stand, senior journalist Sarath Malalasekera has bade adieu to the nation. His remains were cremated at the Borella General Cemetery last afternoon.
Sarath's death sent shock waves through not only Colombo-based media, but also the highest echelons of the judiciary, defence, and academia. He was one of the most senior journalists who reported the courts, predominantly the Supreme Court, and also the police.
Sarath was an icon in his chosen beats of the judiciary and the police, largely influenced by his Court Mudaliyar father Chandradasa in his stint with the Daily News for over 50 of those 80 years, predominantly in the Daily News, with a brief stint juxtaposed with the now defunct Nation on Sundays.
However, albeit his stint at Lake House in the Daily News, he also filed the time-bound legal stories and police stories to the Sunday Observer as well, which had the approval of the Editors and the News Editors as there was a lacuna in that aspect in the Sunday Observer at that time. Sarath was a journalist par excellence. He was particular of the 'A' in journalism, which was accuracy. He earned the highest respect of the judiciary and defence establishments for his reporting. His stories found their way to the repositories of the judiciary, the law, and academia.
His associations with personnel of that level typified at a media cocktail reception hosted by the police in 1995, at which I was also standing next to him where he addressed the sitting Inspector General Police by the Sinhalese endearment Machan. My heart skipped a few beats, my legs caved in! This was not only an embodiment of the warmth they had for each other, but also underscored their respect and affection for each other. Another anecdote relevant to Sarath was his intense distaste for journalists who bore no moral code.
Among his heavyweight peers at Lake House were former Daily News Deputy Editor William de Alwis, Defence Journalist Richard de Silva, Shipping Editor Ivor Milheissen, Business Section pioneer and former Daily News Editor Manik de Silva, Business and Political Journalist and Business Desk Head Winston de Valliere, along with Senior Associate Editor Sugeeswara Senadheera, Senior Deputy Editor Nemsiri Muthukumarana, Madras University Science and Economics Double Graduate Thurairatnam Sabaratnam, Senior Deputy Editor Pararajasingham Balasingham, and veteran Parliament Reporter Premil Ratnayake, Parliament Lobby Correspondent A.B. Mendis, News Editor A.S. Fernando, Senior Associate Editor Dudley Jansz, Senior Business Writer and Film Critique Mohan Samarasinghe, Consultant Editor Pramod de Silva, Senior Associate Editor Rodney Martinesz, Veteran Sports Editor Elmo Rodrigopulle, and Senior Journalist Rohan Perera.Sarath used to keep company with some of the most influential Cabinet Ministers. He had once reported a story on the Ministry of Justice and had been seen in a friendly discussion at Parliament with then Justice Minister Nissanka Parakrama Wijeyeratne. Such was the camaraderie he enjoyed with the highest in the land.
Sarath was admired by all; he never had an enemy. He never spoke a hurtful word and no one spoke ill of him either. Sarath was not devoid of lighter moments. He was very close to Senior Associate Editor (Cultural Affairs) Nemsiri Muthumarana as he filed a lot of Buddhist stories.
Sarath was a cut above the rest even when it came to his personality and immaculate attire. He was most conspicuous among the hardworking yet bedraggled journalists of this newspaper who were running helter-skelter in the discharge of their duties, with his spotlessly-white long sleeved shirts and trousers, as well as his hair creamed and combed at any time of the day.
Apart from the widely-acknowledged zeal and the conscientious concern he had for his work, Sarath was also a devoted husband to his wife Premawathi who predeceased him in 2013 and a great father to his three children, elder daughter Priyanka, son Saman (Senior Graphics Editor at Lake House), and younger daughter Priyani.
Also coming to mind were the countless occasions he visited me in the Colombo National Hospital and the Nawaloka Hospital, where I was hospitalised for over 10 months after enduring a near-fatal accident on May 25, 1999, where I was debilitated with 28 surgical sutures on my head, an amputated left ear lobe, an eight-inch gash below the sternum, and four stress fractures below the right knee. That was when I was handpicked to report on former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga for both the Sunday Observer and the Daily News.
Interestingly, former President Kumaratunga was one of the five of six Executive Presidents of Sri Lanka barring President Premadasa as I was not in the media at that time. I reported along with former Prime Ministers Ranil Wickremesinghe and the late Ratnasiri Wickremanayake and the latter, with whom was also buttressed with a millennium interview for this newspaper at Temple Trees on January 1, 2000, at 10 am.
Sarath was a uniquely moral human being. A product of St. Josephs College, Colombo 10, he was a devout Buddhist. He was a lifelong vegetarian and often visited Buddhist temples. He also engaged in deep meditation. His sense of altruism was most amazing, giving Rs.50 to and Rs.100 to beggars. The minor staff employees of Lake House were no exception. A former colleague reminisced how he quietly slipped a Rs.500 note into his shirt pocket, assuming that he would have needed it at some stage.
In retrospect, Saraths voice was not one which was heard loudly but felt profoundly.
Sarath epitomised Rabindranath Tagore's following poem:
I will be true
For there are those who trust me
I will love,
For there are those who care;
I will be swinging,
For there is so much to suffer
I will be brave
For there is so much to dare;
I will be friend of all the poor, the friendless;
I will be giving and
Forget the gift;
I will be humble
For I know my weakness,
I will look up and laugh
And love and lift

Sathiyamalar Sinnappoo
Exemplary role model
I had known Sathiyamalar Sinnappoo, affectionately called Sathi akka, for over half a century. She was my lecturer at the Palaly Specialised Teachers' College in 1965. She was also one of my wife's relations. She was later transferred to the Kopay Training College as its principal, a post she held until retirement.
My thoughts are crowded with memories of special moments. Words cannot do justice to her all-round capabilities and achievements. I can visualise her beautifully dressed, walking at terrific speed (that was her usual pace; no one can beat her in a walking race) and being at the lecture hall on time. Such was her punctuality.
It was mainly her high degree of discipline, dedication, devotion and commitment to duty that made her an exemplary role model as a lecturer at the Palaly G.T.C. and later as principal of the Kopay Teachers' Training College. She always meticulously planned and executed whatever activity she desired to do.
She enjoyed the blessings of all trainees, co-lecturers and supporting staff. Her loving, kind, innocent genuine smile will never be forgotten by her loved ones. She never grumbled or inconvenienced anyone, patience, perseverance and pleasing manners were her humble way of life. Generation of teacher trainees will treasure her in their heart.
Among the qualities she possessed, her loyalty to her family, friends and students were bountiful.
The hospitality she showed to any visitor whether at home or at college remained par-excellent. The affection she had for people was limitless. She spoke courteously and her gentle words pierced anybody's heart.
She was the Manager of the Anglican School in Jaffna called Chundikuli Girl's College during the war, held almost all the key offices at the Anglican Church called St. James Church in Nallur, Jaffna and remained in readiness to help the poor at all times. Her motto was "help ever, hurt never, love all and serve all," and she lived true to those words.
Sad to say, she lived through her life as a worthy spinster. Nevertheless, she lived a content life. She had more than a dozen nephews and nieces; they were the centre of her universe, especially Ravi and Jeyendran who were the apples of her eye.
She was a second mother to them. In fact, she breathed her last at the entrance of the hospital in Ravi's hands while being rushed for emergency treatment. Beside these nephews and nieces, she also possessed the teacher-trainees who passed through her hands as her own children and they, in turn, returned her the same love. That was the richness of her heart.
Life is like a flower that blooms in the morning and withers in the evening. Sathi akka will be remembered for leading a harmless and inoffensive life, as well as winning the friendship and respect of all those who she came in contact with.
May her noble soul rest in peace.

Rev. Sr. Mary Perera
She was selfless
The three-month death anniversary of Rev. Sister Mary Irene Perera falls on November 20. Rev. Sr. Mary Irene (Emmo), after her fathers loss at a very early stage in life, realised that her call was to serve the Lord.
She was passionate in serving humanity and practiced humility, simplicity and availability, which were the outstanding virtues of St. Francis of Assisi. Rev. Sr. Mary was born on May 10, 1921, to Joseph and Nellie Perera and was the eldest of five siblings.
On June 13, 1942, she entered the religious life to join the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary Novitiate at Mattakuliya and proceeded to make her first and final vows in 1945 and 1948, respectively. She served in different parts of the Island: Moratuwa, Kalaoya, Minneriya, Mahiyagana and Mattakuliya.
At a time when leprosy was highly infectious without proper medicine to treat the disease, Rev. Sr. Emmo volunteered to look after leprosy patients and went through the jungles of Minneriya and other areas in the North Central Province in search of them who were marginalised by society.
She would attend to their needs, dress their wounds and provide them with medicine. Her commitment to them was unwavering and she nursed them with dedication and commitment. Even in her late 80's she visited patients regularly and organised Christmas parties every year.
She was selfless, giving whatever she could to the underprivileged and was at all times, compassionate towards the poor, sick and the neglected. Her compassion for the poor had no limits. Wherever she was free, she would visit them and try to satisfy their needs.
She did all this with a smile; I never saw her complain. Her love and compassion made everyone around her feel the radiating joy emanating from her. Being a very lighthearted person, she always blended her conversation with humour. Rev. Sr. Emmo was never known to hurt anyone with words or actions; in fact, her smile always won our hearts.
There arent enough words to express the love and gratitude I feel towards Rev. Sister Emmo. She showed kindness and compassion, and always brought a much-needed sense of humour at all times. Blessed with an outgoing personality, she reached out to everyone: young, old, rich and poor, and built strong relationships with all and sundry.
She was called to rest on August 20 after 75 years in religious service, and I believe she is already with St. Francis of Assisi in heaven today.
A 'thank you' seems hardly adequate to Rev. Sr. Emmo, who gave this world so much love without counting the cost. She is an unsung hero of our times and the most courageous example of faith I have ever known. We are proud of you, Rev. Sr. Emmo; we miss you!

Appropriation Bill to be discussed at next Cabinet meeting
The Appropriation Bill will be discussed at the next Cabinet meeting, UPFA MP Shehan Semasinghe yesterday said.
He also said that people should not fear of any economic instability as all necessary steps will be taken by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Finance Minister to manage the countrys economy.
Semasinghe also said that the government will take measures to relax the heavy taxes imposed upon people in the near future. He further said that Samurdhi Officers will soon be absorbed into permanent cardre by the government as well. Semasinghe also observed that following the next General Election, the UPFA will form a strong, stable government led by Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Even though there is a tense situation and instability in Parliament, that does not mean the government is
unstable. The government administration is running smooth and the government is very much stable, Semasinghe added.
MP Semasinghe made these observations at a press brief held at the Prime Ministers Officer in Colombo yesterday morning.
In answer to a question by the media, Semasinghe said that there is no problem concerning the payment of Rs.170,000 million in debts due next year.
The public should not have any unnecessary fears about the current situation. Prior to 2015, there were numerous global phenomenons such as the food crisis and global economic downturn which had an impact on our economy, but we were able to manage the situation. Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken debts worth Rs.5,000 billion too during the last three years. Even though there is instability in Parliament, the government operations are running smooth. Semasinghe pointed out.

However it wasnt all an easy ride against Italy, who held out against the two-time world champions for the first half an hour and were enraged by Tito Tebaldi and Braam Steyn both having tries disallowed in the first 15 minutes.
The win was a boost For Australian counterpart Cheika, whose side have just four wins out of 12 games this season. Im not going to say anything about the refree ... I thought we were really good considering the situation of the season, said Cheika. Now we have to look to see what we need next week (against England).
We love going to Twickenham, love the crowd hating us, so lets get it on!  AFP

Career opportunities for Sri Lankan software engineers
Australian/SL start up Different to change face of property management
Backed by one of Australias biggest venture capital funds, AirTree Ventures as well as the Silicon Valley Venture Capital fund, Foundation Capital, this new property tech start-up founded by the two Silicon Valley technology bigwigs from Uber and Google, promises to be far more than a tech solution.
Different is a full-service property management agency with a monthly fixed management fee per property. It has built apps which give tenants a way to easily lodge problems in the property that need to be fixed, as well as pay rent. Owners, on the other hand, can review previous transactions via their dedicated web application. Different is headquartered in Sydney, Australia with offices in Melbourne. The company has a 12 person strong in engineering presence in Colombo 5.
Different is founded by the former Global Head of product for Uber, Mina Radhakrishnan, and her Sri Lankan born husband Ruwin Perera, an Australian who was a Softbank director and former global business strategy principal for Google.
Radhakrishnan began her career as a business analyst for Goldman Sachs. She later joined Google in California, where she worked directly for Marissa Mayer. She was the first product manager at Uber and later ran the companys product team for three years, leading initiatives such as new driver on-boarding and the addition of other types of car services. She is one of five inventors who jointly hold Ubers 2013 patent on surge pricing. She also advises and mentors other companies.
Pereras experience spans investment, corporate strategy, consulting and business process outsourcing. Ruwin Perera most recently was a Director at Softbank, the worlds largest Internet-sector investor, where he analysed potential investments and supported Softbanks many portfolio companies on business improvement initiatives around the world. Prior to Softbank, Ruwin spent 3 years as a Principal in Googles Global Business Strategy team at Google HQ in Mountain View CA. In this role, he led the Competitive Intelligence function and drove strategic projects across Googles business. Prior to Google, Ruwin was a consultant with the Boston Consulting Group in San Francisco.
Different is looking to hire great software engineers at different levels from Sri Lanka who have the consumer empathy to build great product experiences to aid us in our journey of building a global product company, and leveraging the best Sri Lankan know-how to do so. Perera and Radhakrishnan stressed the fact that the engineers earn great salaries that are very competitive to market as they believe in hiring only the best and developing them to their maximum potential. On recruiting, Radhakrishnan said, We are often getting engineering reaching out on our website and emailing us at [emailprotected]. Engineers are drawn to us because unlike working on short-term agency projects, they get to build a world-class product, and learn from our experiences in Silicon Valley.
As far as their Sri Lankan operations are concerned, the Colombo office has a self-contained team of 12 software engineers and project managers who work in tandem with their Australian counterparts through a partnership with Sri Lankan born Silicon Valley heavyweight Rehan Fernando, and his office on Galle Road. Engineering projects vary from building reusable UI inventory components with React to building the next generation of their API using GraphQL and Javascript. Distributed configuration management using Vault and Consul, Codified infrastructure using Terraform and Packer and containerised platform using Docker and Nomad are some of the upcoming projects.
Different offers the entire gamut of property management services from listing, pricing/rent setting, viewing of properties, tenant selection, payments, landlord protection plans, maintenance, inspections, paying of rates and taxes, while your owner portal ensures that all your important documents are just one click away, said Perera. Different also provides clear, up to date monthly statements that you can access any time through your owner portal.
For instance, if a tenant is facing a problem, all he or she has to do is lodge the problem through the app and the app would automatically determine the best person for the job depending on the issue, location of the property and time to fix. Once the job has been accepted, the tenant and owner will be given the details. But for more complex problems, such as a tree falling on a house, etc, the agent would step in and personally manage the process.
Different hires smart experienced agents who focus on the things that only people can do like selecting the right tenants and ensuring you get the best return on your property investment. With our intuitive technology, every owner has an online portal that gives them a management history of their home. Its directly linked to our systems so its always complete and up to date. Whether its managing your property or finding you a new tenant, we do everything a traditional property manager does and so much more, said Radhakrishnan.
We want our people to focus on creating and nurturing great relationships with our owners and tenants rather than repeatedly managing mundane tasks. We do that by building systems from the ground up that understand the complex workflows we deal with. That means intelligent background automation across a variety of platforms, delightful consumer products and the seamless transition between people and technology. Thats why we have an NPS of 90, while still being able to manage properties more efficiently than anyone else.

Biggar-inspired Wales thrash Tonga
CARDIFF, Saturday: Dan Biggar guided Wales to their eighth consecutive victory as a much-changed side scored 10 tries in a comprehensive 74-24 thrashing of Tonga on Saturday.
Tonga battered their way back from a 24-3 deficit to draw level early in the second half at Cardiffs Principality Stadium.
But the floodgates opened as the Welsh, with a host of World Cup hopefuls playing, ran in 50 unanswered points against a flagging defence, Biggar notching up 19 points of his own.
Biggar was back at fly-half after Gareth Anscombe was preferred in last weeks 9-6 win over Australia, coach Warren Gatland looking like he has built up some significant strength in depth in key positions ahead of next years Rugby World Cup in Japan.
Wales got off to a rocketing start with three tries inside the opening 12 minutes. First came a penalty try as a rolling maul was taken down as it crashed over the Tongan line, lock Leva Fifita shown a yellow card by Australian referee Nic Berry for his role.
Wales turned the screw with Tonga down a man, Biggar on hand to crash over from close range following a neat offload by flanker Aaron Wainwright.
Sonatane Takulua at least got Tonga on the scoreboard with a penalty, but then came Wales third, a memorable one for British and Irish Lion Liam Williams in his 50th Test for his nation. The Saracens wing brilliantly dotted down one-handed in the corner, launching his body airborne to avoid being tackled into touch, after fellow winger Steff Evans had combined slickly with Tomos Williams and Wainwright.
Tonga centre Siale Piutau then saw his try disallowed by referee Berry, whose attention had been drawn to a dubious knock-on, Biggar going on to stretch the home sides lead with a penalty.
Giant lock Fifita made up for his yellow card when he forced his way over the line to give some hope back to the Tongans, who arrived in Cardiff on a run of seven victories in their last 11 Tests, including wins over Pacific rivals Fiji and Samoa.
Tonga hauled themselves right back into the contest when they showed their patience to go through the phases and finally usher Castres lock Steve Mafi over the line for a well-worked second try, Takulua hitting his second conversion. The Pacific islanders got the perfect start to the second period when No 8 Sione Vailanu picked off a Tomos Williams pass at the line-out and sprinted his considerable frame in from 40 metres.
Takuluas extras drew Tonga level at 24-all, but there was an immediate reaction, Jake Ball breaking the defence before Biggar put in a kick-pass to Evans for a straightforward try. Biggar added to his successful conversion with a 55th-minute penalty as a raft of replacements disrupted the rhythm of the match, notably for the visitors.
Wales then pulled away as Tomos Williams went over after a sustained period of pressure and Biggar nailed the conversion before being replaced by Rhys Patchell.
Centre Tyler Morgan followed suit, thanks to Patchells long mispass and Owen Watkins offload.
As Tonga tired in defence, Cory Hill and Aled Davies were on hand to finish off multi-player moves before Patchell scythed through for a great individual try, the replacement also racking up 13 points in his cameo.
The last word belonged to Liam Williams, who crossed for his second in the dying seconds, with Tonga on the ropes.

Canada close in on Rugby World Cup after Germany win
MARSEILLE, Saturday - Canada are one point away from a place at next years Rugby World Cup after beating Germany 29-10 in a round-robin repechage tournament on Saturday.
A losing bonus point against Hong Kong in the final match of the tournament next weekend would be enough for the Canucks to claim a spot at the showpiece event in Japan.
Despite a meagre three-point lead at half-time, a trio of second-half tries helped Kingsley Jones outfit close in on qualification.
Earlier in the day, Hong Kong comprehensively beat Kenya 42-17 but need to beat Canada on Friday by more than seven points and prevent them from scoring four or more tries to ensure their first-ever appearance at the tournament.
Hong Kong, who lost their opening match of the campaign to Germany, came back from 14-0 down after 23 minutes to run in six tries, two of them from backrow forward Thomas Lamboley.
Four teams are involved in the competition in Marseille with the winner going through to face New Zealand, South Africa, Italy and Namibia in the group stage of the World Cup.
The defeats for Kenya and Germany mean that they now cannot qualify for the tournament in Japan.  AFP

CARGILLS BANK  records Rs 71 mn PAT
Cargills Bank recorded a modest post-tax profit of Rs. 71 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018.This reflects a growth of 56% over the corresponding period of last year, after discounting the one-off gain of Rs. 481million from the disposal of its subsidiary.
The net interest income of Rs. 1,530 million improved by 46%, reflecting increased income from a larger loan portfolio, interest rate benefits from currency swaps and the impact of the inflow of Rs. 1billion from the disposal referred to.
Net Fee- based Income of Rs. 115milion for the 9 months reflected an increase of 43%. Most of this was attributable to income from growth in the loan portfolio and to higher guarantee commissions. This income would have been substantially higher if not for the delay in the launch of credit cards.
Other income for the nine months grew 23% when the exceptional gain in 2017 is excluded, an important contributor being increased earnings on foreign exchange.
Impairment charges increased 223% from Rs. 73 million in 2017 to Rs. 237 million in 2018. Growth in the loan portfolio, non-performance by some large customers and delayed settlements on other loans contributed to this. The banks NPA ratio increased from 3.55% at 31 December 2017 to 5.78% at 30 Sep 2018. This is receiving close attention; management considers the increase temporary. The bank stringently assesses credit quality and strengthens monitoring and recovery to contain NPAs at an acceptable level.
Operating expenses increased by 27% for the 9 months. Higher depreciation costs and personnel expenses accounted for most of this increase. The employee head count at September 30 2018 was 524 against 418 at September 30, 2017.
The Rs. 24.5 billion loan portfolio of the bank at September 2018 was 18% higher than at December 31, 2017. Credit growth was moderated by a shift in focus to secured lending, an exit from large low yielding facilities and a re-deployment of funds in the SME segment. Growth was slower than expected given the prevailing macroeconomic environment.
The banks deposit base, at Rs. 18 billion at September 30, 2018, remained flat compared to the base at 31 Dec 2017. Rupee denominated deposits grew by a modest Rs. 2 billion which was cancelled out by outflows in foreign currency deposits.It commenced, during the 3rd quarter, a deposit campaign targeting 6 month, 1 year and 5 year deposits.
This promotion has been well received and we are seeing a steady inflow of deposits.The Bank also unveiled its new Podihitiyo Childrens Savings Account on World Childrens Day, offering an attractive interest rates for childrens savings accounts to help create a culture of savings in the community. Targeted promotions to attract deposits will continue. The Banks CASA ratio stood at 16% at September 30, 2018.
The Capital Adequacy Ratio of Cargills Bank continued to be well above the minimum regulatory requirement during the period. At 30 Sep 2018, the Tier I Capital Ratio was 32.3% and the Total Capital Adequacy Ratio was 32.7%. The Bank remains focused on the need to productively deploy the capital buffer it presently carries.

Point of view
Political drama continued to influence Sri Lankan equity markets, with the Presidents unexpected dissolution of the parliament last Friday (after market close), the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court and the disarray during the reconvening of parliament dominating market movement.
The broadshare ASPI remained volatile over the week, recording 3-days of positive returns and 2 days of negative returns to result in a cumulative drop of ~23 points (cf. a loss of ~114 points last week) over the week. While Index heavy-weight JKHs announcement of a 1 for 20 share repurchase helped prop markets to some extent, markets remained broadly on a downtrend and failed to regain momentum as the countrys political deadlock progressively worsened over the week.
Although activity levels remained largely subdued over the week, Softlogic Groups strategic transfer of Odel Plc within the Group helped total weekly turnover increase ~6.6% W-o-W as the transaction amounted to Rs.6.2Bn (or ~75%) of the weeks turnover. Crossings for the week consequently accounted for 84% of the weekly turnover cf. just ~19% last week.
Despite this weeks continued political standoff, foreign investors returned to Sri Lankan equities for the first time in 11-weeks, to record a net inflow of Rs.0.13Mn cf. an outflow of Rs.3.9Bn last week. Meanwhile, September quarter earnings of ~ 92% of corporates remained weak (-7.8% Y-o-Y to Rs.56.2Bn cf. Rs.61.0Bn reported by the total market in Sep17) and the CBSL on Wednesday acknowledged that GDP growth for 2018 is likely to remain below envisaged levels. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the outcome of Mondays parliamentary session and any further political developments.
The Central Bank on Wednesday maintained a neutral monetary policy stance by simultaneously reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 1.50 p.p to 6% while increasing policy rates (SDFR by 75bps to 8% and SLFR by 50bps to 9%). The monetary authority acknowledged that the reduction in the SRR (which is expected to release a substantial amount of rupee liquidity to the banking system and thus reduce banks costs of funds) is aimed at addressing the large and persistent shortage in rupee liquidity in the domestic market.
Meanwhile, to neutralize the impact of this reduction, policy interest rates were raised by 50-75bps. The CBSL added that although inflation levels have decelerated (driven by the decline in volatile food prices), private credit to all major sectors up to Q318 showed a notable acceleration while the trade deficit has widened amid higher imports, thus prompting the increase in policy rates.
The CBSL noted though that a slowdown in imports and private credit growth is likely in period ahead given the LKR depreciation and its recent policy measures. Market rates moved higher in the aftermath of the increase in policy rates, with rates on the 3M and 1Y Government securities rising between 36-42Bps since the announcement.
Yields on G-Secs have increased sharply in the recent weeks amidst the countrys ongoing political turmoil. Since the start of the political turmoil on Oct26, yields on T-bills have risen between 17-50Bps across all tenors, prompted by the sharp sell-off by Foreign investors who have sold ~Rs. 23Bn in the last 3 weeks as the political fallout has progressively worsened.

Let peace and harmony exist
The attention of the entire nation has been drawn towards the Sri Lankan parliamentary structure. The common man isnt concerned much about those changes, he bothers about how to live peacefully by feeding his children and giving his children a good education. If those motives are fulfilled, they are quite satisfied. If not, at least let a government act wisely. It is better not to take off the powers given to a President by the Constitution. When we look at this act it seems dictatorial but it never becomes dictatorial as the President is elected by a vote of a thumping majority.
It would have been more democratic if Ranil Wickremesinghe cared to answer a questionnaire on where he had gone wrong and what action he had taken for his defence. Unlike in other countries, most of us are Buddhist by birth. We strongly believe in five precepts, values and virtues of an ancient tradition. What prompted Ranils exit The association with Arjuna Mahendran, making him the head of the Central Bank and allowing him to leave the country are the offences that Ranil is legally bound to answer.
As a devoted and dedicated Buddhist, President Sirisena exercised his sympathy on Ranil for so long without taking any side. Thanks to his patience, there is no bloodshed in the country. However, we fervently hope that this exercise wont continue further and may not hinder the peace-loving people of the island.

Comark also manufactures solar panel accessories which are used in the installation of solar panels in domestic and industrial applications. In this instance too, imports have been reduced substantially due to local manufacture, thus saving foreign exchange.
In addition to the solar panel accessories, Comark is manufacturing stainless steel four bar hinges/friction stays which meet international standards for both local and export markets. These friction stays are used in the mounting of aluminium windows which is a standard feature in most of the buildings.
Comark Engineers is the only manufacturer of these products and offer warranties on all of their products. The stainless steel used in the manufacture of these products is tested and their SUS 304 grade is certified as suitable for coastal application.

Dealing with bullying
Shehan always felt a sense of disappointment each day he turned over to Sanduns desk in the classroom. Shehan observed how Sandun was bearing up a lot of pain when boys used to call him sandalwood and humiliated him in different ways. Shehan couldnt control himself when one day, a few boys were physically assaulting Sandun. Shehan went to his rescue. Little did Shehan know that this brave act would make him a victim of bullying.
Shehan, a student who passed his Grade Five scholarship examination to receive admission into a prestigious school in Colombo had nothing in mind, except performing well academically and becoming an independent man in the future. The day he helped Sandun, a boy who was bullied in school for not being cool and not being able to afford sophisticated stationery, Shehan fell prey to bullying.
They started bullying Shehan and Sandun. They were a group of 6  10 boys. Shehan wasnt sure, what he had done or hadnt done to the bullies. What Shehan was sure about was that he didnt have proper defence, not in any way, shape or form. The moment they turned against him, he turned into their prey.
The two years that followed consisted of Shehan and Sandun being chased by this pride of lions in and around school, in class and on their way to and from school  there was never a moment they could catch their breath and they certainly had no help from anyone. They were spat at, cornered, kicked and beaten up daily, humiliated and laughed at by the gang of bullies. The scholar Shehan was affected even more as they stole his textbooks, tore his homework and scribbled on his notes. Poor Shehan, had to bear all this insult just because he stood up for a friend who was being bullied.
Bullying affected Shehan and Sandun badly. Shehan was so affected that he could not concentrate on his studies due to the stress and anxiety he was going through. There was a significant decrease in his ability to focus on any activity. He had frequent stomach aches and headaches which made him miss school, exorbitant amount of times. Shehans academic output was edging off. On the other hand, Sandun was depressed. He always felt lonely and never spoke to anyone. He was always caught in class for sleeping or losing interest in the lesson.
But, Shehan was intelligent. When he observed the curtailment in his grades over time he decided to enlist his father, whom he thought was the best person to approach for such a problem. Shehan told his father the entire story with no attempt of concealment. His father Algama was very angry and resentful at Shehan for concealing this secret for nearly two years. But Algama knew that before anything got worse he had to take a decision.
Algama wrote a letter to the class teacher about the bullying that had taken place within the school premises and threatened to complain to the National Child Protection Authority if no achievable solution was found. The class teacher took immediate action by informing the sectional heads and this resulted in the bullies receiving a two-week suspension from school.
Shehan might have found a solution for his problem but Sandun is still affected. The bullying he went through has left numerous scars in his life. Shehan hasnt been able to help Sandun in any way. Shehan can only pray to God to protect Sandun from taking a wrong decision like taking his own life!
Ten years later, Shehan is a successful businessman with a lovely family of five. Sandun has not been able to overcome his sorrow and grief. He indulged into drugs and smoking to relieve his depression, but it has not helped him in any way. Sandun lives alone with his old mother in a distant village. Bullying has destroyed Sanduns life and career. Shehans intelligent action ten years ago has benefitted him in a positive way.
A few years later, Shehan read a newspaper article that caught him off balance. The article was referring to a man who had committed suicide due to the long-term effects of bullying and being singled out. That man was Sandun and he had left a message to the world. Bullies couldnt exist without victims, and they dont pick on just anyone; those singled out, lack assertiveness and radiate fear long before they ever encounter a bully.
Bullying is a highly unacceptable form of behaviour with long term problems following its tail. Bullying affects children by putting them into situations they are not supposed to experience. Many believe that bullying is a part of growing up, but I stand against it and believe that nobody has the right to infringe the right of a child. Therefore, I have produced three compelling messages to what parents, teachers, principals and students like me can do about bullying.
Bringing about open communication among children and elders
What I believe is that the key factor in the process of bullying is the fear of the victim. What we must spread within the public, especially students in schools is that they must be confident to stand up for themselves. They must be able to communicate with the parties that need to be informed when such a thing takes place. Therefore, a very important message that must spread within the public is that Open Communication helps victims to gain assistance from others for the problems they are facing.
When anyone is being bullied, the first step he/she should take is to inform his/her immediate superior. This could be parents, teachers or guardians. As Sri Lankans if you fear that informing your parents or teachers is not going to help, you can inform the National Child Protection Authority on 011- 2778911 and they will surely take necessary action. This way we will also be able to bring out fear in the minds of bullies and this might make them stop bullying others in the long run.
The biggest issue in status quo is that many victims of bullying remain as victims and preys of the bullies. There is less input from the victims to get out of the state they are in. They are oppressed, they feel inferior, yet they dont respond to it because they are fearful of the bullies who feel superior. The message that must spread among the public is that whatever the circumstances are nobody should ever stand by bullying. Being by standers also affect people in the long run. Therefore, by standing up for bullying you can create a positive impact to your life.
Spread the message that bullying is not tolerated by society
The greatest problem in the world in status quo is that people think that bullying is allowed and there are no rules advocating against bullying. It is important to remove this stigma that is prevalent in society. Therefore, we can produce solutions to stop bullying by advocating bullying prevention policies in schools and throughout the community. It is important to raise awareness about the policies we are introducing. We can develop and distribute print materials advocating against bullying. We can also encourage local radio, television and websites to give public service announcements about bullying. - UNICEF

Encroachment on Anuradhapura tank reservations intensifies
The Anuradhapura Senior Citizens Society and many farmer organizations said a large number of people had encroached on reservation lands of tanks in the Anuradhapura district and relevant authorities have not taken enough measures to stop them.
The District Agriculture Committee members had discussed the issue at their many sessions with the farmer organizations and other stakeholders such as irrigation, wildlife conservation, forest conservation departments and the divisional secretaries but they could not evacuate the encroachers so far.
Some encroachers threaten officials who hand over them evacuation notices, he said.
The legal papers to evacuate encroachers should be submitted to the Irrigation Director General for approval. The Irrigation Department Colombo Legal Branch has to carry out further actions. The District Irrigation Directors are not empowered to take legal action against the offenders, they said.
The Irrigation Department control 13 tanks and the Mahaweli Authority controls the Kalawewa reservoir. Around 50,000 perches of tank reservations come under the Nuwarawewa (36,050 a.f.) Tisawewa (3,500 a.f.) Abayawewa (1675 a.f), Mahawilachchiya (30,500 a.f.), Mahakanadarawa (36,250 a.f.) Rajangane (81,000 a.f.) and Padaviya (85,000 a.f.) are occupied by 3,000 encroachers, they said.
Anuradhapura Irrigation District Director Engineer Prasanna De Silva said that during the last two years, many people had not encroached on the tank reservation and irrigation officials prevent people from encroaching on these lands as much as they can.
Police officers prevented people from encroaching on the Rajangane reservations.
Eighty acres of Galgamuwa and Thambuttegama divisions have been now encroached. The Irrigation Department will take these lands back very soon.
Twenty two unauthorized constructions were identified at the Nachchaduwa tank reservation and notices were issued to encroachers to vacate the land.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told Daily News that the illegal activities in tank reservations narrow the tanks, and pollute environment. He said the farmer organization, public organizations and officials must be committed to stop illegal activities in the tank reservations.

Sri Lanka lose second Test by 57 runs
England series win very special says Root
PALLEKELE, Sunday : Its very special was how captain Joe Root described Englands series clinching 57-run win over Sri Lanka in the second Test at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday that gave them a unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match Test series with one to play.
England didnt have to wait long for celebrations as the last three Sri Lankan wickets were consumed within a matter of 52 balls on the fifth and final day yesterday as the hosts chasing 301 runs for victory were bowled out for 243.
A lot depended on Niroshan Dickwella, the last of the recognised batsmen for Sri Lanka when they resumed at 226-7, requiring 75 runs to win and square the series. But he added only eight runs to his overnight score of 27 before edging a catch to slip off Moeen Ali who in the very same over got through the defences of the stand-in Lankan captain Suranga Lakmal to bowl him for a duck.
Left-arm spinner Jack Leach who had troubled all the Lankan batsmen put the finishing touches to a highly clinical performance by England having last man Malinda Pushpakumara caught and bowled for one to celebrate taking his first five-for in his short three-Test career  5 for 83 off 23 overs.
Akila Dananjaya who will leave for Brisbane on November 20 to have his bowling action tested after being reported after the Galle Test was unbeaten on eight.
The Pallekele Stadium pitch turned out to be a spinners paradise with a world record 38 wickets being taken by trundlers from both sides and shockingly it was England who finished on the winning side playing on a subcontinent pitch. Englands spinners Leach, Ali, Rashid Khan and Root took all 19 wickets to fall to bowlers. Sri Lankas three spinners Dananjaya, Dilruwan Perera and Pushpakumara also took a total of 19 wickets with only one wicket going to a fast bowler Lakmal.
The margin of victory left one to ponder whether it was the innings played by Sam Curran in the first innings that was the turning point. He scored 64 and helped England recover from 171-7 to 285. Had he been dismissed without scoring it would have been a different ball game altogether.
Root celebrating the win said at the post-match press conference: The guys have worked extremely hard. Weve planned very well for it. We said we were going to play in a certain manner and weve backed that up completely in the two games. And thats
probably the most pleasing thing.
Weve stuck to our guns. Weve been ruthless when weve had our opportunities to get ahead in the game and weve soaked up pressure well on occasions. To see this team growing
all the time and looking to improve in practice and driving that standard up is a great position to be in.
When asked which the most satisfying series win was  beating India at home 4-1 or taking a winning 2-0 lead in Sri Lanka, Root said, Theyre very different. It would be easy for me to say this right, now. It feels great. To come here, in very difficult conditions  it was quite extreme here and at Galle  and to perform as we have done and managed to soak up that pressure and apply it back on the opposition for long periods of time as well. Hold our nerve. It shows
a lot of maturity for quite an inexperienced side in this part of the world.
Root was named Player of the Match for his second innings century (124) that set up Englands target after they were 109-4 and only 62 in front.
ENGLAND PLAYED BETTER CRICKET - HATHURUSINGHA
Sri Lanka head coach Chandika Hathurusingha under whom Sri Lanka has suffered their first Test series defeat said: Were looking at the bigger picture. This is the first series we lost this year. We won against South Africa 2-0. These two games were very close ones. We had the opportunity to win both games at times. England played better cricket than us. We have to accept that. We have to learn from these mistakes. I think those mistakes we can easily correct it. Its about certain decisions. The skill is still there - thats what Im banking on. Thats the hope that I have with this team.
If you remember this game, I think we lost it in the first innings. When we took 9 wickets - the last wicket put on 60, and the way they made runs was disappointing. In the second innings there were times where we were in the game and we let them off the hook. There was no pressure. Those are the things that are key for us, to win consistently away from home, or at home. Those are the things we need to discuss, he said.
Hathurusingha said that fielding which has been Sri Lankas bane and cost them several matches has to be made a priority ahead of batting and bowling for selections.
Fielding has been an issue for us for a long time in every format. I think its a big picture thing, again. The guys who are not fielding well up to the mark, are the same kinds of players who are coming through the system. They are not athletic enough or skilled enough to do that kind of fielding. We need to address that, said Hathurusingha.
We need to look at fielding as a no. 1 thing. Most of the time we look at their no. 1 skill - either bowling or batting - and then you ignore sometimes about the fielding. But we need to look at that very seriously when we select. We need to look at their ability to contribute on the field.
CHANDIMAL FITNESS TEST TODAY
Hathurusingha said that captain Dinesh Chandimal was undergoing a fitness test today and if he passes it he will be available for selection for the third and final Test starting at the SSC on Friday.
Chandimal missed the second Test at Pallekele after suffering a groin strain in the first Test at Galle.

England survive Japan scare at Twickenham
TWICKENHAM, Saturday: England came from behind to beat Japan 35-15 at Twickenham on Saturday as they avoided a shock defeat by the 2019 World Cup hosts.
Japan led 15-10 at half-time and were threatening an upset to rival their stunning 34-32 win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup, when they were coached by current England boss Eddie Jones.
But England scored 25 unanswered points after the break, with late tries from Test debutant Joe Cokanasiga and Dylan Hartley sealing victory. England scrum-half Danny Care scored the first try of the match in the third minute but Japans passing and handling was far sharper in the opening stages of a dry day well-suited to their running game.
Japans enterprising play was rewarded with tries by centre Ryoko Nakamura and captain Michael Leitch.
Meanwhile England again paid the price for indiscipline, with hooker Jamie George, starting in place of regular co-captain Hartley, sin-binned.
But England recovered to lead thanks to openside flanker Mark Wilsons first Test try and the boot of George Ford, their captain for this match, before powering away.
Fly-half Ford, winning his 50th cap, led the team after being benched for a 12-11 win over South Africa and the All Blacks loss.
Japans amateur players were earning 14 (2,000 Yen) per day for this game, whereas their England counterparts receive 25,000 per match.  AFP

A Positive Transformation
The Finance Commissions unrelenting pursuit of excellence 2016-2018
The passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka witnessed the birth of the Finance Commission in 1987. The 19th Amendment of the Constitution in 2015 reconstituted the Commission along with eight other Independent Commissions.
On the recommendation of the Constitutional Council, the President appointed the following Members to the Finance Commission on November 13, 2015 for a period of three years. The Commission comprises:
1. Chairman: U. H. Palihakkara
2 Ex-officio Member: Dr. Indrajit Coomarswamy, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka
3. Ex-officio Member: Dr. R. S. H. Samaratunga, the Secretary to the Treasury
4. Member: V. Kanagasabapathy
5. Member: Prof. H. M. Zafrullah
A.T.M.U.D.B. Tennakoon functions as the Secretary of the Commission.
It is an opportune time for reflection and introspection on the journey of the Finance Commission over the last three years, 2016-2018, in the accomplishment of its mandate, which is pivoted mainly on Balanced Regional Development (BRD) of the country.
During the period, a number of significant steps were taken to position the Finance Commission for its long-term performance and progress, with a firm resolve to turn this important organisation into an efficient and strong Independent Commission for effective discharge of its mandated functions, contributing to the development of the national economy, ensuring transparency and accountability.
Independent Commissions
Immediately upon taking over of office in November 2015, the Commission started implementing a robust reform agenda with the formulation of a well-conceived Annual Activity Plan for 2016. This reform-roadmap was designed to steer the Finance Commission for an effective organisation with all critical prerequisites. In the context of the Activity Plan, during the year, the Commission set itself another challenge to examine its governance structure and embarked on a Strategic Plan (2017-2020), a blue print for achieving the Commissions mission and major goals.
The Annual Reports of the Commission give a detailed account of its activities and accomplishments. During the three-year period the Commission had initiated a number of decisive steps and embarked on some special studies for redressing regional disparities and framing important polices.
With a view to carrying out the role of the Commission effectively, a Manual of Internal Policies and Procedures has been formulated based on the regulatory framework applicable to Government Ministries and Departments, pending formulation of specific guidelines applicable to Independent Commissions.
The Finance Commission is entrusted with the task of recommending adequate funds to Provinces and to recommend principles to the President on the apportionment of such funds between the Provinces. In performing this task, the Finance Commission assesses the needs of the Provinces and makes recommendations for fund distribution among the Provinces, adopting a rational basis for fund allocation using a composite formula developed with the support of the Department of Census and Statistics, and providing proper guidelines for Provincial Councils with a view to aligning provincial investments in line with the National Development Polices and Strategies. In this context, the Commission developed a broad framework for aligning of policies and strategies with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a vital requirement for fulfilling Sri Lankas commitment to achieving SDGs by 2030.
The Commissions recommendations to Provinces on Provincial Specific Development Grants (PSDG) are based on the sectors given in the relevant Lists of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. In this regard the Commission has embarked on several sector studies such as health, education, irrigation, agriculture and social services etc. which are used in the making recommendations to the President, as well as in fund allocations to Provinces. In addition, a number of special studies were conducted to address regional disparities and framing important policies. These include, imbalances between provincial revenue and expenditure, identification of weaknesses and anomalies between fund allocations to Provinces due to lack of coordination in overall macro planning, budgeting and accounting aspects and unbefitting needs assessment methods.
Positive steps
However, the published statistics point to the fact that such allocations constitute a meagre fraction of the governments total annual budget, and intra and inter-regional disparities yet continue. This is mainly due to allocative inefficiencies, regarding which, in the recent past, the Commission has taken a number of positive steps, including promotion of resource mapping, master planning, Database/Management Information System (DBS/MIS) development, and improved coordination between the relevant government ministries/departments, and other agencies. To this end, the Commission, among other matters, dived into some major policy initiatives.
A Revenue Performance Grant (RPG) has also been introduced in order to encourage provincial revenue generation. This is a development-oriented grant, linked to devolved revenue collection, and the Provinces will have discretionary power to use the grant for capital related development programmes. Furthermore, the Commission has also contributed towards the preparation of an Action Plan for enhancement of revenue in Local Authorities, and in the formulation of the relevant amendments to the Municipal Councils Ordinance, Urban Councils Ordinance and Pradeshiya Sabaha Act, by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.
The Code of Governance adopted in December 2017 and the Finance Commission Bill, awaiting the Attorney Generals clearance for enactment, and the ongoing exercise for DBS/ MIS development will pave the way for an effective and prudent management for the long-term success of the Commission.
Previously the Commission was housed in a small rented out premises without much space for effective operations. In 2016 the Commission commenced the construction of its new office complex at Sarana Mawatha, Rajagiriya. The foundation stone for the office complex was ceremonially laid by Speaker Karu Jayasooriya, the Chairman of the Constitutional Council in the presence of many distinguished guests on November 24, 2016. The building is now complete and the Commission is housed in the new building. It will be officially declared opened shortly. The total cost of the project is Rs.442 Mn., and it is fully funded by the government.
With regional development planning gaining emphasis, reformulating and re-articulating theoretical and policy views on the globalization of regional development is critical. In this regard the Finance Commission initiated action in joining hands with other parallel institutions elsewhere, especially in the South Asian Region. It is expected that with this move the wealth of experience amassed by the Finance Commission as well as other similar institutions created for sub-national affairs would provide a platform to share their knowledge and wisdom for sound spatial economic development planning.
Greater prosperity
It is our wish and desire to make the Commission strong and vibrant and we remain committed to its primary target of reducing regional disparity and Sri Lankas march toward greater prosperity. There is no doubt that the Finance Commission faces continued challenges to cope with the increasing demand for better allocation of financial resources in the Provinces in terms of quality of service.
We hope to formulate a more comprehensive Corporate Plan with realistic and transparent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) targeting better organisational performance for creating value, and enriching the lives of the people.
In a rapidly changing environment, success depends upon revisiting approaches and methods, and adapting to the needs of the day. All of these new directions will not only reflect the Finance Commissions increasing and ceaseless endeavour to ensure its commitment for excellence in service delivery, but also that of the aspirations of all Sri Lankans.

Forestpin listed top ten APAC Region  Big Data Analytics Solution Providers
Each year, the APAC CIO Outlook Magazine publishes a list of top Big Data Analytics companies originating from the Asia Pacific Region. The 2018 list published in November includes the following companies given in alphabetical order, CADS (Malaysia), DATAVLT (Singapore), Forestpin (Sri Lanka), GRIDSUM (China), HYPERS (China), OneAD (Taiwan), (China), Tech Valley (China), Vpon (Taiwan), WINNER Technology (China).
The APAC CIO Outlook is a magazine published from the technology hub of Silicon Valley, USA, with sales offices in Hong Kong and editorial presence in all major APAC countries. The APAC CIO Outlook Magazine aims to provide a platform for CIOs, CTOs, and other senior level IT buyers and decision makers, along with CXOs of solution providers, to share their experiences, wisdom and advice with the enterprise IT community of APAC countries. They also identify and profile emerging companies providing cutting edge solutions to enterprises in APAC.
We are delighted to be recognised in this prestigious list of Big Data Analytics software, which include very large companies from the region. I believe its due to the uniqueness of the value proposition of our solution, said Forestpin Co-Founder and Director, Dilanke Hettiaratchi.
We need to thank all of the progressive companies in Sri Lanka that were early adopters of Forestpin Analytics and Risk Alerts, and who have supported us along the way. Some of these companies already had the best of breed analytic solutions, yet saw the potential of timely visibility of risk, which has helped them towards mitigation of financial loss, said Forestpin Co-Founder and Managing Director, Ransith Fernando.
Forestpin is a Sri Lankan company that helps companies reduce operational risk in transactions, by giving analytics and alerts on suspicious transactions.
Forestpins Risk Engine works as a part of the enterprise system in the background, where data is extracted on a predefined basis, and a series of anomaly detection computations are run, resulting in a risk score on each and every transaction. The engine also computes a dynamic threshold based on the alerts sent in the last 30 days, and the number of alerts a user can consume per day on average, where the transactions above the threshold are alerted either in digest form or individual alerts. The engines dynamic workflow with authorisation levels permits users to comment or change statuses based on their roles.
The updated statuses are used by the learning mechanism to identify the risk factor to the business. If an alert is marked as not useful, then the Risk Engine will stop highlighting that type of risk over time. If an alert is marked as keep alerting, human error, process improvement, or found manipulation, then the learning mechanism increases priority for the type of alerts. Interaction on the alerts is also captured for our enterprise customers on Forestpin analytics to ensure businesses are attending and investigating their alerts.

Forms for the future
Shortly after announcing that they will be building a new Philharmonic Concert Hall in Yekaterinburg, Zaha Hadid Architects has been granted an even bigger project in Russias capital. The team of ZHA and the Russian firm TPO Pride Architects is one of three consortiums that will be creating the Rublyovo-Arkhangelskoye neighborhood west of Moscow.
This smart city will feature homes for 66,500 residents, schools, medical clinics, shopping districts, transit infrastructure, and civic spaces. To compensate for Russias growing financial, consulting, and legal sectors, the neighborhood will also accommodate two acres (800,000 square meters) of office space.
The new area will be developed across 1,136 acres (460 hectares), with one third used as parkland and forest bordering the Moscow River. A 74-acre (30-hectare) lake at the center will provide a natural respite from the city. Rublyovo-Arkhangelskoye itself is fulfilling a critical role in helping with Moscows rapid growth, as the population has increased by 30 percent over the past 20 years. A new metro line will link the area with Moscows city center, to meet the demands of citizens without overcrowding the center. Looking to become a global benchmark for sustainable cities, Rublyovo-Arkhangelskoye will integrate new technology to optimize consumption and increase connectivity. Working with specialist teams in Russia and Europe, we developed a people-centric design for a smart interconnected city that brings people together not only through innovative technology but also through organizing the public realm; building a community that integrates the natural aspects of the site with principles of openness and inclusivity in high quality architecture suited for the 21st century, shares Christos Passas of ZHA.

France claim first win in nine months by beating Argentina
LILLE, France, Saturday: France claimed their first victory in nine months by beating Argentina 28-13 as Teddy Thomas scored twice on Saturday, less than a year from the teams meeting at next years World Cup.
Guilhem Guirado also crossed for the home side in Lille as Jacques Brunels men sealed a much-needed confidence boost as well as a psychological edge ahead of the pool-stage fixture in the sports showpiece event in Japan in September.
Despite a positive start for the Pumas with Ramiro Moyano touching down after less than two minutes, the hosts fought back for a first win since Marchs Six Nations victory over England.
Moyanos try came after a superb Jeronimo de la Fuente off-load and the winger ran in untouched from more than 50 metres.
Baptiste Serin claimed the home sides first points with a penalty goal after seven minutes. Nicolas Sanchez then added one of his own.
Thomas first try came as Yoann Huget, playing his first Test in a year, broke the Argentinian line following tidy set-piece play and the Racing 92 winger dotted the ball down in the corner unopposed.
Frances scrum was solid throughout and the they took the lead for the first time after 33 minutes as the Pumas 22-year old tight-head prop Santiago Medrano was penalised and Serin added the three points for a 11-10 advantage which held until the half-time whistle.
The Pumas started the second half the better and Sanchez added a second penalty goal to regain the lead for his side.
The rest of the half belonged to the home team, mainly through fine playmaking by Gael Fickou who transferred his good club form onto the international stage.  AFP

World Toilet Day 2018
Harpic strengthens commitment towards uplifting public health and sanitation
Harpic, Sri Lankas number one toilet cleaner, initiated a special CSR project to celebrate World Toilet Day 2018, by deploying their teams to clean and transform public rest rooms at Fort and Maradana railway stations.
The United Nations declared 19 November as World Toilet Day and being a socially conscious brand, Harpic conducted their CSR initiative in line with UNs objective of raising awareness about the social issue relating to inadequate access to hygienic toilet facilities.
As part of the CSR project, the Harpic cleaning crews were engaged in cleaning work during the days leading up to 19 November. The initiative also saw Harpic crew members educating the public on their individual responsibility to keep public rest rooms clean.
Not having adequate access to hygienic toilet facilities is a huge issue our communities are silently dealing with. The United Nations declared November 19 as the World Toilet Day due to the importance of raising awareness on this issue. As a socially responsible brand, we wanted to actively take this problem to the people and heightened awareness on this matter. Fort and Maradana railway stations are used by thousands of commuters every day. We are happy to notice the appreciative gestures of all who acknowledged the work we have done said Jude Martino; Head of Marketing & Trade Marketing, of Reckitt Benckiser (Sri Lanka) Ltd.
Tackling sanitation issues has been a major concern for the United Nations as over 4.5 billion of the worlds population lives without access to safe toilets. The issue has a significant impact on achieving the UNs Sustainable Development Goals. In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that 8% of the population still do not have adequate access to hygienic toilets and the condition of public toilet facilities are generally not at an acceptable level.
Harpic, a member of the renowned Reckitt Benckiser house, has always aligned their CSR efforts to target these broad challenges relating to the community. In March 2017, Harpic launched the Harpic Suwa Jana Meheyuma; Mission Wellbeing, in collaboration with the Ministry of City Planning & Water Supply to elevate the status of hygiene across households in Sri Lanka. Under the project Harpic has so far built 200 toilets in households and schools around the country, providing people with important sanitation facilities for their wellbeing. Taking their commitment to the next level, Harpic is also channeling Rs. 5 from every 500 ml bottle of Harpic sold towards this project.
Since the inception of the brand, Harpic has conducted multiple ground activations to promote cleanliness and hygiene among the communities and has reached out to hundreds of thousands of households across the country. As part of these activations, Harpic has been present at all important social and cultural public events, providing relief to many. Harpics mobile toilet programme with state-of-the-art toilet facilities, has been covering over 10 major religious and social events annually over the past years.
Harpic is a leading brand of Reckitt Benckiser (Sri Lanka) Ltd. Reckitt Benckiser is a renowned global business that operates in markets across 6 continents. Inspired by a vision to create a world where people are healthier and live better, the Company produces a popular range of health and hygiene products that include Dettol, Strepsils, Veet, Airwick, Durex and Lysol. Harpics CSR efforts reiterate the commitment by Reckitt Benckiser to conduct a socially, environmentally and financially responsible business entity.

Hasan, Yasir set Pakistan on victory path in first Test
Abu Dhabi, Sunday: Medium pacer Hasan Ali and leg-spinner Yasir Shah took five wickets apiece to set Pakistan on the victory path on the third day of the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.
Hasan took his maiden five-wicket haul with 5-45 while Yasir finished with 5-110 -- his 14th five-wicket feat in an innings -- as New Zealand collapsed from 220-4 to 249 all out soon after tea.
That left Pakistan with 176 to win the Test and at close they were 37-0 with Imam-ul-Haq on 25 not out and Mohammad Hafeez unbeaten on eight, needing another 139 to win with all ten wickets in hand and two days to play.
With the Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch not worrisome for batting Pakistan has high hopes of enforcing a 1-0 lead in the three-match series while New Zealand can take heart from the fact that Pakistan lost a Test here against Sri Lanka by 21 runs after set 136 to win last year.
Bradley-John Watling with 59 and Henry Nicholls with 55 had defied Pakistan in the post lunch session with a fighting stand of 112 for the fifth wicket but Yasir took four wickets off just 15 balls to bring his team back into contention.
Pakistan took the second new ball with the total at 201-4 soon after tea and Yasir had Nicholls caught beautifully by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed and then in his next over trapped Coiln de Grandhomme leg-before for three.
Nicholls hit three boundaries in his 171-ball resistance-packed knock.
An over later, Yasir ended Watlings 145-ball defiance with a leg-before and then bowled Neil Wagner for nought. Watling had five boundaries in his knock.
Hasan then wrapped up the innings by bowling Ish Sodhi for 18 and Trent Boult caught off a miscued drive for nought to improve on his previous best figures of 4-51 against England at Lords in May this year.
New Zealand were in danger of losing the Test today after three quick wickets fell in the space of just 22 runs in the first session with Hasan taking two in the same over.
But Watling survived a leg-before decision on review after umpire Bruce Oxenford raised his finger off Bilal Asif for 15. Watling took full advantage of the reprieve and added 67 in the second session without losing a wicket.
It was Hasan who brought Pakistan back in the first session.
Hasan, who had opener Tom Latham yesterday, trapped a dangerous looking Taylor leg-before with a sharp incoming delivery for 19 and then had Jeet Raval caught behind by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed for 46.
Raval had added 86 for the second wicket with Kane Williamson who made 37. Raval hit five boundaries in his 120-ball knock.
Resuming at 56-1 New Zealand had pinned hopes on their skipper Williamson. But it was Raval who smashed two boundaries and then took a single off Mohammad Abbas to take New Zealand into the lead.
But just 12 runs into the lead Williamson was bowled by leg-spinner Yasir Shah to a ball that beat the batsmans push and removed the bail.
The second Test is in Dubai (November 24-28) and the third in Abu Dhabi (December 3-7). AFP

Healing Herbs
Nugegoda is a bustling and noisy town with plenty of traffic and busy commuters. It is one of the busiest towns. Yet only a few knows there is a little secret garden inside Sujatha Vidyalaya. It is a herbal garden and Green Thumbs features this garden by Sujatha Vidyalaya.
The little ones of the school are excited about this beautiful little garden. It is a project by grade one students, but students of other grades also help to maintain the herbal garden. One reason why this herbal garden is so precious is because studying plants is part of their curriculum at school.
Some of the herbs in the garden include Aloe Vera, Hops, Silky Indigo, Agallocha, Iramusu and Bengal. It is a well- known fact that herbs have a variety of uses including culinary and medicinal. Here the leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark and inner bark can be used.Ruhansa Amarasekara says she finds joy when working in her herbal garden. I really love this herbal garden and I go and see it every day. I visit it in the interval. It is a good project and it is relevant to our subject where we learn about plants. I really like working in this beautiful garden of ours. The other girls in our school are very interested in the herbal garden as well, said Ruhansa. Senumi Sehansa, enthusiastically pointed out that one of the highlights of her day is certainly working in the herbal garden. It is a very good project and we learn so much about herbal plants just by working in the garden. It is a project done by the grade one students. I visit the garden daily. I love the herbal garden because there is so much that we can learn from it. It is also fun working together with each other, said Senumi By the expression on Udamsa Kariyawasams face one could instantly tell that this herbal garden means the world to her. There is such a variety of herbal plants in this home garden of ours, and we learn a lot simply by working in the home garden and interacting with it. Every day I water the plants and it is something I really look forward to doing, said Udamsa. Induni Dharmasiri felt that hands-on experience is far better than explanation. There is so much we can learn from this herbal garden because it is directly related to our class work and what we study in the class. By working in this home garden we can better appreciate what we learn in the classroom. So this helps us with our book knowledge, Induni explained. Viduni Wickramarathna pointed out that this kind of practical knowledge enables them to master what they learn within the four walls of the classroom. One of the nicest things about our herbal garden is the fact that when working in the natural environment, theoretical knowledge in the classroom is easily understood. We are familiar with what we learn in class and perform better at the exams, said Viduni. Primary School teacher, Awanthi Fernando, explained that this is a unique opportunity for the children to see and understand the natural environment. The subject matter in the Grade 1  5 Curriculum directly relates to this herbal garden. Here they learn about the plants and the environment because of what they learn in the curriculum we decided to start this herbal garden. This is a grade one project done with their parents assistance. All the children visit this garden in the morning. They touch the plants and they study the plants. We started this because we felt the need for the curriculum to be accompanied with something tangible, said Fernando. Fernando added that in this world of fast foods by opening this home garden, the parents, children and everyone around them get used to eating organic food at home. Through children the society also benefits and learns, contributing to healthier lifestyles. The entire primary and the upper school students are involved in this project. All of them visit the plants. Earlier we had herbal plants all over the school so we thought of gathering it into one place so they can learn better. Our girls bring plants when they acquire them and place them in the herbal garden, explained Fernando. Sectional Head of the English Medium classes, Supushpi Jayasundara commented on the medicinal value of the project. The medicinal aspect made us start this herbal garden. This garden provides knowledge on medicine as well. The children show much interest. Even the parents participate enthusiastically. After work some parents come and water the plants. They have a roster to water the plants. They bring new plants as well. And we hope to continue this. For Environmental Related Studies we have so many lessons. This herbal garden helps to educate the kids on plants. When we do a lesson, we take the students to the herbal garden and show them. So they become familiar with the plants, said Jayasundara.

For a high-yield vegetable garden
Yields are easier to achieve than you may think. The secret to super-productive gardening is taking the time to plan strategies that will work for your garden. Here are seven high-yield strategies gleaned from gardeners who have learned to make the most of their garden space.
Plant in raised beds with rich soil
Expert gardeners agree that building up the soil is the single most important factor in pumping up yields. A deep, organically rich soil encourages the growth of healthy, extensive roots able to reach more nutrients and water. The result: extra-lush, extra-productive growth above ground.
The fastest way to get that deep layer of fertile soil is to make raised beds. Raised beds yield up to four times more than the same amount of space planted in rows. Thats due not only to their loose, fertile soil but also to efficient spacing. By using less space for paths, you have more room to grow plants.
Round out the soil in your beds
The shape of your beds can make a difference, too. Raised beds become more space-efficient by gently rounding the soil to form an arc.
A rounded bed that is five feet wide across its base, for instance, could give you a six-foot-wide arc above it. That foot might not seem like much, but multiply it by the length of your bed and youll see that it can make a big difference in total planting area.
Plant crops in triangles instead of rows
To get the maximum yields from each bed, pay attention to how you arrange your plants. Avoid planting in square patterns or rows. Instead, stagger the plants by planting in triangles. By doing so, you can fit 10 to 14 per cent more plants in each bed. Just be careful not to space your plants too tightly. Some plants wont reach their full size  or yield  when crowded. Overly tight spacing can also stress plants, making them more susceptible to diseases and insect attack.
Grow climbing plants to capitalize on space
No matter how small your garden, you can grow more by going vertical. Grow space-hungry vining cropssuch as tomatoes, pole beans, peas, melons straight up, supported by trellises, fences, cages, or stakes.
Growing vegetables vertically also saves time. Harvest and maintenance go faster because you can see exactly where the fruits are. Fungal diseases are also less likely to affect upward-bound plants thanks to the improved air circulation around the foliage.
Time your crops carefully
Succession planting allows you to grow more than one crop in a given space over the course of a growing season. That way, many gardeners can harvest three or even four crops from a single area.
Stretch your season by covering the beds.
Adding a few weeks to each end of the growing season can buy you enough time to grow yet another succession crop or to harvest more end-of-the-season tomatoes. To get those extra weeks of production, you need to keep the air around your plants warm by using mulches, cloches, row covers, or cold frames. goodhousekeeping

ICC Womens World T20
India and New Zealand leave Guyana with batting fireworks
The clash between the tournaments most consistent teams proved predictably entertaining, but ended with a result that few predicted. In front of a crowd of almost 5,000, India recorded a memorable win over tournament favourites Australia. It was only their fourth ever win against the Aussies in T20Is, on the back of a career-best 83 from 22-year old Smriti Mandhana.
As the tournament said goodbye to the Guyana National Stadium, Ireland gave two of their senior players a guard of honour as they took the field for the last time in international cricket, only to have two more announce their retirements at the end of the game. There were no surprises in the result, as Sophie Devine matched the record for the fastest fifty in ICC Womens World T20s to give New Zealand an eight-wicket win.
India topped Group B with eight points while Australia finished second with six points. New Zealand (four), Pakistan (two) and Ireland (zero) finished in that order. The last days league matches in St Lucia on Sunday will determine the semi-final lineup with England and the Windies fighting it out for the top spot in Group A.
In the semi-finals on 22 November, the top side of Group A will play the second side from Group B and the top side of Group B will play the second side from Group A.
INDIA BEAT AUSTRALIA
Mandhanas first T20I fifty in 14 innings could not have come at a better time. It helped India to a 48-run win, their first over Australia in ICC Womens World T20s. The left-hander had a scratchy tournament, but put that behind her in a chanceless and sparkling knock, one that helped India to their highest ever total against Australia. In the process, she also brought up her 1000th T20I run.
Vice-captain Mandhana combined with captain Harmanpreet Kaur, and the two senior batters set the pace, scoring 68 off just 42 balls together, with Harmanpreet scoring 43 of those. The pair hit five fours and three sixes while at the crease, and despite no other batter getting into double figures, the eventual total of 167 for eight proved enough.
Australia had a less than explosive start, and were restricted to 39 for two in the Powerplay, after which wickets fell regularly. Only Ellyse Perry, who also took three wickets, was able to convert her start into a substantial score. But she was left stranded on 39 not out, as the lower order collapsed around her. The Indian spinners shared all nine wickets, four of those caught by Veda Krishnamurthy in the deep.
Scores:
India Women 167-8 in 20 overs (Smriti Mandhana 83, Harmanpreet Kaur 43; Ellyse Perry 3/16, Ashleigh Gardener 2/25, Delissa Kimmince 2/42)
Australia Women 119-9 in 19.4 overs (Ellyse Perry 39 n.o., Ashleigh Gardener 20; Anuja Patil 3/15, Radha Yadav 2/13, Deepti Sharma 2/24, Poonam Yadav 2/28)
NEW ZEALAND BEAT IRELAND
Twin sisters Isobel and Cecelia Joyce joined Clare Shillington and Ciara Metcalfe in retirement at the end of Irelands game against New Zealand. On the field, it was Gaby Lewis who impressed before Sophie Devine ended New Zealands tournament with some fireworks.
Chasing Irelands 79 for nine, Sophie Devine (51) hit the joint fastest-fifty in the tournament and second fastest ever, matching the 21-ball mark that Australias Alyssa Healy set earlier this week. The three sixes she hit took the tournaments tally past 57, setting a record for the most sixes across editions of the ICC Womens World T20, with five matches still to be played.
Earlier, Lewis hit five fours as she scored a brisk 39, equaling the highest score for Ireland in the ICC Womens World T20s. She was the only Ireland batter to make an impression though, as off-spinner Leigh Kasperek took three wickets.
Scores:
Ireland Women 79-9 in 20 overs (Gaby Lewis 39; Leigh Kasperek 3/19, Lea Tahuhu 2/17, Amelia Kerr 2/18)
New Zealand: 81-2 in 7.3 overs (Sophie Devine 51)

## Title: Jacques Derrida: The problems of presence

Jacques Derrida: The problems of presence
Jacques Derrida is widely regarded as the most important French philosopher of the late twentieth century. Yet when his name was put forward for an honorary degree at Cambridge University in 1992, a significant portion of the Anglo-American philosophical establishment was outraged. Eighteen philosophers from nine countries signed a letter to The Times opposing the award on the grounds that Derridas work consisted of tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists or of the concrete poets and amounted to little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship. Understanding Derridas legacy, then, must also involve understanding why he should have been the target of such vitriol.
Born into a Jewish family in Algeria in 1930, Derrida learned at an early age about the damage caused by the imposition of fixed categories on human diversity: in 1942 the Vichy regime lowered the percentage of Jewish students allowed in schools, resulting in his expulsion and a period of somewhat haphazard education. In 1949 he moved to metropolitan France for further study, and in 1956, having written a dissertation on the German philosopher Edmund Husserl, passed the agrgation examination that qualified him as a teacher. In 1964, after two years of military service in Algeria, he began teaching at the cole Normale Suprieure in Paris, where he remained for twenty years, giving a weekly seminar  on a fresh topic every year  that became a magnet for the intellectually curious.
Philosophical scene
In 1962 Derrida published a book-length introduction to his translation of Husserls short work The Origin of Geometry in which the seeds of his later thinking were already evident, but it was in 1967 that he truly made his mark on the French philosophical scene. In that year he published no fewer than three books, and in so doing displayed the startling originality and productiveness that was to characterize his career until his death from pancreatic cancer in 2004: Lcriture et la difference, La voix et le phnomne and De la grammatologie. Five years later, another trio of books appeared, cementing Derridas position at the forefront of what became known in the English-speaking world as post-structuralism: La Dissemination, Marges de la philosophie and Positions. There followed a steady stream of publications; a recent posthumous volume produced by his favourite French publisher, Galile, lists fifty-seven books from their own house and another thirty-one from other publishers  and this list includes only the first two volumes in the planned series of hitherto unpublished seminars delivered over more than forty years.
Derridas range was extraordinary: he wrote analyses of the works of a host of philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to his contemporaries and engaged with the poetry, fiction and drama of numerous French, English and German writers. His commentaries on the visual arts are among his most challenging publications, and he made telling contributions to current political concerns. His influence has been felt across an even wider range of disciplines and institutions, political movements and creative practices.
Central strands
Such a productive and comprehensive intellect would be difficult to summarize briefly, but we may draw out some of the central strands of Derridas thinking. The set of assumptions at which much of his work takes aim  assumptions at the heart of both the Western philosophical tradition and of what goes for common sense  can be labelled presence. When I reflect on my own consciousness what I experience is self-presence: there seems to be no intervening medium between my sense of myself and that self. Similarly, the world I see and hear is present to me without mediation. The meanings I constantly encounter seem immediately present; its hard to see how the apparently simple (spatial) here and (temporal) now of being in the world could be divided or complicated.
Presence is implicit in Western philosophys reliance on reason, which distinguishes sharply between what is present (now, here) and what is absent (past or future, somewhere else), and searches for a pure origin and secure ground for thought, summed up in the Greek word logos  hence Derridas name for this way of thinking, logocentrism. If presence is fundamental and inalienable, anything that threatens to complicate or sully it must be regarded as secondary, derivative and regrettable. For presence is a value; it is what is proper, proper to meaning, to consciousness, to existence, but also good and correct (the French propre carries a suggestion of cleanliness and purity). Derrida defines the metaphysics of presence as the enterprise of returning strategically, ideally, to an origin or to a priority thought to be simple, intact, normal, pure, standard, self-identical, in order then to think in terms of derivation, complication, deterioration, accident, etc.
But what if presence were a fantasy, a product of our desires rather than the way things are In his early works, Derrida analysed a number of philosophical, linguistic, autobiographical and anthropological texts to show how, again and again, attempts to keep at bay the impurities that threaten presence succeed only in proving that those apparently secondary properties are in fact primary. The best-known instance in these early studies is the relationship between speech and writing, the subject of Of Grammatology and of part of Dissemination. In the history of Western thought, Derrida argues, there is an assumption that speech is primary and self-sufficient while writing is a secondary system by which speech is transcribed. In all the thinkers he examines, writing is found wanting in comparison to speech because it is cut off from its source, open to corruption, a set of dead symbols rather than the lively expression of a self, and thus of presence.
Careful reading
But Derrida doesnt simply point out this continuing prejudice; by means of careful reading, he shows how the very properties for which writing is repeatedly found wanting by thinkers from Plato to Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Ferdinand de Saussure and Claude Lvi-Strauss are what make speech possible. Speech too, no matter how immediate it feels to speaker and hearer, is mediated by the system of language and by the cultural context of speaker and hearer, and can always be falsified or misunderstood. Language, in any form, is a kind of writing (Derrida calls this generalized sense arche-writing); it is never a pure manifestation of presence  and only because this is so can it function at all. This is the insight that the thinkers under consideration have to resist, often quite vehemently, in order to preserve the illusion of the purity and simplicity of presence.
The point of this demonstration, which Derrida carried out over hundreds of pages of close analysis of works such as Platos Phaedrus, Rousseaus Confessions, Saussures Course in General Linguistics and Lvi-Strausss Tristes Tropiques, is not simply to correct a mistaken view of the way language works; for Derrida it is the sign of a larger problem at the core of Western thought, one that underlies not only philosophical treatments of meaning, subjectivity and communication, but which also has profound ethical implications. Much of Derridas energy in the later part of his career went into developing these ethical consequences. -Times Literary Supplement

Lanka Prosperity Index increases
Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI), increased to 0.771 in 2017 from 0.661 recorded in 2016, mainly due to improvements in Economy and Business Climate and Socio-Economic Infrastructure sub-indices.
Economy and Business Climate sub-index has improved during 2017, due to increase in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and enhancements of the aspects associated with employment.
With regard to the sub index of Socio-Economic Infrastructure, improvements to the road network with the extensions to the expressways, construction of bridges and flyover projects, availability of electricity facilities and improvements in pipe borne water quality were the key drivers.
Even though the Well-being of the People sub index has declined during 2017 mainly due to the reduced levels of purity of environment and air quality, improvements were recorded in the aspects of availability of healthcare facilities, availability and quality of education, wealth of people and their engagement in entertainment activities.
Provincial Prosperity Indices, compiled to measure the level of prosperity across provinces, increased in North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Western provinces.Meanwhile, enhancements in rankings could be observed in North Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces.

The Last Ten Days
I never met my paternal grandfather. He died before I was born. Of my maternal grandfather, I have vague memories, but he too died before I was old enough to speak - or write. I never got to show them any of my stories, never got to hear their own stories of living through two World Wars. Had they lived, would they have let me write their memoirs I hope so. At least, from what I have heard of him, I have no doubt my paternal grandfather would tell me the same things Mike Chabons grandfather tells Chabon shortly before he dies. After Im gone, write it down. Explain everything. Make it mean something. Use a lot of those fancy metaphors of yours. Put the whole thing in proper chronological order, not like this mishmash Im making you.
The end result of the stories Chabons grandfather tells him is a book called Moonglow. As with most other stories of our generation, this story too is about the reverberations of the Second World War. For, as the author points out, the Second World War has set the tone for nothing less than the entire contemporary world. Everything is traceable back to the Second World War, he says. Thats true not just of politics and the nations that are in contention in various ways around the world. Its also true socially and in the ways that we all have grown up and have been schooled to look at the world. And, culturally, in terms of stories that have predominated, so many of them are ultimately rooted in some way or another in the Second World War, whether thats James Bond or Marvel comics or Star Trek. You can see the influence of those six years of conflict just absolutely everywhere.
And so, in Moonglow, the narrators grandfather is on his deathbed, with his inhibitions loosed by pain medication. He recounts his lifes adventures, from his childhood in Philadelphia to his experience as a soldier during the invasion of Germany, his career at NASA, his time in prison, his marriage to a holocaust victim, and, finally, the last days of his life in Florida and in Oakland, where he lies dying. The reader never gets to know his name. Instead, the narrator Mike Chabon calls him, my grandfather.
Only, he is not really Mike Chabons grandfather (nor step-grandfather to be precise). He is a half real, half imaginary figure in this story written by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Michael Chabon. Similarly, neither is the narrator, Mike Chabon, totally real nor totally unreal. At times Mike Chabon in the book is the real Mike Chabon who writes the book (Author Chabon like the narrator Chabon was with his grandfather during the last ten days of his life. His grandfather too died of bone cancer). At other times Mike Chabon in the book is a totally imaginary character who -coincidence galore - happens to share the same name as that of the author who writes about him.
If this is not confusing enough, Chabon writes in the Authors Note, In preparing this memoir I have stuck to facts except when facts refuse to conform with memory... warning tongue-in-cheek that he has taken liberties with the truth with due abandon, even while calling it a memoir. Chabon says he chose this method because a memoir would have been so boring; theres nothing to write, he explains. Thats the problem with life. So he wrapped what was true in a pack of lies.
The most crucial facts about Moonglow however, is not whether the grandfather is real or lives only in Chabons imagination. What really matters is the poignant love story about the narrators grandparents, who could never entirely be free of the terrors they witnessed. The war is forever present in the grandmother, prodded into insanity by nightmare visions of a skinless horse. When Mikes grandfather marries her and becomes her daughters stepfather, it is with the hope that he can mend what the war had broken. In fact, it is noted that from the first that was part of his attraction to her: not her brokenness but her potential for being mended and, even more, the challenge that mending her would pose...He thought that if he took on the job of loving this broken woman, some measure of sense or purpose might be returned to his life. He thought that in mending her he might also be mended.
In keeping to his grandfathers wishes the narrator uses many fancy metaphors in his story that can only be called ingenious inventions. Take this description of falling in love: At the possibility of truly being seen, something in his chest seemed to snap open like a parachute. And of how they got on so well: She was always threatening rain; he had been born with an umbrella in his hand. And how they lived: My grandparents forgave each other with the pragmatism of lovers in a plummeting airplane.
Among all the beautiful prose of this novel that centers entirely around some of the most precious people in our lives  our grandparents  giving us a glimpse of the lives they led when they were young and healthy in a world totally alien to us, there is a long passage where the narrator and his dying grandfather talk about the point of it all. This dialogue so aptly sums up the difference between the present generation and the older generations.
You try to take advantage of the time you have. Thats what they tell you to do. But when youre old, you look back and you see all you did with all that time is wasted. All you have is a story of things you never started or couldnt finish. Im ashamed of myself.
Im not ashamed of you, I said. Im proud. My grandfather made another one of his faces. This face said that what I knew about shame, what my entire generation, with its deployment of confession as a tool for self-aggrandizement, knew about shame would fit into half a pistachio shell.
No doubt, this would probably be the look of all grandfathers in the presence of their 21st century progeny. That is why Moonglow so wonderful. The fantastic stories of Chabons grandfather might make you think they are a world away from where you live but they will always turn out to hit home.

Making life better for cancer patients
The Maya Family Fiesta has been organized for our own fraternal inmates of the Apeksha Cancer Hospital, at the Maharagama Urban Council Sports Arena. The event will be on November 23, 24 and 25 and is organized by Fathima Himaya Niyaz, a mother of two, and hers is a very special story.
Q: Whats your motivation behind organizing such an event
A: From my young days, I had nurtured this dream that I should earn something with the sweat of my own brow, and do something useful for my country. I run my own salon. It is in the meanwhile, that I got to associate with the Fight Cancer Team. I consider it my good fortune to meet with this volunteer group of people. I felt I am serving the needs of somebody by my own effort, by teaming up with this set of folk. It is along with this sentiment that I began to realize that I have to do something with my hard earned cash for cancer victims. This is how I began organizing this fiesta.
Q: How did you decide to set aside the money realized through the Fiesta, for the purpose of the welfare of cancer patients
A: I met many cancer patients while I worked with this group. In all of those instances, I was severely affected mentally, watching their plight. Sometimes I used to think all day about them. We do not know the path our lives would take in the future. I decided to donate the money realized through this project, to the welfare of cancer patients, because I thought I should do something, when I am still able to.
Q: Tell us how you teamed up with the Fight Cancer Team
A: A close friend of mine is one of its members. He made me a part of the event surrounding the first scanning of a patient with the PET scanning machine. I was then able to make a full tour of the Apeksha Hospital, and to talk to the patients there, and empathize with their pain, and their plight.
I was deeply hurt seeing as I did the suffering of these people who were engaged in a battle between life and death. Several times, I broke down and cried. I decided to join the Team so that I would be able to do something for these folk.
I witnessed firsthand the experiences of those who were cancer victims, even as we were enjoying our lives, being able to eat, drink and be merry.
Q: A special feature of the event is dedicated to children,you said
A: Yes, I spend most of my leisure hours with kids. Im a mother of two kids too. Children have minds as fragile as flowers, and they are so innocent.
The Himaya Maya Family Fiesta event is exclusively for the entertainment of kids. I made Uncle Upul who organizes events for the benefit of children a part of this effort, and he has incorporated magic shows, and activities such as face painting, into it.
There are musical shows with the participation of Sri Lankas most talented musicians. I enjoy along with the children, more than I enjoy watching them having a good time. I believe we must be their age, rather than make them act ours. I ask parents earnestly to bring their children along for this fiesta.
Q: Who helps you organize this event
A: My husband is of tremendous assistance. He sacrifices his own time dedicated to his business ventures, to ensure that my goals in this regard are met. Also I would like to take this opportunity to convey my gratitude for media friends as well.
Q: Please tell us about your future plans
A: I would try to do the best I can for the Apeksha Hospital. If anyone desires to do anything for the patients there, I urge them to stop thinking and get involved.
I am organizing this Fiesta with good intentions. I need the strength to reach my goal. I will not stop at that, if this mission is a success. I hope to assist patients in a different hospital in the same way. There are many people, such as kidney and heart patients who suffer in silence.
A patient is a victim in serious need, and the family members suffer along with such a person. I learnt this at the Maharagama Apeksha Cancer Hospital.
Q: How does anybody get in touch with you
A: Himay Bridal Salon is my workplace, and anyone can meet me there. I am someone who derives pleasure from making someone happy, stylish and fashionable. You could also connect with me on Facebook on Himaya Bridal, and youd be able to learn about the work I do.

Manufacturing activities,  services sector growth up
All the sub-indices of PMI Manufacturing recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion in October compared to September.
The improvement observed in manufacturing activities in October was mainly driven by the improvement in new orders and production, especially in manufacturing of food and beverages activities, led by the positive outlook with the seasonal demand.
Even though the employment in the manufacturing of food and beverages activities has improved with seasonal trend, overall employment slowed down. This was mainly evident in manufacturing of textiles, wearing apparels, leather and related activities due to difficulties to find employees in the market.
Stock of purchases indicates an expansion with the stock holding in manufacturing of furniture activities in preparation for the upcoming season. Lengthening of suppliers delivery time usually indicates that economy is booming with expanding activities in the short run.
Meanwhile, the services sector expanded at a higher pace in October, underpinned by a strong upturn in business activities, expectations for activity and new businesses. The expansion in business activities was seen mainly across financial services and transportation and warehousing sub sectors.
However, respondents cited that the depreciation of the local currency had an adverse impact on import volumes and thereby on their activity growth. New Businesses also expanded across financial services and professional services sub sectors. Employment levels expanded at a higher rate in October owing to the expansion in Business Activities. Service providers optimism on the three months business outlook strengthened in October 2018 due to upcoming festive season and the peak season for tourism. However, respondents raised concerns over the current political situation and the weakening of the domestic currency which could moderate the realisation of expectations.

Musings by Hiranthi Jayasundara will be held at the J. D. A. Perera Gallery, 46, Horton Place, Colombo 7, on November 23 and 24 from 8am to 8pm.
Hiranthi explains what made her come up with the idea and what she wishes to encapsulate through musings. When I was at ACAD (Alberta College of Art and Design) Calgary, I have seen galleries of Art from talented Students and Artists. I have visited many such Art exhibitions and Art Museums. People display their work to show the world their talents and also to be admired. As I have a reasonable collection of my paintings, I thought it may be a good idea to display them in a solo art exhibition, and some art loving people in this country may find them fascinating. And also, it will be a platform to display my artistic talents to the local audience, she said.
Her ambition is to take her paintings into international art exhibitions in future. Musings therefore is the stepping stone in my journey as an artist and to be recognized as an artist through my talents, she said.
Hailing from the Southern Province of Sri Lanka Hiranthi is a talented upcoming artist in town. She had her primary and secondary schooling in Galle. While in grade 9, Hiranthi was selected for Canadian Crossroads International Student Exchange Program as the only student from Sri Lanka. She stayed with a young host family in Canada for three months and had to interact with children from over 100 countries across the globe for various social and cultural programs. This was one wonderful opportunity which opened up a whole new world for her at a very young age.
Hiranthi says she would rather consider her painting as a fulfilling pastime and a hobby which gives her immense satisfaction. I do my painting during my free time and when Im in the right mood. This kind of a thing need a lot of time and freedom and you just cannot rush through. But, finding a free time is little tough as I am a mother of two loving sons who constantly seek my attention. However, with my present engagement as an Art Teacher at Asian International School (AIS), I consider being an art teacher is a fitting metaphor for my life and career. After all it is my passion, she said.
I left for Calgary, Canada in 2009 to take up an assignment as a teacher and served in Canada until 2014. During that time I entered The Alberta College of Art and Design as an external student and studied Acrylic painting. Graduating from this academy was a big achievement for me, as I wanted to learn the proper techniques and obtain a deeper subject knowledge and I got the opportunity to sharpen and enhance my skills, she added.
Hiranthi says when it comes to painting it is all about imagination and self-expression. I only do Acrylic paintings right at the moment because the colours are easy to mix up to get vibrant shades and tints.I prefer to do figurative and Abstract Art, I do landscape Art as well. But I think my passion is for dancers and horses, she added.
Musings will have a collection of 37, Figurative, Abstract and Landscape Art displayed to be admired and for sale

Natural farming  the key to long-term sustainability
Throughout our ancient history, agriculture was one of the most highly regarded occupations in Sri Lanka. Among the varying communities, the farmers were the highest respected. This shows the importance given to agriculture and food security in peoples daily lives compared to other professions. Even the ancient kings who constructed and maintained irrigation systems in the dry zone were venerated for their contribution to sustaining agriculture.
In the hill country of Sri Lanka, valley bottoms were irrigated during dry periods through canals that collected spring water into hill slopes. Hills performed the function of reservoirs and helped to manage watersheds. Therefore, the thick forest that covered hilltops was never destroyed and as a result, it helped to prevent soil erosion and regulate water flow.
The rice farming soils, as well as the agroecosystem, was a co-evolved system that maintained its production potential for literally thousands of years. Modern history demonstrates that the great soil capital of this nation was practically lost with the advent of colonial plantation agriculture.
Then in the middle of the last century, Sri Lanka adapted (what was called) the Green Revolution in favour of high-yield farming. As a part of the Green Revolution, scientists developed new varieties of seeds which changed the way agriculture was carried by the Sri Lankan farmers for centuries. To produce a good yield from these varieties of seeds and prevent pest attacks, chemical fertilizers for the soil and pesticides were also introduced.
The farmers were pressurized not only to buy these seeds but also to invest in fertilizers and pesticides. They were given loans for the initial investment into the crop. The interest rates and the other expenditure further put the farmers into a cycle of debts.
It nearly took four decades for our farming community to become aware of the dangers. They realised that complete dependence of high input seeds and fertilizers had robbed them of crop independence. With the advent of the Green Revolution, they lost their interest and ability to independently manage their farms and over the years, they were beginning to lose their indigenous farming knowledge and practices.
Indian experience
In the past decade, India has done a fair number of research programmes preparing retrospections of their adapted Green Revolution, its achievement and limits in terms of agricultural productivity improvement and its effect on the environment.
Indian experience revealed that although the output has increased tremendously, it has given rise to numerous ecological problems, such as waterlogging, soil erosion, lowering of underground water table, soil, water and air pollution, the decline in soil fertility and the emergence of several diseases and health hazards.
New revolution
Therefore, the main point faced by us today is how the country can move towards a new green revolution which demands people to produce and consume responsibly. It doesnt mean going back thousand years, but having a combination of what nature can offer together with scientific knowledge which will guarantee a healthier, sustainable, human-friendly farming which will be and more acceptable.
In order to do it, we need to restore the time-tested soil and agricultural practices of Sri Lanka. But how This writer agrees with Dr. Ranil Senanayake, environmental scientist, when he says that there are only two methods. One is the re-training of farmers on the management of their lands without a heavy energy and toxin input. The other is to build back the fertility of farming soils so that the natural productivity is re-established.
According to Dr. Senanayake, we have no national plans for transitioning towards optimal production with little or no external inputs, and the ignorance of that practice has led to the guardians of our agriculture policy, planning and implementation to just rely on the distribution of more of the addictive fertilizer.
He further adds: When soil loses its tree cover and the inputs of organic matter to feed the living organisms within the soil, the fertility goes down, and the overall plant health of the soil loses its cohesive strength. The loss of cohesive strength accelerates erosive processes which are brought about through the loss of soil binding agents.
He also recommends solutions to this problem. One is the addition of composts and deep-rooted plants, another is by immunising with cultured soil bacteria, and the third solution is by incorporating green manure that is grown as a preparatory crop before tilling.
In addition, there are many commercial companies and farmers in Sri Lanka and abroad with a long experience of soil building and organic production.
Dr. Senanayake states that there are many examples of farms in Sri Lanka that have moved away from the chemical farming regimes to organic farming regimes with no loss of crop.
Foundation
Any action must begin a national consciousness and awareness programme. First of all, the real connection between food and health should be reinforced among the people. This could be done by a national school-wide education programme and an adult education programme via media.
It may be a good idea if we can create a National Foundation for a long-term eco-initiative to protect natural resources of land, soil, water and vegetation. It needs to be a public-private enterprise.
The Foundation can help farmers develop their crop and become economically self-reliant by organising regular innovative agricultural workshops. They must be trained to choose indigenous seeds and crops which are best suited to the local soil and climate. They must be further trained to develop, dry, preserve, store and pack seeds for use by other farmers as well.
In the initial stages, the programme can facilitate interaction with farmers and public to apprise them of the causes for the decline in crop productivity, escalation in production costs resulting in higher consumer prices.
The seminars, lectures and demonstrations can create awareness in farmers about the dangers in chemical farming. The Foundation can go further in search of remedial solutions for some of the major environmental degradation factors in the experiments with the farmers and also scientists. Appropriate training programmes on chemical-free and zero budget agriculture have yielded positive results in India and a number of Far East countries. There is no doubt that Sri Lanka can accomplish the same success if implemented in a well-planned and organised manner.
In 2016, the Government started an ambitious three-year agricultural plan to build a toxin-free nation. The plan reimagined the countrys agricultural future based on the principles of agroecology: an approach which prioritizes sustainable and people-centred practices over corporate profit.
However, the Governments commitment has not been translated into a national policy. It resulted in a significant division between those who support smallholder-led agroecology and those committed to agribusiness policies, including the use of chemicals. As a result, the project has not effectively materialised.
Multi-institutional support
However, to make a natural farming initiative sustainable, an integrated approach to improving soil fertility and productivity is required. The Government should take a policy decision in this regard to take the initiative and provide the necessary policy support. The Governments support will be greatly welcomed by the farming community but the bottleneck will be the need for transferring the technology of processing.
To make the farmers manage their own units and get into marketing themselves is the true challenge. We need to facilitate interfacing of the production process with the processing and marketing of agricultural produce.
The next will be to support the creation of models within each agroecosystem. Ideally, this work should be done by a committee consisting of Agriculture Ministry, Department, NGOs and farmer groups. In parallel, there should be the encouragement of companies who can provide biological inputs for sustainable agriculture and for companies who can market or export organic products.
There also should be a liaison between the EDB, Sri Lankan Standards Institute, organic certifiers and other institutions authorised to issue a certification of toxin-free products.

Worlds End tragedy
New safety measures in place
A special programme has been implemented to ensure the safety of local and foreign tourists at Worlds End to prevent a tragedy as occurred last week, said the Custodian of Horton Plains National Park in Nuwara Eliya, Pradeep Kumara.
On November 11, 35-year-old German tourist Julia Helga fell from Worlds End while attempting to take a selfie. After this incident, the Wildlife Department, on the instructions of the Wildlife Director General and the Central Province Assistant Wildlife Director has paid attention to safety at this tourist site.
Accordingly, steps have been taken to display notice boards in several local and foreign languages warning tourists of potential danger at Worlds End. A Wildlife Officer is also posted on duty at the site daily.
From November 12 onwards, tourist guides were asked to accompany their tourists to Worlds End, without staying back at the ticket counter.
Schoolteachers who accompany students are also informed to be vigilant regarding the safety of their students when visiting this place, he said.
Pradeep Kumara said several incidents have also been reported from the same place where Julia Helga fell and therefore, they have paid their attention towards fixing a safety net at this place.

Panasian Power records 452%-1H PAT growth
Panasian Power PLC (PAP.N), one of Sri Lankas leading green energy solutions providers, posted a consolidated net profit of Rs. 54 million for the quarter and Rs. 153 million for the six months ending September 30, 2018.
This represents a 110% and 452% increase respectively over the corresponding period of the previous year. Furthermore, operating profit for the quarter increased to Rs. 74.7 million from Rs. 41.8 million during the same period the previous year. This represents a growth of 79% for the quarter and a total growth of 159% for the half year despite the increase in costs.
Major contributors to this result were the Padiyapelella mini hydropower plant and the Rathganga Mini Hydropower plant which contributed Rs. 93 million and Rs. 50 Million respectively to the Groups net profit during the period under review. In addition, the Manelwala mini hydropower plant too made significant contributions towards the growth in revenue during the quarter. The period under review also includes the Groups diversified solar power income which was initiated in the previous quarter.
During this period the Groups revenue increased by 137% compared to the previous six months once again due to major contributions from the Padiyapelella and the Rathganga mini hydropower plants. By exercising prudent cost control practices, the Group was able to reduce the finance cost by 9% to Rs. 45.5 million during the same period. Commenting on these strong results, Panasian Power Chief Executive Officer Dr. Prathap Ramanujam said, We are pleased to once again post strong results thereby validating the confidence all our shareholders have in us.
This continued success is only possible thanks to the calculated steps we took last year to diversify our income streams and implement vigilant cost control measures that have helped grow our bottom line. We have since gone from strength to strength and fully expect this trend to continue in the near term as we unveil and complete new hydro and solar projects that take our country closer to a clean, green energy future.
Speaking about the companys future, Dr. Prathap said, We have commissioned an 800 Kw rooftop solar power project during the quarter and a 900 Kw rooftop solar plant in Kelaniya is in the final stage of construction. The latter will be connected to the grid during the third quarter of this financial year. These projects represent our continued commitment to diversification and we believe they will fuel our future growth.

Party leaders resolve to hold trouble free sittings
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stressed on the need to pass the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the government by name or using the electronic voting system, for him to take a decision.
The President addressing the All Party Conference held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, said that it was the most acceptable mode of action for him, the people and the international community.
The President also observed that a Voice Vote is acceptable in accordance with Standing Orders. However, when we have to take a decision on a very vital issue like the change of government, voice voting is not proper and it lacks transparency, a communiqu issued by the Presidents Media Unit said.
The All Party Conference was called to consider the prevailing situation and to discuss the action necessary to resolve for smooth sailing. The deliberation resolved to conduct parliamentary business without undue disturbances when Parliament meets today.
The communique issued by the Presidential Secretariat said that the Leaders of the Political Parties present at the deliberations agreed that Party Leaders should decide the future course of action and the way to conduct affairs in Parliament when Party Leader meet today.
The All Party Conference was well attended by all political parties invited except the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). The JVP had informed him in writing that they opt to stay out of this conference.

Pollard stars as South Africa down Scotland at Murrayfield
EDINBURGH, Saturday: Handre Pollard plundered 18 points to help South Africa follow up their dramatic late win against France by becoming only the second visiting team in two years to win in Scotland with a 26-20 victory on Saturday.
On the day he collected his 38th cap to pass Butch James as South Africas second most capped outside-half, Pollard ran in a first-half try and nailed two conversions and three penalties as Rassie Erasmus Springboks followed New Zealands Murrayfield success of 12 months ago as only the second away team in 12 matches to triumph on Scottish soil.
After two second-half penalty misses by the otherwise outstanding Blue Bulls pivot, however, it needed a 72nd-minute penalty by replacement Elton Jantjies to settle the match, stretching South Africas advantage to six points.
A break by Pollard paved the way for the opening try, the fly-half bursting over the halfway line before his provincial half-back colleague Embrose Papier added his own cutting edge to an attack that culminated in right wing Sbu Nkosi feeding centre Jesse Kriel for a try to the left of the posts.
Pollard added the extras and it might have been worse for the Scots as they struggled to contain South Africas power and pace in the opening stages, but they struck back after 18 minutes.
Former Stormers player Huw Jones combined superbly with winger Sean Maitland before feeding his Glasgow centre partner Pete Horne for a try that Scotlands scrum-half Laidlaw converted to tie the scores at 7-7.
Not that Scotland were level for long. Two minutes later, full-back Willie le Roux shipped the ball wide for Pollard to breach the home defence for his sides second try.
The Springbok number 10 added the conversion and followed up with a 24th-minute penalty, stretching the lead to 17-7. Again, though, Scotland clawed their way back.
Laidlaw landed a 26th-minute penalty. Then it took a last-ditch hack into touch by Le Roux to prevent Scotlands rampaging fullback Stuart Hogg from finishing a 60m break up the left wing.
From the line-out, Watson caught the Springboks napping, darting to the front to collect Stuart McInallys throw before crossing the whitewash.
Laidlaws conversion made it 17-17, though a 38th-minute penalty by Pollard edged South Africa 20-17 in front at the interval.
Seven minutes into the second half it was level again, Laidlaw landing his second penalty after Le Roux had been penalised and contentiously yellow-carded for an attempted interception that referee Romain Poite gave as a deliberate knock-on after conferring with TMO Ben Skeen.
Not that South Africa suffered for their numerical disadvantage, with Pollards third penalty giving them a 23-20 lead after 49 minutes.
After Jantjies penalty, though, South Africa had their sixth successive win over the Scots.

Pragmatic cooperation,  beneficial to china -sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is one of the first countries to openly support and join in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), said Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan.
He was making the opening speech at the Chinese Embassy and the Bandaranaike Center for International Studies (BCIS orgniased international seminar on BRI at Five Years -- Regional and Global Dimensions at the BMICH last Friday to mark the 5th Anniversary of the BRI.
The pragmatic cooperation between our two countries has made a great contribution to Sri Lankas development, and also brought tangible benefits to our two countries.
The completion of the Norochcholai Power Station provided about 40% of the nations electricity supply, the Colombo Airport Expressway has brought great convenience to domestic and international travelers.
The CICT has become the fastest growing container terminal in Asia, and the Moragahakanda Project, which is the biggest water reservoir in Sri Lanka, has brought great benefits to local agriculture and people.
Besides, Colombo Port City development, as well as the Hambantota Port and Industrial Park, are expected to become the new engines for Sri Lankan economic take-off. Today the world is undergoing great changes, with instability and uncertainty continues to increase, while economic globalization and global governance encounter setbacks.
To tackle all these challenges and to promote the development of the world economy, BRI has provided a common solution to the world.
Over the past five years, the BRI has developed from an initiative to a reality, from a vision to an important platform, and has become more and more popular around the world.
By the end of September, nearly 130 countries, regions and organizations had signed more than 150 agreements under the BRI framework with China.
The trade value between China and BRI countries exceed US$ 5.5 trillion. Chinas direct investment to these countries exceeds US$ 70 billion, which have created 244,000 jobs for the local people.
As a new initiative, BRI need to keep advancing in the exploration, keep growing in the challenge, and keep innovating in the development. We are glad to see that more and more countries have already begun to share their achievements and constructive suggestions under the BRI framework, he added.
Since its birth, BRI has always adhered to the golden rules of joint consultation, contribution and shared benefits, following international and market rules. The cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is a very good example of the BRI practice.
He said that they are confident that as long as all countries could make joint efforts and constantly push forward BRI cooperation, it will bring more and better prospects to the world.

## Title: Public Trustee takes leaf out of Queensland

Public Trustee takes leaf out of Queensland
Last year, the Queensland Public Trustee prepared 28,272 wills for Queenslanders in Australia. They are also the largest will-makers in the Southern Hemisphere and the biggest Public Trustee in Australia, which has eight Public Trustees  one for each of their state and territories.
It has been 102 years since the Queensland Public Trustee was established and we have been around for 88 years. Though we were both established around the same time and have a similar population, they have far outstripped us, said Sri Lankan Public Trustee Sanath Weeratne. He undertook a study tour of the Queensland Public Trustee in October of this year and held discussions with the Queensland Public Trustee Peter Carne to understand ways in which our own Department can be improved.
Even if we can incorporate one percent of what they do, we would have achieved something, he added, speaking in an interview with the Daily News.
The differences between the Sri Lankan and Queensland Trustees however are too many to count. If the latter have invested in air-conditioned and fireproof underground bunkers to keep all their wills safe, the local office keeps them all in a cupboard at the home of late D.B. Jayathilaka on Bauddhaloka Mawatha, the office of the Public Trustee. Last year, however, Weeratne managed to get fire extinguishers to ensure the wills since 1930 were somewhat safe. The Queensland Public Trustee is also looking to go digital and soon will not have to keep stocking perishable paper wills. Weeratne in the meantime explained that they still needed to get their accounting and workflow software sorted.
Despite these obvious challenges however, Weeratne is optimistic that the biggest takeaway from his tour of Queensland should be their emphasis on proper systems.
There is no magic to what they do, they just have proper systems and protocols in place. And that is what we need, he said.
Changes, a must
Having studied the current organisational structure of the Queensland Public Trustee, their workflow, the manner in which they are integrated with other public services, engagement between regional offices, an overview of the laws, practices and regulations related to the Public Trustee and the ways in which procedures and systems are put in place to increase public engagement with the Public Trustee through digital platforms, Weeratne spoke of how some of their systems could be implemented into the Sri Lankan Public Trustees Department.
Firstly, he emphasised on the need for the department to be financially self-sufficient, They do not depend on Treasury funding like us, and I believe with the proper management of our assets, we too can achieve that. All these people who left us their wills did not leave us liabilities, they are all assets. We are a cash-rich organisation.
In addition to finances, the Sri Lankan Public Trustee observed that having his staff come under the combined services made it hard to retain and train good staff. The majority of public servants come under the combined services category where every year they can be transferred to another department in the government. It takes us at least six to eight months to train someone to handle the work we do, but then they are transferred and we have to start all over again. It also does not motivate them to work better here, because they know it is not permanent.
In his report to the Ministry on the visit, Weeratne proposed that the cadre system be closed so that the staff can build a career out of working in the Public Trustees Department, thus making people more committed to the job. At present, a transfer to the Public Trustee is seen as an easy job, a place where they can relax for five years before being transferred somewhere else.
Eighty percent of our problems would be solved with the proper and trained staff, he said.
Weeratne has also requested that their cadre numbers be increased from the current 87. The Queensland Public Trustee employs close to 600 staff to carry out its duties and whilst the Sri Lankan counterpart has not expanded its business activities to the extent of Queensland, Weeratne said they were severely short-staffed and an expansion could be supported better with more staff.
His expansion plans mainly revolve around opening up more regional branches. At present, Sri Lanka only has one office in Colombo, but Weeratne believed that they could dramatically increase their portfolio if they were more accessible to the people through their regional branches. The Queensland Trustee has 15 branches and today, administers an asset portfolio worth US$ 2.7 billion. Sri Lanka, in the meantime, has an asset portfolio of Rs. 3 billion.
We need branches at least in Jaffna, the South and Kandy, so people can get to know what we do and come to us, he said.
What a Public Trustee can be
For the last 88 years, the focus of the Sri Lankan Public Trustee has been limited. They have mostly been satisfied with managing estates or property of individuals who come to them and have them execute and manage their wills. Weeratne however says that this is a department with much more potential. In Queensland, the Public Trustee not only offers a free will-making service but also conducts awareness programmes through Will Week to have more people sign up. In addition they also undertake executor services, manage Enduring Powers of Attorney (allowing the elderly to nominate who would manage their affairs when they are incapacitated or no longer able to), manage real estate, help people with applying for income tax returns, and manage trusts.
It is a long walk for us, but we have to start somewhere, said Weeratne.
The proposition of having the Public Trustee offer free will-making services is something Sri Lanka can adopt, he added, and it would mean that many who cannot offer a lawyer can come to the Trustee and get their wills made. Of course, private lawyers would be up in arms against the Public Trustee, but this is a service that as a government department we can provide.
The more wills the Public Trustee can make, the more beneficial it is for the countrys economy, he said, as unused lands and property can be put to the best use for the general public after a person passes away.
One of the best lessons to take from the Queensland Public Trustee Department however was its integration with other public services such as the Office of the Registrar of Births and Deaths, Marriages, etc. This meant that whenever the person whose will the office was managing passed away or had a life-changing incident take place, the Department is instantly notified and their will can be looked into.
This is of special significance to the Sri Lankan Public Trustees Department which found out this year that there were 252 unopened last wills since the 1930s and they did not know whether the owners had passed away or not. If we can come up with a way to connect the Registrar of Birth and Deaths, Department of Immigration and Emigration, and all other government departments in one system, we would be easily notified when things change. Now we have to go to court and go through a lengthy court process to figure out what to do with these wills, said Weeratne.
The Queensland Public Trustee also collects all financial information, from the individuals tax file number to the loans and debts the person may have incurred and even medical records (if acting as an enduring power of attorney) when making his or her will. Thus a will prepared in such a comprehensive manner is less likely to be challenged in courts, explained Weeratne.
This means that the Public Trustee does not have to run around ensuring that the will legally stands which we do here now.
If the Sri Lankan Public Trustee can revamp successfully, it would also help tackle many of the property issues families in Sri Lanka go through. The encouragement towards having people write a will is can be positive and not only increase the states assets, but also ensure that there are few families that break apart after a wealthy family member passes away.

Puppy-shaped ice-cream
A cafe in Taiwan has been getting a lot of attention online for serving puppy-shaped ice-cream that most people describe as adorable and terrifying at the same time.
When you think about food, the first thing that probably comes to mind is taste, but the fact is that eating is a visual experience as well, and sometimes you can be put off by a dish, even though you know it is delicious. Thats kind of the vibe Im getting from the puppy-shaped ice-cream served at the Sowing the Sweets caf, in Taiwan. Im sure it tastes good  its ice-cream, after all  but at the same time I find the idea of digging into this realistic puppy with a spoon disturbing and morbid. Its not clear exactly how the cafe creates the puppy ice-cream, but Im pretty sure theyre using the same type of high-quality silicone molds as this Thai dessert shop that went viral last year for its puppy-shaped coconut milk puddings. It doesnt even matter how they make them, the important question is who has the heart and stomach to eat these frozen treats Where do you even start Do you take a bite out of its face, a paw or do you just sink the spoon into the puppys back
Well, Reddit user Penguin4466, whose photos of the disturbing dessert went viral on the popular social network, actually managed to eat one of these treats. Most redittors who commented on his photos agreed that the puppy ice-cream just looks to realistic to eat.
Too real. Could not eat, Reddit user goblingirl wrote.
What did it taste like Sin and regret Im-a-huge-fan asked.
Id eat it, but Id cry while doing so, queenfirst commented.
The only thing that could make this puppy-shaped ice-cream even less appetizing is if they actually filled it up with a red-syrup for even more realism

A quick solution, the hope of all
The assurance given by President Maithripala Sirisena to Government officials that the current political crisis will be resolved within the coming days, no doubt would be received with a huge sigh of relief by the general public. It is no exaggeration to say that the whole country is today going through a surreal dream unable to grasp what really is happening in their midst. Political grandstanding has to take precedence over reason and sound judgement by all actors in this drama resulting in the countrys image being blackened. Hence the sooner the crisis is resolved the better it will be for all, particularly the health of the country.
Addressing Ministry Secretaries, District Secretaries, general secretaries and heads of public bodies on Saturday, the President appealed to them to ensure that the public sector is not crippled and to move forward effectively and efficiently. While asserting that the current political crisis will be resolved, he reiterated that it was the responsibility of government officials to uphold the administration and ensure its undisturbed continuation. While some ministry secretaries apprised the President of the practical difficulties they encountered due to the deepening political crisis, the President advised them to continue in the normal course. Above all he advised them to remain politically neutral. As officials engaged in serving the public it was important that they remain apolitical at all time, President Sirisena told the officials.
It is palpably evident that the effects of the current political imbroglio had seeped not only into the state administration but also enveloped the society at large and is having a deeply negative outcome. The general talk in the offices, in buses and the market place is about what is going to happen next. It is no exaggeration to say that the country is in a state of drift with the people looking aghast at the unfolding developments. The ugly scenes in Parliament over the last few days that were given live television coverage had also shocked the general public and is certain to have brought a bad reputation to the country.
Needless to say, the political unrest that, no doubt, had created a negative image of the country would also deal a body blow to the tourism industry and dent investor confidence. The tumble of the rupees against the dollar is continuing apace and is bound to have direct consequences on the economy. The cumulative effect of all these negatives will soon see this country pushed over a precipice if drastic action is not taken to reverse the trend.
It is in this context that the Presidents assurance of a solution to the current political in the coming days has come as a breath of fresh air in an otherwise gloomy scenario. At the time of writing the President had scheduled a meeting with the party leaders represented in parliament in an apparent bid to reach a comprise solution, with some newspapers even speculating that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too was due to meet the President along with the party leaders. In this respect the UNP has a bounden duty, as a party who had ruled this country, to agree on a comprise to end the stalemate, without sticking to its guns, since being adamant could only prolong the crisis.
The intransigence would also earn for itself the pubic wrath which would give vent to at a future election, since the public mood presently is for the political impasse to be resolved and the country returned to normality.
In this context Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa should be commended for offering to step down from his post if the No-Confidence motion brought against him would be presented in the proper manner, demonstrating that he did not want to cling onto power and was willing to take a step back for the greater good of the country. Speaking at a religious ceremony in Weeraketiya, Tangalle on Saturday the Premier said; if they (the UNP) take the vote in keeping with the Standing Orders of Parliament and show that they have a majority I am willing to step down.
This indeed is statesman like declaration where PM Rajapaksa, who was twice head of state, is demonstrating his willingness to make a sacrifice for the sake of the country. Even in his address to Parliament on Friday Premier Rajapaksa, amidst the cacophony, made the point that he had been Prime Minister and President before this and that it was no big deal for him to forego his post.
It is not clear yet as to what form the solution to the crisis will take and what the parties will decide at the discussion. Whatever it is, it will be the hope of each and every citizen of this country that the political gridlock would end and the wheels of the state start moving in earnest. Religious leaders too have appealed to all concerned for a break in the current deadlock without further delay. It is hoped that saner counsel prevails and wisdom dawns on all to realize the dire need of getting the country out of the present political quagmire.

Rare and deadly delicacy
Due to their thick, finger-like trunks and their eerie claw-like feet, the gooseneck barnacles growing on the rocks of Portugals most south-western coastline are known as Lucifers Fingers. They are sometimes referred to as the truffles of the sea, both because of their rarity and high price, but also because of how hard and risky they are to harvest. Restaurants in Portugal and Spain charge up to $115 for a plate of Lucifers Fingers, which may sound sound outrageously expensive two some people, but is justified by their rarity and the dangers barnacle hunters expose themselves to when harvesting them.
Lucifers Fingers, or percebes, cannot be farmed and only thrive on the on rocks in the ocean intertidal zone, where crashing waves provide them with plankton. This makes them notoriously dangerous to harvest, with hunters risking getting crushed against the rocks by crashing waves, or being rendered unconscious by the impact and drowning. The lucky ones escape with broken limbs or severe abrasions.
Never turn your back on God when you dive for Lucifers fingers, commercial diver Joo Rosrio told BBC last year.
When you dive for percebes and you turn your back on the unpredictability of the ocean, you will most likely be injured or killed. There are many cases of divers being knocked unconscious and drowning. The lucky ones get away with breaking an arm or leg or suffering abrasions where the rocks cut through their wetsuits.
Percebes hunters basically have to options; either swing down from 100-meter-high-cliffs with a rope and chiseling off at Lucifers Fingers during low tide, but risk getting crushed by breaking waves, or approach the rocks by boat, anchor at a safe distance and swim towards the cliff face, timing their chiseling to match the rhythm of the sea. Each option has its risks and hunters have yet to agree on which one is the safest. Lucifers Fingers harvesting is a regulated business in Portugal, with only 80 diving licenses issued each year, and a maximum daily harvesting quota of 15 kg per diver. Depending on quality and size, a kilo of percebes can fetch between 30 and 60 euros. Because of their high price, poaching is a serious issue along Portugals Costa Vicentina, and the police cant patrol everywhere at the same time. Locals consider these delicacies as their ATM in the sea and see it as their right to make withdrawals whenever they want, whether authorities like it or not. So are Lucifers Fingers worth $115 per serving Well, despite their name and unappetizing appearance, they are considered delicacies by sea food lovers who swear that the title of truffles of the sea is not wasted on them. As for how to cook them, the Portuguese generally agree that there is only one correct way to do it: boiling them in salt water for as long as it takes you to say the Lords Prayer, which in this case sounds appropriate. It shouldnt take longer than minute, after which they should be spooned on ice to stop the cooking process. Then they are ready to serve. Enjoy!

Refurbished train for Kelani Valley line
A refurbished train with five compartments refurbished at a cost of Rs. 70 million was added to the Kelani Valley railway line route on November 17, in fulfilment of a request made by commuters and the media for some time.
The train will service the Colombo Fort  Avissawella and Avissawella  Colombo Fort route, a press release by the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.
The release said the G8 model train imported in 1990 was fully refurbished at the Ratmalana railway workshops, while the compartments were refurbished by a local company.
So far 68 railway compartments have been refurbished and added to railway operations under the programme to refurbish 200 old compartments with modern facilities. Refurbishment of one compartment costs Rs. 12 million as against import of a new compartment which costs nearly Rs. 28 million. This helped the country to save valuable foreign exchange.
The Railway department has planned to import 160 railway compartments and two power sets with a complement of 11 compartments each, produced in India, before the end of this year. Similarly six railway engines would be imported next year to be deployed on the hill country line.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva who flagged off the train on its maiden run on the Kelani Valley line, said a large member of people including office workers used the Kelani Valley railway line to travel to Colombo. The Railway department earlier failed to add more trains and compartments on the Kelani Valley line due to its preoccupation with catering to commuters on the main lines. But he was happy to fulfil a request made by Kelani Valley commuters even belatedly, after 10 years. He said he has instructed the department to add another train with new compartments within the next two months.
The Minister said they had rendered a great amount of work to uplift the Railway service in recent years. The Kelani Valley railway line would be made a double track line under an ADB aid scheme worth US$ 200 million.

Rereading Demons and The Brothers Karamazov
WHAT DO TWO LATE masterpieces by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky, Demons (1872) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880), have in common, apart from the technical fact that the action of both novels takes place in Russia in the late 1860s and early 1870s Although their main common trait is quite evident, it goes unnoticed not only by ordinary readers but by the great majority of literary experts as well, even though it is indispensable in interpreting each of the novels. They are both narrated from the same perspective: from the point of view of a more (The Brothers Karamazov) or less (Demons) marginal character. That perspective, however, is not as simple as it usually isand this is where the problems begin.
Both Anton Lavrentyevich G. (Demons) and an anonymous narrator (Brothers) inform usmostly firsthandabout the events they have personally witnessed. Then they provide us with secondhand accounts from various reliable sources. Thereafter the narration becomes less and less trustworthy: alleged happenings, gossip, suppositions based on general beliefs about somebody or something, etc.all the way to the total impossibility of the two narrators having been able to learn what they are telling us. Curiously enough, both ordinary readers and literary experts very rarely, if ever, ask themselves the fundamental question: how our storytellers could have learned about events that, by their very nature, remained a total secret from everybody but the participants, who were either unable to disclose them (because, for example, they had died) or had no reason whatever to do so
The explanation for the absence of this elementary question is, of course, the literary genius of Dostoyevsky. He made the transitions from the possible to the impossible narrations so smooth, so imperceptible, that they remain invisible to all but the most attentive reader. For the rest, the mechanism of doubt that should always be triggered by an impossibility remains inactive. If you are not at the highest pitch of reading alertness, you accept what you are told by the two narrators at face value.
This opens up a very important question: why did Fyodor Mikhailovich choose such a complex and ambiguous point of view in the first place, when he had at his disposal an old and straightforward narrative perspective in which there are no impossibilities of this kindwhy didnt he simply narrate his two great novels from the point of view of the omniscient narrator Was he just experimenting with narrative perspectives for the sake of it, or did a more profound literary strategy and ambition lie behind it all If the latter is the case, then for what higher purpose did Dostoyevsky introduce one of the greatest literary inventions of the nineteenth century: the unreliable narrator
I believe I know the answer to this question, but I wouldnt be able to provide it here, in the very limited space that remains available to me after my long introduction. All I can give you is a hint in the form of a crucial question for each novel that hopefully should serve as an inspiration for you to reread, more attentively than before, Demons and The Brothers Karamazov, and to try to decode for yourself why it was necessaryinevitable, in factfor Dostoyevsky to tell his two great novels from the point of view of the unreliable narrator.

India play four Tests and three one-day internationals from early December, with three Twenty20s before that, starting in Brisbane on Wednesday.
Despite Australias form nosediving since the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March resulted in bans for Steve Smith and David Warner, the former spin great doesnt believe they have lost their aura.
I dont think so, he said. I always believe no team is weak at home.

Shastri didnt want to be drawn on Australias new friendlier approach to playing cricket under Justin Langer, which has seen them tone down the confrontational style that brought then so much success.

Experts will be on hand at each section to guide shoppers on pairing specialty ingredients for the best outcome, from selecting one of many cheeses sourced from around the world to an expertly sliced cut of meat.

Speaker must be held responsible - Rambukwella
Parliament was chaotic because the Speaker did not follow the stipulated procedure to present a No Confidence Motion, Government Co-Media Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said.
He was addressing the Senkadagala Podu Jana Peramuna (PJP) Bala Mandala Meeting held at the Pushpadana Hall in Kandy recently.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, responding to the request by the people, was back in active politics and in a few months, he impressed and draw people in their thousands to the new party.
The PJP is a leading political party in the country now since Prime Minister Rajapaksa leads it, Minister Rambukwella said.
He said Rajapaksa accepted the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena to put a stop to the attempts made by former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to sell the country.
The public marked the occasion of Mahinda Rajapaksa being appointed as the Prime Minister by having kiri bath in every town and village of the country, Keheliya Rambukwella said.
We faced the challenges by the UNP, TNA, JVP and other political parties effectively. We overcame Jayampathy Wickremerathne, Sumandhiran and the diaspora and we are ready to face the No Confidence Motion if it comes in the proper channels, he said.
Minister Rambukwella said the Supreme Court will give the final verdict in December and the Speaker cannot act as he wish. He has to follow the parliamentary norms and traditions, Rambukwella said.
He said the Speakers entered the House under police protection since the way he was acting was wrong. It is his action that brought about the chaos, Rambukwella said.

Tips for choosing organic food
Organic food is a great choice for our health and the health of the environment. The following tips can help you build your organic food pantry at home:
1. Find a farm, farmers market
Purchasing food that is both local and organic is ideal. Ask friends, family members, and co-workers for referrals to green markets in your area. You can
2. Ask Questions
Whether you are buying your food directly from the farmer or at your supermarket, do not be afraid to ask questions. Inquiring about whether products are certified organic, grown using organic methods, or produced locally shows farmers and store managers that these issues are important to you.
3. Read food labels
When seeking out organic food, read food labels. Packaged foods are often clearly marked with a certified organic seal. Fruits and vegetables typically contain stickers that contain a product look up (PLU) code to help identify how the food was produced. Organic produce has a 5-digit code that begins with a 9, conventional produce has a 4-digit code that begins with a 3 or 4, and genetically modified produce has a 5-digit code that begins with an 8.
4. Purchase organic food within your budget
Many individuals are working with limited food budgets. Buying food in season, buying in bulk, and splitting shares in your local CSA are all ways to buy quality organic food on a budget. In some cases, you may be able to save a few dollars by purchasing a mix of organic and conventional produce.
5. Find balance
While seeking out and purchasing organic and local food may sound ideal, it may not be practical for every person in every location. Some individuals simply do not have access to farmers markets or supermarkets that offer many organic options. Do not let that be a deterrent to eating more fruits and vegetables. Consuming more plant-based foods overall-organic or not-benefits everyones health. Simply do the best you can and buy the freshest and best quality fruits and vegetables you can afford.

Unconvincing win by Kandy SC over Police SC
Kandy Sports Club pulled off an unconvincing win against the Police Sports Club in their Dialog A division league rugby match played at Nittawela yesterday.
Probably over confidence made them ignore the basics and play as a champion side. They had to produce hard work to outperform Police and win their second first round match by 32 points to 23.
Kandy from whom much was expected failed to deliver and did not make the most of all the possession. There were too many unforced errors from them.
Thanks to the superior pack of Kandys fly-half Arshad Jamaldeen who came in the 20th minute dictated proceedings after his team had endured a rugged opening quarter from the cops.
Kandy SC 32 (3 goals, 1 try and 2 penalties). Tries: Danushka Ranjan three, Yaqoob Ali one. Conversations and the penalties were off the boot of Thilina Wijesinghe and Arshad Jamaldeen.
Police SC 23 (1 goal, 2 tries and 2 penalties). Tries: Vageesha Weerasinghe two, Sachith Silva one and all kicking by Sachitha Silva. At half time Kandy SC led 17-10.

UPFA MPs severely condemn Speakers conduct
UPFA MPs at a press brief yesterday, vehemently condemned the conduct of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for violating the Constitution, Standing Orders and the traditions of Parliament.
They pointed out that the Speaker is acting in favour of the UNP and is manipulated by foreign forces and the LTTE supported diaspora.
The UPFA MPs also pointed out that if any tense situation arose in Parliament today, Speaker Jayasuriya should take full responsibility. They observed that Speaker Jayasuriya is challenging the Constitution and the powers vested by the Constitution in the President.
They also pointed out that they reject the No Confidence Motion passed in Parliament since proper procedure was not followed by the Speaker in the House. The UPFA MPs expressed their dissatisfaction of the Speaker for deciding not to attend the All Party Conference headed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
They also expressed their confidence that the final order by the Supreme Court with regards to the dissolution of Parliament will be a fair and accurate one.
UPFA Parliamentarians Bandula Gunawardena, John Seneviratne, Shehan Semasinghe and Kanchana Wijesekara were present at the press brief which was held at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo yesterday morning.
Gunawardena addressing media said that from the time that he has been a Parliamentarian, no other Speaker has ever acted as Jayasuriya has done. Gunawardena also said that the Speakers conduct has turned Parliament in to a Kangaroo-Parliament.
Gunawardena further observed that the Speaker violated the Constitution, Standing Orders and the traditions. He destroyed the whole Parliamentary system. Nowhere in the world has a no confidence motion been passed under police protection.
I met a School Principal recently, who told me that the Speaker is like an elephant who has taken an expired drug and acting like in the mating season.
John Seneviratne pointed out that the Speaker was acting like a dictator in Parliament and demanded that the status quo of the House be restored.
Shehan Semasinghe who also addressed the media pointed out that there have been many discrepancies and conflicts of interest on the part of the Speaker continuously over the last three years. The Speaker was never interested in the NCMs brought by us against Ravi Karunanayake or Rajitha Senaratne.
Those days we thought the Speaker had a hearing impairment in his left ear. But now he is having the same
hearing impairment in his right ear. The person who has destabilised Parliament is Speaker Jayasuriya. No important legal enactments have been passed by a voice by vote ever before. We really hope that the Speaker
will act fairly by everyone in todays Parliament session. We can show a majority if proper procedures are followed by the Speaker. We have not even seen the NCM. The Speaker should stand up for the country, not for other political agendas, Semasinghe pointed out.
Semasinghe stating that Speaker Jayasuriya is acting according to the Sirikotha-Constitution demanded that Jayasuriya adhere to the standing orders and the traditions of Parliament. Playing two video footages taken within the Chamber by MP Susantha Punchinilame, Semasinghe pointed out that the Speaker did not heed the warnings of a possible harm to MPs lives seriously. So we believe that a case should be filed against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya under the criminal law for aiding and abetting murder, Semasinghe said.
Kanchana Wijesekara also spoke.

The Victim
These things happened at a time when that noble virtue, frivolity, still flourished, when todays relentless struggle for existence was yet unknown. The faces of the young aristocrats and squires were not darkened by any cloud; at court the maids of honour and the great courtesans always wore a smile on their lips; the occupations of clown and professional teahouse wit were held in high esteem; life was peaceful and full of joy. In the theater and in the writings of the time, beauty and power were portrayed as inseparable.
Physical beauty, indeed, was the chief aim of life and in its pursuit people went so far as to have themselves tattooed. On their bodies, brilliant lines and colours were ravelled in a sort of dance. When visiting the gay quarters, they would choose as bearers for their palanquins men whose bodies were skilfully tattooed, and the courtesans of Yoshiwara and Tatsumi gave their love to men whose bodies boasted beautiful tattoos. Frequenters of the gambling dens, firemen, merchants and even samurai all had recourse to the tattooers art. Exhibitions of tattoo were frequently arranged where the participants, fingering the tattoo-marks on each others bodies, would praise the original design of one and criticise the shortcomings of another.
There was one young tattooer gifted with an outstanding talent. He was much in fashion and his reputation rivaled even that of the great old masters: Charibun of Asakusa, Yakkhei of Matsushimach and Konkonjir. His works were greatly prized at the exhibitions of tattoo and most admirers of this art aspired to become his clients. While the artist Darumakin was known for his fine drawings and Karakusa Gonta was the master of the vermilion tattoo, this man, Seikichi, was famous for the originality of his compositions and their voluptuous quality.
Previously he had achieved a certain reputation as a painter, belonging to the school of Toyokuni and Kunisada and specialising in genre paintings. In descending to the rank of tattooer, he still preserved the true spirit of an artist and a great sensitivity. He declined to execute his work on people whose skin or general physique did not appeal to him, and such customers as he did accept had to agree implicitly to the design of his choosing and also to his price. Moreover, they had to endure for as long as one or two months the excruciating pain of his needles.
Within this young tattooers heart lurked unsuspected passions and pleasures. When the pricking of his needles caused the flesh to swell and the crimson blood to flow, his patients, unable to endure the agony, would emit groans of pain. The more they groaned, the greater was the artists indefinable pleasure. He took particular delight in vermilion designs, which are known to be the most painful of all tattoos. When his clients had received five or six hundred pricks of the needle and then taken a scalding hot bath the more vividly to bring out the colours, they would often collapse half-dead at Seikichis feet. As they lay there unable to move, he would ask them with a satisfied smile, So it really hurts
When he had to deal with a faint-hearted customer whose teeth would grind or who gave out shrieks of pain, Seikichi would say, Really, I thought you were a native of Kyoto where people are meant to be so courageous. Well, please try to be patient. My needles are unusually painful. And glancing from the corner of his eyes at the victims face, now moist with tears, he would continue his work with utter unconcern. If, on the contrary, his patient bore the agony without flinching, he would say, Ah, you are much braver than you look. But wait a while. Soon you will be unable to endure it in silence, try as you may. And he would laugh, showing his white teeth.
For many years now, Seikichis great ambition had been to have under his needle the lustrous skin of a beautiful girl, on which he dreamed of tattooing, as it were his very soul. This imaginary woman had to meet many conditions both as to physique and character; a lovely face and a fine skin would not in themselves satisfy Seikichi. In vain had he searched among the well-known courtesans for a woman who would measure up to his ideal. Her image was constantly in his mind, and although three years had now elapsed since he started this quest, his desire had only grown with time.
It was on a summers evening while walking in the Fukagawa district that his attention was caught by a feminine foot of dazzling whiteness disappearing behind the curtains of a palanquin. A foot can convey as many variations of expression as a face, and this white female foot seemed to Seikichi like the rarest of jewels. The perfectly-shaped toes, the iridescent nails, the rounded heel, the skin, as lustrous as if it had been washed for ages by the limpid waters of some mountain brookall be-spoke a foot of absolute perfection designed to stir the heart of a man and to trample upon his soul. Seikichi knew at once that this was the foot of the woman for whom he had searched these many years! Joyously he hurried after the palanquin, hoping to get a glimpse of its occupant, but after following it for several streets, he lost sight of it around a corner. From then on what had been a vague yearning was transformed into the most violent of passions.
One morning a year later Seikichi received a visit at his house in the Fukagawa district. It was a young girl sent on an errand by a friend, a certain geisha from the Tatsumi quarter.
Excuse me, Sir, she said timidly. My mistress has asked me to deliver this coat to you personally and to request you to be so good as to make a design on the lining.
These things happened at a time when that noble virtue, frivolity, still flourished, when todays relentless struggle for existence was yet unknown.
The faces of the young aristocrats and squires were not darkened by any cloud; at court the maids of honour and the great courtesans always wore a smile on their lips; the occupations of clown and professional teahouse wit were held in high esteem; life was peaceful and full of joy.

World fights for children's rights
United Nations Universal Children's Day will be celebrated tomorrow, Tuesday November 20. It was first established in 1954 to promote international unity and awareness among and about children worldwide. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, promotes and coordinates this special day, which also works towards improving children's welfare.
The occasion also allows the discussion of children's rights in conjunction with the sustainable development goals. Goals such as poverty reduction, health, education, sanitation and equality are all important not only for sustainable development but also for children's rights and well-being.
In many developed countries, children have never had it so good, with access to education, health care, the internet and much more. But millions more are facing unprecedented upheaval. More than 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes due to conflict, poverty and climate change while millions more face violence in their communities.
According to the UN, around 263 million children do not attend school and last year some six million children under five died from mostly preventable diseases.
True, not all of us can look back on our childhood as the most joyous time of our lives. The more privileged among us are perhaps unaware that millions of children in our own nation as well as in many undeveloped countries elsewhere are subjected to untold hardships from the time they come squealing into the world. Their parents too in many parts of the universe struggle with their own problems such as lack of health care, financial insecurity and abuse.
The idea of a Universal Children's Day was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1954 to protect children working long hours in dangerous circumstances and provide all of them with access to an education.
The theme for this year's celebrations: Stop Violence Against Children! According to UNICEF, every year millions of children around the world become victims of untold violence. Children in every country, every culture and at every social level face various forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence.
The abuse takes place at home, in school, in institutions, at work, in the community, in armed conflict and natural disasters. Much violence against children, such as corporal punishment and sexual abuse, remains legal and socially approved of in many countries. The violence children face takes many forms, such as exploitation and abuse, trafficking, physical and humiliating punishment and harmful traditional practices. Growing up with violence and abuse seriously affects a child's development, dignity, and physical and psychological integrity. Nearly 25 years ago, the world made a promise to children.
That we would do everything in our power to protect and promote their rights to survive and thrive, to learn and grow, to make their voices heard and to reach their full potential. In spite of the overall gains, there are many children who have fallen even further behind.
Old challenges have combined with new problems to deprive many children of their rights and the benefits of development. To meet these challenges, and to reach those children and helpless elders in society who are hardest to reach, we need new ways of thinking and new innovative strategies. There is much to celebrate as we mark the 26th anniversary of the Convention, from declining infant mortality to rising school enrolment, but this historic milestone must also serve as an urgent reminder that much remains to be done.
And what about the children we have sworn to nurture and protect Are we focusing enough on child labour, which refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school and that could be mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful
Forced labour in general takes different forms, including debt bondage, human trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. The most vulnerable victims are young women and girls forced into prostitution, migrants trapped in debt bondage and sweatshops or farm workers kept there by clearly illegal tactics and paid little or nothing. Children everywhere hold the key to the future of a country. It is the responsibility of every single person to safeguard children.
Anything you do to support kids and parents can help reduce the stress that often leads to abuse and neglect. By educating yourself - and others - you can help your community prevent child abuse and neglect from happening in the first place. The behaviour of children may signal abuse or neglect long before any change in physical appearance. Get involved. Advocate for services to families. Help to establish parenting groups in your community. Ask your community leaders, clergy, library and schools to develop services to meet the needs of healthy children and families. If you suspect or are aware of abuse or neglect occurring, report it. UNICEF estimates that over half of the 30,000 child sex workers in Sri Lanka are boys. Does this not sound the alarm that we are increasingly on the way to earning the shameful reputation of becoming a nation of perverts, pederasts and paedophiles It is because of our silence that these depravities will continue. All Sri Lankan voices should be heard to boom with outrage against such abuse of our children. Remember that our children should be considered more precious resources than the nation's gold reserves.
Here in Sri Lanka a senseless conflict which raged for nearly 30 years has taken a devastating toll on thousands of families. Now with the war nine years behind us there must be a concerted effort to help this unfortunate segment of the population to ensure their basic survival. Have we given a single thought to the orphans of war and the victims of natural disasters who have never felt the touch of a mother's love Or of a family which has lost its breadwinner father and protector and is struggling to survive
Everyone, regardless of their sundry spiritual beliefs, should reflect on the needs of these dispossessed widows, children and the old and infirm from both sides of the ethnic divide.
That is because they have all been pursued by the remorseless furies of terror, bereavement, bloodshed and brutality. Among them are the swarms of orphaned children, those forsaken waifs and strays of war whose predicament should inflame the empathy and heartfelt emotions of every decent soul.

Sajith must be UNP candidate for premiership at general election
The UNP Central Working Committee should nominate UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa unanimously as the UNP candidate for the Prime Minster at the general election if the UNP needs to win this time, former Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said.
If the UNP presents former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this time as its candidate for Premier, it will record a sure defeat in the forthcoming general election, he said.
He said he told the UNP Central Committee members in 2010 that Sajith Premadasa was the most suitable UNP candidate for the Premiership.
We are now ready for the general election after the judgment of the Supreme Court. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been functioning as leader of the UNP for over 25 years. The UNP needs a reform and a change in its leadership to win elections. Therefore, he should give the leadership to Sajith, he said.

Sajith should be UNPs PM candidate
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa should be nominated unanimously by the UNP Central Working Committee as the UNP candidate for Prime Minster at any forthcoming general election, if the party is to win, said former Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and former Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe speaking at a media conference at his residence in Kurunegala last week.
If the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is presented by the UNP this time as its candidate for Premier, the UNP will record a sure defeat in the general election, he said.
I told the higher UNP Central Committee members in 2010 that Sajith Premadasa was the most suitable candidate of the UNP for the post of Premier in this country. We are now ready for the general election after the declaration of the judgement by the Supreme Court with regard to the fundamental rights petitions. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been functioning as leader of the UNP for over 25 years. The present UNP needs reform and a change in its leadership. Therefore, he should now give the UNP leadership to the Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa to lead the party towards victory, Abeysinghe said.
