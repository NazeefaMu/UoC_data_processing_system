Sri Lankas No.1 T20I ranking on the line

Preparations for next years ICC World Twenty20 India 2016 continue as reigning champion Sri Lanka goes head to head with former winner West Indies in a two-match series in Pallekele today.
The India event will take place from 11 March to 3 April and Sri Lanka will defend the title it won after defeating India by six wickets in the final in Mirpur last year. The West Indies had lifted the silverware in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in October 2012 when it beat the home side by six wickets.
As many as 12 T20I matches will be played this month and the action will begin on Monday with Sri Lankas number-one position on the ICC T20I Team Rankings on the line when it takes on third-ranked West Indies.
Sri Lanka leads the West Indies by eight points but if the West Indies wins both the matches, then both sides will swap places. In this scenario, the West Indies will rise to 123 points, two points ahead of second-ranked Pakistan, while Sri Lanka will slip to 118 points, three points behind Pakistan and one ahead of fourth-ranked Australia.
If the series is tied at one-all, Sri Lanka will retain its top spot but the West Indies will join Australia on 118 points and because it will be ahead of Australia when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point, the West Indies will be ranked third.
In contrast, Sri Lanka will extend its advantage over Pakistan to 10 points and the West Indies will drop to fifth on 113 points if the home side wins both the matches.
The second T20I between Sri Lanka and West Indies will be played at the R Premadasa Stadium on November 12. ICC

Sri Lanka men finish fourth overall
Sri Lanka had to be content with fourth place in the Asian Rugby Sevens 2016 Rio Olympic Qualifiers when they were edged out 21-26 by South Korea at the Hong Kong International Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka gave off a superb fight back, with their dazzling runs and fierce tackling to score three tries all of which were converted, but could not match their much heavier opponents especially in the set pieces and the breakdowns and conceded three goals and a try. Korea thus clinched the important third place.
In the pool stages Tuskers beat Iran and Malaysia convincingly by 31-10 and 24-10 respectively but later in the day went down fighting to the host nation Hong Kong by 27 points to 12 , after holding on to a commanding 12-5 lead early in the second half.
In the final pool match played yesterday the Sri Lankan team shocked the entire crowd present at the grounds by defeating the formidable Philippine team 50-5. Sri Lanka gave a fabulous Fijian brand of rugby to thrash their opponents and enter the Cup championship semi-finals.
In the semis Sri Lanka did not have any clue to Asian giants Japan who thrashed them 43-nil.
For Sri Lanka ex-skipper Fazil Marija, Danushka Ranjan, Shenal Dias, Anurudda Wilwara, Gayan Weeraratne, Jason Dissanayka and Kanchana Ramanayaka played their hearts out in the tournament.
Japan kept their reputation as the number one team in Asia by coming from being 0-10 down beat Hong Kong 24-10 to bag the Cup Championship enabling them to go to the Rio Olympics in 2016. Meanwhile the Chinese men won the Plate Championship thrashing Malaysia 38-5.
Sri Lankan womens rugby team gave an improved performance by securing sixth slot when they lost to Guam 21-5 in the fifth place playoff at Hong Kong Stadium. Incidentally in the pool stages Sri Lankan women thrashed Guam 22-7.

Teenager found alive 50 hours after Pakistan factory collapse
PAKISTAN: Rescuers in Pakistan have pulled a teenage boy alive from the rubble of a collapsed factory near Lahore 50 hours after the structure toppled, officials said on Saturday.
The teenager had been trapped for more than two days after the collapse and his family, thinking him dead, had already identified and buried another recovered body they believed to be his.
An 18-year-old Muhammad Shahid was also evacuated alive 50 hours after the building collapsed by the blessing of God, Muhammad Usman, a top administration official in Lahore, told AFP.
The four-storey Rajput Polyester polythene bag factory came crashing down on Wednesday evening, and at least 40 bodies have so far been recovered from the wreckage.
Shahids discovery ignited emotional scenes at the site as workers chanted Allah-O-Akbar (God is great) and encouraged each other to boost morale.
The news was a welcome surprise to his family who had mistakenly identified the dead body of another boy earlier this week as Shahid and buried the remains in their ancestral town of Kabirwala, some 265 kilometres (164 miles) from Lahore.
Officials have said at least 150 people were in the factory when it came down and it was unclear how many -- dead or alive -- may still be trapped.
Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif has said the factory may have suffered structural damage in the October 26 quake, which killed almost 400 people across Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Provincial labour minister Raja Ashfaq Sarwar said that an enquiry into the collapse is being conducted and we will probe all angles, with a report to be submitted within two weeks.
At least 24 people died last year when a mosque collapsed in the same city, while more than 200 people lost their lives, mostly due to collapsed roofs, following torrential rain and flooding in 2014.

The legacy of Ven. Sobitha Thera - the driving force behind the fall of Rajapaksa regime
A TRIBUTE TO AN ERUDITE MONK
The demise of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera at a hospital in Singapore yesterday brings to an end a life spent not only propagating the Dhamma but also fearlessly battling political giants without fear or favour across four decades.
The seventy three-year-old monk, despite his vociferous advocacy of causes that he believed in, retained the respect of even his adversaries because he was widely perceived as man of proven integrity in what were tumultuous times in Sri Lankas recent political history.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera was born Pathirage Don Rathnasekara as the second child of Pathirage Don Peiris Appuhamy, a carpenter by profession, and his wife, Balagala Kuruvita Arachchige Karalina Haminey hailing from the sleepy village of Maduluwawa near Padukka in the Avissawella electorate.
Ordained as a monk at the age of thirteen, Ven. Sobhitha Thera received higher ordination seven years later. Initially he attracted the attention of the masses with his Dhamma sermons with his characteristically mellifluous style of preaching which came to be followed by many other monks of his generation.
Executive Presidency
The Dhamma sermons of Ven. Sobhitha Thera and another contemporary Buddhist monk, Panadurey Ariyadhamma Thera was to spark a Buddhist revival of sorts in the early eighties. They both advocated Sinhala nationalism to some degree but Ven. Sobhitha Thera was more politically minded.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera was not a scholar monk with doctorates before his name. Nevertheless, his sermons commanded an enthusiastic following at a time when exposure through electronic media was still in its infancy because he preached a brand of Buddhism that advocated common sense and practicality.
The Thera was among the first to agitate against the Executive Presidency when its architect, President J. R. Jayewardene was at the height of his powers - and the full extent perils of such a presidency were yet to be known. It was to become a recurring theme in his political philosophy.
For his efforts, Ven. Sobhitha Thera, along with the doyen of the Sinhala theatre Ediriweera Sarachchandra, was infamously attacked by goons hired by the United National Party (UNP) in 1979 at the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress. Rather than being deterred, it spurred the monk to continue his struggles.
In the years that terrorism flourished under the command of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Ven. Sobhitha Thera stood steadfastly against them. However, he was never accused of being racist because he was able to make the distinction between the Tamil community in general and the LTTE.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera rose to national prominence in 1995 when he headed the Jathika Sangha Sabhava. In this role he mentored many a Buddhist monk and the result was that monks became a force to be reckoned with for successive governments trying to deal with the menace that was the LTTE.
Buddhist monk of unimpeachable character
This was to evolve in to a trend that saw the emergence of Buddhist monks seeking representation in Parliament which became a reality in 2004, under the aegis of the Jathika Hela Urumaya. However, Ven. Sobhitha Thera preferred to watch from the side-lines, eschewing a role in active politics.
Through all these years in the limelight, Ven. Sobhitha Theras disdain for the Executive Presidency remained. He agitated for this time and again but his pleas fell on deaf years as the Presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa gained popularity, especially in the aftermath of the war victory over the LTTE.
However, as the impunity in the Rajapaksa regime grew, Ven. Sobhitha Thera became the driving force behind a new organisation, the National Movement for Social Justice which protested against its excesses. It brought together diverse social, academic and political forces under one umbrella.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera being a respected Buddhist monk of unimpeachable character, Rajapaksa found it difficult to challenge him directly. The Theras stature and influence grew as even the UNP stumbled to defeat after defeat in the face of clever political manipulations by the Rajapaksa government.
Those close to the monk say that he was particularly incensed by two actions initiated by the Rajapaksa government: the treatment meted out to former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka and the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. They convinced him that he should act.
If one person should take the credit for engineering the downfall of the Rajapaksa regime, it would be Ven. Sobhitha Thera. Convinced that the regime did more harm than good, he initiated contacts with political leaders who he thought could be brought together for a common cause - defeating Rajapaksa.
The temple where Ven. Sobhitha Thera was the Chief Incumbent, The Naga Viharaya in Kotte, became a political hub. The Thera actively mediated between erstwhile arch rivals Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga and mooted the concept of a common candidate against Rajapaksa.
New regime
The concept gained currency but there were no takers. Had Wickremesinghe announced himself as the candidate, his record of dealing unsuccessfully with the LTTE would have been highlighted. Kumaratunga had shed much of her charisma and popular appeal which propelled her in to office.
These circumstances prompted Ven. Sobhitha Thera to declare that he himself would run against Rajapaksa if the need arose. But being politically savvy, he knew that as a Buddhist monk, it would be difficult to attract the votes in the North and East, a sine qua non for any candidate to defeat Rajapaksa.
What was publicly not known at the time was that negotiations were underway with Maithripala Sirisena, then the Minister of Health in Rajapaksas government. The Thera was instrumental in convincing Sirisena to defy Rajapaksa and announce himself as the common candidate.
The rest, as they say, is history. However, to his credit, Ven. Sobhitha Thera remained as critical as ever even after President Sirisena formed his government with Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Time and again he admonished the new regime for its tardiness in pursuing reforms and fighting corruption.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera was happy that his political dream- pruning the powers of the Executive Presidency- was achieved to some extent. His passing away on Sunday robs the nation of a great reformer of our times, but most of all an activist of unblemished integrity at a time when such men are rare.
May he attain Nibbana!

Wonder Tricks
From using leftover coffee beans to preventing dirt from getting underneath fingernails, master gardener Paul James shares his top 14 tips and shortcuts to make gardening a breeze.
1. To remove the salt deposits that form on clay pots, combine equal parts white vinegar, rubbing alcohol and water in a spray bottle. Apply the mixture to the pot and scrub with a plastic brush. Let the pot dry before you plant anything in it.
2. To prevent accumulating dirt under your fingernails while you work in the garden, draw your fingernails across a bar of soap and you'll effectively seal the undersides of your nails so dirt can't collect beneath them. Then, after you've finished in the garden, use a nailbrush to remove the soap and your nails will be sparkling clean.
3. To prevent the line on your string trimmer from jamming or breaking, treat with a spray vegetable oil before installing it in the trimmer.
4. Turn a long-handled tool into a measuring stick! Lay a long-handled garden tool on the ground, and next to it place a tape measure. Using a permanent marker, write inch and foot marks on the handle. When you need to space plants a certain distance apart (from just an inch to several feet) you'll already have a measuring device in your hand.
5. To have garden twine handy when you need it, just stick a ball of twine in a small clay pot, pull the end of the twine through the drainage hole, and set the pot upside down in the garden. Do that, and you'll never go looking for twine again.
6. Little clay pots make great cloches for protecting young plants from sudden, overnight frosts and freezes.
7. To turn a clay pot into a hose guide, just stab a roughly one-foot length of steel reinforcing bar into the ground at the corner of a bed and slip two clay pots over it: one facing down, the other facing up. The guides will prevent damage to your plants as you drag the hose along the bed.
8. To create perfectly natural markers, write the names of plants (using a permanent marker) on the flat faces of stones of various sizes and place them at or near the base of your plants.
9. Got aphids You can control them with a strong blast of water from the hose or with insecticidal soap. But here's another suggestion, one that's a lot more fun; get some tape! Wrap a wide strip of tape around your hand, sticky side out, and pat the leaves of plants infested with aphids. Concentrate on the undersides of leaves, because that's where the little buggers like to hide.
10. The next time you boil or steam vegetables, don't pour the water down the drain, use it to water potted patio plants, and you'll be amazed at how the plants respond to the vegetable soup.
11. Use leftover tea and coffee grounds to acidify the soil of acid-loving plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias, gardenias and even blueberries. A light sprinkling of about one-quarter of an inch applied once a month will keep the pH of the soil on the acidic side.
12. Use chamomile tea to control damping-off fungus, which often attacks young seedlings quite suddenly. Just add a spot of tea to the soil around the base of seedlings once a week or use it as a foliar spray.
13. If you need an instant table for tea service, look no farther than your collection of clay pots and saucers. Just flip a good-sized pot over, and top it off with a large saucer. And when you've had your share of tea, fill the saucer with water, and your table is now a birdbath.
14. The quickest way in the world to dry herbs: just lay a sheet of newspaper on the seat of your car, arrange the herbs in a single layer, then roll up the windows and close the doors. Your herbs will be quickly dried to perfection. What's more, your car will smell great.

For Afghan women, driving a car brings both fear and freedom
AFGHANISTAN: Since Rokhsar Azamee began driving the streets of Kabul last year, she has endured condescension, ridicule, and even threats to her life with some men deliberately causing accidents to harass her. But she will not be deterred.
The 23-year-old journalist learned to drive to avoid aggravation from men in the street as she waited each morning for a taxi with a driver who would not hassle her on the way to work.
But even the purchase of her own car has not shielded her from condemnation in the male-dominated, ultra-conservative society of Afghanistan.
For many men, she says, it is a new thing to see a woman drive a car, they will harass you. One way to do so is by causing an accident.
Once as she was heading home in her white 1997 Toyota Corolla, she was followed by a group of four or five men driving an SUV.
Her anxiety growing, she kept driving until they blocked her in a semi-deserted street in downtown Kabul, forcing her to pull over.
But as the men began to clamber out of their vehicle, she saw her chance to escape -- reversing quickly then hitting the accelerator. It was very horrible experience for me, she says.
It was not always like this. Up until the 1990s Afghan women were commonly found behind the wheel -- even driving buses, in the big cities at least.
But in 1992, when the communist regime in Kabul collapsed and civil war broke out, women drivers were slowly discouraged.
And as the extremist Taliban group swept to power in 1996, women were banned not only from driving, but from even leaving their homes without a burqa or the company of a male chaperone.
- Intolerable -
Change did not come again until the US invasion toppled the Taliban from power in late 2001 and a government backed by Washington took over.
Gender equality was enshrined in the Afghan constitution, and millions of women came out from the shadows to attend schools and universities and work in offices again.
Fourteen years on, however, the idea of a woman driver is still seen as controversial, provocative and even immoral.
Islam does not prohibit women from driving, but laws and cultural norms vary throughout the Islamic world, from Saudi Arabia -- where women are banned from driving entirely -- to Iran and Pakistan, where women drivers are more common.
In Afghanistan, woman drivers are seen as a Western imposition and a rejection of Muslim values, Babrak, an Afghan man in his fifties, tells AFP.
Women, especially young girls, driving can increase immorality and even lead to prostitution in Islamic societies, he says.
These women driving encourage our devout Muslim sisters towards immorality. It is becoming intolerable.
His view is not uncommon in Afghanistan where ultra-conservative men fear such freedoms increase womens independence and the lack of a male chaperone will result in increasingly liberal behaviour.
But in big cities like Kabul women are attempting to shift change into high gear. The increase in the number of women drivers has been growing at a steady rate: Kabuls traffic department estimates show that up to 1,000 women each year now apply to join driving schools in the Afghan capital alone.
In the early years after the end of Taliban rule that figure hovered around 50, Kabuls traffic police chief General Asadullah told AFP.
The women have the right to learn, they have the right to drive, and we encourage them for that, he says.
Social activist Sohaila Sama, 25, looks forward to driving her own car to the green plains of northern Afghanistan without persecution.
I have felt better, more confident since I learned how to drive, she says. When I see other women drive their vehicles, I feel like our country is moving forward towards a better future, a more civilised one. The progress is promising, but it may not be enough.
A Taliban resurgence in recent months has UN officials and rights activists fearing that the fragile gains women have made could be further eroded when international forces eventually leave. Testimony from womens rights activists who fled the Talibans recent brief capture of the northern city of Kunduz revealed harrowing stories of death squads methodically targeting women -- an ominous blueprint of what could happen should the insurgents ever return to power.

Are you crazy for junk food
Craving junk food is in your genes! Some people's brains are hardwired to want high fat foods
* Two genetic variants make certain people crave fatty or sugary foods
* Pictures of high-calorie foods shown to 45 men while scientists evaluated their brain responses
* Variants increased brain activity when they looked at high-fat foods
* Those people didn't have same level of activity in response to healthy food
* Variants affect dopamine levels in the brain, making you feel more reward
Are you a slave to junk food, facing a seemingly endless struggle to curb your cravings
A team of researchers from the Imperial College London have discovered two genetic variants - known as FTO and DRD2 - cause certain people to experience more intense cravings for unhealthy foods.
They believe these variants alter the levels of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that regulates the reward sensation.
Dr Tony Goldstone, the consultant endocrinologist, who led the study, said: It means they may experience more cravings than the average person when presented with high-calorie foods - that is those high in fat and/or sugar - leading them to eat more of these foods.
The team evaluated 45 European Caucasian males who had been fasting overnight for the study.
The participants were asked to look at pictures of either high- or low-calorie foods and rate how appealing they found the pictures.
Meanwhile, researchers evaluated their brain activity using a brain scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
The researchers also took a sample of DNA from each participant.
Researchers determined that the study participants with a variant near FTO gene - which predisposes a person to obesity - had more activity when looking at the high-calorie foods in the orbitofrontal cortex part of their brain.
These people found the fatty foods to be more appealing than the low-calorie options.
And researchers said they did not see the same level of brain activity when these participants looked at the pictures of healthy foods.
Interestingly, for the first time we also found that the activation in a part of the brain called the striatum was increased when those with the variant in the FTO looked at high-calorie foods, but this depended on which variant of the other gene DRD2 they possessed, Dr Gladstone said.
The DRD2 variant alters how the dopamine system works in the brain.
As a result, researchers concluded that one of the reasons why people with the FTO variant are more likely to be obese is because the dopamine signals in their brain lead them to feel more reward and craving associated with high-calorie foods.
People with these genetic variants might respond differently to certain obesity treatments, Dr Gladstone said.
These people might want to seek out treatments that change how the brain processes fatty or sugary foods and how much they like the high-calorie foods, or even those that affect the dopamine systems in their brain.
Certain drugs that alter how dopamine works in the brain as well as specific surgical procedures and hormones from the gut that can act on dopamine brain cells might help cure them of their cravings, according to Dr Gladstone.
The findings were presented Thursday during the Obesity Society Annual Meeting in Los Angeles.

Winnie the Pooh was inspired by a girl bear, new books reveals
Bear secret bared!
The character, written by A.A. Milne, would go on to become of the most beloved in children's literature :::intro
Stop whatever you are doing right now.
The inspiration behind Winnie the Pooh was not only Canadian, but also a girl.
The revelations come from a new book, published on 20 October, examining the origins of the beloved book character and honey-loving bear.
In Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear, authors Lindsay Mattick and Sophie Blackall write in 1914 a small black bear cub was rescued by Canadian veterinarian Harry Colebourn, en route to treat horses in the First World War.
After the war Colebourn, who had named the bear after his home town of Winniepeg, took her to London Zoo - where she met a real-life boy called Christopher Robin, who was so captivated with Winnie he would name his teddy after her.
Robin's father was none other than A.A. Milne, who would go on to write the books that would captivate generations of adults and children.
The inspiration of the books lived out the rest of her life in London Zoo, dying there in 1934.
But her namesake would go on to become one of the most recognisable - and beloved - children's book characters in history.

Cairns defence concludes in perjury trial

LONDON, FRIDAY: Former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns's defence at his perjury trial closed their case on Friday after three days of evidence at London's Southwark crown court.
His legal team then gave way for the defence lawyers representing Cairns's co-defendant, Andrew Fitch-Holland.
Cairns himself gave evidence over two days and often faced detailed cross-examination.
His first day in the witness box saw Cairns reduced to tears while he spoke about his family, living in Australia.
Cairns's Australian wife, Mel Cairns, was a witness via video-link from Canberra on Thursday.
She denied she heard her husband discussing match-fixing. When accused of lying on behalf of her husband both during the present trial and in his 2012 libel action with former senior Indian cricket administrator Lalit Modi, Mel Cairns replied "absolutely not".
"I would never lie to help my husband, especially in a court of law," she said.
Fitch-Holland, a barrister and friend of Cairns, denied the prosecution's description of him as a "cricket groupie".
Chris Harris, another former New Zealand cricketer, previously gave evidence about an occasion at an exhibition match in 2010 when Fitch-Holland came up to him and a group of others.
Harris said someone asked what was going on with Cairns with regards to match-fixing rumours.
"Mr Fitch-Holland replied, to my surprise, 'Oh, he's guilty, Cairnsy's guilty'," Harris told the court. However, on Friday, Fitch-Holland said he was drunk at the time and did not remember the conversation.
Fitch-Holland also described the moment he first heard from Cairns of Indian Premier League founder Modi's Twitter post that said the New Zealander had been involved in match-fixing.
"My mobile phone rang and it was Chris, freaking out," said Fitch-Holland. "You won't believe this, Modi's fucked me. I'm done, He's tweeted I'm involved in match-fixing'." The prosecution's main evidence against Fitch-Holland is a recording of a Skype conversation between him and Lou Vincent, another ex-New Zealand cricketer, in which he asked Cairns' former team-mate to provide a statement for the libel case.
However, Fitch-Holland told the court he had not asked Vincent, who has publicly admitted his role in match and spot-fixing, to lie.
Fitch-Holland will face cross-examination when the trial resumes on Monday. Cairns faces a charge of perjury, and faces a joint charge with Fitch-Holland of perverting the course of justice by trying to get Vincent to provide a false statement. - AFP

Celebs who almost got away with living Double Lives
It's neither uncommon nor new for stars who promote squeaky-clean images to have sordid lives on the other side of the camera. It happened with the cast of The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family. But it didn't end with the 1970s. Here are some celebrities who attempted to get away with leading double lives.
CORY MONTEITH: Cory Monteith seemed to have his whole life, and a very-bright acting career, ahead of him. He was one of the more well-known cast members on the hit show Glee, and he was beginning to get film work, earning a role in the Selena Gomez flick Monte Carlo and a starring role in the film Sisters & Brothers. Unfortunately, a life of drug abuse, beginning at the age of 12, cut that rather short. During his life, he had two stints in rehab as well, the last one initiated by an intervention held by his fellow cast members and Glee co-producer and co-creator Ryan Murphy. In reality, Monteith's life wasn't filled with much glee at all-tragically, he died of an overdose in July of 2013 at the young age of 31.
TIGER WOODS: One of the most successful professional golfers ever and one of the highest paid athletes worldwide, Tiger Woods had a beautiful wife and a family and endorsement deals that earned him more money than most of us will ever see in our lifetimes. All of that ended in November of 2009 with an alleged golf club to the head after his wife found out about his numerous extramarital affairs. In the days following, over a dozen women claimed to have had sex with Tiger. Since then, Tiger has apologized for his actions, to both his wife and his fans, and has embarked on something of a comeback.
R. KELLY: The soul singer R. Kelly gave us the uplifting and inspirational hit "I Believe I Can Fly," as well as the seductive "Bump N' Grind." But it seems he may have bumped and grinded against the wrong people a few too many times, because he had a little trouble keeping his hands off the young ladies (emphasis on young). While he may have been acquitted of having sex with and relieving himself on an underage girl, it's not his only instance of getting a little too-close to a minor. He was illegally married from August 13, 1994, until February 1995, to a then-teenaged Aaliyah. The marriage was annulled at her family's request. Allegations of sex with other underaged girls continue to follow R. Kelly.
ELIOT SPITZER: The former New York governor's political career was marred with controversy from some progressive and not-so progressive actions. To his favor, he attempted to allow undocumented workers to gain New York driver's licenses, and he proposed a bill that would have allowed same-sex couple to get married, both of which met with political disfavor at the time. To his detriment, he used of State Police as a surveillance force, earning the ire of his constituents. However, what ended his political career had nothing to do with his policies or proposals-it was his fondness for prostitutes, which cost him quite a bit of money over several years. He resigned in 2008 shortly after the news of the scandal broke. Things didn't end up all bad for the former governor though. He became a columnist for Slate, and he has had a few television shows as well.
KEANU REEVES: Not all double lives need to be a bad thing. Despite what we may think of his movies, and his band (yes, he has a band), Keanu Reeves is actually a really good person. He's known for giving his seat to strangers on the subway. More verifiably, he gave most of the money he earned on The Matrix sequels to the people working behind the scenes. He has even set up his own cancer charity and chose not to have his name attached to it. That's quite a secret to keep. Maybe he truly is the One.
SUZY FAVOR HAMILTON: This former Olympic middle distance runner competed in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics, but never medalled. However, the Big Ten honored her by naming an award after her, the Big Ten Suzy Favor Female Athlete of the Year award. Unfortunately, the University of Wisconsin-Madison alumna lost that honor after her secret career as an escort was brought to light in December 2012 by The Smoking Gun. Beginning in 2011, she worked for several Las Vegas escort services under the alias "Kelly Lundy". Her name was not only stripped from the award, but she also lost endorsement deals with Nike and Disney. It didn't end all bad for her though. Like most celebrities and celebrity athletes, her illicit activities provided material for a forthcoming memoir.

Debt is modern slavery
Oh my gosh! I was so busy. I didnt have my lunch even. This contemporary, yet fancy utterance is catching on like bushfire country-wide only to find hospitals bursting at its seams saddled with a stressful population struck with all kinds of sicknesses. The medicinal side effects apparently are far worse than the disease. Cashing in on this is a greedy breed minting money at others misery, opening up so called state of the art hospitals island wide - one of them being a former presidential biological link whose selfless loving care of the sick can match his very successful war gymnastics as a patriotic son of the soil which he now regrets, going on his own admission.
Lest I deviate from my mainstay, how come every Johnny has suddenly become so obsessed with work having hardly any time for even his meals Good, if we are on the developmental fast track. But are we Development at the cost of a populations health is sure to lead us nowhere except the doldrums. Kurunegala is no exception to this busy bug bugging in no small way.
All too suddenly, slumbering Kurunegala has awoken. The youth here have taken to buying all kinds of machinery and vehicles, tractors, disc ploughs, land masters, mini lorries, three wheelers, motor bikes and now cars as well. My inquiring mind insisted on how they got all the monies for all this luxury buying. Were they into politics No. Were they big time mudalalis No.
Leasing companies
Large scale financing is draining the energy of the youth here. They are all afflicted with sicknesses hitherto unheard of. In Kurunegalas hinterland - oooops sorry, no such geographical entity exists any more - the kalagedi carrying womens trouser progeny are seen riding pleasure bikes, fully made up, sunglasses and all. Tuition classes thrive. Come evening the doctor and tutor are on par with their soaring clientele.
The endless crowd that seek their assistance enables them a super grade private practice. It is big status to be seen at the evening channel service than to see the same doctor in the rural hospital. The wallet-fattened doctor glides in his limousine and when he arrives all stands to attention, far removed from the respect he would get in Colombo. Every few yards, a pharmacist mints money on doctors prescription. The crowd is the financiers clientele, the youth and not the elderly. The doctor would even tell you which pharmacy to patronize for obvious reasons. Both he and the pharmacist are obese with their newly found riches and would not exist if not for the leasing companies to whom the stressed out, sick youth are neck deep in debt.
Nimal a weed cutter tells me he has little sleep at night. His tractors constant whirring has affected him. The dust has even compelled him into breathing problems. His wife will soon be on her second delivery. So Nimal has got to work even harder. His biological asset in seven months time will turn into a burden. His bundle of joy is a tale of sorrow. Recently, the finance company even seized his tractor for payment default. To prevent a repetition, he has got to get his act together. The leasing agent has a monthly Rs 40,000 hold on him.
Tharanga, another victim of finance, is not spared the agony of his routine trek to the Dambulla economic centre. Vegetables are his line of living. He has to somehow make it into the financiers purse a neat monthly 28,000 for his Bolero truck. Vegetable alone costs him Rs 300,000 a month while fuel around Rs 10,000. He complains of acute gastritis and appetite loss.
Making life a veritable hell hole are their wives driving them up the wall. Tharangas wife insists on a new house. Not content with the truck, she is constantly pestering him for a car. Mage gaanita pissu. Mama finance gevaaganna balanava. Eyaata car onalu, he told me in the course of conversation at the pola.
Gilbert's wife drags him out of the house, stands opposite the neighbours and asks: arent you ashamed to live in that hovel of ours This mans son and Sarath are in the same class. Gilberts son now is a regular absentee in school because of the stigma in living in a wattle and daub. After a couple of hard stuff, Gilbert prefers the cemeterys solitude to his wifes incessant nagging.
If not for a private milk company paying for Jayaweeras milk hire, things may have been far worse. Yet the daily drive to Narammala is no piano. The Maha season has started and following this exhaustive drive mind you daily, Jayaweera is back ploughing every field in the locality to beat the financiers deadline the monthly Rs 30,000.
The thatched village kades have been neatly replaced with modern shops on par with those in Colombo and most women keep shop and men scrape coconuts. A role changing, upwardly mobile class striving for social prestige as in Colombo is on the rise. Cradling the majority of Colombos population is this evolved class from the village that go to make up Colombos socio/ political/ business and religious elite a reminder of the removal of caste based jobs in 1848 under the Colebrooke / Cameron reforms that have placed them in positions they least expected.
Children here have to walk to school. Van uncle has taken over their transport. He is also the financiers victim for if not for the van what would he do to keep the wolf off the door Walking to school is shameful. And so every child has some extra pounds around his waist. Some can hardly carry themselves.
Stiff competition
Close upon night comes choonpaan hovers around to the strains of cuckoo waltz, once the possession of only the sophisticated urban elite. The financier juggernaut grips him as well. Pastries, pies patties and cutlet (no longer pronounced cutlis) which their mothers knew not, have rested firmly on their taste buds most unwilling to accommodate that plate of rice so familiar to the farming community. Even for breakfast shorteats have come to stay. Pittu, kola kenda and string hoppers now take a backseat.
Stiff competition, social prestige, false values, vanity, the stigma of poverty and whatnot have enveloped the youth here apart from the rising cost of living.
Neeliya, a well informed source, tells me that bank loans for large scale weddings are a common fallback state, for social prestige is number one priority.
They are into an ad hoc kind of progress only to end in progress retarded.
They need counselling but who is to fill that space A ministry assigned particularly for this purpose with a dedicated team will for certain bring relief to these disgruntled youth whose elephantine problems remain regretfully unresolved.
Also cant the states benign eyes enable their tasks into easier and lighter arena by mitigating the imposing role of marauding financiers and leasing companies Life does offer a second chance. So why not an alternative for these youth - the much valued societal backbone Its time that Yahapalanaya steps in for it must be evergreen in the minds of the present power wielders that if not for the countrys youth, they would have ended up a lost entity.
The country is in debt to international donor agencies and its people to finance companies. When will this country and its people ever find relief from the misery of debt
Over to you Mr. President!

Reproduced below is the speech made by former Attorney General Shibly Aziz at the Conference of Attorneys General of ASIA PACIFIC held in Colombo hosted by the Attorney Generals Department.
The dilemma - balancing politics and the law
Given the increasing role of the law and judiciary in deciding fundamental rights in the 21st century, such as how to balance the right to privacy with the right to freedom of speech, or even to decide the fate of the leadership of a country (for instance, in Bush V Gore in the United States), it presents an opportune time to investigate how the crucial role of an Attorney General in different countries manifests itself.
It may be said at the outset the concept relating to the Attorney-General and expectation from the Office seems very similar in whatever jurisdictions you look at. At the same time it is accepted that there are noticeable differences in the matrixes in which he is appointed and operates,- whether as a political appointee or as a non political appointee, to that post.
Some jurisdictions openly make their Attorney-General a political appointee whereas some specifically stress the need for the appointee to be free of any political affiliations or ambitions However, all legal structures emphasize the need of the Attorney-General, however appointed, to be as apolitical in the carrying out of his functions.
Being the Chief Legal Advisor for the Government, without exception, forces the risk of facing allegations of bias, or a proclivity towards the interests of the appointing authority by any holder of that office  creating somewhat of a paradox.
It would seem appropriate to deal very briefly with the manner in which this role has been structured in a few different countries across this spectrum, as this would highlight the various issues and hassles which the holder of this High Office faces, given this dichotomy.
There really are three main categories. One, where the Attorney General is a member of the government (as in the case of the UK). Two, where the Attorney General is a political appointee but subject to vetting (as in the case of the USA). Three, where the AG is someone appointed by the executive branch, but without any vetting (the vast majority of other countries).
UK
In certain countries, as in England, one part of the Attorney General's role is that of a Cabinet Minister. He is a Member of Parliament and is therefore a political appointee. In this capacity the Minister is responsible for representing the interests and perspectives of the Ministry at Cabinet and vice versa.
The Attorney General for England and Wales is the chief legal adviser of the Crown , and a member of the Government. The Attorney General provides legal advice to the Government of the day.
The Attorney General oversees the small Attorney General's Office and also has responsibility for the Treasury Solicitor's Department. The Treasury Solicitor acts on behalf of the Attorney General when representation in court is required.
The Attorney General also has supervisory powers over prosecutions, including those mounted by the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions); the Serious Fraud Office; and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office.
India and Pakistan
In India, the Constitution of India, the Attorney General is not a political appointee. The Constitution does not place the Attorney General in the position of a Minister but elevates him to a significant position. Article 88 of the Constitution under the caption Rights of Ministers and Attorney-General as respects Houses - states that every Minister and the Attorney-General for India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member, but shall not by virtue of this Article be entitled to vote. This appears to give him a pre-eminent role unlike the other public servants in so far as Parliament is concerned- though a vote is not given to him. He is certainly, with this right of audience, in a position to influence decisions of both Houses.
This provision in the Constitution of India is unlike that of the British Parliament, where though a member of the Cabinet, he does not have a right but only an ability to address the members of the body of which he is a member.
The office of the Attorney-General of Pakistan is created by art 100 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 . Article 100(1) of the Constitution vests the President of Pakistan with the power to appoint a person, being a person qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Attorney-General for Pakistan.
Thus the AG could simply become a legal counsel for the current government that is engaged in defending the government rather than objectively advising on the law. Like as seen in many countries, this leads to the politicisation of the office and can divert the Attorney General from its original function.
Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, the Attorney General is not a member of the Cabinet nor is he given any special position vis a vis the Parliament except in the case of vetting Bills for Constitutionality. Nor is he able to address Parliament in any capacity.
At the 1984 Conference, the then Attorney-General Mr Shiva Pasupathy gave a short but vivid description of the position held by him. He said:
 the Attorney-General is the lineal successor of the Advocate Fiscal and later, the Kings Advocate. It appears that during the Dutch period in our history, there was the Advocate Fiscal appointed by the Government of Batavia, who combined two different functions. In civil cases, he deliberated and voted as a judge: in criminal cases he was considered as the public prosecutor. During the British period that followed, when in 1802 the Supreme Court of Judicature was established, the office of Advocate Fiscal was retained. In the Charter of Justice in 1833, the Office of Advocate Fiscal underwent the transformation to that of Kings Advocate. It was 100 years ago, in 1884 that the office of Attorney-General was established by law consequent to a decision of the Supreme Court.
In Sri Lanka the Attorney-General has under successive Constitutions after independence, retained his non-political status and did not become a member of the Cabinet. Hence, the need or the requirement for independence of his office never became the subject of debate or controversy. Whilst the need is accepted, whether the present procedures for appointment is satisfactory - with one factor being the unfettered discretion given to the President to appoint the holder - raises significant concerns as to whether the correct person gets appointed to this prestigious and important post.
Recently the appointments have been to the satisfaction of the Bar, which is the primary body to reflect on such matters, though the salutary provisions which were placed about 15 years ago to ensure this, were repealed, much to the chagrin and disappointment of the Legal Community in Sri Lanka. We hope the earlier provisions will be reinstated with more safeguards built into them to ensure the correct appointments to this office and also very importantly the higher judicial offices, the lack of which has eroded the public confidence in the delivery of justice.
The last many years have witnessed a growing public awareness of the critical role of the Law Officers in the Constitutional framework of Government.
The office of the Attorney-General stands at the intersection of Government and Parliament, the Courts and the Executive, the unofficial Bar and the Public Prosecutor, the State and the citizens. The conflicting pressure inherent in the hybrid nature of the office have made us in Sri Lanka keep the Office of Attorney-General apart from the Legislature and as a separate department of State functioning under the Attorney-General himself, so that his role remains, as far as practicable, independent.
Speaking of the United Kingdom, in 1948 when it was urged that the Attorney-General should not appear before the Lynskey Tribunal appointed to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain members of the Attlee Government Sir Hartley Shawcross the Attorney-General thought otherwise. As he subsequently wrote.
It was the duty (however personally unpleasant) of His Majestys Attorney-General to represent the public interest with complete objectivity and detachment and that to refuse to discharge that duty in a particular case in which the public interest might be suspected to conflict with the interests of certain of his friends or his political colleagues would be tantamount to saying that the office itself was inadequate to represent and protect the public interest against who sever might challenge it.
Sir Hartley Shawcross emphasised that it was the Attorney-Generals duty to be wholly detached,wholly independent and to accept the implications of an obligation to protect what he conceives to be the public interest whatever the political results may be.
Speaking in the House of Commons in 1951 Sir Hartley Shawcross maintained that when a prosecution may concern a question of public policy or national or international importance the Attorney-General has to make up his mind not as a party politician, but must in a quasi-judicial way consider the effect of prosecution upon the administration of law and of Government in the abstract. He said:
The responsibility for the eventual decision rests with the Attorney-General, and he is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter. Nor, of course, can the Attorney-General shift his responsibility for making the decision on to the shoulders of his colleagues. If political considerations which in the broad sense that I have indicated affect Government in the abstract, it is the Attorney-General, applying his judicial mind, who has to be the sole judge.
Prosecution of criminal offences
In Sri Lanka, the Attorney-General has very broad power over the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. Investigations carried out by police and magistrates are subject to the Attorney-Generals control and direction. Likewise decisions to indict or not in cases of serious offences and the precise framing of charges and consequent prosecution lie fully within the Attorney-Generals control. The Attorney-General thus holds a central position within the criminal justice system and plays a critical role. The effective exercise of accountability within the criminal justice system requires the Attorney-General to act effectively and independently, as well as the actual existence of a legal framework that permits the Attorney-General to so proceed. This would also apply to any cases of violations during the final stages of a war, as the one we had recently.
The independence of the Attorney-Generals Department has been challenged at particular points in the countrys history. It has been said, and I agree to some extent , recently been weakened; an issue of particular relevance was if that office should assume investigations into senior members of the Government or military for the final stages of the war. Another blow followed the 2010 elections, a gazette notification setting out each ministrys functions and responsibilities removed both the Attorney-Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department, whose primary task us drafting new laws, from the Ministry of Justice where they had been previously located. As newly unlisted departments, these departments now fall under direct presidential control by virtue if Article 44(2) f the Constitution, and were organisationally located in the Presidential Secretariat.
I believe every AG has realized at some stage of his career that work and the responsibilities indeed can be very painful and can take a toll. Unless of course, you adjust to your role and envisage it as nothing but giving proper and considered legal advice to those who seek it- in this case the Government. Not what your client wants to hear  but what you, in your professional wisdom distilled over the years, thinks what should be given- taking into consideration your clients interests as well as that of the public- with both interests firmly rooted in the law and the Rule of Law.
I believe this is what every fair minded and competent Attorney General aspired or aspires to do, and to a very substantial degree often succeeds in balancing these interests.
No Attorney General can and will ever achieve a perfect harmony in balancing these interests. He or she must resolutely endeavour to do so.
Through time growing up in the Department and by imbibing its traditions and its ways of doing things,the holder becomes qualified in every way to discharge his duties when he or she reaches the pinnacle of office in that Department.
violating legal principles
The Attorney General traditionally has the duty (as recently put very quaintly by the current English Attorney General) (I quote) to keep the Government and its actions within the circle of justice(unquote). He must (I quote) police its boundaries (unquote) and ensure that the Government does not stray out of these. But this does not mean that his role ought to be considered as negative or disruptive of government policies  he must as every public servant be loyal and supportive of the Government and its endeavours  and like every such public servant point out where it is going outside proper governance- and in the case of the Attorney General outside the circle of justice. He must give his robust and independent advice tell the Government the manner in which its goals can be achieved without violating legal principles or stepping on legal toes - and this is what AGs in the past have done. It is only then that the post is respected and the advice looked forward to by Governments.
Though one may express these sentiments in the ratified atmosphere we find ourselves in this hall today, avoiding political turmoil and criticism is not easy and the job is indeed tricky. Any rabid politicisation of the office by its holder increasingly diverts the functionary into turbulent waters and prevents him from performing its original function. The politicisation has taken its toll on some holders of the office of the AG in this country as elsewhere.
We all know the story of Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General in the later Blair Government, whose name may never recover from the controversy over his advice on the legality of the Iraq war. At first hesitant about the grounds for invasion, he later gave it grudging endorsement, but only after possibly being pressed into doing so by the Blair Government.
A few Attorneys General have been tarnished with some being called the quintessential hit men: the history of every country is replete with such aberrations.
Whilst undue loyalty to the Government may cause miscarriages of justice, what is perceived as a failure to appreciate the concerns of the Government may cause similar predicaments for the holder, as the previous English Attorney General found out when he was perceived by his own party as being too subservient to the European Parliament and its Judiciary. He was removed and replaced.
The present English Attorney Generals decision not to refer the five year and nine month sentence given to Rolf Harris to the Court of Appeal, as he did not think they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it, had its own detractors.
There are various components of the Attorney General's role. The Attorney General has unique responsibilities to the Crown, the courts, the Legislature and the executive branch of government. While there are different emphases and nuances attached to these there is a general theme throughout all the various aspects of the Attorney General's responsibilities that the office has a constitutional and traditional responsibility beyond that of a political minister or as Chief Legal Advisor to the Government.
Some Attorney Generals have supported the government's view. Some have cautioned government on what they have done or proposed to do. But each incident stressed the independent judgment and accountability of the Attorney General.
The Attorney General has to keep the political aspects linked to development and social needs also in mind when his services are availed of by the Government. This is specifically so when his services are sought in the area of economic and social development where he and his Department may get involved in suggesting and drafting laws or expressing opinions in these areas. In the wake of Asia's striking economic progress, issues of law and governance are now seen as critical for the developing, developed and post-conflict states of Asia. The development of law in Asia from the perspective of law reform initiatives intended to create development in its various aspects - economic, social, and political. The emphasis will be on rule-of-law entrenchment, good governance reforms, and constitutional change. The relationship between law and economic development has been a central concern of modern social theory. Today, the relationship of law and economic development is again at the very forefront of development policymaking, as government agencies, international organizations, and the non-profit sector advocate the need for strengthening the rule of law in developing countries. Can they sustain economic progress and satisfy the demands for the control of corruption and abuses of powers, and the creation of new forms of accountability.
The questions concerning the role of law in Asian economic development are absolutely crucial to development policy and the Attorney General of today cannot distance himself from playing a positive role in this endeavour. His efforts in this area has to be supported by a well trained set of officers with full exposure to world wide developments in these areas, second to none in their field, which I truly believe has been the case here in our country. After all these officers are our lawyers who represent or advice on matters on behalf of the country and us.
Conclusion
A very percipient observation of our Supreme Court made a few decades earlier (which related to the correctness of a Government decision to permit officers of our Department to private practice).
The Attorney-General of his Country is the leader of the Bar and the highest Legal Officer of the State. As Attorney-General he has a duty to Court, to the State and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and to act impartially with the sole object of establishing the truth. It is for that reason that all Courts in this Island request the appearance of the Attorney General as amicus curiae when the Court requires assistance, which assistance has in the past been readily given. That image will certainly be tarnished if he takes part in private litigation arising out of private disputes. I cannot but agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that there are constraints on the Attorney-General engaging in private practice in the civil law as well as the criminal law. It is regrettable that the State has sought to act counter to tradition, (prudence and propriety) in granting the Attorney General and his law officers the right of private practice. Justice is the loser thereby. No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other- or he will hold to one and dispose the other. No Attorney-General can serve both State and private litigant (Grand Central Case-1981)
In my view however tricky the role is, the discipline of the law which the Attorney General has been subjected to over the years should make the holder resilient and capable of discharging his duties adroitly and with acceptance to the large majority. This training in the law and exposure to time tested legal principles and adherence to them, would undoubtedly be his shield to protect him from unfair and scurrilous allegations. His ability to rely on them in formulating his thinking will protect him. In other words he must not be dishonest or arbitrary in his approach; that is the way to balance the competing demands of the role and serve in the best interests of the people of the country and the government that serves them.

Eating processed meats can cause colorectal cancer- WHO
Eating processed meats can cause colorectal cancer, concludes a new report from the World Health Organization, while eating red meats may also raise risk for the disease.
The report, compiled by a Working Group of 22 experts across 10 countries on behalf of the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), is published today in The Lancet Oncology.
Numerous studies have linked high consumption of red and processed meats with greater risk for colorectal cancer, or bowel cancer, with associations being so strong that they have influenced public health recommendations.
In 2011, for example, Medical News Today reported on a recommendation from the UK's Department of Health to reduce intake of red and processed meats from 90 g daily to 70 g daily to lower cancer risk.
This latest report supports recommendations to reduce intake of such foods, after finding that every 50 g of processed meats consumed daily - the equivalent to two slices of bacon - may raise the risk for colorectal cancer by 18%.
While the report authors note that the link between red meats and cancer risk was more difficult to establish, the studies they analyzed suggest every 100 g of red meat eaten daily may raise colorectal cancer risk by 17%.
The experts also identified a link between high intake of red meats and increased risk for pancreatic and prostate cancers, although to a lesser extent.
Diets high in processed meats may cause 34,000 deaths annually
To reach their findings, the IARC Working Group reviewed more than 800 studies assessing the link between red and processed meats and numerous types of cancer.
Red meat was defined as any form of mammalian muscle meat, including beef, pork, lamb, mutton and goat. Processed meat was defined as any meat that has been subject to any processes that boost flavor or improve preservation, including salting, curing and smoking. Examples of processed meats include bacon, sausages and hot dogs.
The experts identified sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that high intake of processed meats is carcinogenic to humans. In other words, there is strong evidence that a high intake of processed meats causes colorectal cancer.
Based on recent data from the Global Burden of Disease Project, the experts note that a diet high in processed meats may cause around 34,000 cancer deaths across the globe annually.
While the link between red meat intake and cancer was based on limited evidence, they state that diets high in red meats may cause around 50,000 deaths globally every year.
Commenting on the results of the review, Dr. Kurt Straif, head of the IARC Monographs Programme, says:
For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed. In view of the large number of people who consume processed meat, the global impact on cancer incidence is of public health importance.
While the experts say their findings support recommendations to reduce intake of red and processed meats, they note that there is some nutritional benefit from such foods.
Therefore, says Director of the IARC Dr. Christopher Wild, these results are important in enabling governments and international regulatory agencies to conduct risk assessments, in order to balance the risks and benefits of eating red meat and processed meat and to provide the best possible dietary recommendations.
Previous studies have suggested there may be other negative health implications associated with high intake of red and processed meats. Last year, a study reported by MNT linked eating processed red meat to greater risk for heart failure, while another study suggested red meat consumption may raise the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Electric crowds cheer All-Stars game in NY
Warne's Warriors batsman Kumar Sangakkara plays a shot during the first of a three-match T20 series between at the Citi Field in New York on Saturday. Indian Sachin Tendulkar and Australian Shane Warne captain two All-Star sides in a three-match Twenty20 series in the US in a bid to spark interest in a sport alien to most Americans. AFP
New York, Sunday: Amid a sea of Indian shirts, fluttering Pakistan flags and deafening roars, New York cricket fans turned out in their thousands to watch greats of the game face off against each other on Saturday -- in a baseball stadium.
Australian spin king Shane Warne and Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar captained two star-studded teams in a Twenty20 match designed to introduce Americans to what organisers billed as the world's second most popular sport.
Warne's Warriors beat Sachin's Blasters, with Warne man of the match after claiming Tendulkar's wicket.
But it was the Indian star whom most of the overwhelming South Asian expatriate crowd had come to see.
"Sachin, Sachin, Sachin," screamed the stadium in unison, hundreds wearing blue Indian shirts, many with the record-breaking batsman's name emblazoned on the back.
"Sachin for President," read one banner.
Snacking on hot dogs and nachos, chewing on pretzels and quaffing beer, for many it was the first time in years they had watched live cricket in America, long starved of the sport.
The three-hour match will be followed by games in Houston and Los Angeles.
Warne told reporters 36,000 people had packed into the Citi Field -- home of the New York Mets baseball team -- for the game.
"I thought it was fantastic, the atmosphere was amazing," he said.
At the end, the players lapped the pitch, waving and applauding the crowd, which Tendulkar compared to the home crowd at the Mets' World Series.
"The whole idea of Cricket All Stars is that, to try to get as many nations together to celebrate this," Tendulkar said. "It was electrifying."
"The music, crowd, atmosphere - it was nothing not to like. How could you not enjoy that experience today It was fantastic," said Warne.
Fans from all backgrounds helped create a party atmosphere.
There were couples with babies, fathers with sons, and youths waving flags of India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
There were glamorous women dressed in chic Pakistani shirts and skinny jeans, more sedate married women in dupattas.
All were fixated by the action. Tendulkar's opening stint at the crease saw the concession stands deserted, few willing to waste a second of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. AFP

EU to welcome 3 m more migrants
BELGIUM: The European Union is predicting that 3 million more migrants could arrive in the 28-nation bloc by the end of next year, with the refugee emergency already providing a stern test of EU capacities to provide shelter and welcome.
More than 700,000 people have come to Europe seeking sanctuary or jobs so far this year, overwhelming reception centers and border authorities.
EU autumn economic forecasts released on Thursday show that based on current migrant entries and a "technical assumption" about future flows, arrival rates are unlikely to slow before 2017.
The EU's executive Commission said that "overall, an additional 3 million persons is assumed to arrive in the EU over the forecast period."
The Commission says the refugee crisis has resulted in additional government spending but that it could have a small, positive impact on European economies within a few years.
However the EU said the real impact on national budgets is difficult to predict, given a lack of complete and reliable data about exactly who is arriving in the bloc and whether they are staying.
Most people are arriving in Europe through Italy and Greece, while Hungary and Austria have been affected by heavy migrant flows. Germany and Sweden are also feeling the impact.
Those nations, among others, want the EU to apply its budget rules with flexibility, taking into account Europe's biggest refugee emergency in well over half a century, and avoid reprimanding member states for excessive spending and deficits.
The Commission said Thursday that Sweden, which has the highest share of refugees per capita, is likely to feel the economic impact most, perhaps 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product this year.
Other hard-hit migrant transit and destination countries are likely to see an impact of 0.2 per cent of their GDPs in 2015.
While acknowledging the potential short-term impact, the Commission did not clearly state whether it would be flexible on budget policy.
However a senior EU official said on Wednesday that some flexibility might be allowed "taking into account well-specified costs and for a limited period of time."
"This has been an asymmetrical shock for some member states," said the official, briefing reporters on condition that he not be named.

Fireworks expected at special cabinet meeting
Ministers pushing for stern action against "protectors" of wrongdoers
Fireworks are expected at the special cabinet meeting today with several ministers calling for strong action against certain powerful politicians and government officials who are said to be defending those accused of fraud and corruption during previous regimes time.Minister Champika Ranawaka told "Daily News" that the special Cabinet meeting to discuss the Avant Garde and the progress
related to several other investigations was an important one as it could convey a strong message to the public that the government was not soft-pedaling fraud and corruption charges leveled against some top - notch politicians and officials of the previous regime. Ranawaka said that there was criticism from sections of the society on the delay on the government's part to prosecute those accused of wrong doings.
He said that it was time to put a full-stop to such accusations and show all that the government's anti-corruption drive was on track.He also charged that some powerful ministers and state officials were defending those accused of wrongdoings in the past and called for strong action against such individuals.
"Their names remain an open secret. The whole country knows who they are," the Minister said. Commenting on the controversy regarding the Avant Garde issue, Ranawaka added that there was no doubt that the firm had breached the local laws when conducting their activities.
"We toppled the Rajapaksa regime to put a full stop to such corrupt activities.People are waiting and watching.
Tomorrows meeting could be a symbolic one to show that we do not condone fraud and corruption headed."Meanwhile, when the Parliamentary group of the ruling party met on Friday, the Avant Garde issue became a key topic among the party's MPs.
Ministrers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne, Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, Arjuna Ranatunga and Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera fired salvos at Cabinet ministers trying to defend the conduct of the Avant Garde company.
They said the government should take stern action against the company as the public was losing faith in the good governance policies of the government.
They also stressed the need to conduct anti-corruption inquiries without political interference.
They warned that the battle against corruption, a key rallying point for the common opposition at the last Presidential election in January, is gradually coming to a standstill.
"This could," they said, "plunge the government into a crisis". Meanwhile, another group of Ministers representing the UNP held discussions over the weekend to defend Marapana and Rajapakshe at the Cabinet meeting on Monday.
"No member in the Cabinet is more experienced than Marapana and Rajapakhe when it comes to matters related to the judiciary. Ranawaka and Senaratne talk as if they formed the government along without any support from the UNP.
It is our duty to defend our party at the Cabinet meeting," a Minister, who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News.

India wants more consultations between UNSC and member states
UN: India has called for more consultations between the UN Security Council and member states on special political missions to ensure transparency in the policy formulation of these missions and to minimise the disconnect between their mandates and political reality.
"We would urge for more consultations by the UN Security Council on issues related to Special Political Missions (SPM). There should be free flow of communication between the Security Council, General Assembly and the Secretariat regarding the SPMs," visiting MP Rattan Lal Kataria said at a debate on the Special Political Missions here yesterday.
He said such communications should not be routine in nature, but should involve the Member States in a substantial manner.
"We have noticed that the policy formulation for SPMs is a rather opaque process which lacks transparency," he said.
He stressed the importance of having clear-cut mandates for SPMs, saying that there is blurring of mandate and disconnect between the mandate and the political situation of a particular region where SPMs are proposed to be sent. "We would expect more consultation with member states for policy formulation related to SPMs so that chances of disconnect of the mandate of SPMs with the political reality is minimized," he added.
According to the report of the Secretary General, there are 38 SPMs operational as on September 30, 2015.
He said the large spectrum of issues covered by these SPMs need to be matched by appropriate accountability of the SPMs and transparency in the appointment of its personnel. He cited the example of the appointment of experts of the Al-Qaida Sanctions Monitoring Team, in which while five experts positions seem to be reserved for the permanent members, there are three experts from the general membership. "It may be noted that there is no UN Security Council resolution which states that five experts should be from the P-5 (Permanent five). Even for the appointment of the three experts from outside the P-5, the process is opaque and lacks credibility," he said.
Kataria further stressed that when the UNSC does decide to increase the mandate of the SPMs, there should be well established mechanisms in place to ensure its accountability. "We are in favour of allowing the political processes to be given its due place and not substitute it with peacekeeping operations which would be ill equipped to handle such a situation," he said. - PTI

Jerome has really jelled with the team - Mathews
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews has credited interim head coach Jerome Jayaratne for his team's success against the West Indies.
Sri Lanka completed a whitewash of the Tests (2-0) and the One-Day International (3-0) series that concluded at Pallekele on Saturday.
Mathews described Jayaratne as a coach who "is really jelling with the guys" and added "he is very light-hearted but very focussed".
What Jayaratne brought to the dressing room was an atmosphere of calm and collectiveness that was lacking previously.
"We worked extremely hard in changing the environment and try and get rid of the individual doubts, trying to give the players confidence and keep the dressing room environment focussed and calm - looking at all the players to enjoy the game rather than putting a lot of pressure on themselves," said Mathews. "All in all he is a very good coach and a good human being so we would like to have him around."
In the absence of a batting coach Jayaratne took on the role and did a fairly good job.
"He is specialised in that area working really hard with the batters," said Mathews.
The big change that Mathews sees from previous series is that the batters have started to take on responsibility.
"The way Kusal batted we want guys like him to grab the opportunity when they get a start. I am very pleased with Kusal he plays his normal game in the first 10 overs and then tries to settle down to bat out the 50 overs," said Mathews.
"I am very happy about the change in his approach. I trust that (Dinesh) Chandimal and (Lahiru) Thirimanne would also take on the responsibility and make the contributions they are expected of.
"The coaching staff has been brilliant in working with individuals, very pleasing to see the change of mindset."
Mathews described West Indies as "a very good team that failed to click".
"They got some super players and power hitters in their line up it's just that they didn't click in the Test matches. The conditions played a massive part in their defeat," stated Mathews.
"But more than anything overall we played better cricket than them. We were pretty clinical in our performances. We had little gaps here and there but we managed to pull it through. It's pleasing to win a trophy at home and to whitewash them."
New Zealand will be Sri Lanka's next stop and Mathews stated that it would be a challenging one.
"It's totally different conditions and different opposition. We will work on those areas as a team to improve day by day. We will give our best shot in New Zealand and train really hard in the next few weeks."

Mind your flu
The influenza season is around the corner. Before joining the club of influenza victims, read on the following precautions and stay off this menace. Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha speaks to Health Watch on what kind of action to take in order to prevent influenza.
Q: What is Influenza
A: Influenza is an acute viral infection caused by an influenza virus. There are three types of influenza viruses. They are A, B and C. Type A influenza viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of various virus surface proteins. Among many sub types of influenza, A viruses, influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) sub types have a tendency to spread. Influenza viruses circulate in all parts of the world. Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than A and B. That is why only influenza A and B viruses are included in influenza vaccines.
Head of the National Influenza Centre of Medical Research Institute (MRI), Consultant Virologist Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha
There are two annual seasons for the disease: one in May, June and July and the other in December, January and February. The second season of this year has already started and over 200 samples obtained from the patients had been tested and over 50 of them found positive for the viruses. Seasonal epidemics and disease burden in temperate climates and seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.
Q: What are the main signs and symptoms
A: Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and runny nose. Cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. But influenza can cause severe illness or death especially in people at high risk. The time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about two to four days.
Q: Who is at risk
A: Yearly influenza epidemics can seriously affect all populations, but the highest risk of complications occur among children younger than age two years, adults aged 65 years or older, pregnant women, and people of any age with certain medical conditions, such as chronic heart, lung, kidney, liver, blood or metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), or weak immune systems.
Q: How does Influenza transmit
A: Seasonal influenza spreads easily and can sweep through schools, nursing homes, businesses or towns. When an infected person coughs, infected droplets get into the air and another person can breathe them in and be exposed. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, and wash their hands regularly.
The virus spread up to one metre when released to the air and exist in the air for about few minutes. It survives in the environment (door knobs, surfaces of tables, hand rests, bars attached to buses, trains etc) for a longer period. It survives in air conditioned environments for much longer period than in a normal open environment. The illnesses can result in hospitalization and death mainly among high-risk groups (the very young, elderly or chronically ill). Clinics and hospitals can be overwhelmed during peak illness periods.
Q: How can Influenza be prevented
A: The most effective way to prevent the disease and/or severe outcomes from the illness is vaccination. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 60 years. Among healthy adults, influenza vaccine can provide reasonable protection. However among the elderly, influenza vaccine may be less effective in preventing illness but may reduce the severity of disease and incidence of complications and deaths. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications, and for people who live with or care for high risk individuals.
WHO recommends annual vaccination for pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, children aged six months to five years, elderly individuals (over 65 years of age), individuals with chronic medical conditions, health-care workers. Influenza vaccination is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with vaccine viruses. Influenza viruses are constantly changing. For many years WHO has updated its recommendation on vaccine composition biannually that targets the three (trivalent) most representative virus types in circulation (two sub types of influenza A viruses and one B virus). Starting with the 2013-2014 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, quadrivalent vaccine composition has been recommended with a second influenza B virus in addition to the viruses in the conventional trivalent vaccines. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines are expected to provide wider protection against influenza B virus infections.
Flu injection is very effective to prevent complications such as pneumonia.
WHO highly recommends that pregnant women, elderly (healthy) individuals can also prevent influenza before the season or during an epidemic. The side effects of this vaccine are rare and local effects are painful at injection site. Flu will last only two days if developed. Once taken, the vaccine is effective for one year and need to take annually.
Avoiding crowded places during epidemics is also recommended. Wearing masks also help prevent spreading the disease but it is not highly effective.
The infected person should stay at home until fever settles and they should not go to work or school. They should take plenty of fluids and adequate rest. No need to avoid any particular food, they should not take Aspirin. Pregnant women with flu should seek medical treatment during the first 48 hours from a qualified medical practitioner. Other vulnerable groups should pay attention to difficulty in breathing, increase tiredness, sleepiness as danger signs. Transplant patients may not develop fever and need to be extra careful of illness.

New Delhi, Sunday: Lankan champion Mithun Perera finished joint fourth along with Namchok Tantipokhakul of Thailand and India's Jyoti Randhawa who led the charge on the final day, firing rounds of 66 and 67 with Shubhankar Sharma at the Panasonic Open India yesterday.
India's Chiragh Kumar emerged victorious after firing a two-under par 70 in the final round, clinching his first Asian Tour title.
Kumar, 31, hit three birdies against a lone bogey to end the tournament with a four-day aggregate of 13-under 275, three shots ahead of Thailand's Thaworn Wiratchant and Bangladesh's Siddikur Rahman.
"Winning an Asian Tour event means a lot to me," Kumar said.
"It is like a dream come true. This is the best thing that can happen to me. Everybody knows me at this club so it is very special to win."
Kumar, who secured his Asian Tour card after finishing tied second at the Venetian Macao Open three weeks ago, parred the first four holes before a bogey on the fifth.
But he made amends with a birdie at the eighth hole to make the turn at even par.
On his way back, the Delhi golfer picked up a couple of strokes on the 11th and 13th holes to hold on to his overnight lead. AFP

Nepal to import fuel from Bangladesh to keep planes flying
NEPAL: Nepal has struck a deal with a private supplier to fly in fuel from Bangladesh to ease crippling shortages that have sparked fears of domestic flights being grounded, its state oil trading company said Saturday.
Protesters seeking changes to Nepals new Constitution have blocked a key checkpoint bordering India for more than six weeks, cutting off vital supplies and forcing fuel rationing across the landlocked Himalayan nation.
We have reached an agreement with a private company, Petromax Nepal, who will air-lift ATF (aviation turbine fuel) from Bangladesh in the next three to four days, said Mukunda Ghimire, a spokesman for Nepal Oil Corporation.
Petromax has agreed to bring 400,000 litres of ATF per day, this should solve our problem and allow to supply international airlines with fuel as well, Ghimire told AFP.
The fuel crisis has forced international airlines to make additional stops overseas to refuel while the state-run Nepal Oil Corporation has struggled to supply domestic carriers.
Nepal Oil Corporation had earlier warned that domestic flights could be halted due to shrinking supplies.
The country is home to six airlines, including state carrier Nepal Airlines.
Saturdays agreement comes after Nepal signed its first-ever petroleum supply agreement with China last week, ending a decades-long monopoly by India, but details have yet to be worked out.
Nepal has faced crippling fuel shortages since September 24, when demonstrators from the Madhesi ethnic minority kicked off a blockade in the southern town of Birgunj.
They are protesting against the countrys new constitution which they say will leave them politically marginalised.
In a crackdown that dashed hopes of a compromise between the government and demonstrators, Nepali security forces on Monday broke up the blockade for a few hours, sparking violent protests and leading an Indian man to die in police firing.

Container Gardening: Anytime, Anywhere
No Kidding, There's No Digging
Tips for a container garden
* Many pots have a single, large drainage hole at their base. To prevent this from becoming blocked with compost, cover with a layer of broken bits of pot.
* When displaying pots on a paved area, such as a patio, raise off the ground by resting on terracotta feet or even bricks. This will help water drain freely and prevent a build up of moisture at root level.
* Place a layer of broken pots (known as crocks) at the base of the container.
* Fill pot with your chosen compost to the level of the base of your largest pot - aim to leave a 2cm gap between the top of the compost and the rim of the pot.
* Fill in the gaps with compost and press with your fingers.
* Finish by watering well. Aftercare
* Replace the top soil of your potted plants with a fresh layer of compost. This will give plants an extra boost of essential nutrients needed for healthy growth.
* Plants in containers are in danger of drying out. Be sure to check the soil and water regularly.
Many moons ago, when I was a lodger in a match-box size apartment in Queens, New York, I was the proud owner of a tiny container garden. To gaze at the used yoghurt tubs brimming with lettuce and parsley was, well...almost like falling in love. Be still my beating heart, I used to mutter under my breath each time I went near that special corner in the hallway where my roommates lived - in containers.
Now that I am home, I have a backyard where I do a little digging, a little planting, a little weeding and a whole lot of daydreaming. But now my heart is still, for I no longer have my roommates with me.
And, come to think of it, for those of us who do not have access to a garden, a back yard or even a balcony, a container garden is really a great alternative.
To quote my real roommate who shared that apartment with me, when there's no hope for a plant to poke its head out from between the floor-boards of your living room, when there is nothing called a balcony you can turn to, then you'd better get potty!
Trust me, you are sure to find it worth your effort. If you think about it, you will realize container gardening offers many advantages that most of us tend to overlook: containers can be less work because they can be placed closer to a water source; they offer a smaller soil area to weed; they can be placed at a height that can minimize bending for watering; and they can provide a garden plot even in high-rise apartments.
How do we select a container, though According to the information given in the National Garden Bureau website, virtually anything that will hold soil and water is a candidate for container growing. From a bag of soil with holes punched for planting and drainage to plastic tubs, old shoes, tin cans, hanging baskets and fancy ornamental pots there is nothing to stop you from choosing the size, shape and cost to fit your needs and desires.
Once you have a container you can probably walk around your neighborhood searching for good soil or buy a bag of soil from a plant nursery. It is said that the potting soil should provide nutrients for plants as they grow, and should help retain moisture.
One important fact to note is that you should thoroughly water the soil before planting. Pour the water gently until water drains from the bottom of the pot. This way you can be assured that the entire soil mass is wet. If you are going to move the pots, you may want to move them before watering so they will not be as heavy as they will be after watering.
If you are planting seeds from packets, follow the seed packet directions for spacing and whether or not to cover the seeds with soil. Keep the soil moist by gentle misting or watering several times a day. When seedlings emerge keep them watered, and if you have too many plants thin them by plucking out the weakest looking ones.
For transplants, plant the top of the root ball even with the soil line and keep plants well watered as they get established, advise the experts a the Garden Bureaue.
A simple test as to whether or not to water is to stick your finger into the top inch of soil. If it feels damp, there is no immediate need to water; if it feels dry then you should water until some runs out the bottom of the container.
Plants that will be grown outdoors in full sun in containers can benefit from a layer of mulch on top of the soil. Mulch will help retain moisture in the soil, discourage weed growth, and break the harshness of raindrops or watering from a hose or watering can. Sawdust, and dried leaves can act as mulches-choose one appropriate to the container and the plants.
Containers placed in semi-shady or shady areas do not need mulch as much as those planted in full sun, but it is never a bad idea.
Experts say growing in containers gives you an opportunity to experiment on a small scale. If you have a shady area that you want to test to see how certain plants will grow, putting a few in a pot in that area will let you see how they do without a lot of work. Of course, you can do the same for sunny locations too. By grouping several pots, each with a different selection, (spinach, gotukola, tomatoes and brinjals) you can see which ones do better so that you can decide what to grow more and vice- versa in that shady or sunny corner.
Container growing is also an excellent choice for introducing children to gardening. Containers are easy to look after and can vary according to the age and interest of a child. Letting them choose their favourite vegetable or flowers to plant in pots would be the best way to get them started.
Surprisingly, containers can also mean much more than what they appear to be. For the Mediterranean Garden editor, Caroline Harbouri growing cannas in pots meant a marital compromise. my husband loved cannas and, having pronounced sniffily, They wouldn't suit the garden, we are not going to have cannas, I reflected that this was ungenerous and suggested, We can have a couple in pots on the balcony if you like. And in fact they did perfectly well in pots... Today, in memory of Spyros, I still have several of his cannas on my roof terrace and find that they blend quite successfully with the other plants. This has led me to recognise that the aesthetics of pot-gardening and garden-gardening differ.
This could be because we expect different things from our potted plants. A mature garden, even a small one, would have trees whereas a pot garden has no trees - and hence no shade. Moreover, shrubs grown even in large pots cannot attain the full stature that they would have in a normal garden. What this means is that one tends to count more on flowers and on foliage, says Harbouri, than one would, when growing trees in a garden-garden.
For all this, Julie Lake, author of the book, Gardening in a Hot Climate, assures all gardeners If it can be grown in the ground, it can be grown in the pot. I confess it is a bit hard to agree with this optimistic statement - after all, what about big trees On the other hand, if you are planning to have a container garden, I think this is a good principle to start with. Time and experience would show what you could and could not grow - in containers.
And, I'm certain, once you get going, you would never want to give up. For, as essayist and columnist Phyllis Theroux said, gardening, be it in pots or otherwise, is the closest one can come to being present at creation.

Peru creates huge national park in Amazon basin
PERU: Peru is creating a national park to protect a vast territory in the Amazon basin that is vulnerable to drug trafficking and illegal logging and mining, the country's environment minister said Saturday. Called the Sierra del Divisor National Park, it covers an area of about 14,170 square kilometers (5,470 square miles) in a region inhabited by a variety of indigenous communities living in self-imposed isolation.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala will travel to the region Sunday to sign a decree creating the park, Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal said on his Twitter account.The park has an estimated 3,000 species of plants and animals, many of them found nowhere else in the world, according to the government.
The announcement comes just three weeks ahead of a UN summit aimed at sealing a global pact on climate change. Advocates of the new park have said it will enable the capture of 150,000 tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of nearly 40 percent of Peru's daily carbon output. Sierra del Divisor has been a protected zone since April 2006. Since then, the communities living there have lobbied for its designation as a national park to stiffen legal protections against encroachment by loggers, miners and drug traffickers.
Sierra del Divisor is the second national park created since Humala took office in 2011, after the Gueppi National Park, a 6,260 square kilometer expanse centered on the Gueppi River in southeastern Peru.

Rain intervenes in first Gabba Test

Brisbane, Sunday: New Zealand's hopes of stonewalling an Australian victory took a massive blow with the contentious dismissal of leading batsman Kane Williamson on a rain-hit fourth day in the first Gabba Test on Sunday.
The accomplished Williamson took up where he left off after 140 in the first innings to reach his 50 off 55 balls but fell to a marginal leg before wicket decision nearing tea.
The Black Caps were 142 for three off 53 overs chasing an improbable 504 runs for victory with Ross Taylor on 20 and skipper Brendan McCullum not out four when a combination of bad light and rain prevented any play after tea.
English umpire Richard Illingworth gave Williamson out after he was struck high on the back leg from spinner Nathan Lyon and the Kiwi batsman called for a review.
Replays showed the ball clipping the very top of the bails and the umpire's decision stood much to New Zealand's chagrin.
Williamson had looked up to the task and efficiently dissected the Australian field with his crisp strokeplay. The Australian bowlers were unable to get him to play a false stroke up until his dismissal.
Rain twice intervened on the fourth day and there was no play after tea, meaning there will be an earlier start to Monday's final day's play.
Martin Guptill, who took 24 balls to get off the mark, gave two chances and survived a leg before wicket review, before he was caught at slip off Lyon for 23. Guptill was dropped before he had scored and again on seven. Joe Burns had two fumbles at short leg to catch Guptill off Mitchell Johnson before Lyon got his fingers to a hot chance above his head at point, again off Johnson. AFP

The SKYS the LIMIT...
Being the only child in the family, her parents allowed her to follow her heart when making important decisions in life. Kishani Alanki Perera went to Colombo International School and studied Law at the University of London. Her mum has always encouraged her and is the biggest strength in her life along with her dad who has always supported her decisions.
She was not acting for about 3 to 4 years because she dedicated that time for her Law Degree but started her acting career again after completing the studies. These days she is appearing in a tele drama called Monara Kadadasi.
She also hosted a popular adventure TV programme called A Team B Team.
With all this and more she is now getting ready to represent Sri Lanka in the Mister and Miss Pancontinental beauty pageant which will be held in Manila Philippines from November 19 to the 30.
TnC caught up with this beauty with brains for a chit chat.
Q: So Kishani...do tell us how you got to be selected for this upcoming pageant
A: The national Director Prasanna Pathmanathan was in search of a suitable candidate to represent Sri Lanka for this inaugural pageant.
He had auditioned several potential candidates and finally decided that I was the most suitable for the title and I was surprised when he called me and invited me to represent Sri Lanka for this prestigious pageant as Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Pancontinental.
Q: Have you ever participated in other international pageants
A: Even though I had been invited to take part in several pageants before, I never took part in any, therefore this happens to be my first ever participation in an international pageant.
I truly feel blessed to have been selected to represent Sri Lanka.
Q: Describe yourself in 3 words.
A: Sensitive, Straightforward and Caring
Q: What is your daily routine
A: I am not a morning person...but if I have a shoot then I will be awake at 5 am and start my day early. These days I am busy meeting designers who are designing outfits for my pageants and training for the pageant in every aspect.
Q: Three things you cant do without
A: My phone, Food and Love.
Q: Top 3 actors/ movies.
A: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Angelina Jolie. Movies - A Walk To Remember, Love Aaj Kaal and Seven Pounds
Q: Motto in life
A: The Sky is the Limit if you believe in yourself!
Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years
A: I see myself being a Human Rights Lawyer and working with underprivileged kids. This is why I pursued a degree in law because I felt that it can be used to do something that I have always been passionate about. I work closely with the Foundation of Goodness as one of their ambassadors and I have been fundraising every month for the last two years to raise donations for underprivileged kids in rural areas to obtain a good education. It truly saddened me to learn that there are so many kids in rural areas who walk up to 17km to go to school barefoot. So we assist them by raising donations to buy school bikes and school shoes and encourage them to go to school. I wish to raise more awareness and to help on a larger scale so that more kids can benefit. And well in the next 5 years I think I might see myself being married!
Q: What are your fitness rules
A: I am honestly one of the laziest people and never really cared much about exercise but I try to stay healthy by taking a walk at least twice a week so that I could stay healthy. But these days I am working out because for the pageant and it has truly motivated me to be a fitter person!

So finally Angie borrowed from Kate
The By the Sea red carpet circuit is in full swing for Angelina Jolie, who appeared with Brad Pitt for the film's premiere in New York City last week. Angie, wearer of thigh-high slits and sleek suits, went for a more modest, classic outfit: a vintage pale blue dress with beige heels. The look was nearly the same as the one Kate Middleton wore for her recent red carpet appearance, down to the silver belt.
Brad was a little dressed down to be Prince William, but perhaps he didn't want to take any attention away from his wife. That gaze is Ryan Reynolds-Blake Lively level.

Space debris expected to burst into flames
The falling space debris may be visible to the naked eye as it is expected to burst into flames when re-entering the earth's atmosphere on November 13, an official at the Planetarium said.
However, she said it might not generate a spectacular view as it happens in the daytime sky.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, she said the object is expected to fall into the Indian Ocean, about 65 kms south of Sri Lanka around 11.00 a.m. on November 13.
"We hope to observe the object one hour before and after the calculated time. This object designated as WT1190F is said to have a diameter of about two metres. The likelihood of any damage from this space junk is very low. In the next few days, we will receive more accurate calculations on the time and location of its fall. The object may break up into smaller pieces during reentry. The bigger pieces will continue to hurtle downward while smaller pieces burn completely high up in the atmosphere," the official said.
She said the object is thought to be a component from a spacecraft bound for the moon. The official added this is the first experience for Sri Lanka of a falling space debris in its environs.
Explaining on the rising threat of space debris, she noted about 3,000 objects of space debris about the size of WT1190F or larger than that are found in the space.
"The term came into use since the Earth's first satellite 'Sputnik 1' was sent in 1957. Much of the debris will eventually fall back into the Earth's atmosphere and incinerate, but some larger ones may still make landfall," she said.
Scientists requested the fisher community not to go fishing in the southern seas during the time of the phenomenon, even though they predict the chance of any hazard is low.
