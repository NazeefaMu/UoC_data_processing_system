General Election  the best option to resolve crises
Members of the Victorious National Organization including the members of the clergy, academics and Vedda Chief Uruwarige Wannilaththo yesterday told the media that a General Election would be the best option for the present political crisis in the country.
They were speaking at a press conference at the Kandyan Art hotel in Kandy yesterday.
Prof. H.M.D.R. Herath of the University of Peradeniya criticized the conduct of the MPs in Parliament. He said the people of the country should be given the opportunity to elect new MPs instead of this rotten parliament.
They said the people have already decided peoples representatives in the next Parliament.
The representatives from 21 organizations including the Northern and the Eastern areas participated.

No leniency in issuing gun licenses
Farmers visit me at my office often to get their firearm application forms recommended, which is practically and legally impossible, said Anuradhapura government agent R. M. Wanninayake.
He was speaking at the November Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee Session.
He informed farmer organisations and officials that people were acting on wrong information that temporary gun licenses were issued by the District Secretariat for the protection of cultivations.
There is no such leniency in issuing gun licenses on the part of the government, he said.
Government agents have proposed authorities to relax laws on firearms.

How come a new procedure is implemented only for the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, while one common procedure followed for all the other No Confidence Motions in the past MP Kanchana Wijesekara asked.
He was addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) headquarters at Battaramulla yesterday.
He said the NCM against the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe handed over on March 21, 2015 and it was taken for the debate on April 4, two weeks after the motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was handed over on November 14 and taken a vote on November 14 after 10 minutes.
MP Wijesekara said that no debate was there like the debate held for the NCM against the former PM. No proper vote was taken. Another NCM was handed over against the former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake on August 3, 2017, but it was not taken for the debate until he resigns from his post.
Yet another NCM was handed over against the former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on March 24, 2016, and it was taken for the debate on June 9, 2016, after two and half months but not in two weeks or two minutes, he said.
Another NCM was handed over against the former Health Minister on August 24, 2017, but it was not taken for the debate yet, he said.

Premier will rebuild country destroyed by UNP
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has commenced an operation to rebuild the country which was devastated by the United National Party for the last three years, said Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga.
Ranatunga stressed the importance of forming a stable government to revive the ailing economy and said the country should go for a snap General Election soon.
He was addressing a meeting organised by the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna, at Galkanda in Minuwangoda.
Ranatunga added that everyone asks why the Prime Minister accepted this post at this time. He said there would not have been a country, if Mahinda Rajapaksa had waited any longer.
He said former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe faced defeats in 27 elections.
Wickremesinghe wants to stay in the seat for good. He has no concern about the country or the party, Ranatunga said.
Ranatunga added that the UNP will face a humiliating defeat at a General Election.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is acting in violation of Parliamentary traditions and Standing Orders, he said.
He said the Speaker is trying to portray a picture internationally that the country is in turmoil, with the ulterior objective of becoming the common candidate of the United National Party.
The country is in crisis as Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is dreaming of becoming the common candidate of the UNP at the next election, he said.

Umpire fails to notice spell of bowling in which:
40% deliveries were no balls
The recently concluded third Test of the three-match Test series between England Sri Lanka came into headlines for a strange incident.
Although England managed to bag the Test in their favor after defeating the home team by 42 runs, the game was in news because of the Sri Lankan spinner Lakshan Sandakans spell of bowling.
Sandakan bowled many no balls in this particular spell but the more surprising fact was that the on-field umpire S Ravi failed to take notice of the no-balls and allowed the balls as legitimate deliveries.
It was only when Sandakan dismissed Ben Stokes twice and the decision went to the third umpire for a check on the no-ball that it was discovered that in both these deliveries, the bowler had failed to comply by the front foot rule and hence Stokes survived on both the occasions. Stokes was initially dismissed on 22 and then again on 32 but for the no balls. The umpires had to allow Stokes to resume his innings in the middle.
After the entire incident bowler, Lakshan Sandakans bowling became a matter of intense debate and discussion across the cricketing globe. Detailed analysis was done of his bowling. According to the ESPNCricinfo stats, Sandakans 40% deliveries were actually "no balls" but umpire Ravi failed to take that into notice.
To argue for the case of the umpire, Sandakans unorthodox and weird action made it extremely difficult for the umpires to keep an eye on his front foot. Had the wicket of Ben Stokes not fallen to no balls, perhaps Lakshan would have continued his no bowling spree.
WHAT WAS THE REASON
Sri Lankan spin coach Piyal Wijetunge seemed extremely worried about his bowlers inability to deal with his No Ball problems. He suggested that it is possibly the first incident at the international level where a bowler has been so regularly bowling no balls.
He also went to say that this the first time that Lakshan had been going through something like this.
The coach added that perhaps in a bid to get extra bounce off the surface of the Sinhalese Sports Club ground, Sandakan was trying too many things which ended up in him crossing that bowling crease so frequently. This would be a massive learning phase for him, the coach suggested. - sk

All debt repayments  will be honoured  Prof. Samarakoon
National Economic Council (NEC) Secretary General and Chief Economist of the Government Prof. Lalith Samarakoon yesterday assured that the Government would honour all its contractual debt repayments for this year and the next.
He was addressing a seminar on Sri Lankas Economic Challenges in the Year 2019, at the Galadari Hotel along with Central Bank Senior Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and Professor at the Faculty of Economics University of Kelaniya Prof. Ajitha Tennnakoon.
He said that despite the countrys economy also being badly influenced by global conditions such as a volatile international market, further increasing of US Federal Reserve rates and slow growth rates in advanced economies next year, Prof. Samarakoon explained that the Government regardless of political situation had already made arrangements through external credit lines and borrowings to repay its debts which would average USD 5 million each year for the next five years.
We have USD 30 billion of foreign debt and USD 32 billion of domestic debt to repay, the Professor said.
The Chief Economist, however, warned that the Government was looking at a tough year ahead in 2019.
Dr Weerasinghe and Prof. Samarakoon highlighted the need for political stability in the country to prevail if the country is to have a better economic outlook,
We have to go for more borrowings to repay our loans but with the current downgrading by Moody from B1 negative to B2 stable, this means that we would have to pay higher risk premiums of at least 5 per cent (normally 3 per cent) at international bond markets, Prof. Samarakoon said.
He said the issue would be the countrys persistent twin deficits; the Budget Deficit (5.5. percent) and Current Account Deficit (2.5 percent) which remain worryingly high and are expected to remain so in the foreseeable future.
But as other world economies are expected to have decreased economic growth rates in 2019, this would have a spillover effect on our economy. Emerging markets have already declined by 13 per cent this year, Prof. Samarakoon said. He said that flight of capital from our stock market would also increase next year as US Federal Interest rates increase and home markets become more attractive than Frontier and Emerging markets.
On the positive side, however, oil prices have declined sharply in the last two months with Brent Crude Oil prices falling from USD 86 per barrel to USD 59.39 at present. The government as a result reduced Petrol and Diesel prices by Rs 5 per liter yesterday.
Prof. Samarakoon noted that whilst this was positive for countries like Sri Lanka, it was also indicative of slow economic growth around the world, which is now needing less oil for development.
Oil prices may have bottomed with slight upturn going forward, Prof. Samarakoon said.
The economists stressed that short term solutions would not resolve the current crisis and that eventually the Government would have to roll out a growth oriented strategy to overcome the current structural problems in the economy.
Dr.Weerasinghe said the Central Bank alone could not control inflation and monetary policy without the Government adopting better fiscal policies to increase growth, increase foreign earnings and reduce fiscal deficits.
From 1977 to 2009, Governments have maintained on average a fiscal deficit of 9 per cent every year but that was made possible only because of borrowings. We cannot address the issue of currency depreciation without addressing the current account and fiscal deficit issue, the Senior Deputy Governor said.

## Title: Climate Change and the Indus Valley Civilization

Climate Change and the Indus Valley Civilization
More than 4,000 years ago, the Harappa culture thrived in the Indus River Valley of what is now modern Pakistan and northwestern India, where they built sophisticated cities, invented sewage systems that predated ancient Romes, and engaged in long-distance trade with settlements in Mesopotamia. Yet by 1800 BCE, this advanced culture had abandoned their cities, moving instead to smaller villages in the Himalayan foothills. A new study from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) found evidence that climate change likely drove the Harappans to resettle far away from the floodplains of the Indus.
Beginning in roughly 2500 BCE, a shift in temperatures and weather patterns over the Indus valley caused summer monsoon rains to gradually dry up, making agriculture difficult or impossible near Harappan cities, says Liviu Giosan, a geologist at WHOI and lead author on the paper that published Nov. 13, 2018, in the journal Climate of the Past.
Although fickle summer monsoons made agriculture difficult along the Indus, up in the foothills, moisture and rain would come more regularly, Giosan says. As winter storms from the Mediterranean hit the Himalayas, they created rain on the Pakistan side and fed little streams there. Compared to the floods from monsoons that the Harappans were used to seeing in the Indus, it would have been relatively little water, but at least it would have been reliable.
Indus floods
Evidence for this shift in seasonal rainfalland the Harappans switch from relying on Indus floods to rains near the Himalaya in order to water cropsis difficult to find in soil samples. Thats why Giosan and his team focused on sediments from the ocean floor off Pakistans coast. After taking core samples at several sites in the Arabian Sea, he and his group examined the shells of single-celled plankton called foraminifera (or forams) that they found in the sediments, helping them understand which ones thrived in the summer, and which in winter.
Once he and the team identified the season based on the forams fossil remains, they were able to then focus on deeper clues to the regions climate: paleo-DNA, fragments of ancient genetic material preserved in the sediments.
The seafloor near the mouth of the Indus is a very low-oxygen environment, so whatever grows and dies in the water is very well preserved in the sediment, says Giosan. You can basically get fragments of DNA of nearly anything thats lived there.
During winter monsoons, he notes, strong winds bring nutrients from the deeper ocean to the surface, feeding a surge in plant and animal life. Likewise, weaker winds other times of year provide fewer nutrients, causing slightly less productivity in the waters offshore.
The value of this approach is that it gives you a picture of the past biodiversity that youd miss by relying on skeletal remains or a fossil record. And because we can sequence billions of DNA molecules in parallel, it gives a very high-resolution picture of how the ecosystem changed over time, adds William Orsi, paleontologist and geobiologist at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who collaborated with Giosan on the work.
Sure enough, based on evidence from the DNA, the team found that winter monsoons seemed to become strongerand summer monsoons weakertowards the later years of the Harappan civilization, corresponding with the move from cities to villages.
Rural Harappans
We dont know whether Harappan caravans moved toward the foothills in a matter of months or this massive migration took place over centuries. What we do know is that when it concluded, their urban way of life ended, Giosan says.
The rains in the foothills seem to have been enough to hold the rural Harappans over for the next millennium, but even those would eventually dry up, likely contributing to their ultimate demise.
We cant say that they disappeared entirely due to climateat the same time, the Indo-Aryan culture was arriving in the region with Iron Age tools and horses and carts. But it's very likely that the winter monsoon played a role, Giosan says.
The big surprise of the research, Giosan notes, is how far-flung the roots of that climate change may have been. At the time, a new ice age was settling in, forcing colder air down from the Arctic into the Atlantic and northern Europe. That, in turn, pushed storms down into the Mediterranean, leading to an upswing in winter monsoons over the Indus valley.
Its remarkable, and theres a powerful lesson for today, he notes. If you look at Syria and Africa, the migration out of those areas has some roots in climate change. This is just the beginningsea level rise due to climate change can lead to huge migrations from low lying regions like Bangladesh, or from hurricane-prone regions in the southern U.S. Back then, the Harappans could cope with change by moving, but today, youll run into all sorts of borders. Political and social convulsions can then follow.
Also collaborating on the study was Ann G. Dunlea, Samuel E. Munoz, Jeffrey. P. Donnelly, and Valier Galy of WHOI; William D. Orsi of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen; Marco Coolen and Cornelia Wuchter of Curtin University in Australia; Kaustubh Thirumalai of Brown University; Peter D. Clift of Louisiana State University; and Dorian Q. Fuller of University College, London.
The work was supported by the National Science Foundations Division of Ocean Sciences and internal WHOI funds.

Kandy SC will host CR & FC in what is expected to be a thrilling Dialog first round league encounter at Nittawela on Sunday. Both sides have a point to prove and tension will be even greater due to the recent outcome of the game where both teams have played three games and won all three. Kandy SC may cause a few problems with their running style and explosive individuals, but CR & FC will try their best to tactically outclass their opponents.
Rugby playing schools start fitness program
All Kandys rugby playing schools have started fitness program, physical and weight training for the coming season which is expected to kick off in March. This will encourage each coach and player to review their fitness critically and try to modify it to meet their needs. Rugby in Kandy at school level is primary and secondary school program, designed to increase participation. The program introduces participants to the skills and core values required to play traditional rugby. Schools as a sporting organization offer coaches quality programs that encourage children to participate in this great sport. Its more about the kids having fun but hopefully underlying that they learn a lot of lessons about healthy living, lifestyle, teamwork and values that will hold them in good stead.
Kandy YMCA back at chess after 2 decades
One of the oldest chess clubs in the island Kandy YMCA are back in action and will take part in the Super League, which will be held from today till December 5 in Colombo. Kandy YMCA who took up chess in 1974 and produced some top players are back in the game after two decades. It was in the 80s and 90s they dominated and their last major success was when they won the Inter Club Chess Championship in 1994 under the leadership of T.S Mallawarachchi. Later they were forced to keep off from chess due to most of their players diverting to studies and jobs out of Kandy. Once again due to keen interest chess was started in 2016. This time they have qualified for the Sri Lanka Super League championship, which is amongst the best eight teams in the country. The team is blessed with a couple of masters -International Master Rahul Sangma from India and Fide Master Chinthaka Anuruddha. YMCA in every sport gives opportunities to youngsters, and this time the team will be led by Sylvestrian Shiraz Liaquath a top player. A 14-year-old Maliyadevan D M Dabarera too has joined. Last year's players taking part are Ishan Wiratunga who was a member of the 1994 team, Sameera Chandrasiri, Dhanushka Bandara and Yasnatha Jayaweera. A big hand should go to Sri Lanka Telecom for giving a big hand by sponsoring the team.
Growing interest for athletics in Kandy
The early history of Kandy athletics is lost in the midst of time. Records are unavailable and people associated with early years are long since dead. Almost up to 1925 athletics was not given much importance as it is today nor did our athletes interested. Today athletics has a special place especially in schools and recently in Kandy many athletic events were held. Schools have good coaches, Trinity is coached by a well known sportsman H.Gamage Ariyaratne who learned his sports at Vidyartha College and was also a top ruggerite. Walala A Ratnayake Central is doing well at athletics, followed by St. Anthonys, Dharmaraja, Sri Sumangala, St. Sylvesters, Kingswood, Girls High School, Mahamaya Girls School, Hillwood Girls College, Hemali BV, Swarnamali BV, Seethadevi BV, Viharamadevi BV, Kandy Convent, D.S.

Cricketers who also contributed towards music
Everyone loves music. Even people who claim to hate it like music.
It is soothing and has different genres giving individuals myriad choices of tunes to select their favourite.
Even cricketers love listening to songs. We know how Sachin Tendulkar is a massive fan of Lata Mangeshkar. However, he never pursued music.
Here we look at different cricketers who actually tailed and followed music, some of them even making a part-time career out of it.
Lets see a list of cricketers who contributed to music
1  Brett Lee
It is no secret that Brett Lee is one of the most menacing bowlers in cricket history. However, are you aware that the Australian paceman has his soul strung to music, besides cricket He is part of a rock band called Six & Out which includes four other members (also former cricketers), including his elder brother Shane Lee. Cant Bowl, Cant Throw is one of their famous singles that reached #100 on ARIA singles chart.
2  AB de Villiers
Yes. The fastest ODI century maker features on this list, too. Collaborating with local singer-songwriter Ampie du Preez, de Villiers released Maak Jou Drome Waar (Make Your Dream Comes True), a bilingual pop album on August 2010.

3  Sanjay Manjrekar
This former middle-order batsman did not make a career in music. However, he did record a solo Indipop album titled Rest Day. The album begins with Manjrekar explaining how cricket and music are related. In the album, he sings not only his favourite songs, but also the beloved tracks of fellow cricketers including Mohammad Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble.
4  Donald Bradman
The batting legend is usually known for his astounding average in Test cricket  99.94. Very few people know that Sir Don Bradman was a master piano player. During the 1930 tour of England, he recorded songs with Columbia Record Studios. As his solo pieces, the album featured Old Fashioned Locket and Our Bungalow of Dreams.
5  Curtly Ambrose and Richie Richardson
The band that Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose play in is called The Big Bad Dread and the Bald Head. Where the former plays the rhythm guitar, the former West Indian pace bowler takes on the bass guitar.
6  Mark Butcher
Mark Butcher is a former England middle-order batsman, who represented Surrey in county championships as well. Though not a professional musician, Butcher wrote and sung Youre Never Gone, dedicating it to Ben Hollioake, his Surrey teammate, who died in 2002 following a car accident.
7  Henry Olonga
Henry Olonga played international cricket for Zimbabwe.
He was the first black player to play for the country when he made his debut in 1995. After retiring from the game, he does commentary as well as focuses on singing. He participated in channel Fives reality show The All Star Talent Show and won it, thanks to his operatic voice.
These are the cricketers who contributed to music across the world.

On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to vacate its Interim Order dated May 31, 2018 staying the holding of election that was to be held on last May 31.
Court of Appeal President Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara had made the order pursuant to a writ petition filed by Former Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga.
All parties in the petition had agreed to call for fresh nominations to conduct an election under the prevailing laws to elect the SLC office bearers. The case was fixed for argument on December 7.
Former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga had filed the writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a writ order preventing SLC and its office bearers from permitting Thilanga Sumathipala to hold the post of SLC President in any manner after the SLC election to be held on May 31 this year.
All parties including former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga agreed to annul the validity of the nominations called for the election of May 31. They also agreed to call for a fresh election. It will be conducted in accordance with the Sports laws. The calling of nominations would be opened enabling any party to raise objections regarding the nomination of the candidates. The authority conducting election must provide sufficient time to raise objections.
The petitioner cited 27 persons including incumbent SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala, Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha, SLC Election Committee members, SLC Executive Committee Members and several others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the appointment of the Election Committee on May 19, 2018 violates the SLC constitution, the Sports Laws and regulations.

Ending HIV
Around the world, 37 million people are living with HIV, the highest number ever, yet a quarter of them do not know that they have the virus. Today (December 1), on World AIDS Day, the theme is Live Life Positively: Know your HIV Status. Today also marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day.
Significant progress has been made in the AIDS response since 1988, and today three in four people living with HIV know their status. According to the latest data, 9.4 million people living with HIV don't know their status and 1.8 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2017 alone.
We still have miles to go, as the latest UNAIDS Report shows, that includes reaching people living with HIV who do not know their status and ensuring that they are linked to quality care and prevention services. One problem is that if a patient is infected with the HIV virus, he or she may live without any symptoms for one to 10 years. Even with the HIV virus present in the blood, the blood test results for HIV may be negative, if tested within three months from the date of infection. This is because the antibody development takes about three months from the date of infection.
HIV testing is essential for expanding treatment and ensuring that all people living with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives. It is also crucial to achieving the prevention targets and empowering people to make choices about HIV prevention so they can protect themselves and their loved ones.
Unfortunately, many barriers to HIV testing remain. Stigma and discrimination still deter people from taking an HIV test. Access to confidential HIV testing is still an issue of concern. Many people still only get tested after becoming ill.
Knowing your HIV status has many advantages. It is an essential entry point to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support services. People who test positive for HIV should be linked immediately to antiretroviral therapy to keep them alive and well and, when viral load suppression is reached, prevent transmission of the virus.
Knowing your HIV status also enables people to make informed decisions about HIV prevention options, including services to prevent children from becoming infected with HIV, male and female condoms and other preventive measures.
More than 77 million people worldwide have become infected with HIV, and more than 35 million have died of an AIDS-related illness. But huge progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment, and prevention efforts have avoided millions of new infections. But as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres notes, the pace of progress is not matching global ambition. New HIV infections are not falling rapidly enough. Some regions are lagging behind, and financial resources are insufficient. Stigma and discrimination are still holding people back from getting tested for HIV and getting treatment. Guterres says there is still time -- to scale-up testing for HIV; to enable more people to access treatment; to increase resources needed to prevent new infections; and to end the stigma.
Here in Sri Lanka, there is wide awareness on HIV/AIDS, but more needs to be done. The highest number of HIV infections in the Sri Lankan history was reported last year (2017) and the number is 285. According to venereologists, every week around six new HIV infections are detected in Sri Lanka and the estimated number of HIV infected persons in the country is around 4,200. Compared to the population as a whole, this is a very low rate of infection. Experts say that our cultural and religious ethos may have played a part in this.
However, one-third of those infected do not know that they are HIV positive. The new HIV infected persons detected in the country are between the ages of 15 and 49. New HIV infections among youth have shown an upward trend over the last five years. Earlier, it was young adults around 30 and 35 who were susceptible to HIV infection, but now the age has gone down to 2025. More awareness of HIV and safe sexual practices is needed to prevent more people from this age group falling victim of HIV. Sex education should be an essential part of the school curriculum.
We also need to tackle the issue of stigma and myths surrounding HIV. A few years ago there was a well-known case of a boy being excluded from his school in Kurunegala as he was suspected of having HIV. The incident also exposed the lack of knowledge in society about HIV  many parents thought that their children would also get HIV by being near the affected child, whereas HIV is not transmitted through the air like certain respiratory diseases. The media must play a bigger role in educating the public on HIV.
Scientists around the world have stepped up efforts to create an HIV/AIDS vaccine and they could succeed in 10-15 years at present rates of research and development. Several breakthroughs have been reported recently in this regard. A world free of HIV could be a possibility sooner rather than later.

Five underrated cricketers of modern times
Since its inception, cricket has seen some great players who have taken the game itself to the next level. They increase the quality of the game and in doing so get noticed in the cricketing world.
But, there will always be some really good talents who do not receive as much praise as they should despite their exceptional talent on the field. The fact that many of their careers are born at a wrong time has led to them going unnoticed.
Cricket is a game of uncertainties, for you never know who may become a star on the field. Though it is a game played by 11 people on either side of the team, there are few noted players who shine brighter than the others.
Cricket too has seen unsung heroes since its inception and even in the times of social media, it is no exception.
In this segment, let us all have a look at 5 most underappreciated cricketers of modern times.
5. Brendan Taylor
Brendan Taylor has been the face of Zimbabwe cricket for more than a decade now. He has scored runs all over the world and saved his team from defeat many times. Taylor has carried a nations hopes on his shoulders whether its with his batting or captaincy.
In 28 Test matches, he has scored 3397 runs at an average of 33.35 which includes 5 centuries and 8 half centuries. In ODIs, he has scored 6156 runs at an average of 35.79, with 10 centuries and 36 half centuries.
He amassed 433 runs in the 2015 Cricket World Cup which was more than any of the top Indian batsmen. He scored back-to-back hundreds against India and Ireland.
But, despite such achievements, Brendan Taylor, as a wicketkeeper-batsman and as a skipper, has always been underrated in world cricket.
4. Azhar Ali
Azhar Ali has become Pakistan batting departments most trustable batsman after the retirement of Younis Khan and Misbah ul Haq. Azhar Ali has been probably their best batsman in Test matches in this decade. He debuted in test matches before ODIs and he is one of the rare breeds of cricketers to whom Test cricket means everything.
He has scored 5303 runs at an impressive average of 44.19. This includes 14 Test centuries and 29 half centuries. He has 3 double centuries and 1 triple century against his name which goes to shows the gritty and resilient character he is at in the Test level. And one of those great double hundreds came at MCG against Australia when Pakistan needed it the most.
He recently retired from ODIs to continue his Test career which is such a rare thing to do nowadays, since everyone wants to play the shorter formats. Azhar Ali still continues to produce great innings in Tests for Pakistan especially when the team needs it the most.
3. Morne Morkel
The tall fast bowler from South Africa who intimidated every batsman with his pace, Morne Morkel, is undoubtedly one of the most under-appreciated fast bowlers of the modern era.
In 86 Test matches. he picked up 309 wickets at an impressive average of 27.67. In 117 ODIs, he picked up 188 wickets at a brilliant average of 25.32.
He formed one of the most devastating bowling combinations of modern era along with Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander. Furthermore, when Steyn suffered injuries, he continued preying batsmen with Kagiso Rabada and Philander. But, he always lived under the shadow of the legendary Dale Steyn. He retired early this year after the Test series against India.
2. Rangana Herath
Rangana Herath said goodbye to the game of cricket a week ago in a game when Sri Lanka lost to England at Galle. Herath will go down as one of the most underappreciated spinners of his generation. For a career that was in disarray when Muralitharan was in charge of the spin department, Herath picked himself up after the age of 30 like no other in history.
In 93 Test matches, the Lankan legend took 433 test wickets, the most by any left-arm bowler in the history of the game. He retired when he was the 8th ranked ICC bowler in the world. He took 74 wickets in 71 ODIs too, which not many people would remember.
For a player to have taken more than 350 wickets after the age of 30 is a remarkable achievement. He has defied age in every sense of the word. But he leaves a noiseless legacy behind.
1. Ross Taylor
This may come as a surprise for a few, but there is absolutely no denying the fact that Ross Taylors career is one of the most underappreciated in modern history. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest players to have come out from New Zealand in the last 2 decades. But has never witnessed the sweet smell of success in terms of the limelight for his achievements.
In 86 Test matches, Taylor has amassed 6282 Test runs at a terrific average of 46.53 garnished with 28 half centuries, 17 centuries, including 2 double centuries. He broke a 111-year-old record with his magnificent 290 at Perth.
In 207 ODI matches, he has scored 7428 runs at an astounding average of 47.01 which includes 43 half-centuries and 19 centuries. Its an astonishing career for any middle order batsman.
His blitzkrieg innings against Pakistan at Pallekele in 2011 will go down as one of the most destructive innings in the World Cup history. Taylor has that ability to change the match when its needed.
However, despite his tremendous career, he will go down as one of the most underrated cricketers of all time. - sk

House concerned over  Batticaloa Police deaths
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday that he would draw the attention of President Maithripala Sirisena and Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando to the concerns expressed in Parliament on the killing of two Police officers in Vavunathivu, Batticaloa.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara requested to probe whether there is a link between the killing of two Police officers in Batticaloa and Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharans (Karuna Amman) threatening tweet on Thursday. MP Bandara read out former MP Muralitharans tweet which said, Please remember I am Karuna Amman from Batti.Maybe you ask other people who Karuna Amman was before 2004. The MP raised concerns as to whether this means Amman was trying to reorganise his former terrorist outfit.
TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran supported MP Bandaras statement adding that Amman was making various statements in public over the past few days.
Since the events of October 26, Karuna Amman has come out of the cold and started speaking. Four policemen have been shot at in Batticaloa and two have succumbed to their injuries. According to information we got, we have serious suspicions about whether they have been rejuvenated since Oct 26, he said.
He also noted that EPDP cadres have also come out of the woodwork with an attack on activists of another Tamil party. A person calling himself a minister says I have returned using a famous screen dialogue to terrorise the people, he added. UNP MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara pointed out that the incident in Batticoloa was serious in nature and needs proper investigation, as such crimes did not take place during the past three and half years.

Indian Coast Guard Ships here today
Indian Coast Guard Ships CGS Samar and Aryaman will arrive today in Sri Lanka and stay until December 7.
The ships will arrive in Colombo after participating in the India-Sri Lanka-Maldives Tri-Lateral Coast Guard Exercise Dosti conducted from November 25 to 29 in Maldives.
Two junior Sri Lanka Coast Guard Officers have also been embarked on the ships since their departure from India on November 23 to provide sea experience and first-hand insight into Coast Guard operations. During their stay in Sri Lanka, the ships would also be visiting Galle.
The visit is aimed at furthering cooperation and interoperability that exists between Coast Guards of both nations and to assist in capacity building of Sri Lanka Coast Guard. Interaction between the services has seen a steady increase over the years with a number of high level delegations and four ship visits undertaken by Indian Coast Guard to Sri Lanka since last year.
The operational and professional exchange that takes place between both the Coast Guards had also served to build mutual trust and provide an opportunity to learn from each other.
CGS Samar is an indigenously-designed state-of-the-art vessel built in Goa Shipyard, the same yard where Sri Lanka Navys two latest Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessels Sayurala and Sindhurala were built.
The ship is designed to carry high speed boats for fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol.
CGS Aryaman is also an ingeniously-designed vessel that was constructed at Cochin Shipyard. Similar to CGS Samar, she is also tasked to carry out fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol.
During their visit, the Indian Coast Guard ships will undertake training on aspects such as search and rescue, vessel search procedure and documentation, pollution control etc. In addition, a series of professional exchanges and sports fixtures have been also planned ashore between the ships crew and Sri Lanka Coast Guard personnel at Colombo as well as Galle.

## Title: May in desperate fight to save Brexit Deal

May in desperate fight to save Brexit Deal
Theresa May is now campaigning in the United Kingdom in a desperate move to gather public support for the Brexit Deal agreed with the European Union last Sunday, as she faces major opposition to the Deal in the House of Commons.
The situation is made worse for her with an official analysis of the Brexit Deal showing the UK economy would shrink and wages fall under every scenario of Brexit, while she insists this is the Best Deal the UK would get, and warns of dangerous situations under a No Deal Brexit.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research's (NIESR) study modelled different Brexit scenarios against a baseline of staying in the EU. The report states that every region of the country will be worse off in 15 years time, after Brexit, with London suffering the greatest damage, the analysis finds. Real wages, after inflation, are expected to be 2.7 per cent lower  despite the claims of pro-May Brexiteers that cutting EU migration would allow pay to go up.
It found that leaving the EU in March 2019, and entering a transition period lasting until December 2020, before moving to a free trade agreement - would lead to a huge reduction in trade and investment, largely because leaving the single market would create higher impediments to the services trade, making it less attractive to sell services from the UK.
Leaving the EU discourages investment in the UK and ultimately means that UK workers are less productive than they would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU, the report states.
Trump strikes
A situation that is already bad for Theresa May has been made worse by the UKs strong ally the US, with President Donald Trump saying the UK may not be able to trade with America in the future, in the context of the UKs continuing relations with the EU, even after Brexit, in the transition period. This is rejected by Theresa May.
May already has an arduous task to get the motion approved, and the Trump statement makes it worse.
Theresa May has to face the House of Commons from December 4, at the major debate on the Brexit Deal, with a final vote on Dec 11, in a situation where she is not assured of majority support in the Commons. A large number of her own Conservative Party members are opposed to the deal, and she will also not get the support of the 10 members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland, whose votes are vital for her to get a majority in a parliament. DUPs opposition to the Deal, makes it break the agreement with May, to support her government in the Commons on key financial and policy issues, the lifeline for her and the Conservatives.
With the Opposition Labour Party stating it would oppose the current Brexit Deal, Theresa May is now seeking discussions with some dissident members of the Labour Party to gain some votes in the Commons.
Defeat in the Commons would most likely unleash huge political uncertainty and could roil financial markets. The opposition forces are now calling for a second referendum on leaving the EU, as the first referendum two years ago, which support Brexit was a small majority, was with the voters uninformed of the actual situation of an exit.
The defeat of Mays Brexit Deal in the Commons could also lead to a call for a General Election, in a situation where the Conservatives led by Theresa May lost the last election two years ago, and with the opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn much stronger today.
G20 and Khashoggi in Argentina
The 2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit, the 13th meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) hosted by Argentina, bringing together leaders of the worlds biggest economies, will have a focus away from its intended Agenda - on the future of work, infrastructure for development and a sustainable food future, and the need for focus on the crypto-currencies.
The change will be due to the presence there of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohamad bin Salman (MBS), associated so closely with the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the opposition from many western countries to the Saudi role in this killing. Crown Prince MBS faced street protests in majority Muslim Tunisia, over the Khashoggi killing, before he arrived in Buenos Aires. There are likely to be some protests there too.
The Khashoggi play in Buenos Aires is more interesting as President Donald Trump, who has rejected the CIAs reports of MBS close involvement in the Khashoggi killing, is expected to meet and greet MBS here. President Trump has declared himself a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia come-what-may, re-Khashoggi. Many analysts see Trump having a tete-a-tete with MBS as cosying up with one who is fast being seen as a threat to humanitarian values in governance.
As Donald Trump associates with MBS in Buenos Aires, there is increasing opposition to his moves, at Capitol Hill in the US. In the U.S. Senate, a rare bipartisan coalition is forming around a bid to introduce a resolution halting American military, intelligence and financial support for Saudi Arabia's brutal intervention in Yemen's civil war. The motion may come to a vote as soon as this week, although the White House has vowed to veto it. Meanwhile, Trump has despatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis for a closed door meeting with senators in an effort to head off the motion.
The G20 has more unexpected interests, with Donald Trump stating he may not have a meeting with Russias Vladimir Putin, in a protest over Russias recent aggression in Ukraine. However, Vladimir Putin has confirmed he will sit down with MBS, vowing to bring up the Khashoggi's murder, along with oil markets and the situation in Syria.
The G20 Summit is having more focus on the reported role of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince MBS in the Jamal Khashoggi killing, than the regular interests of the leading economic powers of the world. It also shows a new interest in humanitarian affairs, and the role of Saudi Arabia in the cruel war in Yemen.
Yellow Vests in France
Frances President Emmanuel Macron is faced with a major protest by those opposed to rising fuel prices and increasing economic hardships.
The Yellow Vest movement, which has no link to any political party, is made up of ordinary citizens, especially from the sub-urban and rural areas, who wear legally required safety jackets or yellow vests that all vehicle drivers in France should have for safety notifications. As the protests have spread in Paris and many cities and towns, President Macron has been firm in stating he would not change the fuel prices, and condemned the violence involved in some of the protests, especially in Paris.
With the protests moving to the third week, showing strong public opposition to the Macron Presidency and his government, Frances Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, has offered to meet with members of the yellow vest movement, stating that the protesters are expressing a lot of legitimate things that should be heard.
The protests have also moved to the French Indian Ocean territory of Reunion, where there were very violent protests. The protesters denounce the perceived elitism by President Macron, who insists that the rising taxes on fuel - especially diesel most used by French vehicles - is due to the need for environmental protection.
Two in three French people reportedly back the protest movement, and nearly 80 percent rejects Macrons proposed measures as insufficient, according to a survey published by Opinion Way on Wednesday. Only 32 percent of respondents said they opposed the movement, which has caused economic disruption as demonstrators hold up road traffic. A centrist, Macron, has pledged a three-month public consultation aimed at producing a roadmap to help France shift to a low-carbon economy without penalizing low-income families. But he refused to go back on an increase in fuel tax which is due to come into force in January, saying it is needed to help fight pollution.

Money Laundering case against Namal, others fixed for April 3
The case filed against Hambantota district MP Namal Rajapaksa and five others under the Money Laundering Act was fixed for further trial on April 3 by Colombo High Court Judge Pradeep Hettiarachchi yesterday.
The defence sought a further date for further trial since its senior counsel was appearing in another court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against six accused for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services.
Four accused Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation were present in court when the case was taken up before Colombo High Court.
However, the second accused Indika Karunajeewa was not present in Court but represented by attorneys.
At a previous occasion, the High Court permitted the prosecution to proceed the trial in the absentia of second and sixth accused in the case in terms of section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
At a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had served indictments on three accused regarding this money laundering case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Namal Rajapaksa, Indika Karunajeewa, Sujani Bogollagama, Iresha Silva, Nithya Senani Samaranayake and Gowers Corporate Services on 11 counts under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for their alleged involvement in money laundering amounting to Rs.30 million in a company Gowers Corporate Services owned by Namal Rajapaksa between 2013 and 2014.
It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to SriLankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.

Mystery behind head of woman and torso
Janaka Kumara of Deiyandara, Udagahagedera gave a statement to Morontuduwa Police, identifying the head of the woman found at the shrub jungle near Bolgoda Lake to be his 19-year-old daughter Ayesha Kalhari.
She was married to Krishan Madusanka and lived at Morontuduwa, Tharunaseva Mawatha in Morontuduwa. She was married for two years and had a child.
The statement said that there were constant arguments between the couple.

Over 7000 Samurdhi officers made permanent
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa presiding over an event organized and hosted by Minister of Housing and Social Welfare Wimal Weerawansa said that government officers and particularly Samurdhi officials have a duty to alleviate the suffering poverty of 1.5 million people in this country who live below the poverty line.
Letters to 7000 Samurdhi Officers making them permanent was handed over by the President and the Prime Minister yesterday.
The President told a huge gathering of Samurdhi officials who were gathered at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium to receive certificates confirming their employment that they should not be perturbed by the political crisis. Leave the political crisis for us politicians to resolve, he said. Dont let the country fall into anarchy. Render the services that you all did, let children go to school, trade and do business as youve done before. This is a nation of resilient people.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said that parliament was akin to Sirikotha were decisions were being taken and approved by members with vested interests including the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya. Just yesterday Mangala Samaraweera brought up this matter of awarding Samurdhi officers with certificates confirming their employment to which the Speaker said he would look into it, he said. I am grateful to Minister Wimal Weerawansa for having the courage to go through with this even after so much opposition.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa said that one of his prime objectives when he took over the Housing and Social Welfare Ministry was to ensure that the workers were well looked after. It is only when they are looked after that they would render a better service, he said. I was told that this was a huge concern and it had prompted many to terminate their jobs. I only spent two meetings on the matter and we organised this event in less than four days.
Minister Weerawansa also questioned as to how a member of parliament from the opposition could propose a motion and how speaker could approve it without so much of a deliberation, knowing very well it was unlawful.
He added that the recent incident where two police officers were shot and killed in Batticaloa was done by individuals with vested interest for political gain.

Parliament passes motion to curtail funds to Ministers
A motion prohibiting the Ministry Secretaries from approving any payment drawn from the state funds for Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers and their personal staff was passed with 122 votes in favour and none against in Parliament yesterday.
The UPFA MPs boycotted Parliament sittings for the fourth day. UNP MP Sujeewa Senasinghe was not present for the vote as he was appearing in the Supreme Court. The motion signed by six UNP MPs was presented to the House by MP Patali Champika Ranawaka and was seconded by MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
The motion stated that Ministry Secretaries have no authority to approve any payment of monies drawn from the funds of the Republic for Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers and their personal staff from November 15. It prohibits the Secretaries from paying for the salaries and other emoluments of Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers and their personal staff. It also prohibits them from defraying expenses incurred in foreign travel, internal air travel including use of helicopters. According to the motion, any person taking any action in violation of this resolution will be dealt with according to law.
MP Ranawaka presenting the motion, made a brief analysis of the impact on the countrys economy by the month long Constitutional crisis. He pointed out that the countrys economy has come to a standstill and investors have started withdrawing their investments.
The MP pointed out that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has been acting impartially right from the beginning. We opposed your decision, when you told us that the Parliamentary staff members have to go by the Gazette issued by the President and allocate PMs seat to Mahinda Rajapaksa when the House reconvenes after prorogation. We told you the Gazette was against the Constitution, but we did not pour water on your chair or throw chilli powder at the members as our opponents did. It was after the passage of the No-Confidence Motion that you declared that there is no Government or PM. Democracy loving people lined up with us, he elaborated.
Ranawaka also stressed that the UNF is ready for elections at any moment under a legitimate Government. He however pointed out that they demand a Presidential Election first.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, adding to what Ranawaka said, told the House that he always acted within the countrys legal framework and followed the advice of the IPU and Commonwealth Parliamentary Union and Parliamentary traditions.
UNP MP S.M.Marrikar drew to the Speakers attention that the official Parliament website mentions that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the Prime Minister from October 26 upto date. UNP MP Mayantha Dissanayake drew to the Speakers attention that Rupavahini and SLBC have stopped live coverage of Parliament sittings.
Parliament pays money to the SLBC to telecast Parliament sittings live. The Speaker must look into it, he added.
The Speaker also expressing his concerns over the matter said the SLBC at this instance has clearly acted in a biased manner and that it amounts to contempt of Parliament. He however pointed out that Parliament has not inked an agreement for live coverage with Rupavahini.
TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran pointed out that Parliament was exercising its full control of public finances for the first time in the Sri Lankan Parliaments history with the passage of two motions yesterday and day before.
If they dont heed what Parliament is doing as a token of its power over public finance, then Parliament can actually shutdown Government. The purported ministers should give up now, he added.
It is the Speaker who needs to be satisfied that a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) has been passed properly. An NCM is passed in Parliament, not at the Presidential Secretariat. Once the NCM is passed, the Cabinet stands dissolved. I explained this to the President, he noted.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath brought to the attention of the Speaker that the President was yet to make the appointments of S.Thurairaja, PC and E.A.G.R.Amarasekara as Supreme Court Judges, even though the Constitutional Council (CC) approved the appointments a month ago.
The Speaker replied that the matter was notified to the President.
UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera then brought to the Speakers attention that 7,000 Samudhi appointments were given at a ceremony attended by Wimal Weerawansa at the Sugathadasa Stadium and questioned the legality of that act in a context where there is no Government.
The Speaker then placed the motion before the House and a vote was taken using the e-vote system around 11.45pm. UNP MP Ven. Rathana Thera, TNA MPs S.Viyalendran and Ananda Sivasakthy were absent. The motion was carried with 122 MPs voting in favour of it. The Speaker then adjourned sittings till 10.30am on December 5.
A motion to prohibit the Prime Ministers Secretary from approving any expenditure drawn from the state funds was passed in Parliament with 123 votes on Thursday.

P.M. Modi pursues yoga diplomacy at G20 summit
ARGENTINA: Stepping away from the sealed security zone and ceremonial pomp of the Group of 20 summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought a message dear to his heart to host Argentina -- the value of yoga.
With the sound of rush-hour traffic audible outside, about 4,000 yoga practitioners in Buenos Aires took to their mats in a convention hall to hear Modi as well as a troupe of 70 Indian musicians.
I arrived in Buenos Aires a short time ago after a trip of more than 24 hours, but thanks to your enthusiasm and affection I feel like I'm still in India, Modi told the crowd.
The right-wing leader, who has championed a greater Hindu identity in officially secular India, has made yoga a diplomatic priority since taking office in 2014.
Modi has promoted an International Day of Yoga and dedicated a government office to yoga, the Indian-rooted spiritual exercises that have found a global following among seekers of mental and physical strength.
Modi in his remarks voiced hope that the summit of the Group of 20 economic powers would make progress on international challenges such as sustainable development and climate change.
He also voiced hope for greater relations with Argentina, seeing pharmaceuticals, energy and information, and aerospace technology as areas of cooperation.
The Buenos Aires yoga followers folded their arms together toward the sun in a traditional surya greeting.
Several voiced support for the theme of Modi's appearance, that yoga can be a route to peace.
Silvana Alberto, a 59-year-old astrologer, wore a T-shirt with a phrase of India's nonviolent independence hero Mahatma Gandhi: We must be the change that we want to see.
All of us being here is a way to anchor the energy of this place, which we need so much, she said.
It is the masses that give this energy its force, she said.

President opens sluice gates of Moragahakanda
President Maithripala Sirisena opened the sliuce gates of the Moragahakanda Reservoir coming under the giant Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga Multi-purpose Development Project last morning with the reservoir reaching its maximum water level.
The President said the Moragahakanda Reservoir project is the largest multi-purpose development project in Sri Lanka. It can be considered as a giant leap for the economy especially in the agriculture and irrigation sectors.
This is undoubtedly a fulfillment of a long felt need of the people, who have been affected by scarcity of water in the Dry Zone, President Sirisena said.
The Moragahakanda Reservoir consists of five spill gates which open automatically when the water level reaches the 185.5 metre level from the sea level.
The water released from the giant Moragahakanda Reservoir feeds hundreds of major and minor tanks in the Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee and Matale districts and Giritale, Minneriya, Kawudulla and Parakrama Samudraya tanks. Besides, water will be utilised to end the agriculture and industrial water scarcity of the Madirigiriya area.
The Moragahakanda-Kaluganga Development Project which is a major component of the Mahaweli Master Plan has been progressing steadily and is to improve irrigation facilities to existing water scarce farmlands (82,000ha) and most importantly open up new land (5000ha) for agriculture development in the Northern, North Central, Eastern and North Western Provinces.
The Project will generate 25MW of hydro-power to the National Grid. Increasing inland fish production, provision of domestic and industrial water requirements, Eco tourism and effective flood control are the other targets of the project, Coordinating Officer of Moragahakanda project P.G. Dayananda said.
It is estimated that the total project cost can be regained within three years once the project is completed. The Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Reservoirs, which utilise water from the Amban Ganga as the feeder river, is ready to open a new chapter in the countrys agriculture sector, Dayananda added.
Meanwhile, the construction of the Kalu Ganga irrigation project, which comes under the mega Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Irrigation Development Scheme, is nearing completion by now. Residential Engineer of Kaluganga Development Project Hemantha Dedigama said that 90 per cent of construction work of the project has already been completed and it has been planned to hand over the project to the government by December 25. But it will take a few months for the entire project to be completed, Dedigama said. The Kalu Ganga irrigation project consists of two dams, including a Main Dam and a Saddle Dam. The construction of the both dams has already been completed.
Accordingly, 90 per cent of the construction of the entire project has been completed, Dedigama said.
The water filling has commenced and it is estimated that the reservoir would be completely filled by January 2019, he said. The water capacity of the Kalu Ganga Reservoir is 248 million cubic metres and of the capacity 8 per cent (20 million cubic meters) has already been filled. The reservoir will be filled up to 218 meters from sea level and the water level at present is 170 meters from sea level, he said.

PMs lawyers raise preliminary objections
Quo Warranto case  put off for Monday
The Court of Appeal yesterday commenced hearing into the writ petition filed by United National Party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and 121 other Parliamentarians.
They sought an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that Mahinda Rajapaksa is not entitled to hold the office of Prime Minister and the matter was fixed for further support on Monday (December 3).
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal President, Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, the Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and other respondent parties raised preliminary objections against the writ petition. They moved Court of Appeal that the petition be dismissed in limine.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Counsel Navin Marapana appearing on behalf of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa informed that Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear this case until the Supreme Court makes a determination regarding several Fundamental Rights petitions regarding the dissolution of Parliament.
He further submitted to Court, Parliamentary proceedings including the No Confidence Motion were commenced at the time several FR petitions are being heard before the Supreme Court. What will happen if the Supreme Court determined the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament was valid. If it happened, all Parliament proceedings up to now would be null and void,Presidents Counsel Marapana observed.
In reply, Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran and Counsel Suren Fernando appearing for UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the petition before this court is nothing to do with dissolution of Parliament. They contended that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to issue an order in the nature of Quo Warranto in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court will look into the matter relating to the dissolution of Parliament. The resolution for the No Confidence Motion was passed in a duly summoned Parliament, Presidents Counsel Kanag-iswaran added.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Minister Udaya Gammanpila informed Court that the Court of Appeal does not have the jurisdiction to hear this matter since it relates with the Parliamentary affairs. He further argued that this application cannot be maintained since the President and the Speaker have not been made as parties.
The Speaker never said motion for the No Confidence Motion was carried. What transpired in Parliament can be examined through the video footage officially released by Parliament website. A Quo Warranto cannot be issued based on the uncorrected version of Parliament proceedings (Hansard reports).
Silva further stated that the court has to consider the consequences of an Interim Order prior to grant it as requested by petitioners. If court issues an Interim Order, country would be in anarchy. There will be no Prime Minister or Cabinet of Ministers to govern the country, Silva added.
Meanwhile, Gamini Marapana PC further submitted to court that there is no ex-facia No Confidence Motion duly passed in Parliament since it was passed using voice vote while standing orders being suspended. Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena and Manohara de Silva PC were also made their oral submissions against the writ petition.
In this petition, the petitioners further sought an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that 49 respondents including the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the incumbent government are not entitled to hold the office of ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
The petitioners, the Members of Parliamentarians representing the United National Party, Tamil National Alliance, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and several other parties filed this petition naming 49 persons including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, members of cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers as respondents.
The petitioners stated that on November 14, 2018, Parliament passed a vote of no-confidence against the purported government of the Respondents. They further stated that on November 16, Parliament passed another Vote of No-Confidence against the Government. They maintained that in terms of Article 48 of the Constitution, the Cabinet stood dissolved from November 14, 2018.

Sajith confident President will protect Constitution
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa yesterday expressed confidence that President Maithripala Sirisena will be flexible in his stance in order to protect the Constitution and democracy in the country.
Premadasa pointed out that President Sirisena who was earlier adamant in proroguing Parliament until the UPFA proves its majority, later stated that he shall not prorogue Parliament.
In answer to a question on President Sirisenas refusal to re-appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister, Premadasa pointed out that Many of the Pohottuwa supporters requested the President to keep proroguing Parliament but President Sirisena flatly refused it.
I believe, given the situation, it was an excellent decision.
I firmly believe that President would change his stance with regards to some other statements he has made as well, Premadasa said.
Premadasa urged the UPFA to step down and let the party that commands the majority of the House take over the Government to end the Constitutional crisis.
He also said that Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa and Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thero too expressed the importance of allowing the majority to form a government. Addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary complex yesterday, Premadasa questioned if the UPFA MPs have no shame to claim that they are the ruling party when they have already been defeated five times in the House as at yesterday.
They dont have at least 85 lawmakers to support them in Parliament. With todays motion, it is time they face the reality and step down to make room for the Constitution to take its course, said Premadasa.
Premadasa also requested the government servants to consider the present situation and act according to the Constitution without bowing down to the purported government.
Asked if three names were suggested in the UNP group meetings as possible persons to hold the Prime Minister portfolio, Premadasa denied it. Who said about three people There is no such thing as that.
There is only one name and that is what we are proposing. That is Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was and is the democratically elected Prime Minister, he said.
Speaking on the recent statement by UNP MP Harin Fernando in relation to the same matter, Premadasa pointed out that Fernando was not talking about the present situation. He was talking about a General Election. He was not referring to the present situation that we are in. The UNP will decide who would be our next candidate at a General Election when the time comes, he furthered.

World AIDS Day 2018, get tested now:
SHAPING A HEALTHY FUTURE
The College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka is the professional association of the Public Health Practitioners in Sri Lanka. The membership consists of specialists in Community Medicine and is the leading body in the country that provides advocacy and promote policy formulation to address public health issues in the country, through liaising with health systems, lawmakers, non-governmental organisations and community based / multisectoral organisations while influencing them to promote and adopt better practices in public health.
They work closely with the media to sensitize them on reportage of public health issues and work as ambassadors to uplift the health in the communities to reach to a global standard. Every year, with the induction of a new president and new council members, they operate on a different theme every year. The theme of the current year of the college is, Shaping a Healthy Future: Youth as a Smart Investment.
This year on World AIDS Day that falls today, December 1, the College together with The National STD/AIDS Control Programme of Sri Lanka has launched many programmes in keeping with the theme Test and treat today, know your status.
This year marks the 30th year of HIV/AIDS day in the world and we commemorate this time those who have lost their life to the illness in the past and also to encourage all to prevent HIV contraction and for those who suspect they may be at risk of it to get tested early and start treatment, explains Dr. Janaki Vidanapathirana, Consultant Community Physician attached to the National HIV/AIDS Programme in Sri Lanka as well as being the current President of the College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka.
HIV infected persons
Ending HIV/AIDS by 2030 is an integral part of the sustainable development goals that were unanimously adopted by the UN member states in 2015. Towards achieving this objective the UN has set up a fast track approach over the next five years. But here in Sri Lanka we have in fact advanced our target to end HIV in five years to 2025 over the UN target says Dr. Vidanapathirana.
In keeping with international indicators, by 2020, we hope to identify 90% of HIV infected persons, out of this 90% we plan to have 90% on treatment and from those to achieve a reduction of the viral dose by 90%.
She further stresses that since a person who gets infected with HIV could live up to 8 to 9 years without any symptoms, it is important to get tested early and be on treatment to suppress the virus rather than waiting for symptoms to appear as once that happens it would depend how the bodys immune system would react to treatment.
It has been almost 35 years since the world was introduced to the term AIDS. In the 1980s, researchers and physicians were trying to understand what was causing waves of strange infections and discovered it was a new virus called the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Since that time, HIV has gone from an end of life situation to a manageable chronic disease thanks to treatment advances such as antiretroviral treatment.
Currently our estimated number of HIV patients is 3,600 and since 1987 our cumulative reported number since 1987 is 3018. Currently we see a pattern that of our number of reported new infections increasing while the estimated number being decreasing. The reported number is being increased mainly because we do more testing now, explains Dr. Vidanapathirana.
She goes on to explain that up until 2010 the world recognized mainly the traditional methods of prevention such as being faithful to your partner, using a condom and avoiding risky behaviours. While these still remain standard, it is time to identify new methods to identify new patients in order to start early treatment. Several key populations have been identified worldwide as being high at risk for HIV. These are men who have sex with men (MSM), drug users, sex workers, transgender population and prisoners.
Preventive programmes
Currently we do many preventive programmes in the prisoner population through the government sector and the other sectors in partnerships with nongovernmental organisations that work at grass root level because they have more access to these populations says Dr. Vidanapathirana.
There are some restrictive factors in reaching key vulnerable populations such as LGBT rights in Sri Lanka. This involves Section 365 and 365A that are sections of the Penal Code which describe LGBT behaviour as unnatural offences and acts of gross indecency. It states that the act should be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10 years and not exceeding twenty years with a fine and compensation. As at 2018 the country has not convicted anyone under those provisions since 1948, but this prevents those people who want services to access them due to fear and stigma.
Even after testing and if they become positive and if they do not disclose the truth about themselves they will not get correct counselling, explains Dr. Vidanapathirana.
Section 399 of the penal code criminalizes gender impersonation and is often used against transgendered people. It is possible to use this if a person has converted to another gender yet bears a different gender on their documentation.
On the prevention of Sri Lanka, a big success story is the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV. Since last year Sri Lanka initiated universal screening of every pregnant mother.
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV was introduced in Sri Lanka in early 2002 with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-positive pregnant women. Initially only a low percentage of pregnant women were screened for HIV though a wide spread awareness programme was carried out. Being a low prevalence country, the need for universal antenatal screening was difficult to be advocated to policymakers amidst competing health priorities. Further, voluntary screening for HIV in a low prevalent country was also difficult to be marketed as a successful intervention.
In this background, advocacy to introduce universal antenatal screening for HIV was restarted by the National STD and AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) and the Family Health Bureau of Ministry of Health together with UN Agencies such as WHO, UNICEF etc., The Ministry of Health initiated the universal antenatal screening for HIV as a national policy in 2013. As there was a high coverage for syphilis screening, it was decided to increase the sample of blood collected to 5 cc and to do both syphilis and HIV tests from the same sample.
But now, we plan to eliminate mother to child transmission of HIV and Syphilis by January, says Dr. Vidanapathirana. We have already achieved it but we have to receive the WHO certification after they consider all the factors which will be in January.

Shocking! Dismissed Australian player replaced umpire
In 1885 during an Ashes match being played between Australia and England a dismissed player from the same match replaced an umpire while the Test was still underway.
The incident that took place on 24 March, 1885 was a bizzare story in the history of cricket.
George Hodges the debutant umpire turned down every appeal by the English bowler in favour of Australian batsmen Jones and Horan.
Then it happened: irritated by the continuous appeal, Hodges refused to take field after tea. Since there was no deputy umpire, Australian batsman Garrett, who had already been back in the pavilion, walked out with Jim Philips to officiate for the rest of the Test.
What followed after the match was George Hodges never umpired in Test cricket again, Australia did not regain the Ashes till 1891-92 and Horan never played a Test after the series.  catchnews

Speaker carries out UNPs agenda - SB
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is acting in an adamant manner with the intention of being named as the Common Candidate at the next Presidential election, Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Addressing a media briefing in the Parliamentary complex yesterday, he said the Speaker is acting in a stubborn manner and conducting Parliamentary business together with the TNA, JVP, SLMC and several other UNF factions for the satisfaction of the UNP.
What will happen if the Supreme Court determined the Presidents decision to dissolve Parliament was valid. If it happened, all Parliament proceedings up to now would be null and void,Presidents Counsel Marapana observed.
In reply, Presidents Counsel K. Kanag-iswaran and Counsel Suren Fernando appearing for UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the petition before this court is nothing to do with dissolution of Parliament. They contended that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to issue an order in the nature of Quo Warranto in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court will look into the matter relating to the dissolution of Parliament. The resolution for the No Confidence Motion was passed in a duly summoned Parliament, Presidents Counsel Kanag-iswaran added.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Minister Udaya Gammanpila informed Court that the Court of Appeal does not have the jurisdiction to hear this matter since it relates with the Parliamentary affairs. He further argued that this application cannot be maintained since the President and the Speaker have not been made as parties.
The Speaker never said motion for the No Confidence Motion was carried. What transpired in Parliament can be examined through the video footage officially released by Parliament website. A Quo Warranto cannot be issued based on the uncorrected version of Parliament proceedings (Hansard reports).
Silva further stated that the court has to consider the consequences of an Interim Order prior to grant it as requested by petitioners. If court issues an Interim Order, country would be in anarchy. There will be no Prime Minister or Cabinet of Ministers to govern the country, Silva added.
Meanwhile, Gamini Marapana PC further submitted to court that there is no ex-facia No Confidence Motion duly passed in Parliament since it was passed using voice vote while standing orders being suspended.
Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena and Manohara de Silva PC were also made their oral submissions against the writ petition.
In this petition, the petitioners further sought an order in the nature of Quo Warranto declaring that 49 respondents including the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the incumbent government are not entitled to hold the office of ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
The petitioners, the Members of Parliamentarians representing the United National Party, Tamil National Alliance, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and several other parties filed this petition naming 49 persons including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, members of cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers as respondents.
The petitioners stated that on November 14, 2018, Parliament passed a vote of no-confidence against the purported government of the Respondents. They further stated that on November 16, Parliament passed another Vote of No-Confidence against the Government. They maintained that in terms of Article 48 of the Constitution, the Cabinet stood dissolved from November 14, 2018.
Even the proposal to cut the expenditure of the Prime Minister can only be brought to Parliament through an act and this too can only be done by a Minister after having it passed by the Cabinet. So what is the Speaker doing We told the Speaker to seek advice from the Attorney General, but instead he gets his advice from the Sirikotha lawyers, Dissanayake said.
He said that recently a senioer UNPer had told MP Ananda Aluthgamage that the next Common Candidate for the Presidency would be Karu Jayasuriya and then they could work well under him. There is currently a poster campaign in this regard as well. Hence, his actions today are clearly biased and in favour of the UNP towards realising his own agenda, noted S.B.Dissanayake.
According to Dissanayake, having realised that it was impossible for the President to carry out his duties and serve the nation with the UNP and with the SLFP faction leaving the Unity Government, the President had to take a courageous decision, which he did.
Once the SLFP group left the Unity Government, it automatically ceased to exist and so did the Prime Minister. Then there was a vacancy and the President then appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister whom the President felt has the Parliamentary majority and the majority support of the people. Thereafter, once the President had established the government, what the Speaker had to do was to accept the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House appointed by the Prime Minister and establish a Selection Committee, which would meet and then establish the Parliamentary Business committee. They would meet and discuss the agenda given by the Leader of the House and convene Parliament. This is the Speakers duty, Dissanayake said.
He pointed out that when Ranil Wickremesinghe came to Parliament with 51 members we had 150 members in the Opposition.
The Speaker at the time was Chamal Rajapaksa and he never asked Wickremesinghe for a show of majority. He accepted his appointment and carried on with his duties without any fuss. Hence, this whole issue was muddled right from the start by none other than Speaker Karunaratne Jayasuriya by his high handed actions, Dissanayake said.
Hence, he said that they are waiting for the court decision and if it permits an election and in an election, Rauff Hakeems seven seats would drop to three, Rishad Bathiudeens five would become two, Mano Ganesan would not win a single seat, Digambarams four seats would become one, TNAs 1 would drop to 13 and those three seats would go to Douglas Devananda. Hence, if we go in for an election, we would easily be able to make up 130 and form a strong government.
On the other hand if the court decides otherwise, we ask the Speaker to form a government legitimately, said S.B.Dissanayake.

Parliament is now similar to the headquarters of the United National Party, said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was addressing the gathering at the launch of Apiwawali Apikanne programme at Padawgama in Lunugamwehera and Berelihela.
The minister said the ruling party arrived at a decision to boycott Parliament from last Friday due to the bias attitude of the Speaker.
The Speaker has become the cats paw of the United National Party. It was the first time in history that a Speaker entered Parliament by being escorted by police and acted in violation of Parliamentary norms.
He said they are now struggling to save Sri Lankans from being sold out to foreigners and to safeguard the democratic rights of the people.
The minister said the Speaker would soon have to face the music for his unconstitutional activities. The Speaker had acted against the interests of the Presidents privileges and the prerogatives of the Executive to forge the country forward. He said none of the previous Speakers arbitrarily challenged the decisions of the Executive and that they did not have the same powers as the Executive as the present Speaker, the minister said.

Evolution of cricket:
Is T10 the right kind of innovation that the sport needs
Every tiny thing in the universe undergoes an evolution over a period of time. Cricket is not an exception to this natural change. Test matches, the root of the game, have undergone several changes over the years.
Earlier, timeless Tests were the norm in the sport. Then, the teams started playing Test matches within a certain amount of days. Later on, the Test match was universally adjusted as a 5-day format.
Besides, a new limited-overs format named One Day International (ODI) was born in 1971. Just like the number of days in the Test format, the number of overs in the ODI format was varied in the earlier stages. From the 1987 ICC World Cup onwards, the format was fixed as 50 overs per team.
In 2003, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) introduced yet another new format to the cricketing world  Twenty20 (T20). Slowly, the fans started to love the concept of T20, and the attendance figures increased gradually.
Then, the birth of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 completely changed the entire cricketing landscape.
With the sudden boom of T20, Test cricket, the games purest format, has slowly started to decline over the years. So to bring back the audience to the games oldest format, the organizers tweaked the traditional 5-day format with a 5-day/night format.
So far, the day/night Test matches have yielded positive feedback. Even a 4-day/night Test match was played between South Africa and Zimbabwe in 2017.
Though the number of fans watching T20 is comparatively very high, Test cricket is still followed by a considerable amount of loyal fans. The audience count for ODI lies somewhere between the count of T20 and Tests.
Shorter the format, the better
With each format having a specific set of rules and a separate group of audiences, the quality of cricket has never been degraded. However, the recent inception of yet another new format, called the T10 League, seems a little dodgy.
On one side, a team (Rajputs) chased down a target of 95 runs in just 24 balls with a batsman (Mohammad Shahzad) smashing 74 of them in 16 deliveries. On the other side, a team (Northern Warriors) scored a mammoth 183 runs in their 10 overs for the loss of two wickets. More importantly though, the efforts from the fielding sides seem to be seriously lacking, with a number of dropped catches and missed stumpings helping the batsmen even further.
High scoring
These kinds of high scoring matches can be a treat to the crowd gathered in the stadium.
However, think from a bowler's perspective for a moment. The way in which the batsmen in the league are swinging their bats (without even properly watching the ball) looks a little ridiculous - especially since the bowlers and fielders don't seem bothered about the runs they are leaking.
The number of boundaries scored in these games will boggle the minds of traditional cricket fans. But that kind of reckless batting has often lead to tame dismissals. In general, the quality of cricket displayed on the field sans the boundary count is rather poor.
Just for the sake of money, the organizers seem to have framed a brand new format without putting in the right kind of planning and thought into it. If this trend continues, then the day is not far away when the bowlers will be replaced by bowling machines.
The question also needs to be asked the T10 format will eventually replaced by a 5-over format. Ultimately, will the toss be used to determine the winner
Instead of investing money in an ill-planned format, the organizers can try to look for ways to promote the game in countries like USA and China.
This exploration into new markets will at least help the game attract new audiences and increase the financial market size. - sk

17-member Test squad selected for New Zealand:
Thirimanne, Samarawickrama recalled; Dimuth made vice-captain
Sri Lankas new selection committee headed by former fast bowler Ashantha de Mel recalled discarded batsmen Lahiru Thirimanne and Sadeera Samarawickrama and appointed Dimuth Karunaratne as vice-captain in a new move to groom a captain for the future when the 17-member Test squad was picked for the two-Test series in New Zealand.
We first selected 15 members and then we took two other additional players which the coach wanted. We looked at his request and we thought from our batting side especially with seven Test matches and 9 ODIs altogether in three consecutive series against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa we need to strengthen the batting, said De Mel.
Most of the time we are not scoring runs, even in the Test matches they are getting bowled out for less than 250. We need to bolster the batting in the Tests. We selected these batsmen looking at all these three tours. Altogether we have picked 10 batsmen, he said.
Normally we take only 15 but this time we are taking two extra players with additional cost to Sri Lanka Cricket. This is done for the betterment of our cricket. They are not going on joy rides.
On the selection of Thirimanne and Samarawickrema, De Mel said, Thirimanne is a player who has played well on bouncy pitches in New Zealand and Australia if you take his record. He has been playing well in the super series and his average is 95. He is a good player, the potential is there but for some reason he has not been performing. Sadeera is someone whom they have been trying out and in the last ODI against England he put on a century partnership for the first wicket. We thought we send these two batsmen because after the New Zealand series these boys will be able to do some work in Melbourne. We need some sort of back up in the batting slots of opener and nos. 3 and 4. If someone gets injured its very difficult to take one person from here because they wont be ready to play as they are not got used to the conditions.
On recent tours Sri Lanka had done away with appointing a vice-captain but De Mel is of the view that its an important position. We have to groom some captain. We feel that Dimuth is the right choice. He is already captaining SSC in the Premier league. He is a thinking cricketer he is someone who is thinking and who can make decisions. Going forward we need somebody like that, said De Mel.
Karunaratne will open the batting with Danushka Gunathilaka while the wicket-keeping duties will be shared by Niroshan Dickwella and Dinesh Chandimal who returns to lead the team after missing out the second and third Tests against England with a torn groin.
Fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Lahiru Kumara have also been recalled. Pradeep returns after 14 months having struggled with injuries and Kumara after suspension on disciplinary grounds that saw him miss the recently concluded three-Test series against England.
Sri Lanka play New Zealand in the first Test at Wellington from December 15-19 and the second at Christchurch from December 26-30.

Protesters disturb alms-giving at Lake House
UNF government acted against peoples wishes - Nayake Thera
The annual alms-giving ceremony held to commemorate the founder of Lake House D.R.Wijewardene, was disturbed yesterday morning by an agitation campaign held in front of its entrance by a couple of dozen people who called themselves activists from an organization called the Media Front for Democracy.
They shouted slogans of protest against the media institution while members of the Maha Sangha were chanting pirith in the boardroom.
The ceremony was held amidst this disturbance with the Maha Sangha invoking blessings on Lake House, its Founder late D.R.Wijewardene, the Chairman, the Board,the management and the staff.
The Sangha Nayaka of Frances Buddhist mission, Ven.Murungagasyaye Gnanissara Thera, told the participants of the alms ceremony, that Sri Lankans living in France have experienced and understood, better than those who are living in this country, the results of the previous governments abominable and nefarious actions during its three years of rule.
Ven.Gnansissara Nayaka Thera said the people have become indisposed to the previous governments nefarious commands cashiered by force and fraud and have decided to support Mahinda Rajapaksa because they have had enough of its abuse.
The majority of journalists have found the culture of that government repulsive.The rulers of that government were selling the countrys national assets. They put up the country, its culture, heritage and its values for auction, the Thera said.
If they ever said that they were not selling any national assets, that is exactly when they were actually doing it. They were lying through their teeth right from the beginning, he said.
They have inflicted much damage and disrepute on the Maha Sangha in the last three years. The members of the Maha Sangha are taking a breather only now, he said.
Ven.Gnanissara Nayaka Thera said Lake House as a media institute that has stood its grounds for over a century has a duty to act with responsibility to ensure that it will contribute to the pacification of the current situation in the country.
This institution must lead the way to protect the nation, the country and its welfare, he said.
A residential monk of Fort Sambuddhaloka Vihara and Colombo District Pirivena Education Director Ven. Vitharandeniye Medhananda Thera said here inasmuch as the people of this country, they too, as the members of the Maha Sangha had to undergo difficulties under the previous government.
The previous government was not at all people friendly. Now that it has been put away with a new government, the people have new expectations. he said.
He said the current unrest in the country can be solved through a General Election. We offer our blessings for an election that should bring peace, Medhananda thera said.
Lake House Editorial Director Dinesh Dodangoda and ANCL Legal Director Rasanga Harischandra participated.
The ceremony was organised by the Lake House Welfare Division and SLPP trade union members.

Ven. Dambara Amila Thera in gas company payroll - MP D.V.Chanaka
MP D.V. Chanaka alleged that a monthly payment of Rs. 95,000 was paid to Ven. Dambara Amila Thera by a leading Gas company during the past three years. He said all court cases filed against then Joint Opposition (now Government) members are still going on without any interruption.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Quarters at Battaramulla yesterday, he said that Buddhist monks usually do not take money for preaching Bana and chanting Pirith.
Therefore, may be the money that was allegedly paid was for slinging mud on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and to promote the new Constitution which divides the country into nine pieces. These type of persons destroy the respect that the people have for religious leaders, Chanaka said.
According to the MP, the company had allegedly paid the monthly salaries for another 38 persons and if they are not in the list, Ratnaptiya, Uyangoda, Prof. Wijesuriya etc should announce it to the public and get their names cleared.
Corrupt persons are campaigning against the holding of elections because their corrupt activities would be revealed to the country, he said.
MP Chanaka pointed out that on November 15 this year Bribery and Corruption Commission Deputy Director General Sunethra Jayasinghe had sent a letter to the Finance and Media Ministry querying about Rs.27 million in payments allegedly made to a group of people including Samanali Fonseka, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya and Gamini Viyangoda during past three years for certain items etc. In her letter she says the payments are not tally with the real market prices of those items etc. What the JVP states about court cases is not true and all court cases are proceeding without any interruption, he said. MP Chanaka accused UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa of building shanties in the name of houses and only Rs. 8 million was spent on 20 houses.
But, Rs. 20 million was spent for publicity and Rs.800,000 for three name boards which could have been used to build another three houses, Chanaka alleged. In then past, the Joint Opposition revealed about acts of corruption and malpractices with concrete evidence and by making formal complaints to the Bribery and Corruption Commission, But even a statement had not been recorded so far. Three and half years passed since the complaints were made. The UNP had allegedly paid over Rs.20 million as rent for some buildings while having state buildings that can be used. But everything will be revealed to the country in a proper way with evidence. One of the master minds of the Central Bank Bond scam is still free and another stays inside Temple Trees without any problems, MP Chanaka said. MP Kanchana Wijesekera said allegations have been made that the Media Ministry had made payments to Samanali Fonseka, Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya and Gamini Viyangoda and 38 others.The Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna Youth League said the Bribery Commission has queried from the Ministry about this questionable payment and called for clarifications. Wijesekera said the Media Ministry had made payments to a number of persons for variety of services rendered by them, during the past three and half years and the Bribery Commission was in a quandary about those payments.

We are disciplined by the Buddhas teachings who enlightened us on respecting human beings.Hence western countries need not to teach us about human rights, the President said.
The function was organised by the Kelaniya University under the guidance of Prof.Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa to commemorate the 200th year of the 1818 Uva Wellassa Riot which happened during the British rule.
The President said some of the unfortunate incidents which happened during the Colonial rule are repeatedly happening today and political leaders similar to John Doyly are acting in the same manner to steer the country into a great disaster by joining hands with Western countries.
The President further told that the Sinhalese are born to fight in unfair situations by nature and that attitude is in their genes.Therefore he said ancestors of Sri Lanka who had shed their blood during the Uva Wellassa Riot had done yeoman service to the country.
The violation of the 1815 Kandyan Convention by British Imperialists was the basis for this struggle of liberation. Bringing the first struggle for freedom from 1817-1818 under control in a barbaric manner and the punishments given to Sinhalese leaders can be identified as a painful result of that struggle, the President said. He said some countries who are pontificating on human rights had violated human rights in a blatant manner when they were ruling Sri Lanka during the Colonial period.
A book on the Uva Wellassa Riot compiled by the Kelaniya University was presented to the President by Prof. Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa. A special commemoration stamp on the 1815 Uva Wellassa Riot was presented to the President as well.
Replicas of the swords used by the Weera Keppettipola Dissawe was presented to descendants of the rebels of the 1815 riot at the event.
