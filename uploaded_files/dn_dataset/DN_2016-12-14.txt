SA names  Invitation XI against Sri Lanka

CAPE TOWN: Omphile Ramela will lead the South African Invitation XI in the three-day tour match against Sri Lanka to be played at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom from December 18 to 20.
A left-hander with the temperament of a scholar Ramela is unusual for a South African cricketer in all the right ways. He is one of a handful of black African batsmen to make their name in the longer format and one of a select group of professional players with a degree behind his name. Ramela, who also speaks five different languages, was studying towards a Masters in Economics while captaining the Cobras.
The match comes two days after the T20 Challenge final and before the Sunfoil Series resumes in January, assuring there is no clash with franchise cricket.
We see this match as a wonderful opportunity to see what some of our younger players, who have shown good form in franchise cricket this season, can do against quality opposition, commented Cricket South Africa (CSA) selection convener Linda Zondi.
This is a good chance for these players to show what they can do at the next level.
We have also included a number of provincial players who stood out in the Africa T20 Cup or for the SA academy team.
It is important that these younger players have some experience to feed off and this will be provided by the likes of Ramela and Dane Piedt.

Ability to beat the field key to playing spin  in subcontinent

Australia and England the two oldest Test playing countries in the world has shown by their recent performances over the past five months that they are eon years behind mastering spin in the subcontinent.
Australia suffered a rare 0-3 whitewash in Sri Lanka in August and England after a disappointing 1-all draw in Bangladesh where they were expected to fare a lot better by winning the series have clearly demonstrated their incapability to counter spin by conceding the ongoing five-match Test series to India 0-3 with one Test to play.
While Australias strong batting was dismantled by the left-arm spin of Rangana Herath who finished the three-match series with a handsome haul of 28 wickets at an astonishing average of 12.75, Englands batting in India has run into trouble against off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin who has so far scalped 27 wickets at 23.70. In Bangladesh the England batting was undone by rookie off-spinner Mehedi Hasan who captured 19 wickets (avg. 15.63) in the two Tests.
Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen wrote prior to departure that Englands winter in India will be decided by which team plays spin best. As it has turned out to be Virat Kohlis men have proved far superior to Alastair Cooks troopers.
India will want nothing less than a 5-0 whitewash against England this winter so they will be watching closely how they perform against Bangladesh over the next two Test matches, wrote Pietersen.
If England draw this series 1-1, or the batsmen struggle and the spinners are whacked, then everyone in India will be laughing at them and they will immediately find themselves under pressure when they arrive there.
Prophetic words for exactly thats whats happened. India will be deprived of a 5-0 whitewash after England drew the first Test at Rajkot with their best performance in the series coming within three wickets of pulling off a win. If that had happened one wonders how the rest of the series would have panned out. India came back strongly to win the next three Tests and pocket the series with one to play.
The controversial Pietersen one of the few good players of spin in the England team wrote: Playing spin in the sub-continent is all about picking length and understanding where you can score. You have to be able to rotate strike and play with the field. At all times you must have boundary options. As soon as you have boundary options, you can hit the ball hard and that opens up a gap for you to be able to manipulate the field.
It is no good being able to just block all day because a ball will bounce and turn that gets you out. If you do not have boundary options, and cant hit over the top or slog sweep for four, then it limits your areas for scoring and rotating the strike. If you do not rotate the strike then you die a slow death on the sub-continent.
Look at the great players down the years. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and now Kohli. Like his predecessors he has four or five boundary options which makes the opposition bowler think goodness me where do I bowl. If the captain puts boundary riders back for the sweep or pushes back long on it gives him 360 degrees around the field to take the single and rotate the strike. Once Kohli does that he has won half the battle. Once you have control over the field you just need to bat sensibly.
The mental challenge of batting in the sub-continent is understanding your game plan and sticking to it. It is not a case of worrying about who is around the bat or what fielding positions they are setting for you. Just stick with your game plan. It is crucial not to worry about the opponents. In Australia and South Africa where there is true bounce and carry you can concentrate on the bowler and what he might do next. But in the sub continent you must focus on your job of scoring, having boundary options and getting off strike. There is no point thinking about short leg, or if there is a catcher here or there. You have to concentrate on your ability to beat the field.
Pietersen is one of the few England batsmen to excel against spin in the subcontinent having scored a Test century in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka  he was dismissed for 99 in Bangladesh.
Who can forget his memorable knock of 151 against Sri Lanka at the P Sara Oval in 2012 that paved the way for Englands series equaling win in the two-Test series. Pietersen battled against the spin of Rangana Herath (6/133), Suraj Randiv and Tillakaratne Dilshan.
Going by how the Indian spinners have dominated the England batting in the series and the way Australia floundered against Herath in Sri Lanka, India will be licking their fingers for another successful home series against Australia when they tour there in February-March for four Tests.

RTC Christmas Races conclude on a high

The sleepy little town of Nuwara Eliya began their Christmas celebrations on December 11 with a gala party at the Race Course - the home of Royal Turf Club.
For the sports buff there were a total of seven races with the feature being the Christmas Gold Cup for horses in the highest class. The bonus was the chance to watch a talented young lady named Rupa who was flown in from India to ride against the boys. Shes a Chennai based professional jockey who has been doing remarkably well in a profession that is dominated by men. For children the interaction with Santa Claus dishing out presents must surely have been the highlight, while for those seeking high fashion, the Deepthika Jayakody selection quenched the fashion thirst with models sashaying down the ramp.
Flying into grace the occasion was the Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara who regale the appreciative audience with two superbly sung songs.
The Yuletide decor simply took your breath away as the Race Course wore a beautiful festive look. But the Christmas spirit at RTC was not just a cosmetic. It went much deeper, touching the very essence and the core of what this festival is all about. Its about giving, and here leading owners Mr. And Mrs. Edwards committed to the cause by donating the entire prize money earned by them on the day to the Cancer Society. Their horses ran their hearts out for this generous and gracious cause and won three races for the red and green sash silks of the Edwards family. RTC joined in by hosting a Christmas meal for their entire staff and their families.
The racing through the day was dominated by Trainer S.P.A. Raju who saddled a lucrative quadruple. He started it off with Captain Haddock (Admiral Of The Fleet ex Beladee) who made every post a winning one under jockey Mahesh to win the German Embassy Advent Cup. Gazaki (Burden of Proof ex Acer) then waltzed away with the Sports Ministry Cup. He was ridden by the Indian pro Aneel who went on from there to reel off a superb hat-rick thus cornering the riding honours for the day.
The Christmas Gold Cup was won by the Deepthika Jayakody owned mare Alcazaba (Burden of Proof ex Alambrah) who improved gradually from the rear to take over the running at the top of the straight and then win in style.
Corrine Almeida kept the crowds on their feet with her superb vocals.
There was something there for everyone and even the Weather Gods blew the rain and clouds away and the Sun peeked out to provide the perfect setting.
Winners of the RTC Christmas Gold Cap: ALCAZABA, owner Deepthika Jayakody, jokey Aneel and trainer S. P. A.

Ronaldos golden year  rewarded with  fourth Ballon dOr

PARIS, Tuesday : Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming a fourth Ballon dOr award on Monday after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.
Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelonas Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.
For me its a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, its a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. Im so happy, said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.
Its probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal.
Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I dont want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above.
The Ballon dOr, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon dOr, returned to France Football magazine this year.
A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.
France and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldos Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place.
Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazils Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.
Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though.
He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winners medal and lifted the European Championship trophy.
Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of Julys Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his countrys first major football title.
Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup.
It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon dOr, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results. - Agencies
