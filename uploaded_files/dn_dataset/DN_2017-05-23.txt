India should remove non-trade barriers on Sri Lankan products
India should remove non-tariff barriers on Sri Lankan imports and the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement between the two nations should be implemented in phases, said a top official of the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) of Sri Lanka.
President of NCE of Sri Lanka Ramal G. Jasinghe said Sri Lanka was open for joint ventures with Indian companies.
The two countries signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2000.
Lot of non-trade barriers is being imposed on Sri Lankan goods reaching the Indian shores. These barriers could be in the form of various charges, procedures, Jasinghe told visiting Indian journalists.
According to him, the procedures differ from port to port in India and the clearance of goods takes time affecting business.
The private sector chamber official also said if only the non-trade barriers were removed then bilateral trade between the two nations would increase further.
He said Sri Lankan companies are open for joint ventures with Indian companies investing in the island nation. Globally India is the largest trading partner of Sri Lanka. The trade between the two nations grew after the signing of the FTA.
According to Jasinghe, the proposed ETCA between India and Sri Lanka should not be implemented all in one go.
He added that the people of Sri Lanka should be made confident about the agreement and also about going global.
Around four rounds of negotiations on ETCA have got over between India and Sri Lanka. India is hoping to finalise the agreement by the end of 2017.

MGR supplied LTTE with money
Former prominent Liberation Tigers of Eelam (LTTE) leader Kumaran Pathmanathan revealed that former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR, supplied the terror outfit with money.
Pathmanathan, who was the chief international financier and helped smuggle weapons for the terror outfit, spoke to WION in an exclusive interview.
KP, as he was known, took over leadership of the LTTE following the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran and was wanted in India in connection with Rajiv Gandhis assassination. As KP revealed, it was Rajiv Gandhis mother Indira Gandhi, who asked RAW to aid the LTTE. In his heydays, KP was a reclusive, overseas financier for the LTTE based in Thailand and avoided capture by constantly changing addresses and aliases. He would later repent and become an orphanage father.
KP was the subject of a worldwide manhunt, with organisations including the CIA and MI-5 on his tail.
He is believed to possess crucial information about the LTTEs vast international assets. A former CBI inspector who took voluntary retirement in 1997 had alleged that the explosives used in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi were sent to Chennai from Singapore by KP.

19 dead, 50 injured after explosion at Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena

Nineteen people have been killed and more than 50 injured in a suspected terror attack at Manchester Arena.
The blast happened at 22:35 BST on Monday following a pop concert by the US singer Ariana Grande.
PM Theresa May said her thoughts were with those affected by "what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack".
Paramedics at the scene told the BBC they had treated some of the wounded for "shrapnel-like injuries".
North West Ambulance Service said it had taken 59 casualties from the explosion to hospitals and treated a number of walking wounded.
The prime minister has suspended Conservative Party general election campaigning and will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later, in response to the attack.
May said: "We are working to establish the full details" of what happened in Manchester.
"All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected," May said.
BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford said senior counter-terrorism officers were assembling in London and liaising with the Home Office.
Unconfirmed reports from two unnamed US officials suggested the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: "Terrible incident in Manchester. My thoughts are with all those affected and our brilliant emergency services."
Greater Manchester metro mayor Andy Burnham said: "My heart goes out to families who have lost loved ones, my admiration to our brave emergency services. A terrible night for our great city."
British Transport Police said the explosion was in the arena's foyer, which connects with Victoria train and tram station, a major hub on the northern edge of the city centre.
Shortly after the blast the station was closed and all trains cancelled.
Greater Manchester Police carried out a precautionary controlled explosion in the Cathedral Garden area of the city at about 01:32. The force confirmed it was not a suspicious item.
Grande - a 23-year-old American TV teen actress-turned-pop star - has a strong following among teenage girls and children.
It is believed the blast, which shook the building, centred on the area near the box office where concert merchandise is often sold.
The pop startweeted: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."
In the aftermath of the explosion witnesses spoke about the fear and confusion that gripped those caught up in the events.
Andy Holey, who had gone to the arena to pick up his wife and daughter who had been at the concert, said: "An explosion went off and it threw me about 30ft from one set of doors to the other set of doors.
"When I got up I saw bodies lying on the ground. My first thought was to go into the arena to try to find my family.
"I managed to find them eventually and they're OK.
"It was definitely an explosion and it was some force. It happened near the box office at the entrance to the arena."
Emma Johnson said she and her husband were at the arena to pick up her children, aged 15 and 17.
"It was definitely a bomb. It was definitely in the foyer," she told BBC Radio Manchester.
"We were stood at the top of the stairs and the glass exploded - it was near to where they were selling the merchandise.
"The whole building shook. There was a blast and then a flash of fire afterwards. There were bodies everywhere."
The police activity around the arena has been huge. There are blue flashing lights and cordons seemingly on almost every street corner.
A wide area around the venue itself has been completely taped off, and the crime scene appears to be widening, with police pushing people further and further back.
I've spoken to people who are shaken, scared and often tearful. One thing that's apparent is there are many, many young people, some of them with parents or guardians. One mother told me her priority was simply to get her daughters home.
Other people have been more candid and have described seeing people covered in blood, or being treated by paramedics. There's still a huge sense of confusion and people are constantly searching for information while letting their families know they're safe.

Boost for export crop cultivation
The unemployment problem cannot be solved by recruiting an excessive number of persons to government institutions. Instead, far more practical solutions need to be drawn up, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
Export crop growing must be carried out throughout the country to uplift the agricultural sector, by providing infrastructure facilities for villagers, said the minister.
He was addressing a ceremony to distribute pepper and arecanut plants to nearly 1,200 housewives at the Eheliyagoda National College auditorium, recently.
It was organized jointly by the Department of Agriculture and Ministry of Export Commodity under the Dhana Saviya concept.
A total of 36,000 pepper plants and 24,000 arecanut plants were distributed among 1,200 women in the Eheliyagoda electorate. Minister Gamage pointed out that a section of bankrupt politicians persuade people to hold demonstrations daily. The attempt to overturn 'Yahapalana Government' is futile, he added.
The Prime Minister, by appointing me as the Primary Industries Minister, encouraged me to develop the export crop sector. Under the plant distribution programme, it is hoped to expand pepper cultivations, he said.
Minister Gamage told participants to take part in this export crop drive to increase their income as well as the country's foreign exchange wealth.
Eheliyagoda UNP Chief Organizer and Provincial Councillors Siripala Kiriella, Samitha Atigalla and Nimal Wijenaike, Eheliyagoda DS Ranjani Dissanayake, Kiriella DS Predeepika Illuykkumbura and Eheliyagoda OIC Niroshan Dharmasena participated.

CA serves charge sheet on GMOA President
A charge sheet was served in open court on Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President, Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The charge sheet is for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance. The charge sheet that was originally filed by activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement, the petitioners.
It was served on Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya yesterday by a stenographer before Court of Appeal President Justice Rohini Walgama and Justice S. Thurairajah.
However, Dr. Padeniya through his lawyer informed Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the court stenographer.
Upul Jayasuriya PC with counsel Chithrananda Liyanage appearing for the petitioners submitted to Court that the GMOA has launched a trade union action and demonstration yesterday itself in a manner of undermining Courts authority.
Gamini Marapana PC with counsel Navin Marapana and Ravindranath Dabare appearing for the respondents informed Court that their client would raise preliminary objections against the charge sheet on the next inquiry date.Further inquiry into the matter fixed for August 2.
Court had issued an Interim Order(IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists Prof.Sarath Wijesuriya, the Convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of Court action naming GMOA President Dr.Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgment by Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticized the said judgment demanding to annulment or setting aside of the said judgment.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against SAITM following Court decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017 the GMOA had organised island wide trade union action against SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the Government to abolish SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the Court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under topic of Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the constitution.They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case.
They further urge to impose sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

Cabinet shake-up,  a scapegoat: JVP

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday questioned if the government had used its Cabinet reshuffle as a scapegoat to avoid taking responsibility for its failure to uphold and fulfill its pledge to have a corrupt-free government.
Communist and Marxist-Leninist Party Leader Anura Dissanayaka said: "It appears that the reshuffle has been made to give undue validation to the ministers of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) so that they may continue to hold fast to their incumbent ministries with additional subjects bestowed upon them by dint of the reshuffle.
The reshuffle has seen some ministers who deserved to be punished for their poor conduct of handling their ministries and various action of corruption being perked up to hold other ministries, he said.
He said Ministers S B .Dissanayaka and John Seneviratna who have been whining of late, have been comforted thought the Cabinet reshuffle by piecing up additional subjects to their ministries.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, due to his UPFA General Secretary position, has got his portfolio dressed up with another cut from the reshuffle, he said.
Thilak Marapana who had to leave his ministerial portfolio earlier for defending fraudulent company Avant Garde, has been brought back as a minister. He is the new minister for Development Assignments, he said.
We have many ministers on the subject of development, that is Minister Malik Samarawickrema for Strategic Development, Sarath Fonseka for Regional Development, Sagala Ratnayaka for Southern Development, John for Sabaragamuwa Development and S.B Dissanayaka for Kandian Heritage.
In spite of having a list of ministers for taking care of the countrys development, Marapana too receives a new development ministry, he said.
What remarkable development we should have under so many ministers he asked.
He said one has to ask oneself whether these ministerial portfolios keep rolling for their own development or the countrys development.
Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella who faced allegations of malpractices in connection with a number of projects and for appointing a large number of advisers and coordination secretaries to his ministry, is safe and sound.
So is Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya who faces allegations of corruption over coal deals, he said.
Minister Harrison, who let middlemen profit from paddy stock sales, Agriculture Minister Duminda who wastes Rs 24 million a month for a building are safe under the Cabinet reshuffle, he said.

Chinese arrivals will be Sri Lankas strongest inbound market over taking India in the future, said Chairman, Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Andrew Jones.
Speaking at the PATA conference, Jetwing Blue Hotel in Negombo, last week he said that overall Sri Lanka arrivals too would increase by 10.4 percent annually up to 2021. He said that one of the biggest problems facing the industry in the future would be to find young tourism professionals.
The Asia Pacific Region too would attract higher number of arrivals for the 2017-2021 periods and the region would pass the 3.7 million arrival mark by 2021, said Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Taleb Rifai. We expect 5 billion people to travel out by 2030, The Secretary-General envisaged.
He said that the proposed One Belt initiative mooted by China would also help to increased tourist arrivals in the region. Rifai said however that attracting 4.5 million tourist arrivals by 2020 by Sri Lanka Tourism may be a tall order.
The Secretary-General said that todays world was changing to digital technology and destination marketing tools should be focused in that direction. Today you dont need huge budgets for marketing. What you need today is innovative marketing tools powered by technology, he added.

Four percent of GDP will be spent on healthcare by 2020: Health Minister
"The government spends 1.6 percent of the GDP on health and it will be increased to 4 percent by 2020. This is a big challenge for a country that is rebuilding after a 30-year long war," Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the Commonwealth Health Ministers' Meeting being held in Geneva, Minister Dr. Senaratne had stated that the steps taken by the government helped the country bring down the maternal mortality from 1,694 per 100,000 live births in 1947 to just 34 in 2015.
"Infant mortality rate was 8.6 per 1,000 live births in 2014. Multiple interventions, both health and non-health, have contributed to this notable achievement. Recent WHO endorsement of malaria and filariasis free status is another positive development in the health sector," the Minister had stated.
"Sri Lanka had achieved much in healthcare by using resources efficiently and coordinating primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and placing well-qualified medical administrators to lead the sector," the Minister had pointed out,
Dr. Senaratne had stated that about 136,000 employees are serving in the health sector - including 17,000 doctors and 32,000 nurses. "Overall staffing per bed in secondary and tertiary hospitals is relatively low compared to many other countries, with a ratio of 1:4, indicating efficient use of available staff without compromising the quality of health care delivered," he had stated. "We are facing a demographic transition with a gradual increase in life expectancy of the population. We are witnessing a rise in non communicable diseases. To address this situation we provide free NCD screening to all at over 940 healthy lifestyle centres in the country, with accessibility to such centres within a radius of three km. I am to improve the quality and coverage of screening through government funding at little or no cost to the patients, the Minister had stated.
The Commonwealth Health Ministers Meeting were attended by Ministers and Senior Officials from nearly 40 Commonwealth countries. Minister Dr. Senaratne made the presentation on behalf of the Asian region on "Sustainable Financing of Universal Health Coverage as an essential Component for Global Security including the reduction of all forms of Violence".

"The government has ensured full freedom to stage protests but the people at large blame the government for inaction when the protests cause hindrance to their daily lives," Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said
He was addressing a meeting after launching the 'Wewak Samaga Gamak' development programme at Ethbatuwewa, Hambantota on May 20.
"The medical profession is so important it has no alternatives. I request members of the medical profession not to tarnish their image by demonstrating at every turn for minor issues that can be resolved through discussion and negotiation," he said. The Minister said the freedom given to demonstrate should not be construed as a weakness of the government. It signified the democratic nature of the government. "Unending demonstrations would only place people's freedom and interests in jeopardy," the Minister said.
"The biggest challenge we face today is to develop the country's economy. It is the duty and responsibility of the government as well as the aspiration of the people. When steps are taken to develop the country, people's support is needed to ensure the success of those steps. But the people's contention is that everything should be done by the government," the Minister said.
"The government is not akin to a company that runs according to profit and loss. Its duty is to formulate plans and implement them. Success of them will be ensured only if they are implemented with the intervention of the people," he said.
Minister Amaraweera said doctors were now launching strikes over the SAITM issue when the President had already provided an acceptable solution. "But the GMOA was rejecting everything and acting like Shylock demanding the whole pound of flesh," he said. "I would consider this as very unfair on their part. Trade unions too should try to be a little flexible without sticking to one firm standpoint," the Minister said.

Kaushal Rajapaksa plans  global recycling village in SL
His vision is to establish a global recycling village in Sri Lanka utilising state-of-the-art technology from around the world. The idea might seem farfetched to many, but for Indhra Kaushal Rajapaksa it is a very vivid dream that has slowly but surely become clearer and more attainable.
Rajapaksa, a product of Ananda College, qualified in Polymer Science Technology at the Katubedda Campus and obtained an MBA in Business Administration in the USA.
Kaushal Rajapaksa with wife Shirani
He is also a Fellow of the Plastic and Rubber Institute, of which he is currently the Vice President. He has experience working in all the major footwear exporting companies in the Katunayake Export Processing Zone.
Kaushal's father was an engine driver in the Ceylon Government Railway; his mother a full-time housewife tending to the needs of Kaushal, his two sisters and two brothers. Theirs is a close-knit family even today, sharing and respecting each other as they learnt early in life.
Having worked in several top companies in the plastics and rubber sector, Kaushal Rajapaksa began Kalhari Group with Kalhari Enterprises in 2003 recycling plastic waste.
Operations began with the recycling of PET bottles; mainly beverage bottles. The company gradually became one of the leading exporters of recycled PET bottles at the time.
Plastic waste was collected and brought to the Kalhari factory in Heiyanthuduwa where it was either crushed or baled according to customer specifications. They were then shipped to China or India.
"Today we do not confine ourselves to PET but have expanded to recycle other plastics as well," says Rajapaksa. "That has given the collector a wider range of plastics including HDPE, LDPE and polythene. Some of them we sell to local manufacturers while the others are exported."
"We have also expanded to recycling rubber waste and steel waste. We were the first to have created value for the steel sand generated in steel factories and opened up export markets for them. From the time steel factories commenced production in Sri Lanka they have been dumping this steel waste in low-lying or marshy fields resulting in the entire area becoming barren where nothing could be cultivated and the water bed gets polluted due to the oxide dripping to the bottom with the water."
"What we have done is to create a commercial value for this steel waste and generate a huge amount of foreign exchange for the country."
"We export the PET to China and Taiwan, rubber waste to Pakistan, China and India, and steel waste to China and Korea. During the last seven years, we have started three other factories and that is how we have become a group. We have an additional recycling factory totally dedicated to recycling tyres, and the product is exported to Japan while some of it is also sold to the local tyre industry."
Kaushals efforts have not gone unrewarded. For several years, he has received many awards including the Exporter's Award.
For another, this would only have been a business venture. Not so for Kaushal Rajapaksa. The growth of the Kalhari Group is intimately woven into the community where the factory is situated.
The company is headquartered in Heiyanthuduwa, about 18 km from Colombo. A rural village accessed through a winding and hilly road, it is also home to most of the employees of Kalhari Enterprises helping in no small measure to raise their living standards.
As a natural leader, Kaushal has initiated many community service projects not only in and around his factory and home, but even as far as Matara. Giving sight to the poor, catering to the medical needs of the elderly and the needy and helping children are priorities for him.
Devout Buddhists, both he and his wife Shirani - always by his side sharing his passion for community service - built a Dagoba for the rural community of Nakulugamuwa, in a remote corner of the Matara district.
Recently Kaushal and his team conducted an annual community service program at the Heiyanthuduwa Buddhist Temple for the tenth year in succession.
In this period, the project has served around 7,000 people and distributed 3,500 pairs of spectacles in addition to the other services provided.
The beneficiaries of his philanthropic activities extend from children and schools to the elderly and the needy. Very broad-minded in outlook, he shuns any form of discrimination and insists that community service should be for the entire community.
Kaushal Rajapaksa's passion for community service has been nurtured by Lions Clubs International District 306 B2.
A Charter Member of the Biyagama North Lions Club, he is the Cabinet Treasurer of District 306 B2 for the year 2016/2017. Today Kaushal is negotiating with partners in Thailand, Belgium, Germany and Spain to bring the latest technology in recycling to Sri Lanka.
Very soon he expects to be engaged in the recycling of outdated and unused chemicals and experts in this field from Spain and Thailand are due to arrive in the country next month for discussions.
His keen involvement in the boating and yachting industries has seen Sail Lanka Charter become the leading yacht chartering and manufacturing company in Sri Lanka. BAFF Polymech, of which he is a Director, has introduced new technology and trained many youth for jobs in water-based industries.
Kaushal has contributed professionally to the industry and through it to the country, even as he continues to contribute to the community through his unstinting philanthropy.

Laojee Tea affirms position as SLs No. 1 tea brand
In an industry crowded with many brands, Laojee has been able to maintain a winning streak in Sri Lanka's branded tea segment.
A brand trusted by Sri Lankans for over 45 years, Laojee Tea has been clearly identified as the preferred choice by locals throughout the years, scoring high on all aspects of tea.
Clearly identified as the largest tea brand in Sri Lanka by AC Nielsen, Laojee has seen its market share increase by 5%, gaining entry into more households in Sri Lanka as the perfect cup of kahata.
Laojee is planning to initiate more activities that would reinforce its strong presence as the brand that brings people together over a cup of tea.
Laojee has lived up to the brands promise of brewing togetherness by enabling Sri Lankans to bond over a cup of tea with perfect strength, colour, aroma and taste.
Laojee is also certified by the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Sri Lanka Standards Institution that affirms quality.
Laojee recorded a double digit growth in 2016 which also saw the brand emerge as the winner of the SLIM Nielsen People's Choice Awards under the Hot Beverage Brand category.
As a brand that has retained its popularity among customers at a mass market level, Laojee has continued to grow even under tough economic conditions, reinforcing its status as a trusted brand among consumers in the mass market.
Laojee is perfectly offset by its affordable pricing and greater availability. In maintaining its growth, Laojee has also expanded the reach through a large network of outlets and has succeeded in sustaining a strong gain in household penetration.
It also scores high on maintaining a strong brand presence, especially at a time such as the festive season during which as a mass tea brand with a sturdy appeal, Laojee has flourished in capturing a large portion of the market.
This has resulted in Laojee's success in contrast to other branded tea available, Aadhil Asver, Brand Manager Laojee, said.
"Especially during times such as the Avurudu, Laojee maintained a high visibility and a strong presence in the market. The perfect cup of tea is not just about known attributes but also about how the brand makes you feel as a part of the family and the community at large, with characters such as Rosa associated with the brand, affirming the brand's popularity among the consumers," says Mihira Kulatunga, Category Head, Beverages.

The Company expects to finance the project which will require an investment of USD 100 million approximately through a project loan from international development finance institutions under very competitive terms and the sponsors equity contribution.
This latest contract is yet another feather in LTLs cap, enhancing its standing as Sri Lankas largest internationally acclaimed Electrical & Heavy Engineering Power Company.
LTL Group has been very active in the power sector of Bangladesh since 2010.
LTL Group CEO U.D. Jayawardana said we have found an ideal market in Bangladesh for investment in power generation, with its huge supply-demand deficit, safe investment climate and an environment that welcomes IPPs as a concept to fill shortages of local capital formation for infrastructure development.

Malaysia to peg US$ 300 mn in Lankas leisure sector
The Malaysian government and the private sector were looking at investing nearly US$ 300 million on theme parks and other leisure sectors.
In addition Malaysian investors were also keen to invest in oil, gas and energy sectors in Sri Lanka, said Malaysian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Wan Zaidi Wan Abdullah at the Malaysian High Commission yesterday.
We are encouraging Malaysian companies to engage in projects in Sri Lanka like the construction of power stations and construction and management of gas distribution terminals in the island. We are also looking at Hambantota for investment opportunities, he said.
Malaysian investments to other countries in 2016 was around US$ 115 billion. In addition Malaysian investments within Malaysia reached US$ 2 billion last year. We are hoping that part of this investment could be channeled to Sri Lanka in the future. We are looking at venturing not only into tourism sector businesses but leisure and theme parks and the discussions are undergoing now about the projects, he said.
I am trying my best to promote businesses between the two countries and encourage the advent of Malaysian commercial and residential integrated government development projects to Sri Lanka. My target is for the next few years to get more foreign direct investment from Malaysia to Sri Lanka.
The areas that we are looking at are telecommunication, construction, infrastructure, education and tourism. Now we are working hard to venture into healthcare and Malaysias expertise in running private healthcare service, supply of medical equipment and technical assistant to medical staff would be beneficial to Sri Lanka, he said.
We are working closely with the Sri Lanka Chamber of Commerce and the exports are growing between the two countries and we are planning to open another 2,000 job opportunities to Sri Lankan workers this year in addition to the 6,000 Sri Lankan workforce in Malaysia, he added.
The Malaysian High Commissioner added that bilateral relations with Sri Lanka were very cordial and friendly and the Malaysian Prime Minister was scheduled to visit Sri Lanka end of the year and with his visit they were planning to venture into various economic and other operations that collaborated with Sri Lankan effectively.

The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) 2017 Annual Summit under the theme Disruption, Innovation, Transformation: The future of tourism concluded at Jetwing Hotel, Negombo.
The event discussed many angles in tourism-related matters, opening an excellent opportunity to meet high profile speakers representing the travel and tourism industry.
It was pointed out that the increase in average income and the fall in levels of absolute poverty are seen in the growing middle class.
The middle class population is expected to increase further, up to 4.9 billion, by 2030. These characteristics too will have a considerable impact on the tourism sector.
From these groups, millennials seem to be the most highlighted, with a reputation for being entitled, distracted, and overconfident.
The millennials arrival in the workforce is a challenge, but also an opportunity. Known for their technological aptitude and global perspective, millennials bring a unique perspective to the world.
For their managers however, there can be a learning curve when it comes to building working relationships and managing millennials in the workplace. The panelists discussed how to make the most of these unique generations best qualities.
Sarah Matthews, Head of Destination Marketing APAC, Trip Advisor, Hong Kong SAR said that the age of transformation will prompt travel agents, hoteliers and key stakeholders in tourism in Sri Lanka and the world over to think differently and be innovative. SS

Renovation of water distribution system in Colombo

National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) will take measures to enhance the water distribution system in Colombo and to reduce the non - revenue water supply (NRW) by 18 percent by 2021, Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Programme (GCWWMIIP) Director S.A.Rasheed said.
 He said this while addressing the Media today at GCWWMIIP office in Wellawatte.
 Though there are many projects to increase that water demand in Colombo, there is no significant project launched to rehabilitate the network resulting in an extremely high level of NRW the GCWWMIIP Director said.
The NWSDB launched the GCWWMIIP with the financial assistance of Asian Development Bank (ADB) to establish a long term mechanism to reduce the NRW and to enhance the efficiency and the capacity of the water supply system in Colombo the Director said.
He said that the project costs Rs 40 billion. The ADB has provided 202 million US dollars and the government has provided 73 million US dollars to support this project.
"According to the statistics, around 600,000 people live in Colombo and more than 400,000 people visit Colombo daily for various purposes he said.
He said that the daily pipe borne water consumption in Colombo per day is 160,000 cubic metres. The water supply system of the city is more than 100 years old and is not enough to provide pipe borne water to the rising population.
People living in low pressure areas recieve water only for 6-10 hours per day, he said.
Director Rasheed added that around 300,000 cubic metres of water is supplied to Colombo daily. But 33 percent of it is lost owing to leakages in the distribution pipe system, and the government incurs a considerable loss due to this wastage. 
He further added that short term inconveniences may be caused to the commuters due to the project activities implements on the roads by traffic congestion near the project sites, dust and noise.
We urge the public to support this project without considering these inconveniences, the GCWWMIIP Director said.

Sangakkara to bid farewell to first class cricket

Three days of engaging cricket from both sides ended, depressingly, with handshakes at 5.25pm. But whatever sorrow filled the air was engulfed by a deeper dismay whenKumar Sangakkara, with a century in each innings, announced that this would be his final season in the County Championship.
He has a couple of contracts to honour this year, including a stint in the Caribbean Premier League with Jamaica Tallawahs. "The mercenary in me is still alive," he joked, when pressed on whether he might be around for a T20 gig or two. "No one wants an old dog just playing for the sake of it. All in all, I'll have a few more months but that'll be it." So begins the farewell tour.
"You need to get out while you are ahead," was Sangakkara's response when he was implored to reconsider - by the press, no less. What world is this where a man can become the fourth Surrey batsman to score four centuries in four consecutive innings (Ian Ward was the last to do it in 2002), pass 20,000 first-class runs with two centuries in a match and sit pretty on 592 in just four Championship games this season and think he's done Sport and indeed life, as it happens. "This really is it. Look - I'm 39. I'll be 40 in a few months. I think this is about the end of county cricket [for me] in the four-day and any sense, really.
"The biggest mistake you can make is to think you are better than you are and you try to fight the inevitable. When you start a season like this, there is a long way to go. You have to enjoy the good times. All good things come to an end. Cricketers and any other sportsperson have an expiry date. I've been very lucky to plays as much as I have and I'm not taking anything for granted, but and there's a lot of life to be lived away from the game."

The fertility rate of Sri Lankan people has increased from 1.9 in 1998 to 2.4 in 2012. The figure may have further increased now, Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka Executive Director Thushara Ranasinghe Agus said.
Addressing a media seminar in Colombo yesterday, she said there is an upward trend in teen pregnancies in Sri Lanka during the recent past and many married women still follow conservative family planning methods leading to unwanted pregnancies and abortions.
Senior Professor of demography, Colombo University Prof. Indralal De Silva said the age of getting married among Sri Lankan men and women has gone down and it was 28 for men and 23.5 for women in 1971. Now it has come down to 27 for men and 23.4 for women. A lot of problems arise with the rapid increase of population. Solid waste management, deforestation, urbanisation, pollution are some of them, he said.
Consultant Community Physician attached to the Family Health Bureau Dr. Sanjeewa Godakanda said the best age gap between two kids of a family is 3 to 5 years.

Stax insights: Four recommendations for realising the potential of Sri Lankan pharma
Picture a class of diagnostic tests with the capability to assess health at a molecular level and shed light on an individual's predisposition to disease. Instead of a generic therapy for lung cancer, imagine a clinician empowered with knowledge of the molecular profile of an individual's cancer and its specific gene mutations to prescribe personalised medicine.
Globally, the field of molecular diagnostics is driving the discovery of 'biomarkers' - genetic markers of a specific condition or disease - and leading towards targeted therapies around these biomarkers.
Prominent biopharmaceutical companies like Roche Diagnostics and Abbott Laboratories invest heavily in the field. In turn, molecular diagnostics research is undergirded by a network of supporting organisations.
Biobanks are an example - these public and private repositories of biospecimens (such as human blood, saliva and tissue) provide the much-needed raw material for biomarker discovery. Altogether, these interconnected organisations have the potential to deliver unprecedented leaps in scientific understanding.
Now, visualise this landscape in Sri Lanka. For many, this is where the reverie ends.
In advanced healthcare ecosystems across Europe and the USA, the complex nexus between pharma, molecular diagnostics and biobanking is only one of many. Synergies also stem from connections between adjacent businesses such as cold chain logistics, drug delivery companies, pharmacy management software and analytics for pharma.
Collectively, these organisations make for a forward-thinking approach to population health management. However, to a large extent, they hinge upon the impetus provided by a well-functioning pharmaceuticals industry.
In Sri Lanka, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) cause over 75% of all deaths. Not only is a thriving domestic pharma market necessary to improve our ability to tackle this disease burden locally but it is also the next step in discovering an area of comparative advantage in an export market flooded by Indian and Bangladeshi generics.
After its inception in the 1950s however, Sri Lanka's pharmaceutical industry stayed dormant for nearly 50 years.
It was only recently, with the advent of public-private partnership for the local manufacture of pharmaceuticals, that the market experienced a much-needed boost.
Currently, there is significant scope for local manufacturers. From an estimated Rs. 35 billion in 2015, the market for branded and branded generics is expected to grow 8% annually to Rs. 51 billion by 2020.
Ground realities in pharma have been complex, however. The past year was witness to the departures of prominent personnel in the National Medicinal Regulatory Authority (NMRA), as well as clashes with the medical community around pending approvals for the import of innovative medicines - like Cuban drug Heberprot-P for diabetic foot ulcers.
Price controls were also instituted on 48 drugs during the final quarter of 2016 - much welcome from the vantage point of consumers, but resulting in several pharmaceutical firms having to compensate pharmacies for losses made.
Amidst these growing pains, the idea of an advanced ecosystem with the potential to foster unique synergies might seem like a pipe dream for Sri Lanka.
However, if regional players like India and Bangladesh are anything to go by, certain efforts can better position Sri Lankan pharma for success in the long run:
1. Implement well-regulated clinical trials and bio-equivalence studies
Clinical trials have an important purpose in establishing quality assurance for medication. Bioequivalence studies in particular are a means of promoting an understanding of generic medicine and brand substitution practices among doctors and discerning patients alike.
However, as of January 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov listed South Asian countries as having a paltry 1.5% share of global clinical trials.
There are some promising studies in the pipeline. In 2014, the Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry logged a randomized controlled trial investigating the performance of the generic brand of sodium valproate (Epilex 200 mg) - used to treat epilepsy - relative to its innovator Epilim 200 mg.
If the two drugs are proven to be bioequivalent, users can rest assured that the generic has the same effectiveness as the innovator drug.
Not only are such studies an important means of ensuring the quality of homegrown generics versus imported pharmaceuticals but they are relevant for local pharma players that are interested in exporting.
The main caveat is that these studies must be conducted within a framework wherein the rights of participants are safeguarded, in line with global best practice.
2. Be intentional about global positioning
Relative to countries like India, Sri Lanka lacks the economies of scale to ensure low cost manufacturing and is not uniquely poised for success as a pharmaceutical exporter.
In particular, export potential is constrained by a global emphasis on the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S).
PIC/S is an informal co-operative arrangement between 49 participating pharmaceutical authorities in the area of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). PIC/S members increasingly look for compliance with their standards when placing government orders for pharmaceuticals. Although some Sri Lankan pharma manufacturers currently export to less regulated markets like the Maldives and Mauritius, future access to lucrative export destinations in Asia and Africa is likely to be curtailed as a result. While PIC/S membership takes several years to achieve, Sri Lanka's ability to capture these markets depends upon how the NMRA positions itself within the broader global regulatory landscape.
3. Invest with a view towards drug discovery
For the most part, the local industry only formulates generics which have gone off patent, with limited capability to develop some of the most important drugs as far as the therapeutic needs of the population are concerned.
Collectively, Sri Lanka still lacks the technology to manufacture oncology medicines, advanced anti-hypertensive drugs, top-end antibiotics and neurological drugs. Like Sri Lanka, India also lags behind in terms of securing access to drugs under patents but has tried to tackle the problem in different ways.
The tuberculosis medication Risorine is, for example, the outcome of a public-private partnership between the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, and Cadila Pharmaceuticals.
The drug's efficacy was established through a multi-centric clinical trial conducted across India in patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.
Over 90% of the patients treated with Risorine were cured of tuberculosis, with a better safety profile and relatively few side effects. Taking the long view towards drug discovery and development, Sri Lanka needs to start by developing knowledge and facilities in biomedical research.
4. Assess the long-term viability of an API park
Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or bulk drugs are the raw materials necessary for a self-sustaining pharma ecosystem. India, for instance, manufactures 30% of global generics drug consumption but currently meets 80% of demand for bulk drugs through Chinese imports.
Starting in 2013, the Indian government set up the Katoch Committee with the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in API production.
Aside from identifying the most important APIs and developing a package of incentives to build domestic production capacity, the Katoch Committee also assessed the viability of mega API parks.
Likewise in Bangladesh, where 80% of the total need for APIs is met through imports, efforts to build an API park began in 2008 under a public-private initiative with the Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (BAPI).
By producing raw materials at the API park, the country is expected to save 70% on the cost of imports. While it is possible to achieve success in manufacturing, marketing and exporting finished pharmaceutical products, developing an API park provides end-to-end control of the pharma value chain.
In the large scheme of things, Sri Lankan pharma is unlikely to achieve these much-lauded advances overnight. However, laying the groundwork for some of these recommendations could set local players on a promising trajectory for the future.
