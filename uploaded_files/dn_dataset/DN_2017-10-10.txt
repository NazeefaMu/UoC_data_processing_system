SL a centre of excellence  for security printing
De La Rue celebrates 30 year joint venture with govt in printing banknotes for the world
Last week, we caught up with Martin Sutherland, CEO of De La Rue while he was in Sri Lanka with the companys Board of Directors to visit the banknote and security printing facility just outside Colombo.
De La Rue is the biggest printer of banknotes and passports in the world and has been in a successful public private partnership with the Sri Lankan government for more than 30 years, bringing in financial investment and employment to the region.
We talked to him about the importance of Sri Lanka to the company and what the future might look like.
Q: What is the reason for your visit to Sri Lanka
We have a print factory in Biyagama which employs over 300 people and exports more than 75% of the product it manufactures. The Sri Lankan government owns a 40% holding in the successful joint venture and last year I hosted President Sirisena at our site to mark the 30th anniversary of our partnership.
This year, I decided we should host our De La Rue plc Board meeting here to show how important it is to our business worldwide. We have a number of global hubs and Sri Lanka is one of our centres of excellence for security printing.
It is a world class facility that produces more than a billion banknotes every year, both for the local Central Bank and for many other countries around the world. I was very keen that the Board get a first-hand experience of the excellent work the team do here.
Q: Tell us about De La Rue and what you do
We are a truly global organisation, providing secure products and services to around 140 countries.
Our purpose is to enable every citizen to participate securely in the global economy, and we enable this by providing products and services that underpin the integrity of trade, the movement of people and goods. And whilst our head office is in the UK along with several other sites, we also have security printing operations in Sri Lanka, Kenya and Malta.
Our business covers three core areas  currency, identity solutions like passports, and brand protection.
We are probably most well known as the worlds largest commercial banknote provider, including printing UK Sterling. Although many people assume that we are heading towards a cashless society, the demand for cash actually continues to grow by 3-4% globally.
It is also the most inclusive of all payment mechanisms, especially when you think that one third of the worlds adult population do not have a bank account and 85% of consumer transactions worldwide are carried out using currency.
We are also the worlds largest commercial passport printer, producing books and paper for around forty countries a year and we deliver some of the worlds most secure passports, designed specifically to meet the needs of each government.
But its not just passports. As a global leader in broader ID solutions, we can develop a whole range of domestic and international identity solutions for governments. The need for every person in the world to have a legal and secure identity has never been more important as the worlds population increases.
Finally, we provide physical and digital support to enable governments to gather tax and excise revenues due on regulated products like tobacco and alcohol, and support brand owners like Microsoft protect their supply chains from counterfeiting.
The cost of counterfeit is thought to be a staggering US$1.7 trillion a year, which, if it were a country, would equate to the 10th largest economy in the world by GDP.
Q: What do you produce in the factory in Biyagama and how has it changed over the last 30 years
De La Rue is just over 200 years old, and throughout that time has a proud record of innovation, for example, developing the first fountain pen and ATM. This history of innovation is at the core of what we do and it is this that continues to make us the global leader in secure printing.
Our site in Sri Lanka is one of five centres of excellence for currency printing globally, alongside two centres in the UK, and our plants in Kenya and Malta. The site has achieved the highest level of security and quality accreditations and we are continually investing to ensure standards are maintained and improved.
Here in Biyagama we started out by producing notes just for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, but have expanded over the years and now export between 7080% of the work produced here.
Our operation and investment continued throughout the challenging times that Sri Lanka endured over the turn of the century and we were pleased to be able to support the local community during those difficult times.
We regularly invest in new equipment to be able to provide our customers with the latest security features for the banknotes to ensure the integrity of currency or other security documents.
Q: Does every country have its own currency and security printing operation
Not many do, as it is a highly complex and capital intensive operation to establish and run. An operation like we have in Sri Lanka is able to meet the currency requirements of Sri Lanka itself, but is also able to run at full capacity to print the currencies of other countries. And the better the factory performs, the more the government benefits  in the form of ongoing employment and an enhanced annual financial dividend.
Q: What has the investment been like so far in Sri Lanka and what is the governments involvement
We are proud to have been in a joint venture with the Government of Sri Lanka for over 30 years and have built a strong relationship with them. The joint venture has been a great success.
Over the last year we have increased the volume of production in Sri Lanka and spent about Rs.2 billion to enhance current capability, upgrading equipment but also investing in quality inspection systems.
We have also looked at whether or not we can enhance the capability we have around identity solutions here in Sri Lanka. My focus is to drive a commercially viable and profitable enterprise where we are exporting and that is what drives growth and job creation, providing skilled employment opportunities for the community.
Q: Are you looking at expanding your operations in Sri Lanka
We have consistently invested in ensuring we have the right level of capability to meet the needs of our customers in Sri Lanka and globally, and we will continue to do so. We have already further enhanced the security printing process with new machinery and technology. The Biyagama factory is a centre of excellence for currency, but could be scaled up to print other security documents such as passports as well.
The Sri Lankan Government is looking to upgrade the passport and the system behind it to be able to provide Sri Lankans with the latest e-passports, which offer greater security and acceptance around the world.
We currently run the British passport system including the data management system and would very much welcome an opportunity to provide this service to the Government here in a similar way and as part of the joint venture.
Q: What are the recent successes for De La Rue
We are constantly providing support to countries the world over, but I am particularly proud of our recent introduction of polymer banknotes in the UK. We have supported the Bank of England as well as banks in Scotland in designing and printing the new 5 and 10 banknotes and we will begin working on the new 20 as well.
De La Rue is a global leader in ID solutions with a strong track record and we deliver some of the worlds most secure passports. For example, we design and print the UK Passport which I am incredibly proud of. We have also recently won significant contracts in countries such as Malta and Australia to help ensure they are at the leading edge of identity protection.
(Sutherland joined De La Rue as Chief Executive Officer in October 2014. Since joining the company his focus has been on developing a strategy based around the three core areas of the business to ensure a strong future for De La Rue.)

'Blade Runner 2049' has great ambition, some glitches [Video]

"Blade Runner 2049" boasts such an enticing assortment of elements it's frustrating that they aren't assembled into a movie that fully delivers on its promise. Yet despite Ryan Gosling, a striking visual template and Harrison Ford reprising the role he played in the 1982 sci-fi classic, glitches mar this undeniably ambitious but drawn-out exercise.
Director Denis Villeneuve ("Arrival") looked like an inspired choice to put a modern spin on this cerebral thriller. And in much the way that HBO's "Westworld" brought fresh considerations to Michael Crichton's movie, this 35-years-later sequel introduces ideas and concerns about renegade robots and artificial intelligence that feel very much suited to where we are now.
The movie, however, perhaps tackles too much, incorporating clever callbacks to its cinematic predecessor while seeking to carve out its own expansive narrative. The pacing, too, is somewhat off, with the first two thirds of the film -- which runs 2 hours, 44 minutes -- feeling a tad too leisurely, as if luxuriating in its futuristic dystopia, before rushing toward its slightly messy climactic act.
From that perspective, it's possible to admire "Blade Runner" for what it endeavors to do -- and recommend seeing it on that level -- without feeling completely satisfied.
The filmmakers have understandably asked that reviews be as spoiler-free as possible, but the basic outline has been spelled out in the promotional material. It's been more than 30 years since the events of the original, with a new Blade Runner, K (Gosling), being drawn into a case that ties back into whatever happened to Ford's Deckard, who has disappeared.
A new conglomerate, moreover, has sprung up to replace Tyrell Corp. as the creator of replicants, the android-like beings forged in man's image, to advance expansion beyond a world polluted and despoiled past the point of recognition.
Strictly in terms of set design and imagery, the movie dazzles. The smog-choked skies and dusty hues are almost tangible, matching and surpassing the acid rain-slicked streets of director Ridley Scott's incarnation.

Like the new "Westworld," "Blade Runner 2049" (the script is by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green) uses that dense backdrop to explore deeper questions about humanity and identity, throwing in a riff from a Disney fairy tale for good measure. The problem is that while A.I. offers a provocative prism through which to frame such matters, it can be an emotionally distancing one as well.
The movie's intellectual concerns certainly stand apart from blockbusters that appear overly preoccupied with blowing stuff up, but Ford's late entry into the story somewhat muddles answers to the questions that the movie raises. The structure also blunts the impact of a strong cast that includes Robin Wright, Lennie James and Jared Leto, with Ana de Armas, especially, standing out as a key figure in K's life.
Give "Blade Runner" credit for doing far more than merely settling for nostalgia and name recognition, reimagining author Philip K. Dick's nightmarish 21st-century vision for a 21st-century audience -- one still wondering when those first flying cars will roll off the assembly line.
The irony is that the movie inadvertently reinforces one of its underlying messages -- namely, the more intricate the parts that go into this kind of vehicle, the more opportunities there are to encounter hiccups in the program.

Bye bye Big Ben, see you in four years

Workers have been pictured erecting scaffolding around Elizabeth Tower as they begin conservation work that will see its Big Ben bell silenced until 2021.
Men wearing hard hats, hi-vis jackets and safety harnesses were seen clambering up to the clock face of the 315ft structure in the heart of Westminster.
Big Ben was silenced at the end of August ahead of the 61million maintenance works.
It is thought the 13.7 tonne bell's loud bongs could have detrimental effects on the hearing of workers operating in such close vicinity.
Elizabeth Tower was built 1859 at a time when it was known simply as the Clock Tower. It received its current name in 2012 as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth II.
Some Conservative MPs have called for Big Ben to chime as a one-off during the maintenance works to signal the completion of Britain's exit from the European Union at midnight on 29 March 2019.

Game of Thrones: Traffic banned from Dark Hedges road

Traffic is to be banned from part of a County Antrim road - made famous by the TV fantasy drama Game of Thrones - to protect trees known as the Dark Hedges.
The tunnel of beech trees on the Bregagh Road, near Armoy, has become a major international tourist attraction.
The scene was used by the Game of Thrones crew to represent "the King's Road" in the HBO drama series.
Stormont's Department for Infrastructure is introducing a ban on cars using the road from 30 October.
The order will also prohibit buses and coaches from using the designated stretch of the Bregagh Road.
Any motorist who flouts the ban could face a fine of up to 1,000.
Some vehicles - including agricultural and emergency vehicles - will be exempt from the ban "in certain circumstances".
The Dark Hedges were planted more than 200 years ago by the Stuart family, who created a tree-lined avenue along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion.
About 150 were planted by James Stuart, but time has taken its toll over the centuries and now fewer than two thirds remain standing.
In January 2016, during Storm Gertrude,high winds ripped up two trees, causing them to collapse.
Later that year, a large, rotten branchbroke off one of the trees and fell across the road.
The Dark Hedges became a huge draw for tourists and TV fans after they appeared, albeit very briefly, in the closing scene of one episode of Game of Thrones.
Arya Stark, one of the show's main characters, was filmed travelling on a cart along the road, disguised as a boy.
Conservationists have expressed alarm about the increasing traffic levels in the area and the possible damage to the trees' roots.
During the Easter holidays this year, pictures of traffic jams were shared on social media,some criticising the number of vehicles lining the road..
The cycling blog NI Greenways described the Dark Hedges as a "national treasure" and claimed it was being slowly killed.
The Department for Infrastructurepublished the banning order on 5 October.
It hadproposed the ban last year, after "discussions with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council and other interested parties".
It launched a consultation and said "four written objections were received and duly considered and no other representations were received".
The ban is will be enforced along Bregagh Road, from its junction with Ballinlea Road to its junction with Ballykenver Road.
The department said new traffic signs, advising the public of the ban, would be erected in the area "in due course".

A case filed against Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and five others for their alleged involvement in laundering money amounting to Rs.30 million through Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited was today fixed for trial by Colombo High Court.
The Colombo High Court fixed the case for trial on February 16 and prosecution witnesses of the case were noticed to appear in Courts on next trial date.
Four accused Namal Rajapaksa, the eldest son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nithya Senani Samaranayake, Sujani Bogollagama and Iresha Silva who functioned as the directors of Gowers Corporation Pvt Ltd director were present in court when the case was taken up before High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe.

It was reported that Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited of Colombo 5, is providing coordinating services to Sri Lankan Airlines.
The FCID had initiated investigations into this matter following a complaint by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Samarasinghe alleged that MP Namal Rajapaksa had bought shares of a company named Hello Corp and set up a company called Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited while being an MP from the Rs.125 million earned through illegal means.

He added that the Health Ministry statistics reports an increase in the number of individuals who seek medical treatment for mental disorders.
The Minister said this while addressing a gathering after opening the Pearl Child Guidance Centre at Aluthgama, Moragolla recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that mental stress and mental disorders have increased due to problems faced in offices and homes.
Busy and competitive lifestyle has also led to this situation. The impact of this negative trend is on the entire society.
Children's mental health should be improved. It is the duty of all sectors to provide all required facilities for children with special needs and to ensure their safety while looking after them well, the Minister added.

UN bans 4 ships from global ports for violating N Korea sanctions

The United Nations has banned four ships from visiting any global port, after they were found violating sanctions imposed on North Korea.
Hugh Griffiths, co-ordinator of a UN panel on North Korean sanctions, described the move as unprecedented.
The ships were reportedly the Petrel 8, Hao Fan 6, Tong San 2 and Jie Shun.
The UN Security Council expanded sanctions on North Korea last month in response to Pyongyang's sixth and largest nuclear test yet.
The ban was announced following a UN meeting on Monday.
Griffiths, speaking after the meeting on the enforcement of sanctions on North Korea, said the ships were found "transporting prohibited goods".
He said the ban, which went into effect on 5 October, did not entail asset freezes or travel bans.
According to the MarineTraffic website, a maritime database that monitors the movement of vessels, Petrel 8 is registered in Comoros, Hao Fan 6 in Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tong San 2 in North Korea. The registered country of Jie Shun is not listed.
Exports banned
In August, a UN resolution banned exports of coal, seafood and iron ore from North Korea. Sanctions wereexpanded last monthto include the export of textiles and North Korean guest workers, as well as a cap on oil imports.
The tightening of trade restrictions followed Pyongyang's sixth nuclear test and the firing of two missiles over Japan.
North Korea's main economic partner China has signed up to the measures, along with Russia. Both have previously vetoed harsher sanctions on the secretive state.
The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of foreign cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of goods each year - and the sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade.
However, repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing with its nuclear and missile development programmes.
