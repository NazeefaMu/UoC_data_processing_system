Disaster responsibility does not lie solely on govt
The opposition cannot say that the responsibility for disasters lies only on the ruling party. The opposition also has a role to play in disastrous situations, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, addressing a meeting at Hambantota.
The minister said, the opposition, as the representative of the people, must bear a portion of the burden.
The ruling party and the opposition must join hands with each other in providing relief to the drought-stricken people. The minister further said that half the population in Sri Lanka is suffering today due to these disasters. We now bear the responsibility of raising the living, financial and social conditions of such people.

Australia hope weather plays ball in England showdown
BIRMINGHAM, Thursday  Australia remain confident of beating England in their make-or-break Champions Trophy clash at Edgbaston on Saturday, even if defeating the English weather has so far proved beyond them.
Steven Smiths side endured the frustration of having Mondays clash with Bangladesh abandoned due to rain, just days after their opening Group A fixture against New Zealand was also washed out.
On both occasions, it has been Australia who were batting in the early stages of their innings when bad weather ended play.
What made the Bangladesh washout at the Oval especially tough to take was that Australia had reached 83 for one in pursuit of 183 to win and required only four more overs to be bowled to ensure they would take maximum points via the Duckworth-Lewis rule used in rain-affected matches.
With two points from their two matches, Australia now have to beat England to be certain of a place in the semi-finals of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day intentional teams.
I think it makes the equation pretty simple for us, said Smith, whose side suffered an Edgbaston defeat by England during the last Champions Trophy four years ago.
We have to beat England and then I think were through. I havent really read into anything else thats happened.
Smiths powerful top order have spent precious little time in the middle this tournament but the skipper said: You know, most of the guys have been playing a lot of cricket, anyway, having been at the IPL (Indian Premier League) and things like that.
I think once they get out in the middle, things will just click into place, and yeah, hopefully we can play well in Birmingham, added Smith of a line-up where the big-hitting Chris Lynn, fresh from his IPL exploits, could be recalled.
Australias pacemen, led by Mitchell Starc, have started to find their form and they would love nothing more than a go at the old enemy this weekend.
England, by contrast, have managed to dodge the bad weather sufficiently to beat both Bangladesh and New Zealand in convincing fashion to book their semi-final spot regardless of Saturdays outcome.
But captain Eoin Morgan wants no let-up against World Cup champions Australia as England go in search of their first major International Cricket Council 50-over title.
I think if were truly going to be contenders for this tournament, we need to beat the best teams -- and Australia are one of the best teams, he said.
They always are going into a white-ball tournament. They seem to produce limited-overs cricketers at will, added the ex-Ireland batsman.
So to go into a game like that with no other attitude than winning is very important to us.  AFP

Bangladesh win by five wickets
CARDIFF June09: A fifth wicket stand of 224 runs between Shakib Al Hasan (114) and Mahmudullah (102 not out) helped Bangladesh to beat New Zealand by five wickets in a Champions Trophy clash at Cardiff on Friday.
Bangladesh made 268 for five wickets in 47.2 overs in reply to New Zealand total of 265 for 8.
Mossadek Hossain marked his return to the Bangladesh side by taking three wickets as New Zealand slumped to a total of 265 for eight in a must-win Champions Trophy clash at Cardiff on Friday.
New Zealand were well set while captain Kane Williamson (57) and Ross Taylor (63) were sharing a stand of 83 -- their third fifty partnership in as many matches this tournament.
But, as happened in their no-result washout with Australia and defeat by England, the Blackcaps innings collapsed once the experienced batsmen were out in quick succession.
Mossadek, chosen ahead of fellow off-spinner Mehedi Hasan, took two wickets in three balls on his way to impressive figures of three for 13 in three overs.
Fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, Bangladeshs other change to a side that escaped with a no result against Australia, took two for 43 in eight overs.
New Zealand, who had been 152 for three off 30 overs, only managed 113 more runs in the last 20 overs.
Given 300 is now generally regarded as a par score, Bangladesh were on top at the half-way stage -- especially as Williamson had won the toss.
Both Bangladesh and New Zealand had to win this Group A match to stand a chance of going through to the semi-finals, although a victory for Australia against England at Edgbaston on Saturday would see them join the already-qualified tournament hosts in the last four.
New Zealand opener Martin Guptill was in excellent touch after the match started an hour late due to rain and drove Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza for six.
But Bangladeshs change bowlers removed both Luke Ronchi and fellow opener Guptill to leave New Zealand 69 for two.
The extra pace of Taskin, recalled instead of batsman Imrul Kayes, appeared to surprise Luke Ronchi (16), a mistimed pull lobbing gently to Mustafizur Rahman at mid-on.Guptills 33 then came to an end when he was lbw to Rubel Hossain. Williamson, fresh from scores of 100 and 87 against England and Australia, showed his class with several elegant fours.
Taylor too drove Taskin down the ground before sweeping spinner Shakib Al Hasan for four.
Williamson went on to complete a 58-ball fifty, but he ran himself out as Bangladesh were rewarded for building pressure.  AFP

Big hearts  Big hearts ride to heal  'Little Hearts'
Interventional Cardiologist at Guys and St. Thomas Hospital, Dr. Divaka Perera, Professor of Cardiology at Kings College London, Prof. Michael Marber and Interventional Cardiologist at Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Dr. Peter OKane are part of a 5-man team who will cycle across the length of Sri Lanka in June, to raise funds for 'Little Hearts' - a charitable initiative of the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Daily News speaks to Dr. Divaka Perera on this noble endeavour.
We will be cycling 750km from Dondra lighthouse to Point Pedro lighthouse via the East Coast, starting on June 11th. This will be quite a challenge as none of us are regular long distance cyclists. I got myself a bicycle about eight months ago, to train for this event.
Although we have all been training hard for this, during evenings after work and weekends when we arent on call, the distance we have to cover in eight days along with the fact that we have not ever done this in the heat and humidity we will face during the ride, will make it quite a challenge, said Dr. Perera. The doctors are doing this to raise funds for two charities who deal with different but complementary aspects of improving the health of children and adults who suffer from heart disease. The charities are Little Hearts in Sri Lanka and the British Heart Foundation, the main funder of cardiovascular research in the UK
Our donors have been incredibly generous. So far, we have raised approximately Rs. 2.8 million in total (from around 110 individual donations), Rs 1.8 million of which has been to Little Hearts. Through more donations and hopefully some corporate sponsorship too, we hope to increase this by a significant amount in the next few days and weeks. I should point out that all funds go directly to the charities and any costs related to the ride itself and fund-raising activities are being borne by the members of the Cardiac Cycle Lanka team, pointed out Dr. Perera.
Little Hearts is a project that is overseen by the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians.
It is an ambitious but unquestionably worthwhile project, which seeks to address a massive gap in Sri Lankan healthcare at the moment, and the ability to provide potentially life-saving specialist treatment to critically ill children with heart disease, in a timely manner. The goal is to build a new state of the art unit on the Lady Ridgeway Hospital grounds (Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) is the only tertiary care referral center in Sri Lanka for children born with a heart problem and other critical illnesses.) While the overall cost is daunting (estimated at Rs 2 Billion) there is a government pledge to donate a substantial amount of these costs if the rest can be raised via charitable initiatives such as Cardiac Cycle Lanka. More than Rs. 130 million has been raised already and I hope we can make a small but meaningful contribution to this, explained Dr. Perera
The Sri Lanka Heart association is a strong supporter of Little Hearts. It has played an important role by endorsing the project and even helping with fund-raising.
President of SLHA, Dr. Nimali Fernando, has kindly allocated space on the programme of the SLHA annual academic meeting, to allow us to launch this charity event on Saturday June 10th. Three of the members of the Cardiac Cycle Lanka team - Prof. Marber and Dr. OKane and I, will also be delivering lectures at the SLHA conference on Saturday morning, before the launch. Following the launch, the team and supporters will ride the first mile of the journey (from Galadari hotel to Galle Face hotel) at about 1.30 pm on June 11th. Anyone wishing to ride (or just show support by being there) is welcome, added Dr. Perera.
This project is something that is very personal and meaningful to Dr. Perera.
I am an academic interventional cardiologist and spend half my week treating patients and the other half, heading an academic team who carry out research into a variety of cardiological problems. Both causes we are supporting are very close to my heart. Furthermore, it is a fantastic chance to help to fill this major unmet need in the country in which I was born, schooled and first cycled in, said Dr. Perera.
In addition to drawing attention to Little Hearts and the issues that apply to critically ill children in the country, this is a chance for all of us to experience this amazing country in a way none of us have done before, even those who have spent some or all of their lives in Sri Lanka, said Dr. Perera, excitedly.
This compassionate project does not end here.
I hope that I will be able to continue to work with the Chairperson of the Little Hearts project, Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe, and the others running Little Hearts even after we complete the charity ride, and see the project through to its conclusion. I have worked very closely with Duminda on this during the past few months and have been inspired by his dedication to the cause. I look forward to the day when I can return to Colombo for the opening of the Little Hearts unit.
I hope that anyone reading this article will, by now, be convinced of the worthiness of this project. If you are able to donate any funds to this cause (any amount, small or large is most appreciated) or simply want to learn more about the project an the two charities we are supporting, please visit www.CardiacCycleLanka.com, summed up Dr. Divaka.

BOC bid on behalf of other primary dealers -former Chief Dealer
Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue:
Several primary dealers have bid at higher rates than usual at the auction held on February 27 2015, similarly to Perpetual Treasuries, it was revealed at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday.
While the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has bid for rates 12.50, 12.75 and 13, several other primary dealers have put bids at similar rates, Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando pointed out. These rates include 10.08, 10.98, 11.25, 11.75 and 12.5. The primary dealers include Entrust, Natwealth, Wealth Trust, Employees Provident Fund, Seylan Bank and Pan Asia have bid at these rates as well. Fernando PC said, reading out from a sheet including the bidding details of the auction held on February 27, 2015.
Fernando PC led evidence of the former Bank of Ceylon Chief Dealer J.D.K. Dharmapala. Fernando PC also suggested that the decision made at the Market Operations Committee on the same day, had reached the Treasury bond market before the said decision was officially released. Dharmapala said, according to several telephone calls he received that day from money brokers, it may have been the case.
Counsel Chanaka de Silva asked Dharmapala if the Bank of Ceylon has exclusive information regarding government requirements.
Dharmapala said, it is possible to deduct conclusions from observing the Deputy Secretary for the Treasury Account (DST account), which is maintained in the BOC.
He said the higher managerial level is kept informed about the status of the DST account on a daily basis. Asked as to who else is privileged for this information, Dharmapala said the Treasury Management Department does. Counsel Chanaka de Silva also questioned Dharmapala on his decision making process regarding the Treasury bond auction which took place on February 27,2015. De Silva suggested to Dharmapala that the Bank of Ceylon has taken a conservative stance regarding the questioned auction.
Dharmapala said, a state bank cannot operate like a private dealer in the market, and that as a state bank it has its priorities. So in that view, it is possible to say the BOC acted rather conservatively regarding this auction. BOC was not interested in investing in this 30 year bond. We were only bidding on behalf of other primary dealers. Dharmapala said. Asked if he read the market wrong that day, Dharmapala disagreed with the suggestion.
Dharmapala said, on the questioned auction date there was a high liquidity available in the market, and there was no way that rates would have gone very high.
He also said, of all the history of Treasury bonds issuances in Sri Lanka, he has never seen an occasion where rates have gone very high, as at the questioned Treasury bond auction on February 27, 2015.

Colombo Bishop urges govt. to follow Court ruling on SAITM
Bishop of Colombo Dhiloraj Canagasabey has called on the government and SLMC to follow the Court of Appeals ruling and not deny provisional registration to qualified medical students of SAITM.
There are many other Sri Lankan students who are able to afford the fees charged by foreign medical schools and who have been registered to practice medicine in Sri Lanka. It is therefore, unjust to deny the same opportunity to SAITM medical students, he said.
Canagasabey also called for the government and SLMC to study and act on the proposals made by the deans of the eight Medical faculties in order to resolve the ongoing SAITM issue.
Various issues involved have been set out, discussed and debated in several media conferences, press releases, paper articles, byway of posters, demonstrations, marches, public meetings and even in our parliament. I need not repeat them here since the interested public is well aware of the arguments made for and against SAITM and sufficient information, including a judgement by the Court of Appeal is available in the public domain, Canagasabey said.
I approach this issue from the angle of justice and fairness. Firstly, to the students who have been enrolled to follow the MBBS course at SAITM and secondly to the general public who will come under the care of these students once they qualify and get registered as medical practitioners, he added.
He said, I believe that students were enrolled for the MBBS degree at SAITM from 2009 onwards and that there is no dispute that this institution was recognized as a degree awarding institution in 2011. Since then, there has been ongoing disagreements with the SLMC and the GMOA about clinical training and finally about the provisional registration of SAITM medical graduates by the SLMC which led tot he Court of Appeal petition.
Ensuring that students enrolled for medical (or any other degree course) are properly qualified is a matter for the University Grants Commission, while ensuring that proper standards are maintained in the teaching of medicine and in clinical training is the responsibility of the SLMC.
In both these areas, the Ministries of Higher Education and Health have an extremely vital role to play, the Bishop added.
Students who have enrolled at the SAITM are our own, who have pursued their dream of passing out as doctors in Sri Lanka. It is therefore, unjust to deny the same opportunity to SAITM medical students, he said.

## Title: Concussion issue is changing rugby

Concussion issue is changing rugby
Concussion has become a bit of a buzzword at the moment, and it is changing the face of rugby in a lot of ways. There is now awareness, and the concussion issue is regulated as a result of World Rugby changing the laws as a means of prevention, but it remains something that can affect players at all levels.
If you go through some of the names affected recently, just in New Zealand, there is: Dane Coles, Ben Smith, Sonny Bill Williams, Ryan Crotty, Matt Todd and Charlie Ngatai have had concussions, while Kieran Read and Brodie Retallick previously had it quite badly; and now this weekend we have Ardie Savea and Beauden Barrett sidelined. And that's not to forget Daniel Baldwin, a young player in Wellington who died recently after a head clash, and Jordan Kemp a couple of years ago.
The spotlight right now is on concussion, and it is a positive that we are all talking about the issue. It is real, and it is something that is changing rugby. It's changing a lot of mindsets and it will be interesting to see where we go from here.
In days gone by, the attitude was always to "harden up" and just get on with the game because rugby was a contact sport. However, we are now starting to see the aftermath of that sort of attitude with the severity of effects among former players. Former Hurricanes lock James Broadhurst retired recently having fought long-term concussion issues, while research sponsored by World Rugby, published in Sports Medicine last year, found links between concussion and cognitive problems for rugby players.
The issue is not going to go away any time soon, and the concerns about concussion are highlighted by the number of high-profile players who are opting out week after week.
Now we have had the ACC (Accident Compensation Commission) throwing $NZ7million to New Zealand Rugby to put in some work to study the issue, and to me it begs the question: What is the solution
I'm passionate about sports injury prevention -- that's the business I am in -- and I can see the question is: What is the how
That interest has extended to our business sponsoring courses by a prominent sports medicine and rehabilitation provider, and I have taken the chance to ask some of the experts at these courses what the best methods are by which we can help
Are mouthguards something that can help Is neck strengthening being encouraged
One speaker at a session said he didn't believe mouthguards or neck strengthening helped.
Then, earlier this year, an Otago University study came out and noted that neck strengthening was important.
I would love to see the introduction of a minimum-standard, accredited mouthguard because there are a lot of poor mouthguards out there. We are teaching young players to put some of these things in their mouth, chew on them and hope they do the job. But they never fit properly, as I've written previously.
You have got to have a properly fitted mouthguard.
I have been at games where I have seen young players sent from the field because they don't have mouthguards, and they go off the field and grab their mate's mouthguard, put it in their mouth, and go back on the field. That's not good enough. We almost need to educate referees so that kids don't just present them with their mouthguard in their hands.
They should have to open their mouth and show that it doesn't fall off the top teeth; only then will the referee know it is correctly fitted.
That way you know the player is protected by a properly fitted mouthguard that will provide the best protection when the point of contact happens.
It is not going to prevent massive impacts from happening, but it is something there can provide a cushioning effect.
These are the steps that we have to start taking with the younger generation. Boxing has been leading the way for a long time now, because it has to. You don't see boxers going into the ring with an average mouthguard or a weak neck; they wouldn't survive in that sport if they did.
I'm also big on the importance of neck strengthening. I've known this for a long time, and have been banging on about having players at a young age do the neck resistance exercises.
The Otago University study showed how the neck stops reverberations and acts like a strong spring, but the trapezius muscle is also hugely important.
Hence I would put money on suggesting that most loosehead props are probably more resistant to concussion than any other player on the field due to what they have to do in the scrum: If you think about the downward pressure on the back of their head, and how they exert their trapezius and neck, some of those players are very strong in those areas.
With the cleaning out that has become part of rugby in the past 20-30 years, the loose forwards now are the players most susceptible to concussions.
Before the cleaning out became common, it was generally felt you had to get lower than your rivals if you wanted to move your opponent. But we are seeing now that the target is over the ball; and the loose forwards are getting to the breakdown as quickly as possible, where their heads have to go low, and it exposes them to knocks on the back of the head.
World Rugby in the past couple of years has been trying to encourage the approach of an "aeroplane taking-off" style at the breakdown to minimise injuries.
That's great, but the loose forwards who have already arrived before the contest commences put themselves in a position where they can get harmed.
This is no one person's problem: It's just what we've created in the way the game is played; and for every change in the game there is a knock-on effect of consequences.  Scrum

The engine that rewrote F1 history
Fifty years ago on Sunday, the Lotus 49 appeared in public for the first time. Had you been present at the Dutch Grand Prix that weekend, it would not have seemed credible that this was the debut of a car, and particularly an engine, capable of rewriting F1 history. Low key does not make a start.
When Mercedes and Ferrari arrived in Spain to begin the European sector of the current season, every additional aerodynamic nuance, no matter how tiny, was recorded, examined and discussed in mind-numbing detail. No surprise, perhaps, because these two teams are championship contenders.
Back in 1967, Lotus was hardly unknown thanks to having won 25 grands prix and two world championships. You would think, with the introduction of a totally new car from the pen of the mercurial Colin Chapman, plus a brand new engine, their arrival in Zandvoort might have caused a stir. By todays standards, it would be the equivalent of Red Bull turning up in Baku with a Mercedes engine in the back of a revolutionary Newey chassis.
In 1967, the pace of life in F1 was, shall we say, more relaxed. There was no fanfare; not a single press release. Having backed Cosworth to the tune of 100,000 (not a vast sum, even then) to design and build the DFV, Ford did not want negative publicity should the engine with their name on the cam cover fail at its first attempt.
This was a journey into the unknown in every sense. The car, in the hands of Graham Hill, had completed a few laps up and down the runway at the Lotus test track in Norfolk.
Then it was loaded, along with another new chassis that had not even turned a wheel, onto the truck and taken on the short sea crossing to Holland, ready for Hill and Jim Clark to compete in the third round of the 1967 championship.
Even more absurd, the first time Clark saw the car was when he arrived in Zandvoort, his new status as a self-imposed tax exile having kept him away from the factory. Seat fitting Dont be daft. Having been with the team for seven seasons, Lotus were familiar with a slim stature that, in any case, was smaller than Hills. Graham was comfortable in the car. So the feeling was, with a few adjustments to the pedals and the addition of a bit of foam here and there in the cockpit, Jimmy would be right as rain.
In the aforementioned imaginary scenario of an all-new Red Bull, Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen would scarcely be able to drive out of the garage thanks to a wall of cameramen and photographers tripping over themselves in desperation to get the first image.
In 1967 -- and this takes some believing -- Clarks car was wheeled from beneath the awning alongside the Lotus transporter and pushed to the back of the paddock. There, Clark climbed on board and began to adjust his mirrors. There were two Lotus mechanics, a Firestone technician and a slave battery on hand to start the car. Nothing else.
A schoolboy and four blokes looked on from the other side of a barrier just behind the Lotus. One of them had a camera around his neck. But he wasnt using it. The double world champion pulled up his facemask, lowered his goggles and eased onto the track. Enter, almost unnoticed, one of F1s greatest combinations of man and machine. Mind you, it didnt feel that way to Clark. His initial impression was that there were two engines in the back of the green car with the signature yellow stripe. There was very little power below 6,500 rpm, at which point it arrived so abruptly that the rear would kick out and spin the wheels. So much for Clarks preference for an even response all the way through the rev range. When the power comes in at 6,500 rpm, it does so with such a bang that the car is almost uncontrollable, said Clark. You either have power or you havent.
Clark was actually more concerned about something not feeling right with the handling. A check by the mechanics found nothing amiss. When Clark experienced the same feeling on the second day of practice, he refused to continue.
Given that the mild-mannered Scot was not bolshie by any means, this said much about his unspoken concern over the occasional fragility of Chapmans designs. Tearing the car apart, the mechanics discovered that Clarks sensitivity had been acute enough to feel the effect of a ball-race beginning to break up inside the right-rear hub. Hill, meanwhile, had been untroubled as he put his Lotus 49 on pole. The fact that he had been 6.2 seconds inside the lap record was a sign of what was to come.
At the end of the first lap, Hill led by several car lengths. Clark, having started from the third row, moved into second place when Hills car coasted to a halt with broken timing gear.
Feeling more comfortable with each lap, Clark took the lead not long after and won by 27 seconds.
It would be the first of 176 F1 victories for the Ford-Cosworth V8 in its various forms during the next 18 seasons. Clark was destined to be around for just nine more months. Had this quiet genius survived that terrible F2 accident at Hockenheim, the story that began so unobtrusively on 4 June 1967 might have been even greater.  F1 news

Fast bowler Witanachchi was a member of Bens champion team
Former St. Anthonys College Wattala, St. Benedicts College Kotahena, Ceylon Combined Schools, Sri Lanka Air Force (Adastrians) and Defence Services cricketer Anuruddha Witanachchi spoke to the Daily News about his cricket career at his residence at No. 20, Kaushulliya Upostharama Road, Pinwatta, Panadura.
What is your full name, date of birth and something about your parents and your family
A - My full name is Anuruddha Witanachchi and my date of birth is on 6th April 1946 and my father is Robert Witanachchi, an ardent cricket lover from Baddegama and my mother is Gladys Silva from Moratuwa. I have one elder brother and sister and two younger sisters. As my father was employed at the Department of Irrigation, Colombo he took up residence at Wattala.
What is your first school and how did you commence cricket
A - I was admitted to St. Anthonys College, Wattala in 1953 to grade one and as usual I played softball cricket with my neighboring friends and with my class mates.
I attended under 14 cricket practices and I was selected and later I played for the under 16 team. I captained both these teams and also represented the first eleven cricket team in the 1962/63 cricket season. I am a left-arm medium fast bowler and right hand bat.
How did you join St. Benedicts College
A - My father was keen that I come up in cricket and he arranged for my admission to St. Benedicts. Along with me another first eleven cricketer Harold Sirisena too joined St. Benedicts and presently he is domiciled in America after a very successful cricket career at St. Benedicts.
Did you get a place in the Bens team
Y  Yes, both of us got selected during the 1963/64 cricket season under Sunil Fernando, our coach was R. B. Wijesinha. The same year we were unbeaten and we became the best team and were awarded the Lifebuoy Shield. I was awarded college colours. In that team Ranjith Fernando also played.
You said that your school was unbeaten and what are the schools that you played against
A - My first match for Bens was S. Thomas and we beat them outright at Kotahena. Then we defeated Royal College, St. Anthonys College Kandy, St. Peters, Ananda, Nalanda and St. Josephs after a lapse of 47 years. Our last match was with St Sebastians at Moratuwa and I think our team was over confident and the match was drawn in favor of us. Not only in cricket anything in life you must never be over confident.
Did you play for Combined Schools
A - I played for three successive years from 1963. During this period there were no foreign tours or any visiting teams to Sri Lanka.
I represented the Schools side in the Robert Senanayake Trophy where Govenment Services, Defence Services, Mercantile and the Rest teams participated. Anura Tennekoon of S. Thomas led the side and his deputy was Harendra Dunuwila. I shared new ball with Nihal Samarasekara of St. Sylvesters. In the finals we lost to Mercantile led by Thomian Claude Reid, The great coincide is both captains happened to be Thomians. Later I was awarded College colors in 1965 and 1966.
When did you enlist at the Royal Ceylon Air Force
A - 2nd June 1967. A former Air Force cricketer and umpire Errol Seneviratne used to officiate our school matches and he asked me whether I liked to join the Air Force and I agreed. He took me to the then Recruiting Officer Fl/Lt Aubrey Ebert and I was taken to the Air Force and I was sent for my Combat and Weapon Training at Diyatalawa for six months.
How do you get in to the Air Force team
A - K. M. Nelson led the Adastrians to victory in Division Two in 1965/66 and played under Donald Perera in Division One 1966/67. He was not given the captaincy of division one in 1967/68 team too and he left the Air Force and joined Maharajas and played for Bloomfield Cricket Club. He was the main strike bowler in the Air Force and during his absence I fitted into the Air Force side.
What is your first Sara match in 1967/68 cricket season
A - My debut match in Sara Trophy was against Bloomfield and in our group there was SSC, Nomads, Colts and Moors. We had return matches also. We beat formidable Bloomfield by an innings and 24 runs. Batting first they were skittled out for a paltry 96 runs and I claimed 6 for 14. I shared the new ball with former Richmondite Hemasiri Fernando. We replied with 196 and in their second essay they collapsed for 76 and I captured 4 for 24 to finish with a match bag of 10 for 24. In the same tournament we beat Moors on first innings. That season I headed the Air Force bowling with 29 wickets and I was awarded colours.
Did you play for the Defence Services
A - First I played for Inter Services and then for Defence Services for four successive years. I am very happy as a schoolboy and as a serviceman I played in the Robert Senanayake Trophy tournament.
How many years did you play for the Air Force
A - From 1967 to 1973 I played for the Sara team and later in the Donovan Andree Trophy and in the Daily News Trophy. Throughout my career I represented the Inter Unit cricket and I led the Admin team of Katunayake and Diyatalawa team. I also played for Diyatalawa in the Badulla tournament. I toured Gan Islands with the Air Force team in 1969 and I was rewarded with Air Force colours for three years.
Have you any connections with your alma mater and with the Air Force
A - We were the All Island School champions in 1963 and we celebrated the Golden Jubilee of that Championship in grand style. If there are any functions at school or in the Air Force they inform me and I used to attend. In the Air Force too I am a regular member for our get-togethers and on 3 June 2017 we had a Get-together of past cricketers and past officials at the Air Force grounds Colombo.
Who is the best batsman you came across during your school career and at the Air Force
A - No doubt it was Anura Tennekoon. The best bowler was Tony Opatha; the best fielder was David Heyn and the best wicket-keeper Ranjith Fernando. In the Air Force the best batsman and wicket- keeper was Keerthi Caldera and the best bowler was Mohamed Faleel.
There were two good all-rounders during my time Sarath Fernando and Dilwin Mendis.
Did your children take upto sports
A - I have three daughters and one son and they all are married and settled down. I live with my wife at home. My son Ashen Chathura Witanachchi played cricket for Sri Sumangala College, Panadura.
What is the advice you can give to the present day cricketers
A - Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. You must always be a team member and play the game hard. At the same time you must be highly disciplined.

Halep, Ostapenko to clash for French Open title
PARIS, Thursday - Simona Halep set up a French Open final against Jelena Ostapenko on Thursday, taking her to within touching distance of a first Grand Slam title and the world number one spot.
Romanian third seed Halep, the runner-up to Maria Sharapova in 2014, claimed a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win over Karolina Pliskova, the second-seeded Czech.
Unseeded Ostapenko downed Timea Bacsinszky 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-3 on her 20th birthday to become the first Latvian finalist at a major.
The eventual champion on Saturday will be a first-time major winner while victory for Halep would crown her as the new world number one, replacing Angelique Kerber.
"It's an amazing feeling right now," said 25-year-old Halep after her fifth win in six meetings against Pliskova, the world number three.
"It was extremely tough today as Karolina is a very tough opponent. To be in the final again is great. I hope to win this time. "But I am facing a young opponent, it will be a big challenge."
Pliskova ended the tie with 45 winners and a staggering 55 unforced errors.
In contrast, Halep registered 14 in both columns.
For Halep, the win came just a day after she saved a match point and came from a set and 1-5 to beat Elina Svitolina in the last eight.
Pliskova, the 25-year-old Czech, would have taken the world top spot if she had made her second Slam final.
In the end, she could at least reflect on progress in Paris -- before this year, she had never got beyond the second round in five attempts.
Ostapenko presented herself with the perfect 20th birthday gift by reaching a first French Open final after blasting past 30th seed Bacsinszky, a semi-finalist also in 2015.
"I'm really happy to be in the final, especially on my birthday. I think it's a nice gift," said Ostapenko, whose win was greeted by the crowd singing 'happy birthday'.
The world number 47 is the first unseeded player to reach the final in Paris since Mima Jausovec in 1983.
Ostapenko is also the youngest woman to advance to the final of a major since a 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki finished runner-up at the 2009 US Open.
"I was always playing aggressive and hitting the ball when I have a chance," said Ostapenko, who smacked 50 winners to Bacsinszky's 22.
"It was a really tough match. I think it was a battle.
"I think it was kind of important that I won the first set, even the second I lost, but in the third set I found my game again.
"I felt a little bit tight because...I was very close to making the final and some thoughts were in my mind," added Ostapenko, whose previous best run at a Slam was reaching the third round at the Australian Open.
"But then I was just trying to be calm and just to try to play my game and just enjoy every moment."
For Bacsinszky it was a second semi-final defeat in Paris.
"Of course I'm disappointed. I'm a competitor, and it really annoys me not to be in the final," said Bacsinszky, who was beaten on her 28th birthday.
"I'm not ashamed to say that she played better. She was braver. She had more courage. She was more successful."
Ostapenko fell in the first round on her main draw debut in Paris last year but is one win away from becoming the first player since Gustavo Kuerten in 1997 to win their maiden tour-level title at a Slam.
Ostapenko fired 50 winners and 45 unforced errors in her victory.
She has 245 winners from six rounds -- more than Andy Murray's 174 after five matches.  AFP

## Title: Hung Parliament in Britain

Hung Parliament in Britain
* Defiant May vows to stay on
* Likely to secure support of Northern Irelands (DUP) to get over the line
* May says new govt. will lead Britain out of EU
* EU President urges delay in Brexit talks
* British Pound tumbles
* Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn urges May to quit
* Conservatives - 318 seats, down from 331 in 2015
* Labour -261, up from 229 in 2015
A defiant Prime Minister Theresa May vowed yesterday to form a new government to lead Britain out of the EU despite losing her majority in a snap general election and facing calls to resign.
What the country needs more than ever is certainty, May said.
The Conservative leader had called Thursdays vote in a bid to extend her majority and strengthen her hand in the looming Brexit negotiations, but her gamble backfired spectacularly.
Although winning the most seats, her centre-right party lost its majority in Parliament, meaning it will now rely on support from Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
May vowed to fulfil the promise of Brexit, in a statement outside her Downing Street office in London after seeking permission from the head of state Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government.
It is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party has the legitimacy and ability to provide that.
This will allow us to come together as a country and channel our energies towards a successful Brexit deal.
The Conservatives and the pro-Brexit DUP are expected to team up on a vote-by-vote basis rather than enter a formal alliance after the stunning result left Britain with a hung parliament.
Sterling sank against the dollar and the euro on Friday as doubt was cast on the whole Brexit process.
EU President Donald Tusk urged Britain not to delay the talks, due to start on June 19, warning that time was running out to reach a divorce deal to end four decades of membership.
We dont know when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a no deal as result of no negotiations, Tusk wrote on Twitter.
May faced pressure to quit from opposition parties after a troubled campaign overshadowed by two terror attacks, but said Britain needs a period of stability.
But Leftist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour party surged from 20 points behind in the opinion polls, told May to quit, saying she had lost votes, lost support and lost confidence.
Tory supporter Nick, 31, blamed the defeat on Mays arrogance.
It serves her right. Whoever takes over has to understand campaigning is important, he told AFP in London.
With all but one constituency declared, the Conservatives won 318 seats -- down from 331 at the 2015 election -- while Labour was on 262, up from 229.
May, a 60-year-old vicars daughter, is now facing questions over her judgement in calling the election three years early and risking her partys slim but stable working majority of 17.
The result is exactly the opposite of why she held the election and she then has to go and negotiate Brexit in that weakened position, said Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics university.
Newspapers reflected the political tumult, with headlines such as Britain on a knife edge, Mayhem and Hanging by a thread.
In a night that redrew the political landscape once again, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) lost millions of voters, triggering the resignation of leader Paul Nuttall.
The Scottish National Party of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, which has dominated politics north of the border for a decade and called for a new independence vote after Brexit, lost 21 of the 56 seats it won in 2015.
Sturgeon said the result showed that the reckless Tory pursuit of a hard Brexit must now be abandoned.
May, who took over after the June 2016 Brexit referendum, began the formal two-year process of leaving the EU on March 29, promising to take Britain out of the single market and cut immigration.
Seeking to capitalise on sky-high popularity ratings, she called the election a few weeks later, urging voters to give her a stronger mandate.
Officials in Brussels were hopeful the election would allow her to make compromises, but this has been thrown into question by the prospect of a hung Parliament.
It creates another layer of uncertainty ahead of the Brexit negotiations, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA currency traders.
Despite campaigning against Brexit, Labour has accepted the result but promised to avoid a hard Brexit, focusing on maintaining economic ties with the bloc. Barely a month ago, the centre-left party seemed doomed to lose the election, plagued by internal divisions over its direction under veteran socialist Corbyn.
But Mays botched announcement of a reform in funding for elderly care, plus a strong grassroots campaign by Corbyn which energised the youth vote, gave him momentum.
Britain has also been hit with three terror attacks since March, and campaigning was twice suspended. - AFP

Iran attacks reinforce hatred for US, Saudi: Khamenei
IRAN: The attacks in Tehran this week will only reinforce hatred for the United States and Saudi Arabia, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Friday at the funerals for those killed.
Such acts will have no other result than to reinforce hatred for the US government and its agents in the region, like the Saudi (government), Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in a message of condolence to the families of the dead.
Wednesday's attacks on Tehran's Parliament complex and the shrine of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed 17 people and wounded more than 50.
They were the first attacks in Iran to have been claimed by the Islamic State group.
The funerals for those killed began on Friday morning in Tehran with a ceremony in Parliament.
After prayers, a procession will leave Tehran University for the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, near the Khomeini mausoleum 13 kilometres (eight miles) south of the Iranian capital.
The intelligence ministry said the attacks were carried out by five Iranian men who had joined IS and travelled to their bastions in Iraq and Syria before returning home.
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard has accused regional rival Saudi Arabia of involvement in the attacks. But Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said we still cannot judge that Saudi Arabia has had a role in this terrorist incident.

Tourism Development and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga regretted last Thursdays incident where he was compelled to ask journalists to leave his residence.
He said the new found press freedom is being abused by a section of the media to bring the government into disrepute.
He said some journalists have no respect for the truth nor the basic decency to report on facts, the Ministers media secretary and former Western Provincial Minister Lawrence Madiwela said in a statement clarifying the circumstances that led the minister to respond to the journalists at the time.

Madiwela said a meeting was held at his residence at Kandana to discuss waste disposal at Muthurajawela premises and its impact on the environment with the residents in the area.
No journalist was invited to cover this meeting and it was open only for members of the organization protecting the Muthurajawela wetlands, Madiwela in his statement said.
He said that Minister Amaratunga was compelled to ask the journalists to leave his residence as they were posing the same issue repeatedly with a hidden agenda in mind.

The loneliness of being Farokh Engineer
LONDON: For those who came in late, Farokh Engineer was one of Indian cricket's original glamour boys - along with the likes of Salim Durani and ML Jaisimha - redefining cool with his charisma, 'keeping and debonair batsmanship.
Now, at 80, the sideburns, dimples and sparkle of youth is gone, replaced by wrinkles and sagacity. Some of the dash, though, is admirably intact.
An outspoken personality, Engineer has never been known to toe the common line.
Yet now, in his twilight years, there seems to linger in him a tinge of regret for unheeded accomplishments, a longing for Mumbai, a need to return 'home'. A realization that he has lived his life, in essence, as an outcast.
"Outcast That's too strong a word," Engineer tells TOI over a cup of tea as rain pelts Birmingham. "I first came to England in 1966. My Lancashire stint started in 1968. I stayed on. They wanted me to. Yet if you ask me if I would embrace India or England, I would proudly say India. I have retained my Indian nationality and passport. My soul is Indian."
Engineer was one of the first Indians to play as a professional in county cricket, and had offers from Worcestershire, Somerset, and Hampshire before he settled on Lancashire and made Manchester his home.
"I couldn't resist the prospect of keeping to the furious Brain Statham," says the man who kept to India's famed spin trio. "Garry Sobers was in talks too but he and Lancashire agreed to disagree. Then Clive (Lloyd) came in and we had a remarkable time. They just wouldn't let me go. They gave me three-year-contracts. At that time I would also play all Ranji games, all Duleep Trophy matches."
After 1976, he stayed on, bought a house in Cheshire, started a business - that of exporting textiles to the Caribbean - and for all intents and purposes became English. "I get the feeling India cricket kind of forgot me. I kept wanting to go back, but the price of property kept going up in Mumbai.
"Sadly, I have never, ever got a coaching offer from India, though MS Dhoni himself came to me early on his career and we worked on a few things with his 'keeping. Some of the coaches I see there aren't exactly top grade.
I am appalled the CK Nayudu award has eluded me, and gone to Padmakar Shivalkar and Rajinder Goel. All respect to them, but they didn't play Test cricket."
Engineer is reluctant to reveal what he taught Dhoni, simply saying "that is between me and him", but does reveal that he lost all his money sometime in the early 1990s, when the Bank of Credit and Commerce collapsed.
"I lost a million pounds in a day. It was a difficult time. I had to come to terms with it. My business collapsed. My lifestyle changed. But I recovered from that too. That's life."
Engineer reveals that he is only one of two people - along with MAK Pataudi - to have not got a benefit match in Sharjah. "We got a one-time payment, and people confuse the two. I get the BCCI pension, of course, around 300 pounds a month, and I'm grateful.
But that's not the point. Why weren't my cricketing talents better used by India I was the only Indian in the Rest of the World XI at that time."
These days, we usually see Farokh Engineer the commentator or TV pundit. Rarely do we get a glimpse of Engineer the person. "That happens," he simply says, appearing to lose interest in the issue. So has Indian cricket made him feel like a pariah
"Yes," says Engineer, appearing perplexed. "But I'm Indian, you know. I just stay here." - TOI

LONDON, Thursday  Angelo Mathews saluted Sri Lankas underdogs after they staged a brilliant run chase to stun Champions Trophy holders India by seven wickets on Thursday.
Mathews side were written off by many experts in the build-up to the crucial Group B clash at The Oval, but they ignored the doubters to keep alive their bid to qualify for the semi-finals.
Tasked with chasing 322 to win, Sri Lanka knocked off the runs with eight balls to spare thanks to memorable contributions from Kusal Mendis (89), Danushka Gunathilaka (76) and captain Mathews (52).
Its one of the top wins, to beat India. The bowlers did brilliantly to restrict India to 321. It was a very chaseable target, Mathews said.
Not many people expected us to win and that took a lot of pressure off us.
I thought the second-wicket partnership (between Gunathilaka and Mendis) was vital. They set us the platform.
It wasnt easy for Gunathilaka to walk into the side and bat like how he did.
It was an emotional return for Mathews, who hadnt played an ODI since August following a calf injury.
His calm innings steadied the ship just as India were trying to regain the momentum.
I tried to hit as many balls in the nets as possible, it makes you feel good and that helped me come back from injury, he said.
Sri Lanka can qualify for the semi-finals if they beat Pakistan in their final group match in Cardiff on June 12, while India must beat South Africa on June 11 to avoid a humiliating exit.
Its a must-win game for all of us in the group, Mathews added.
India captain Virat Kholi admitted Sri Lanka deserved their famous win, but he was disappointed his bowlers didnt follow the game-plan.
We felt we had enough on the board. We trusted out bowlers, but Sri Lanka were pretty good. They kept the momentum through the innings, they picked their areas to hit and executed really well, Kohli said.
Theres always hindsight. I thought we bowled decently, but when you dont execute properly, there is always food for thought.
You have to give credit to the other team. In a tournament like this especially.  AFP

Mihintale to get new power system before next Poson
Poson Full Moon Poya Day Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja was switched on by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya with Ministers Duminda Dissanayake and Chandrani Bandara amidst seth pirith chanting by the Maha Sangha headed by Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven Valawahangunawewa Dhammarathana Nayaka Thera.
Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said he instructed the CEB management to take action to replace the present 15 year-old Mihintale electricity system with an advanced power supply mechanism before next Poson.
He added that Mihintale is the place where the greatest religious revolution took place; a revolution sans bloodshed, violence or destruction, making the country civilized and spiritually advanced, with the endowment of Buddhism by Arahat Mahinda. He lauded the Founder of Lake House late D. R. Wijewardana, his heirs and the Lake House Management for the contribution to make the Aloka Pooja a reality.
In his anusasana, the Prelate said that historic Mihinthale was the only place in the world where an army of 40,000 including the king of the country dropped their weapons brought in to hunt deer, and took to the path of non-violence and compassion, inspired by Arahat Mahinda and the Buddhist entourage from India.

Muralitharan formally inducted into ICC Cricket Hall of Fame
The most successful bowler in Tests and One Day Internationals, Muttiah Muralitharan was on Thursday formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame by ICC Chief Executive David Richardson during the innings break of the India versus Sri Lanka ICC Champions Trophy match at The Oval.
The retired Sri Lanka spin great was awarded the honour along with Arthur Morris, George Lohmann and Karen Rolton by fellow ICC Cricket Hall of Famers and members of the media.
He became the first player from Sri Lanka and the 83rd overall to be formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame when Mr. Richardson presented him with a commemorative framed cap.
Muralitharan: It is a moment of great pride and honour to be receiving this award, especially from the ICC which is the ultimate any cricketer can aspire to achieve.
The induction during this prestigious ICC Champions Trophy makes it even more remarkable.
I thank the ICC for making this possible because this is a moment I will cherish throughout life.
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson: Muralis record speaks for itself.
His control of line, pace and length coupled with his ability to spin the ball prodigiously are legendary. Once he developed the doosra he became almost unplayable.
A character popular with fellow players and fans alike, he not only helped raise the profile of Sri Lankan cricket but was a player people came out to watch the world over. I congratulate him on behalf of the ICC on being inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

Nearly Rs.8,869 m required for post-flood reconstruction: Minister Yapa
Nearly Rs.8,869 million is required to rectify the damages caused by the recent catastrophic floods and landslides, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said yesterday.
He said this amount can be recovered from the insurance trust fund due the Insurance Policy that the government has taken covering all the people and the houses in the country.
The Minister made these observations yesterday in response to a query raised by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti. The Minister was responding to the Adjournment motion.
You have said that Rs.8 billion is needed to rectify the damages caused by the floods. But, we need to know if the Insurance Trust Fund is paying this amount.
There is a notion that the it would not be possible to obtain this amount from the insurance fund as the government has failed to pay the premium MP Handunnetti said.
Minister Yapa said that the full amount or more would be obtained from the insurance trust fund. We have already received an advance of Rs.150 million,the Minister said. On the other hand last year we got Rs 3.135 billion to provide relief and construct the houses for the people who were affected by flood and landslides last year.

New importance to the Message of Mihintale
The Poson Festival stands out as the beginning of a new civilization and culture in this country based on the teachings of the Buddha. The more than one million Buddhists who travelled to the several important shrines to participate in religious rituals, listen to Bana preaching, and worship at these shrines show the importance of Poson in the cultural being of Sri Lanka.
In the context of the crises the country has faced in recent times, and the necessity to overcome situations that lead to such crises, both social and political, as well as be ready to face up to natural disaster that has been in focus in recent weeks, there is a major expectation from the Poson festivities. It is the hope that the Poson Festival observances would not be confined to rituals, but lead to the stronger infusion of Buddhist thinking into society, in a manner that would enrich our social values, bringing about a sea change of attitudes that would cover individual life styles, as well as the tasks of politics and governance in the country.
Many have observed that we are going through a phase in society when religious teaching is increasingly confined to rituals and day-to-day practices of convenience, with less of the deeper and richer meaning of Buddhist teaching. The significance of Poson is in reviving the acceptance of Buddhist teaching and values brought by the Arahat Mahinda that will help enrich our society and culture, as it did when this historic change took place more than 2300 years ago.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his message to mark this Poson festival said: We commenced our journey through a new civilization on the day King Devanampiya Tissa ended the game of deer hunting in Mihintale. With the king who relinquished the bow and arrow on that day, our nation accessed into a path of a new life guided through the concept of Panchasheela, non-violence, compassion and loving-kindness.
On that day we not only received the heritage of a new doctrine, but also the gift of an enriched civilization, education, literature, architecture, agriculture as well as the livelihood traditions of the contemporary Mauryan Kingdom of Bharat.
This highlights the contribution made by Buddhism to the enrichment of Sri Lankan society, with the impact it had on our education, literature, architecture, and agriculture, together with the livelihood traditions of the then Maurya Kingdom of Bharat.
This underlines the necessity for the true values of Buddhism to be further embraced and promoted in our society today, as a means of facing up to the demands and challenges of the modern world, including economics, development and governance, as well as good relations with our neighbours.
In the context of the situation the country faces today, in social organisation and governance, the aspects of equality, reconciliation and peace building in the post-terrorist situation, and the necessity to strengthen ethnic relations and overcome the challenges to good ethnic relations being faced today, and the unfortunate involvement of those in yellow robes in this new challenge; it is the strongest hope that this Poson festival will help in the stronger restoration of Buddhist thinking in our society, and help us move away from the irrationalities and unrealities that seek to divide our society, leading to the dangers of disunity.
Post shake up
The inability of the Gazette notification that will lay out the functions of each minister after the recent Cabinet Reshuffle, points to both the major differences that prevail in the coalition of National Unity as well as the lack of organisational thinking before the re-shuffle was announced. This is regrettable because this shake up took a long time coming, with many postponements, and was finally pushed through in the post-Vesak period. There is no doubt that many ministers would like to keep what they consider their favourite subjects or institutions, even after changing of portfolios. But this is certainly not the stuff of a good re-shuffle. We have seen in the past in this country, as well as in other countries that have electoral democracies, how ministers handling what are considered important or powerful ministries are moved on to ministries of lesser importance, without the fuss that we see in this post shake up politics in Sri Lanka today.
What is necessary is for the ministerial functions in the shakeup situation to be announced, with the absence of situations where those who have moved to new ministries carry with them departments, corporations and other institutions that have no relation to the new portfolios they hold, and have sworn to accept. The shake up having come almost in sync with the recent floods and landslide disasters, there was certainly a clear delay in the proper and speedy addressing of the needs of the crisis due to the internal or personal disagreements on the assigned departments and functions. This needs to be solved with no more delay, if the role of government is to be effective in the months ahead that will require addressing many issues that are more important to the people than the offices and functions held by various ministers.
The delay in allocating these functions, has also led to the situation of room availability for deputy and state ministers who are also involved in this shake up, This is also a matter that has to be resolved with speed, because what these disagreements do is to deepen the rifts within the governing coalition, leading to more public expressions of the disagreements between the UNP and SLFP within the government. This promotes the forces of those ranged against the government, whether in the Joint Opposition and/or the rapidly spreading racist and ethnic divisive forces that will be posing a major threat to governance in the coming months, with the heating up of the politics and discord in the country.
Ethnic and religious violence
An important aspect of this dangerous trend in the country is the task of arresting the growing trend of religious violence in the country. With a clear delay in the Police taking necessary action to curb this trend, despite various circulars being issued by the IGP and many statements made about the commitment of the Police to carry out this necessary task, it has now become necessary for President Sirisena to state that the Army could be brought in to arrest those who perpetrate these crimes.
The President said this when he met Government Ministers and MPs on Wednesday, when he asked why government MPs do not tell the people who were really behind these incidents of violence, and that they were being carried out by a group backed by the Opposition. He was responding to UNP MP Mujibur Rahmans complaint that the government had failed to arrest those who promote religious and communal hatred.
The situation is certainly more confusing and dangerous with the Cabinet Co-Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, telling the media at Wednesdays post-Cabinet briefing that it would be a difficult task for the Police to arrest the Bodu Bala Sena leader Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera, on whom a warrant has been issued, if he was being protected by a Minister.
The Presidents statement of the possible necessity of bringing the Army to carry out this task, as well as a Cabinet Spokesmans comment about a minister protecting the BBS leader, for whose arrest a warrant has been issued, certainly shows major confusion as well as contradictions within government, on how this matter has to be addressed, and the roles of both those in Government and the Opposition in this matter. Such contradiction certainly does not help to resolve this issue, and restore communal harmony in the country, which has already moved to international concerns over inaction on this.
The country that is slowly recovering from the recent natural disaster and the related overall disaster unpreparedness of the government authorities, and, seeing the confusion on governance following the Cabinet shake up, certainly does not deserve to be pushed into a state of communal and/or religious clashes of any scale or nature. The battle against Tamil federalism that expanded to separatist terrorism due to many wrongs, flaws and delays on the part of previous governments, should be a lesson to the present government on the necessity of keeping to the principles of national unity that saw the major electoral change in the country in January 2015.
The Maithri Paalanaya or Government with Maithri or Loving Kindness is what the majority of people voted for, bringing unity among Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. The efforts to bring about new antagonisms in the country with the current activities of the promoters of communal and religious hatred certainly need the strongest response from the government, whatever the threats or warnings given by those who participating and encouraging this new wave of communal and religious hatred. Such action for unity with Maithri is certainly the strongest message that this Poson Festival must give.

Warnings were sent prior to disaster: Minister Yapa
The Disaster Management Ministry had sent warnings before the recent catastrophic flood, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa yesterday said.
"The Ministry through the Disaster Management Centre had sent the warnings to the relevant government institutions and the media prior to the disaster," the Minister said. "Not only that the Ministry had taken commendable measures to rescue people, but also taken measures to protect and provide them with reliefs," he said.
He said many saved their lives thanks to the warnings but some who did not heed became victims to the disaster.
He made these observations yesterday in response to the adjournment motion moved by JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti on the recent catastrophic flood.
He said that the Disaster Management Ministry and the Act were set and passed in 2005 following the Tsunami that hit the country.
The Minister said the natural disasters - floods, storms and land slides - are mostly related to the water. The Meteorological Department make their predictions using the Numerical Weather Prediction technology. "We cannot depend on the international data. The flood situation is provided by the Irrigation Department and the warnings are made based on the same data by the Disaster Management Centre," he said.
"The Disaster Management Centre had made all the required warnings. We had sent those warnings to the media and other related institutions. "One foreign journalist in Sri Lanka told me that they received the warnings," Minister said. "I table all those log reports from May 24 to May 29 of the warnings."
He said the main task of the disaster management is played by the tri forces. The Disaster Management Ministry had spent Rs. 100 million for the tri-forces last year on their training in disaster management. The others who play the important role are the Public Administration Ministry officers led by the Government Agents.
"After the data and the warnings were received by the institutions and the officers, they had conveyed the message to the people in the vulnerable areas using the loudspeakers," Minister Yapa said.
He aid the last step of the mechanism is implemented by the Divisional Secretary, GA and Gramaseva Niladri Officers. "If some one think that those officers are out of the mechanism that is wrong and the mechanism could not be implemented," Minister said.
"If the disaster is so massive that it is a part of the mechanism to inform the Security Forces to get their assistance. This time they had deployed more than 8,500 personnel to manage the situation," the Minister said.
He said they had provided more than 100,000 meal packets to the flood affected.
Seven canteen of theirs had prepared the meals. The Navy had deployed 120 dingy boats and provided more than 100,000 dry rations to the people. The Air Force had engaged in 211 flying hours at a cost of USD 1,500 each hour.
"I totally disagree the allegation that the government did not involve amply to provide relief to the flood affected people," Disaster Management Minister said. "When the provision of the facilities to the flood affected people is concerned, it is the responsibility of the Divisional Secretariat and the Grama Niladari Officer to attend to them," he said.
There is one issue. We have not set up disaster centres as natural disasters amply experienced by the country. Constructing such centres have been commenced in Gampaha, Kegalle and Badulla with the funds of Asian Development Bank.
He said the Divisional Secretary and the Grama Niladari provide food to people after buying them from relevant places and the bills would be settled by the government. The government has so far spent Rs. 266 million for the food of the flood affected people during the recent disaster. We have also planed to provide them with dry rations. We have a plan to get Cabinet approval to grant a house rental for those who have no place to go since their houses were destroyed by the disaster.
The Minister said there is a plan to settle those in vulnerable areas on government lands or at other places temporarily. "We ave prepared three housing plans for the people in vulnerable areas which could be built at a cost of Rs 1.2 million," the Minister said. "Now the houses in Aranayake are constructed. The government has planned to grant Rs. 1.2 million to construct their houses," the Minister said.
"It is only Sri Lanka in the Asian Region that has insured all the people and houses in the country. We have to be proud of it," the Minister said. "We have paid Rs. 300 million to the insurance company for the purpose. The 1.2 million is granted in addition to the insurance," he said.
He said the mountain peaks in the country have been cultivated with tea. "They cannot hold the rainfall. People have settled by the side of the Nilawala river. We need a national policy to prevent them," he said.
Rs. 2,280 million will be spent on the houses destroyed in the Kegalle district. We have already spent Rs. 1,185 million to provide reliefs to flood affected people. The Chinese Government build 100 houses while the Habitat construct 80 houses. 50 houses have been constructed. some other institutions including the security forces are constructing over 60 houses. He said the people in 58 divisional secretariats were affected by drought and Rs 240.2 million is spent to provide reliefs to them.
"The Asian Development Bank has promised to grant us 200 rain gauges, while Japan has promised to give us two doppler radars," the Minister said.
Radical transformation of system of governance imperative: Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan
A radical transformation of the system of governance to ensure peoples participatory approach is imperative, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said.
Sampanthan used the Parliamentary debate on disaster situation yesterday to draw the attention of the House to the need of giving more responsibilities and powers to the provincial authorities to efficiently handle disaster management related activities.
He said greater interaction between people and government institutions must be established.
Under the system we now have, everything is controlled by the Centre. All governmental powers are exercised by Colombo. This leads to corruption as it lacks transparency. Greater interaction with people in the area not only reduce corruption but also leads to more efficiency and minimise delays, he said. Our governance has barely changed since the independence. We see the country is stagnating while other countries are advancing. Our system does not represent the democratic wishes of the people. We need to restructure our system of State and governance, he said.
The Opposition Leader thanked the swift relief measures sent by other countries and observed that those aids portray the international goodwill towards Sri Lanka.
Regional authorities unequipped to handle emergency situation: Handunnetti
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti yesterday questioned in Parliament the disaster preparedness of the relevant government institutions and pointed out that the regional authorities lack boats, generators and water bowsers to be used at an emergency situation.
Handunetti was moving an adjournment motion on the recent flood and landslide havoc in the country in Parliament yesterday. Parliament yesterday facilitated nine and half hours debate on the disaster situation extending the sitting time till 8pm.
Oral questions and questions under the Standing Orders 23 (2), usually taken up at the commencement of sittings, were postponed and the debate continued without a lunch break to facilitate more time for the debate. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the sitting time was extended as many members wanted to speak at the debate. MP Handunnetti, who moved the motion, said many areas went under water since the river mouths were not properly maintained. He asked the government to build anicuts where necessary and invest money on new technological equipment such as Watermasters which are used for dredging, piling and raking.
The MP accused that the evacuated families are being resettled in the same risky places. He said Morawakakanda and Ayagama are examples for the claim. He said the government wants Rs. 8,886 million to pay compensation for the lives lost and fully damaged houses.
Deliberate attempt to tarnish my reputation: Minister Gayantha
Parliamentary Reforms and Lands Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said the CID has found out the perpetrator who distributed some bananas among the disaster affected people pasting his (Minister's) name on the cover.
Minister Karunathilake said it was a deliberate attempt to disrepute him. He made these observations in Parliament yesterday when UPFA MP Chandrasiri Gajadeera inquired about the incident.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella adding to Karunathilakes reply said the CID had found out that a Joint Opposition MP was engaged in a mudslinging campaign in web-based and social media against selected politicians in the government. He has employed a team of about 40 persons for the purpose, he said.
Minister Karunathilake, observing that he was subjected to virulent attack in the social media due to this incident, said the people living in his area are well-aware that he does not resort to such cheap acts.
Dinesh asks for Standing Committee to monitor post-disaster relief activities
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena requested to set up a Standing Committee in Parliament to monitor the progress of post disaster relief activities and compensation payment.
The MP made this request joining in the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday. He said all districts affected by floods and landslides should be represented in the Committee.
A massive flood hit the country last year too, but compensations are yet to be paid to half of the affected. This is despite the claims by the government that there will be immediate compensation. Therefore, I request to appoint a Parliamentary Committee to monitor the progress of the Disaster Management Ministry and relevant departments in implementing post disaster activities, he said.
The MP said the loss from the recent natural calamity exceeds Rs 35 billion as of the reports available so far. This includes damages to property, livelihood, industries and trade, he said.
The MP requested the government to continue paying daily wages of estate workers in affected areas. Observing that there is a delay in activating state disaster management mechanism in the country, the MP requested the government to take measures to rectify the weakness.
MP Gunawardena requested the government to release the land where the Salawa Army Camp is located to rebuild the town. The government promised to remove the army camp from the town following the explosion last year. Without taking measures to relocate the camp, the Army has spent a large sum of money to erect a clock tower at the centre of the town, he said.
House bears extra cost for extended debate
Parliament had to bear an extra cost in facilitating the nine and half hour long debate on the recent flood and landslide disasters yesterday.
Parliament had to arrange dinner for Parliamentarians, Parliamentary staff and the media as the sittings was extended till 8pm yesterday. Many members of the Government and the Opposition were keen to join in the debate to place their views in record. However, only a handful of members remained in the House throughout the debate.
Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma, who received admiration for his active contribution to provide relief to the affected people, did not take part in the debate.
Parliament also postponed oral questions and questions under the Standing Orders 23 (2) usually taken up at the commencement of sittings to facilitate more time for the debate and the debate continued even without a lunch break.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya previously told Parliament that Rs. 4.6 million public funds are being spent on each parliamentary sitting.

Peoples Power to the fore
Today we see the development of an anti racist rationalist peoples movement that critically supports the present Yahapalana government with the intention of establishment of democratic constitution. They see this change with a substantial devolution and the implementation of promises to remove corruption and violation of human rights.
Now many believe that without such a peoples movement, it will be impossible to go forward, defeating fascistic forces hell bent on conspiracy. In recent past several well attended meetings were called by the civil society leaders who worked hard for the democratic change that brought Yahapalanaya to power.
In these meetings Prof Sarath Wijesooriya, Gamini Viyangoda, Saman Rathnapriya, Weliamuna and others participated. Similar views were expressed by Azath Salley and Lakshan Dias speaking against rise of racism in the Lankan society. They point out that organised attacks were made to Christian and Muslim religious places in the recent weeks. We have congregated here because we are losing faith in the present government. The Yahapalanaya government has been tripping and falling like small children. At first they had set backs once in three months, then monthly and now weekly. When we look at the statements of political leaders and Ministers, we see that they have been failing habitually, said Gamini Viyangoda.
Equal political ideals
The Yahapalanaya National Unity Government, unlike the previous coalition Governments, is very important politically. Coalition Governments were formed by parties, which had equal or almost equal political ideals. But for the first time two parties with opposing ideals have come together. This is why it is called a National Government, he added. He noted that this was the first time a candidate came to power without representing any political party. The candidate swore to be politically neutral, but after January 8 we saw him accepting certain responsibilities of the SLFP and the UNP. The fight for power between these two parties is augmenting day-by-day and we dont see them equalizing. They say sectarian party politics has entered Yahapalanaya and this why they see it falling and tripping.
On January 8, 2015 it was the citizens of the country who truly liberated us. We were able to see how people who were hard black rocks become eroded to sand with the changes brought on January 8. The dictatorship was abolished and now we also have a strong Opposition. During the last regime, the people of our country were in fear of their lives. Even Sobitha Thera wanted to abolish the Executive Presidency before he passed away.
However, the people are losing faith in Good Governance, as promises are broken and - programmes have failed, Prof. Wijesooriya said. Ven. Sobitha Thera gave the previous Government a bill that consisted of 10 proposals that should be considered for good governance. However, the President and the Prime Minister dismissed these proposals. This was considered extremely disadvantageous for the Government. My main goal is for the Yahapalanaya Government to follow the conditions laid out by Sobitha Thera one day, he added. He stated that one of the conditions of the 10 proposals had been to eradicate the Executive Presidency system.
In one of Sobitha Theras birthday ceremonies the President and the Prime Minister promised to abolish it. However, this is still not carried through. From January 8 we wanted to build a new nation for the future of our children, with the help of all the people of the country. The Government should serve those who truly serve the country, instead of wasting money on the lavish lives of those who are internally involved with the Government. Many of the political leaders and high ranking Government officials of the last regime worked for their own selfish needs by committing fraud. They ran the Government in a wrong way. Those who were in the previous Government perpetually criticize Good Governance; however, they did not even admit their own past wrongs, he added.
National democratic tasks
In any country the national democratic tasks should be completed for it to function as proper market economy accepted within the global capitalist framework. Among the tasks carried out, the democratization of the state by removing absolutist and dictatorial features in the state, and unification of the country by free association of all nationalities is most important. In the modern world, globally all eyes are watching what is happening. In spite of global powers led by US, truth inevitably comes out and leaders have to answer. The clash of opinions in UK after the terrible attack in London is an example of divisions within their societies. For an interested party, all views and deals within social groups are available for analysis.
Corbyn the Labour leader took a swipe at the Conservatives close alliance with Saudi Arabia and called for a clampdown on the funding of Islamist sectarian organisations in the UK. We do need to have some difficult conversations starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology, he said. Corbyn questioned why, as disclosed by Guardian, PM May had failed to publish a report commissioned by David Cameron into funding of Jihad groups which is thought to focus on Saudi Arabia. At the same time the shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, said Mays statement on Sunday morning appeared to be a breach of an agreement with Labour to put aside political campaigning.
Thus the debates between the right and the left in countries such as US and UK show us the power of masses, in particular the workers in those countries. In the recent debate on environment, media exposed how multinational companies give money to Donald Trump to destroy the earth saving multinational agreements. In spite of himself, such evidence shows the power of big MNCs to push around ideological giants like fascistic Trump! Hence we cannot under estimate the power of international campaigns and international relations, in particular social and political links that represent peoples power.
Traditional left parties
In the past we saw a radical left mass movement developing in this country under the leadership of Vijaya Kumaranatunage. It was a spontaneous peoples movement that absorbed the traditional left parties. Vijaya started his political career in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). He later joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and became its first national organiser. He broke out from the SLFP as it stood against devolution, and he founded the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP), which campaigned for peace demanding peace in the Sri Lankan civil war. Under his new party, he contested a Minneriya by-election and finished second, behind the UNP candidaterelegating his old party, SLFP, to third place.
In 1986, Kumaranatunage visited Jaffna, then controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He visited the Nallur Murugan Temple and met with local Tamil civilians, as well as several LTTE youth leaders. In his final public address, to a large crowd in Colombos Campbell Park on January 28, 1988, Kumaratunge lashed out at the UNP, SLFP, and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parties for failing to address the needs of the hour. He also voiced concerns about the SLFPs links with the JVP, a MarxistLeninist Party involved in building a chauvinist patriotic movement.
In 1988, the SLMP reached an agreement with several other left-wing partiesincluding the LSSP, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP), and Sri Lanka Communist Party, to form the United Socialist Alliance (USA). A few days prior to the establishment of the new alliance, Kumaranatunge was assassinated.
The agreement was signed by party leaders at his funeral. However movement collapsed without proper leadership though the USA won a large number of seats in the newly formed Provincial Councils in an election boycotted by the main opposition SLFP. It remains in the minds of radical democratic political activists who want to release LANKA from barbaric racism and the plunder of global capitalism of Donald Trump and La Pen.

Peterite  Trinity should be a thriller
St. Peters College Bambalapitiya will be at full strength and raring to go when they take on Trinity College Kandy in their Milo A Division inter-schools knockout rugby quarterfinal match at the Sugathadasa Stadium today at 4:15pm.
Led by nippy full back Diyath Fernando the Peterites got some good players who could be match winners for the Bambalapitiya outfit.
Players such as fly half and playmaker Steffen Sivaraj, centre Theekshana Dassanayaka, number eight Angelo Mendis, flanker Sajith Saram, scrum half Raveen Fernando and skipper Diyath Fernando should be marked well by the Trinitians if not they will be in deep trouble like they got into the league game.
The Peterites, one of the strongest contenders for the Milo knockout championship this year, will be out for another shock win when they meet Trinity. The Peterites coached by former junior Sri Lanka coaches Colin Denish and Terence Henry, should have things their own way in this encounter.
The Bambalapitiya school in the just concluded league tournament beat the Antonians, D.S. Senanayake, Isipathana, Zahira and formidable Trinity but lost to Royal, Wesley, Dharmaraja and drew with S. Thomas in a tense battle.
Playmaker Sivarajs kicking boot will play a major role in this game.
Meanwhile Trinitians the dark horse of the Milo knockout, will be out for a quarterfinal win and keep their chances alive to move forward to grab the Cup championship. They will be heavily depend on their skipper Nathan Yee, playmaker cum half back Anouka Boyagoda, the two Bandaranayake brothers Reshan and Rashen, hooker Weliwatte, prop forward Aveesha Priyankara, centres Waren Weerakoon and Dilukshan Dange together with fly half Akitha Sakalasuriya.
Trinity lost two games within close margins to St. Peters and Royal but got the better of the Wesley, Science, Zahira, S. Thomas, Prince of Wales, St. Josephs and Isipathana in the just concluded league tourney.
Going by the two teams performances so far, this encounter should be a close tussle for supremacy with St. Peters holding a slight edge over Trinity as they beat them 15-13 in the league match.

Posers on education
Sri Lanka is known all over the world for having one of the best free education systems and a very high literacy rate. All Sri Lankan Governments have been committed to the concept of universal free education.
However, statistics revealed recently by the Department of Census and Statistics reveals that 452,661 children in the 5-17 age group are not attending school and 51,249 children among them have never attended school. This is indeed a very disturbing revelation, because the general consensus in society is that nearly all children of school going age are attending school.
The Child Activity Survey 2016 reveals that the main reasons for children not to attend school are disinterest in education, non consideration of the value of education, too young (not eligible to enter school), disability, financial difficulties and leaving school before completion of studies to support families. Note that the study included children who had completed the G.C.E. Ordinary Level examination and were waiting at home before the commencement of Advanced Level classes. Leaving a margin of 100,000 for such students, it means nearly 350,000 other students are still out of the education system.
The statistics go further: Around 89 percent of children currently not attending school had previously attended school. Around 11 percent of children are either not attending school or have never attended school. The percentage of children who have never attended school is higher in the 5-11 age group due to them being too young to enter school.
The survey collected information considering about 16 different reasons for not attending school. Curiously, in sharp contrast to most other South Asian countries, boys in Sri Lanka were more likely to skip schooling than girls. The silver lining in the last statistic is that Sri Lankan parents seem to be very keen to send their girls to school. Indeed, Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries where discrimination of girls in terms of education is almost non-existent.
The authorities have to tackle the problem of students not attending school due to lack of interest even if the parents are willing to send them to school. Since the survey has revealed that about 17% of children who do not attend school reported that they are not interested in education or education is not considered valuable, educationists and education authorities must explore how the school system could be made more attractive to children. The focus should especially on the estate sector, where this is reported to be a major problem.
Poverty has always been a hindrance to education, but successive Sri Lankan Governments have begun programmes to distribute free textbooks and uniforms and provide a meal. These can potentially take some burden away from the parents, but the Government should probe further on how these children can be enrolled in schools. After all, education is often the best answer to poverty. Disability in some form is another factor, but some of the best results in recent examinations have been obtained by such students. We need more specialist teachers who can teach these students.
The recent floods and landslides affected a large number of students and schools, with some students losing virtually everything. Apart from the physical trauma, most students are likely to experience some form of mental trauma, especially those who have lost their relatives. The authorities must ensure that none of these students drop out of school due to their changed circumstances.
The Government must accelerate the Nearest School is the Best School project so that all children enjoy an equal chance of attending a good school. Now there is a mad scramble for the big schools in Colombo and Kandy because the schools in these cities are perceived to be the best. If all schools are equal, there will be no need to attend a so-called best school.
Sri Lanka has successfully emerged from two problems that affect the education of children  child soldiers and child labour. The LTTE forcibly recruited thousands of children, depriving them of any formal education in their formative years. The Government is rehabilitating a whole generation of such ex-child combatants. The use of children for combat is one form of child labour, but it can take many forms including domestic labour and sexual exploitation.
A significant proportion of the 168 million children engaged in child labour round the world live in areas affected by conflict and disaster. The 2017 World Day Against Child Labour which falls on June 12 (Monday) focuses on the impact of conflicts and disasters on child labour. As the UN notes Children are often the first to suffer as schools are destroyed and basic services are disrupted. Many children are internally displaced or become refugees in other countries, and are particularly vulnerable to trafficking and child labour. Ultimately, millions of children are pushed into child labour by conflicts and disasters.
Education is a fundamental right. Education is the key to a brighter future and any lacuna in this sector does not augur well. The authorities should take immediate action to ensure that every child attends school, without exception.

Qatar crisis has global implications
It came like a bolt in the blue. Five Gulf nations broke diplomatic relations with Qatar last Monday without any forewarning. There was not even a hint of such a move at the recent Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting or at the America  Islamic and Arab Nation Summit attended by US President Donald Trump. However, the move was pre-meditated and well planned.
Saudi Arabia could not have taken it without prior consultation and approval from the United States, especially because it happened on the heels of a high profile visit of President Trump to Riyadh at which the United States concluded an arms deal worth over US $ 100 billion. Actually President Trump in a Twitter message hailed the move and apparently sided with Saudi Arabia and other nations in their dispute with Qatar, despite the presence of the largest US military base in Qatar which is used for daily operations in the region.
Qatar is a small country with a population of 2.3 million people of which over 2 million are foreigners, mostly from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Philippines. It has a GDP of 334.5 billion US dollars and its per capita GDP is the highest in the world. It is the worlds largest natural gas exporter. It shares the worlds largest underwater natural gas deposit in the world with Iran. Though rich it imports over 80 percent of its food.
Diplomatic solutionthrough consultations
The States that broke diplomatic relations with Qatar are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen. Four other countries followed suit. They are Maldives, Mauritania, Mauritius and Senegal.
They demand that Qatar stop aiding terrorism and severe its relations with 12 entities including Hamas, and the Muslim Brotherhood. They have also named 59 individuals also as terrorists receiving Qatar support. Israeli Foreign Minister has hailed the move against Qatar. French President Macron, President Donald Trump and Kuwaits Emir Al Ahmed Al Salah have all promised to mediate to find a diplomatic solution through consultations.
Qatar has declined to accede to these demands. Its Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdulrahman Al Thani has said that We are not ready to surrender and will never be ready to surrender our foreign policy. The intervening countries had the audacity to call for a policy change by Qatar, in an open affront to its sovereignty.
Terrorist attacks
What is ironic in this situation is that it is not Qatar but Saudi Arabia that is alleged to be openly supporting terrorism. On could recall that 15 out of the accused in the 9/11 attack were Saudi citizens. Bin Laden was also a Saudi national. The recent bomb attacks in Teheran on the Majlis (Parliament) and the Mausoleum of Imam Al Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran was attributed by Iran to terrorists funded by Saudi Arabia. The incidents killed 17 and wounded around 50 others. It may also be recalled that Saudi Foreign Minister is reported to have said in an oblique reference in May about the need to take the battle to Iran.
Iran has taken measures to supply Qatar with food requirements and Turkey has expressed its solidarity by ratifying a deal to train the Qatar military. This diplomatic offensive by Saudi Arabia and its allies is sure to destabilize the entire Gulf region. It has already breached the unity in the GCC. With it the hope of establishing a Sunni NATO against Shia Iran will also will fall unless Qatar surrenders. In the latter case it will have a negative effect throughout the world for the United States would be tempted to exert pressure to subjugate even developed allied countries to ensure world domination.
Since considerable numbers of South Asians including 650,000 Indians live and work in Qatar, India and other countries that have expatriate workers there will be unable to overlook it in their dealings with the United States.
Though the dispute seems to be prima facie based on political differences the underlying factors are economic and are far distant from terrorist activities. Iran and Qatar are jointly harnessing the huge underwater natural gas reserves in the region. Economic interests compel them to keep this cooperation intact.
US supremacy
The consolidation of the Assad regime or a pro-Moscow regime in Syria with the defeat of the Islamic State would ensure the passage of Russian natural gas to the European market via Syria and would favour cooperation and not confrontation between the gas producers Russia and Qatar. In fact Qatar has already invested US $ 2.7 billion in the Russian State company Rusneft. Russia  Turkey relations have improved dramatically in the recent months and have stabilized.
Relations with Iran have been an important aspect of Russian foreign policy in West Asia and the Mediterranean. Thus the present Qatar crisis has the potential of developing a Russia  Turkey- Qatar Iran alliance in the future. Such an outcome would have great geo-political implications and undermine US supremacy in the region.
South Asian nations including Sri Lanka would not be able to stand aloof or toe the US line as the crisis develops. There are 650,000 Indian nationals living and working in Qatar. India will have to take their interests in defining its relations and aligning its policies with that of the United States.

Regular checks of Kelani River water
The quality of water supplied from the Kelani River is tested regularly and distributed only if it is safe for consumption, Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauf Hakeem said.
He said the odour and change in colour was reported in the water from the Biyagama and Kadawatha areas.This was due to contamination of oil and debris to stream water. He added the National Water Supply and Drainage Board took prompt action by placing sand bags to prevent the contaminated water from flowing to the Kelani River after it was reported. Minister Hakeem said the contamination of water was a result of the recent flood situation in the country.
The Minister requested the public not to panic, adding that the water quality is being constantly tested at treatment plants. He stressed that the Water Board distributes water from the plant only if it is safe for consumption.

Sangakkara inspired Sri Lanka stunner - Mathews
LONDON, Friday: Angelo Mathews says an inspirational session in the nets with Kumar Sangakkara laid the foundations for Sri Lankas stunning Champions Trophy victory against India.
Sangakkara is retired from international duty, but the legendary Sri Lanka batsman is currently playing for Surrey and he took the opportunity to spend some time with his countrys emerging youngsters before Thursdays crucial clash with India.
Still in fine form with Surrey, Sangakkara opted against coming out of retirement for the Champions Trophy, but the 39-year-old clearly still has an influence off the field.
Sri Lanka were thrashed by South Africa in their opening match last week but bounced back on Sangakkaras temporary home ground, chasing down Indias total of 321 to win by seven wickets at The Oval.
It was Sri Lankas joint highest ODI run chase and kept alive their hopes of reaching the semi-finals. Danushka Gunathilaka, standing in for the injured Chamara Kapugedera, hit 76 off 72 balls while Kusal Mendis made 89 as the pair set in motion an unlikely victory.
And Sri Lanka captain Mathews revealed some tips from Sangakkara this week helped turn the tide.
Kusal met Sanga to get some batting tips because he is the king, Mathews said.
We all look up to him and take advice from him, all the batters. He taught us good things about how to play on these tracks.
The guys met him, took a lot of advice and went out there and did it today.
Gunathilakas ODI career-best innings was especially impressive as he would have been watching in the stands if Kapugedera hadnt been ruled out with a knee injury suffered in practice on Wednesday.
Gunathilaka and Mendis put together a 159-run partnership before Mathews (52) and Asela Gunaratne (34) finished the job with eight balls to spare.
In the midst of a major rebuilding project, Sri Lanka will clinch an unexpected place in the last four if they beat Pakistan on Monday.For Danushka to walk into a game knowing he wasnt even in the 15 until after Chamara got injured is impressive, Mathews said.
He had to step in against a very strong opposition and I was very impressed with how he batted.
He and Kusal played with a lot of freedom and that set us a platform and made it so much easier for myself and the middle order batters. Aselas little cameo as well really won us the game at the end so it was a fantastic batting effort.
India seemed to be in control after Shikhar Darwan scored 125, while Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni made 78 and 63 respectively. But the holders paid the price for not pushing closer to 350 and now find themselves in a scrap to progress from Group B, where all four teams have two points with one match left to play.
I personally thought we had enough on the board, India captain Virat Kohli said.
You have to give credit to the opposition as well. We are not invincible. We are playing against a champion side.
These are the top eight teams in the world so there are no guarantees.
We have to consolidate and then explode at the end, thats how we play. Were not a side that always plays explosive cricket for the 50 overs. But if a team has that kind of mindset and executes their shots you have to take your hat off and sometimes say, well done. India must beat South Africa on Sunday to avoid a humiliating exit. Every game is a quarter-final now, Kohli said.
All teams are on two points and you have to win all your games to go through. We are very clear about the situation.  AFP

Saudis apologise over 'disgraceful' snub of minute's silence
Sydney,Friday:Saudi Arabia football chiefs apologised Friday after the national team was accused of "a disgraceful lack of respect" for failing to observe a minute's silence in Australia in honour of victims of the London terror attack.
When the stadium announcer in Adelaide called for silence before their World Cup qualifier against the Socceroos on Thursday evening, the Australian team lined up at the centre circle with arms on their team-mates' shoulders.
But most of the Saudis milled around and spread out to various parts of the field, with team officials claiming the tradition of stopping to honour the dead was "not in keeping with Saudi culture".
It left fans and politicians in Australia fuming. Two Australians were among the eight killed last weekend when three Islamist extremists mowed down people on London Bridge before going on a stabbing spree.
"The Saudi Arabian Football Federation deeply regrets and unreservedly apologises for any offence caused by the failure... to formally observe the one minute's silence," federation president Adil Ezzat said in a rare statement.
"The players did not intend any disrespect to the memories of the victims or to cause upset to their families, friends or any individual affected by the atrocity."
Asked about the Saudi team's attitude, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said "everybody, everyone should be united in condemnation of the terrorists and love and sympathy and respect for the victims and their families".
Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese called the snub "a disgraceful lack of respect for not just the two Australians who were killed... but also all of those victims of that terror attack in London".
"There's no excuse here. This isn't about culture. This is about a lack of respect and I thought it was disgraceful."
Senator Derryn Hinch was also outraged, saying: "It is an insult," while Twitter lit up with criticism.
Twitter-user Frank Gardner posted "disgraceful and disrespectful", while Paul Jurdeczka said: "Minute silence not in Saudi culture. Except when it suits them. About showing respect. Which is human." Football Federation Australia said agreement had been sought from the Asian Football Confederation and the Saudi team to pause and remember those killed in the terror attack. "Both the AFC and the Saudi team agreed that the minute of silence could be held," an FFA spokesman told AFP.
"The FFA was further advised by Saudi team officials that this tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture and they would move to their side of the field and respect our custom whilst taking their own positions on the field."
The Islamic State group, which claimed the London killings, has also carried out deadly bombing and shooting attacks in Saudi Arabia against minority Shiites and members of the security forces. Saudi authorities routinely denounce "terrorist" attacks around the world but the kingdom has itself faced accusations of tolerating or even supporting extremists, in particular after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Australia won the match 3-2 to stay on track for next year's World Cup finals in Russia.
The Australians joined Japan and Saudi Arabia at the top of Asia Group B and now face a huge game against Japan in Saitama on August 31.  AFP

Sri Lanka played fearlessly and freely -Kumar Sangakkara
This was a great victory for Sri Lanka and a much-needed one. It meant a lot to the Sri Lanka team to chase down that very stiff total and to do it with such ease will have been hugely satisfying.
There is no doubt, Sri Lanka would have had a few worries coming into this game given recent form, injuries to key players, and the suspension in the last game of stand-in captain and in-form opener Upal Tharanga.
Tharangas suspension though created a great opportunity for Dhanuska Gunathilake. He had previously been left-out of the playing XI but remained in the squad with a point to prove. And what an inclusion he proved to be, as he led the Sri Lanka run-chase, ably joined by Kushal Mendis. The two youngsters are two stars for the future and they showed that they not only have youth and skill, but also the temperament.
The return of Angelo Mathews naturally strengthened the Sri Lanka side immensely. He was missed sorely against South Africa and he guided the Sri Lanka middle-order with just the innings that Sri Lanka needed. He knows how to play under pressure, he is the best batsman that Sri Lanka has, and he showed it again today with a masterful knock, guiding Sri Lanka to victory.
Asela Gunaratne, one of my batsmen to watch from the start of the tournament, was sent in ahead of Dinesh Chandimal and contributed a wonderful little cameo. But with the two run-outs under pressure, the innings that Kusal Perera played was outstanding.
Sri Lanka had a wonderful combination of youth and experience together in the middle-order, doing what they needed to get the team a much-needed victory. They are now set up for their next encounter against Pakistan as a virtual quarter-final.
But Sri Lanka should not get too carried away with the win. They should be realistic about the issues that they may still face. Kusal Perera might miss his next game with his hamstring injury. Hopefully, the team wont have a captain penalised again for a slow over-rate and, in the field, Sri Lanka can get a lot better. The bowling lacked bite and penetration. We also had a couple of questionable bowling changes, such as Gunaratne bowling three overs for seven runs and not being bowled again.
I was very impressed with Thisara Perera, coming in again after being left out, another like Gunatillake deemed not good enough and not the match-winner the team have hoped for.
But he proves that sometimes when you trust players, push them and believe in them, they respond.
Thisara bowled really well under pressure and he was key to limiting India to 320 after a stage when it could have gone on to score a lot more.
India, on the other hand, will rue what it might consider a missed opportunity. It batted beautifully with Shikhar Dhawan excelling having set the tone early on. He forms a brilliant opening partnership with Rohit Sharma that is giving India great starts and a lot of confidence.
For its next match up, India might be looking to change its line-up and maybe bring in Ravichandran Ashwin, maybe leave out Hardik Pandya, possibly Kedar Jadhav. But, whatever it decides to do, it needs to do it decisively, because for it the South Africans now await in another effective quarter-final.
Cricket, has once again proved its eternal unpredictability. I expected India and South Africa to dominate the group, but now its wide open with two classic matches ahead.
Today, though, the story was all about Sri Lanka and how, after a rocky start to its ICC Champions Trophy campaign, it played like the young talented team that they say they are, playing fearlessly and freely with strong belief.  ICC news

Stan Wawrinka beats Andy Murray to enter French Open final
PARIS Friday: Stan Wawrinka became the oldest French Open finalist in 44 years on Friday with an epic 6-7 (6/8), 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3), 6-1 win over world number one Andy Murray.
The 2015 champion will face either nine-time winner Rafael Nadal or Dominic Thiem for the title after avenging his loss to Murray at the same stage in Paris last year.
US Open champion Wawrinka, 32, triumphed in a pulsating four hour 34 minute battle of shotmaking and endurance and will target a fourth Slam title on Sunday.
For Murray, his wait to become Britains first mens champion in Paris since Fred Perry in 1935 goes on. Its incredible to be in another Roland Garros final, said Wawrinka, the oldest finalist since 33-year-old Niki Pilic was runner-up in 1973.
I was hesitant in trying to finish the first and third sets but I felt like I could retake control.
Andy always makes you play another ball, he makes you play badly.
It was a great atmosphere which makes you give it your all. Murray admitted that Wawrinka was the stronger player in the end.
I tried to keep fighting, but he played well at the end, said Murray, the 2016 runner-up to Novak Djokovic. I was a tiebreak from getting to the final in a tournament which I came into struggling. Wawrinka broke for a 5-3 lead in the opener but handed the advantage straight back to the Scot in his next service game. In a gripping tiebreak, an instinctive, point-blank backhand volley gave the Swiss a set point. Again he was unable to take advantage and it was Murray who pounced for the opening set after 71 minutes when his opponent netted a backhand return off a second serve. Murray only notched nine winners in the set but Wawrinkas 23 unforced errors proved his undoing as he shipped his first set of the tournament.  AFP
