Cambridge University to introduce written entrance exams

UK: Would-be Cambridge University students will have to sit a written test in their subject area from this autumn.
The tests are designed to give academics a better indication of their abilities than just relying on the controversial Oxbridge interviewing process and, academics argue, should benefit state school pupils - particularly from disadvantaged areas.
The tests - of one hour or two hours duration - follow the reform of A-levels initiated by former Education Secretary Michael Gove which mean that the AS-level taken at the end of the first year of the sixth-form no longer counts for an A-level pass.
Cambridge University fought strongly against the shake-up - saying that the AS-level gave them the only glimpse of a sixth-former's ability before they had to decide to whom they should offer a place.
Instead, they argue, admissions officers would have to rely on predicted A-level grades - which independent schools have been known to inflate.
In addition, research has shown that teenagers from homes where there is no history of university applications lacked confidence and were often loathe to put themselves forward for top tier university places before they had accumulated the necessary grades.
In a letter to schools and colleges, Dr Sam lucy, the university's director of admissions, said the tests would provide "valuable additional evidence of our applicants' academic abilities, knowledge base and potential to succeed in the Cambridge course for which they have applied".
"This move is a result of responding to teacher and student feedback, a desire to harmonise and simplify our existing use of written assessments and a need to develop new ways to maintain the effectiveness and fairness of our admissions system during ongoing qualification reform," she added.
A spokesman for the university said it had been anxious to stress to teachers that the new assessments - described as "common format written assessments tailored to each subject" to be taken either before or at their interview - were not just another barrier for students to overcome."

Cameron to campaign against 'Brexit'

UK: British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's ready to campaign to keep Britain in the European Union after its president, Donald Tusk, issued a draft proposal that may go some way to allay fears migrants are draining Britain's welfare coffers.
As well as offering a four-year "emergency brake" on welfare for new migrants from the EU, the plan sets out safeguards to shield the British financial system from interference by EU regulators and more powers for national parliaments.
Cameron needs to persuade a sceptical British public he's fought hard and won significant concessions as he prepares for a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU or leave - a so-called Brexit.
At the same time, he has to keep the bloc's other 27 leaders on side, because they still have to approve the plan at a summit in Brussels this month. That would pave the way for a popular vote as early as June.
"If I could get these terms for British membership, I sure would opt in to membership of the EU," Mr Cameron said in a speech at a plant in Chippenham, western England, run by German engineering giant Siemens, symbolising the degree to which Britain's economy is bound up with the rest of the bloc. "Strong, determined, patient negotiation has achieved a good outcome for Britain." But critics said the plan contained only "watered-down" pledges. The deal would give EU migrants "gradually increasing access" to benefits after they come to Britain - as opposed to the outright ban Mr Cameron had previously demanded. They described it as "pathetic" and "insubstantial".
London mayor Boris Johnson became the most senior Tory to openly criticise Mr Cameron's deal, warning that there was "much, much more that needs to be done".
Liam Fox, a former Conservative defence secretary who's campaigning to quit the bloc, denounced the proposal, saying in an emailed statement that "none of these changes even come close to the fundamental changes promised to the public".
Tusk's proposal will limit the application of an ever-closer union in EU law; child benefits will be indexed to the standard of living where the child is; restrictions on in-work benefits may last for as long as four years; and EU legislation can be blocked if 55 per cent of national parliaments oppose it, according to the text posted on the European Council's website.

Defending champ Prabagaran takes lead in 3rd round

K. Prabagaran seeking his third consecutive win in the Sri Lanka Open fired a fantastic 4 under par 67, to snatch the lead from Nadaraja Thangaraja who lead the field up to the halfway mark of the Ballys Sri Lanka Open 2015 at Royal Colombo Gplf Club yesterday.
Thangaraja maintained his lead comfortably with Prabagaran playing steadily until Thangarajas tee shot on the 10th rolled out of bounds and even though he drove the green with his next shot he missed a 8 foot putt for par. Thanga encountered more trouble on the 14th to make a triple bogey and then Praba fired three Birdies to turn the tables on Thangaraja.
The Ballys Sri Lanka Open 2015 is poised for a great finish tomorrow, with Prabgaran enjoying a slender 2 stroke lead from Thangaraja. Lalith Kumara lying in 2nd place after two rounds had a disastrous start and even though he pulled back with three Birdies he dropped three shots again in the 17th and 18th. M. Dharma a seasoned Indian Pro on the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) is in 3rd place 7 shots off the leader.
Praba returned the only sub-par card today considered a tough day in the office by all Professional who played today.
The Ballys Sri Lanka Open 2015 carries a handsome Prize Purse encouraging top players to participate and the support of the title sponsor Ballys Entertainment, Co-Sponsor UTE CAT, the Affiliate Sponsors NISSAN X Trail and CML Walkers has given the opportunity for Professionals from India, Pakistan and Australia to have played this year.

The end of the Big Three

The ICC announced that it will carry out a complete constitutional review of the changes brought about by the 'Big Three' takeover in 2014. The decision was taken at the ICC Board meeting held in Dubai on Wednesday.
Moves have already begun to dismantle the system of governance proposed by the BCCI, ECB and CA two years ago, with confirmation of the expected change to make the ICC chairman an independent position.
The outcomes from the ICC board meeting on Wednesday also included removing permanent positions for India, England and Australia on the Executive Committee and the Financial & Commercial Affairs Committee - the ICC's two most powerful forums. In a statement, the ICC said the board had "agreed to carry out a complete review of the 2014 resolutions and constitutional changes with a view to establishing governance, finance, corporate and cricketing structures that are appropriate and effective for the strategic role and function of the ICC and all of its members".
Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president who is also currently serving as ICC chairman, signalled his intention to roll back the changes overseen by his predecessor N Srinivasan in an interview last year, when he referred to "the three major countries bullying the ICC".

Hambantota overlooked for Aussies 12-match tour
The Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium at Sooriyawewa, Hambantota which was built at enormous cost to Sri Lanka Cricket has been overlooked for Australias full tour of Sri Lanka which will take place in July-August.
Hambantota which is normally used to host T20 Internationals does not find a place in Australias provisional 12-match tour itinerary.
Australia start the tour with two warm-up matches at NCC and CCC before moving onto the three-match Test series starting on July 27 at the P Sara Oval.
Colombo will host two of the Tests with Galle being given the other. Traditionally Galle hosts the first Test of a series but in this instance they have been given the second Test. Due to the Kandy Perahera in August, Pallekele fails to get a Test match instead the third Test will be played at the SSC. Pallekele will host the fifth ODI and the first T20I.
Dambulla gets two ODIs both of which will be day games and the R Premadasa Stadium will host the first two ODIs and the second and final T20I.
Australia last toured Sri Lanka for a full series in 2011 where they won the Test series 1-0, ODI series 3-2 and lost the T20I series 0-2.

Has Super T20 tournament served the purpose

The Super T20 provincial tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket as a prelude to giving players the opportunity to showcase their talent ahead of picking the Sri Lanka team for the upcoming Asia Cup and World T20 tournaments draws to a close at the R Premadasa Stadium today with Colombo Commandos meeting Galle Guardians in the final starting at 7 pm.
More than the result of the final what is more important is how much beneficial the tournament has been to the national selectors who have the envious task of picking 15 of the best T20 players to defend not only the Asia Cup in Bangladesh but more importantly the World T20 in India.
The alarming facts to emerge from the 12 matches played so far is the spate of low totals made by the five teams in competition and the fact that no batsman has single-handedly gone on to win a match for their side. The highest totals recorded are 182/5 by Colombo Commandos and 181/7 by Galle Guardians the two teams playing in today's final. Furthermore no batsman has made a big impact in the tournament with 80 not out by Dhananjaya de Silva of Colombo Commandos being the highest individual score.
The pitches we understand have been prepared similar to those Sri Lanka are likely to encounter in Bangladesh and in India. If that is the case the national selectors will certainly have a huge problem ahead of them in selecting a team that could defend the two titles.
The performances of the batsmen on these pitches which have seen the ball keep low and offer appreciable turn has not been encouraging. There appears to be a distinct weakness against playing spin which was quite evident with the national team in their recent encounters against Pakistan and India at home.
The key to encountering spin on a low track is to play straight but most of the dismissals have been to batsmen playing across the line, which certainly is not a good sign and a worrying factor. It shows that there is a huge deficiency in our batting against spin that needs to be rectified.
The national selectors we learn have been following each and every game in the provincial tournament and will also keep a close eye on the upcoming three T20 internationals in India before picking the final 15 to play in the Asia Cup and World T20.
The two finalists met in the opening match of the tournament with Colombo emerging winners by three wickets in a close encounter with two balls to spare. It could turn out to be different today.
The champion team will collect a cool Rs. One million and the runner-up Rs. 750,000. Individual prizes include Rs. 150,000 for Man of the Tournament, Rs. 100,000 each for Best Batsman and Best Bowler of the Tournament and Rs. 50,000 for Man of the Final.

Look into our woes, urge Ampara farmers

Problems faced by Ampara district farmers in selling their paddy should be looked into, members of the Uoorakkai Farmers' Committee of Thambiluvil said.
They said action should be taken by the officers to solve these problems or else they would be compelled to give up paddy cultivation in the future.
It is alleged that paddy farmers of Uoorakkai Kandam face several issues when selling paddy to the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB).
Uoorakka Farmers' Committee president G.V. Gnanasooriyam said: "Our own experience in the Ampara district shows that the PMB satisfies neither the producers nor consumers. We are skeptical as to whether the PMB is practicing any marketing strategies.
All Sri Lankans consume rice and yet the PMB is unable to market any. Officials at stores in our vicinity are not issuing any thing it purchased during the last season."
He made these remarks at the District Development Committee meeting presided by Digamadulla district TNA MP K. Kodieswaran held at the Thirukkovil DS office.
A PMB official said the PMB will stop buying paddy once the funds allocated to them are exhausted even if there is room in the stores.

Health authorities found that over 54 percent of schools have dengue mosquito breeding sites.
In addition, 40 percent of religious institutions and 36 percent of construction sites have either dengue larvae or dengue mosquito breeding sites, Director General health Services, Dr. Palitha Mahipala said. Addressing the media at the Epidemiology Unit, he said that 5,263 dengue cases had been reported countrywide during this year and the death rate has gone down to 1.5 percent. Fifty eight dengue deaths were reported last year.
According to Dr. Mahipala, a special mosquito eradication week will commence from March 29. A three day dengue eradication programme will be held on February 11, 12 and 13 focusing on high risk MOH areas.
Health officials, members of Armed Forces etc will take part in this programme. Special attention will be paid to schools.
Dr. Mahipala pointed out that people should seek prompt medical treatment from a state hospital, if they suffer from any type of fever for more than two days. Prompt medical treatment obtained from a state hospital can save lives, because dengue patients can avoid serious complications such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome by seeking medical treatment without delay.
Patients suffering from fever should only take paracetamol and should refrain from taking any other medications or pain killers. Other medications can lead to complications such as internal bleeding, if the patient is suffering from dengue fever.

Rajiv Gandhi assassination: convict's mother seeks his release

The mother of a man convicted for his role in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has started a public petition campaign in Sri Lanka seeking the release of her son from a jail in Tamil Nadu, the PTI reported.
Vetrivel Somini, mother of Murugan who has been in jail after his conviction in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, said she is aiming to get one million signatures for the petition to seek the release of her son and six others.
Somini, who lives in Sri Lanka's Kilinochchi, the former administrative capital of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), said she hopes to submit the petition to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Murugan, a resident of Pallai in Kilinochchi, has been in jail for the last 25 years.
Somini said there were examples when world leaders had pardoned convicts accused of grave crimes and so she expects her son to be given clemency.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) carried out Mr Rajiv Gandhi's assassination on May 21, 1991 in Sriperumbudur.
The LTTE had killed Rajiv Gandhi to exact revenge for his decision to send the Indian Army to Sri Lanka under the 1987 Indo-Lanka Peace Accord.
Dampening hopes of release for the killers of Mr Gandhi, Supreme Court in December had ruled that the Centre has "primacy" over states' right to grant remission and referred the issue of clemency for the assassins to a three-judge bench. - AFP

Scientists 'to mimic conditions inside the sun'

GERMANY: Scientists in Germany are set to begin an experiment they hope will advance the quest for nuclear fusion, considered a clean and safe form of nuclear power.
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Greifswald will heat a tiny amount of hydrogen until it becomes a super-hot gas known as plasma, mimicking conditions inside the sun.
It's part of a world-wide effort to harness nuclear fusion, a process in which atoms join at extremely high temperatures and release large amounts of energy.
Advocates acknowledge that the technology is probably many decades away, but argue that - once achieved - it could replace fossil fuels and conventional nuclear fission reactors.
Construction has already begun in southern France on ITER, a huge international research reactor that uses a strong electric current to trap plasma inside a doughnut-shaped device long enough for fusion to take place.
The device, known as a tokamak, was conceived by Soviet physicists in the 1950s and is considered fairly easy to build, but extremely difficult to operate.
The team in Greifswald, a port city on Germany's Baltic coast, is focused on a rival technology invented by the American physicist Lyman Spitzer in 1950. Called a stellarator, the device has the same doughnut shape as a tokamak but uses a complicated system of magnetic coils to achieve the same result.
The Greifswald device should be able to keep plasma in place for much longer than a tokamak, said Thomas Klinger, who heads the project.
"The stellarator is much calmer," he said in a telephone interview. "It's far harder to build, but easier to operate."
Known as the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, or W7-X, the 400-million-euro ($435-million) device was first fired up in December using helium, which is easier to heat. Helium also has the advantage of "cleaning" any minute dirt particles left behind during the construction of the device.
David Anderson, a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin who isn't involved in the project, said the project in Greifswald looks promising so far.
"The impressive results obtained in the startup of the machine were remarkable," he said in an email. "This is usually a difficult and arduous process. The speed with which W7-X became operational is a testament to the care and quality of the fabrication of the device and makes a very positive statement about the stellarator concept itself. W7-X is a truly remarkable achievement and the worldwide fusion community looks forward to many exciting results."
While critics have said the pursuit of nuclear fusion is an expensive waste of money that could be better spent on other projects, Germany has forged ahead in funding the Greifswald project, which in the past 20 years has reached 1.06 billion euros if staff salaries are included. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics, is expected to attend Wednesday's event, which happens to be in her constituency. Over the coming years W7-X, which isn't designed to produce any energy itself, will test many of the extreme conditions such devices will be subjected to if they are ever to generate power, said John Jelonnek, a physicists at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.
Jelonnek's team is responsible for a key component of the device, the massive microwave ovens that will turn hydrogen into plasma, eventually reaching 100 million degrees Celsius (212 million Fahrenheit).
Compared to nuclear fission, which produces huge amounts of radioactive material that will be around for thousands of years, the waste from nuclear fusion would be negligible, he said.
"It's a very clean source of power, the cleanest you could possibly wish for. We're not doing this for us, but for our children and grandchildren." - THE INDEPENDENT

A simple but elegant ceremony
Sri Lanka's 68th Independence Day was celebrated with pomp and pageantry under the theme "One Nation and Enduring Force" at Galle Face Green in Colombo yesterday.
The balmy weather and cool breeze wafting from the Indian Ocean provided the ideal ambiance for Sri Lanka's 68th Independence Day celebrations marked by a simple but charming ceremony held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
With a view to building a single strong country, a single nation through national reconciliation and fraternity, the National Day celebrations were held with pride and dignity with the participation of thousands of people.
This year's focus was bravery, confidence, dedication, national unity,patriotism, nationalism, peace, national responsibility, culture and awareness of national history on the part of the people.
The Independence Day ceremony commenced with the arrival of President Sirisena and Mrs. Jayanthi Pushpakumari at 8.45 a.m.
The President and his wife were received by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena.

Top quality rugby expected in Navy-Air Force clash

Some top quality rugby can be expected to be dished out by both Air Force and Navy when they lock horns in their second round Dialog inter-club 'A' division league rugby tournament match at the Air Force Sports Complex, Ratmalana at 4 pm today.
This will be the sailors' third second round game and at present they are placed behind Kandy, Havelock's and CR and FC.
Navy who suffered two shock defeats when they went down to a rejuvenated Police side by 11-16 and to high-riding CR and FC 25-27 at their own den in Welisara, came back with all guns blazing to hold the formidable Havelock's outfit to a surprising 20-all draw at Havelock Park last week.
Also, Navy who occupy fourth spot will be sans their think-tank and mentor Yoshitha Rajapaksa for this game against Air Force.
Navy captained by Danushka 'Gertha' Perera have players of the class of national caps hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe, second row Sathya Ranatunga and number eight Sajith Saranga.
Navy knows that losing another game could mean the end of the road for their league title hopes, so they will come out with their best outfit, with playmakers Chanaka Chandimal and speedy winger Heshan Maduranga returning to the side after being rested last week against the Havies.
Air Force whose only win has been against bottom ranked CH and FC lost against Army 17-26 last week after a tremendous fight back. They are packed with some outstanding players but they need to minimize their errors and get their act together if they are to pull off a victory against the formidable Navy outfit. Air Force have in their ranks some great players in the caliber of skipper cum second row Kulukulasuriya, playmaker and full back Nuwan Perera, hard running centre Chamod Fernando, fly half Iddamalgoda and number eight Jero Dananjaya in their ranks. All of them are gifted players with immense of talent.
At present Navy occupy fourth spot and Kandy SCports Club, who holds the first slot and are the reigning league champions. -WAI

Work for true national reconciliation
President Maithripala Sirisena said that effective steps are being taken by the government aimed at building and strengthening reconciliation, harmony and peaceful coexistence between the communities. "It is now a timely necessity for genuine co-existence after liberating the country from the clutches of terrorism. Hence, all Sri Lankans are duty bound to work for true national reconciliation, the President said addressing the nation participating in the country's 68th Independence Day celebrations at the Galle Face Green in Colombo yesterday.
The ceremony was held with pomp and pageantry under the theme "One Nation and Enduring Force".

The President pointed out the responsibility of all Sri Lankans is to pay due honour the highest respect to all members of the Security Forces who sacrificed their lives on behalf of the territorial integrity of our great Motherland.
President Sirisena recalled the contributions of all patriots and endorsed by the election victory on January 8, the government will effect a radical change in the political, economic, social and cultural landscape to impart the people the real sense of good governance.
He said the nation should be grateful to the Armed Forces and the government leadership in defeating the terrorists and protect the country.
The President also underscored as priority undertaking, the need to build genuine unity among all people in the country after the physical defeat of terrorism in 2009.
President Sirisena called on the people to extend fullest cooperation to the government to fulfill the task of building the Nation by solving the issues left behind by the Colonial rulers in 1948 and the post-conflict issues that were not resolved after May 2009.
The President further said that the cultural, social and religious values of the Sri Lankan society deteriorated during over 400 years of foreign occupation and the independent nation inherited major issues when the Colonial rulers left in 1948.
During the past 68 years, the country failed to solve those issues and furthermore the country failed to address the post conflict issues that should have been solved after the elimination of terrorism in May 2009.
"The government did not take the required measures after the defeat of terrorism in 2009 and in January 2015, the people gave me the mandate to fulfill that task. Therefore, we have to take effective steps to build reconciliation and harmony and coexistence between the communities" the President said, while urging people to extend fullest cooperation for this national endeavour.
"If we had taken the steps that should have been taken after May 2009, we would not have faced the resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2015. The government is determined to face the UNHRC resolution with the collective strength of all sections in order to protect and preserve the national pride as well as the pride and dignity of our Armed Forces that had made numerous sacrifices to safeguard the country's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity," President Sirisena added.

He noted that it was wrong to give false interpretations to the government policy with regard to the UNHRC resolution as the government is fully committed to safeguarding the nation and the pride of the heroic Armed Forces.
The President said that the people,especially the younger generation are equipped with the latest technological know-how to keep abreast with the ever changing world. It is, therefore, necessary to fully understand the thinking and expectations of the new generation, and as a government to take the necessary steps to help them realize these expectations.
"We should understand the difference between the Child of Culture of the post -1948 era and today's Child of Technology," he said.
"Together with the mandate given to us by the people on January 8, we made important promises and pledges to the people working as a new government and we have achieved a great success by strengthening democracy with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Through that we have established independent commissions for elections, judiciary, police, public service, auditing and investigate bribery and corruption," the President said .
"We have brought about new transformations in politics, the economy,society and culture," he said.
Pointing out that the media enjoys unprecedented freedom today, President Sirisena, however, emphasized the importance of using that freedom with wisdom,responsibility and discipline.
He cautioned that if media freedom is not properly used, any future government could curtail media freedom once again.
The President called on everybody to act with wisdom for the sake of the future of the country and not to use the democratic freedom to entertain illogical, petty, foolish ideas of grabbing power through shortcuts..
Pointing out that many other countries have advanced rapidly because they achieved communal harmony through reconciliation, he said that the biggest challenge we face today, is that of building harmony through a process of reconciliation bring about co-existence and national understanding, and thus take our great Motherland forward as and rich in human affection and understanding.
President Maithripala Sirisena also stressed the need of using the media freedom with wisdom, responsibility and discipline.
He said that the government has ensured a broad media freedom in the country.
He cautioned that if the media freedom is not properly used, any future government could curtail media freedom once again.
The President added that it is the responsibility of all journalists and media institutions to protect that freedom.
"Specially, we have ensured broad media freedom in our country, in accordance with our policies on media freedom.
The freedom we are given and the media enjoy today has now come to a point where I have to emphasize the importance of using that freedom with wisdom , responsibility and discipline,"the President said.
