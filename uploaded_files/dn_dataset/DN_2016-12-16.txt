Plenty of jobs but shortage of qualified persons: President
The government is taking steps to provide ample resources and guidance in building the future generation of the country, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these remarks participating at a ceremony to vest the newly built Sri Jinarathana Vocational and Higher Education Training Institute in Hikkaduwa, Seenigama, with the students on Wednesday. The new Training Institute was vested with the students to mark the birthday of Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera.
President Sirisena said the main problem today is the country lacking qualified persons for existing jobs and it is not a case of shortage of jobs. The President said even though a large number of job opportunities is available at state and private sectors, the lack of skilled workers with technical knowledge is a serious issue confronting Sri Lanka.
He said the country should build a skilled workforce that has modern and updated knowledge to deal with new job opportunities in the job market. President Sirisena appreciated the service of Venerable Galaboda Gnanissara Thera centering the Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple in Colombo, for the development of vocational training.He said the Vocational Training Institute would provide immense strength not only to the youth in the area, but also to the economy.

Sri Lanka supports dialogue on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems

The Sri Lankan government said it supports the establishment of a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) in 2017, within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) and to elevate the dialogue on LAWS to a State driven formal process.
Addressing the 5th Review Conference of the Meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) on Monday, Mafusa Lafir, Second Secretary of the Sri Lanka Mission in Geneva and Sri Lankas delegate to the session said that despite the assurance by many key countries that fully autonomous weapons would not be developed, given precursors for such weapons are in existence, the international community has raised concerns that failure to take preemptive action carries the risk of such weapons being developed in the future.
She said this concern of the international community provides the rationale behind the call for a preemptive ban on LAWS, before these weapons change the current nature of conflicts by removing the human control from the command and operation of weapons.
She said a GGE could be mandated to discuss issues such as the definition of LAWS, understanding on existing systems to agree on the limits need to be set regarding the autonomy in weapons, and to address the challenges of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL).
During the session, Sri Lanka also stressed that the GGE should also engage on securing the rights for States to continue to have unhindered access to the dual use autonomous technology for peaceful purposes, given the benefits it could offer for the mankind.
A call for an establishment of a GGE was a result of the recommendation by the Informal Meeting of Experts held in April 2016, for which the mandate was given by the 2015 Meeting of High Contracting Parties to the CCW presided by Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka in Geneva.
LAWS known as 'Killer Robots', is being broadly categorised as an emerging type of autonomous technology with potential use in lethal weapons systems, that will once activated, have the ability to select, engage, and use force at targets, without any human intervention.
Following three years of informal expert meetings on LAWS and a dedicated session at the 2015 Meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the CCW, States and civil society called for a formal discussion on LAWS within the framework of the CCW, to establish preemptive action on development and deployment of these weapons systems, with a future prospect for a legally binding protocol to the CCW.
Earlier on Monday, Shashika Somaratne, Charg d'Affaires of the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Geneva, opened the 5th Review Conference of the CCW, on behalf of the Chairperson of the 2015 Meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the CCW, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and handed over the presidency to Ambassador Tehmina Janjua of Pakistan.
The Review Conference is being held from December 12 to 16 in Geneva.
The CCW restricts or prohibits conventional weapons that have been deemed excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects.
Review Conferences of the CCW is held every five years, to review the implementation of the Convention as well as to make decisions to strengthen it, taking into account the developments in the field of conventional weapons.
The ongoing 5th Review Conference is expected to make decision by consensus to establish a GGE on LAWS for 2017.

Mechanism to protect journalists and strengthen media self-regulation
The government said it would undertake a consultation with all interested stakeholders on the measures needed to provide adequate legal protection for journalists and to strengthen systems for media self-regulation.
Issuing a statement, Government Information Director General Ranga Kalansooriya said the government had examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report "Rebuilding Public Trust: an Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka", which was presented to the Prime Minister to mark the World Press Freedom Day, this year.
"The report contained a set of evidence-based recommendations developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and based on UNESCOs widely accepted Media Development Indicators," he said.
The statement added, " Similarly, the recently concluded International Conference on RTI Sri Lanka and Media Reforms also deliberated several challenges of the media sector while making some cardinal recommendations.
Some of the key recommendations of the report as well as the international conference require the adoption of enabling legislation. Based on this, the government wishes to undertake a consultation with all interested stakeholders on the measures needed to provide adequate legal protection for journalists and to strengthen systems for media self-regulation.
The government is ready to ensure legal protection for freedom of the press, including by protecting the medias right to gather news and information, by repealing the Sri Lanka Press Council Act, No 5 of 1979, and by introducing an independent oversight mechanism to foster professional standards, with mandatory powers over media outlets.
In this regard, the government invites the views of interested stakeholders in relation to its proposals to introduce legislation: To recognise media freedom and the right of the media: (a) to gather and disseminate news and information; (b) to engage in critical reporting on matters of public interest; and (c) to participate in the process of forming public opinion; To make it a penal offence for anyone wilfully to obstruct the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist working for a media outlet; To put in place systems to promote the safety of journalists; To protect journalists right to not to disclose their confidential sources of information; To make it a penal offence to subject anyone to any legal or employment related sanction or other form of discrimination for providing information to journalists working for a media outlet concerning public affairs or on matters of public interest, except where the secrecy of the information is justified by a larger public interest; To make it illegal to impose sanctions on or to terminate the employment of an editor or a journalist because of his or her refusal to violate recognised professional codes of practice; To establish an independent Council with a mandate to develop and apply codes of practice for media outlets, based on internationally recognised standards for the media.
The proposed Council will function as the oversight mechanism of a system of self-regulation and will have the power to apply sanction for wilful violations of its codes of practice. The approaches towards ensuring the independence of the Right to Information Commission will also be applicable to the Council, which will comprise eminent persons of whom two-thirds are nominated by organisations representing the media and journalists and one-third are nominated by civil society organisations. To ensure the credibility of and the public confidence in the Council, a Judge of a court of law nominated by the Judicial Services Commission in consultation with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka will serve as Chairperson. The tenure of Council members will be protected and, in particular, removal will only be possible by vote of Parliament following a recommendation of the Constitutional Council.
A free, independent and diverse media with high ethical standards and professional competence, dedicated to provide a wide range of information and ideas to citizens, while serving as a public forum for well-informed democratic dialogue, is indispensable for the building and maintaining of democracy in Sri Lanka. The government is committed to creating an enabling environment for the media sector which is based on respect for internationally recognised professional standards and practices, and which ensures media accountability to those who rely on the media as a credible source of news and information.
The government has examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report Rebuilding Public Trust: An Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka, which was presented to the Prime Minister on 3 May, World Press Freedom Day, 2016 by the multi-stakeholder partnership for media reforms.

Temple can guide people on solar energy: Siyambalapitiya
Since the temple offers guidance to people as a centre of attraction in the villages, they can be encouraged to use solar energy for domestic lighting by providing solar energy panels to viharayas as a pilot project, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing a meeting held to mark the installation of a solar energy panel at the Mangedara Raja Maha Viharaya in Ambepussa concurrent to the 'Battle for Solar Energy' launched by his ministry recently.
Siyambalapitiya said: we are engaged in a vital battle for solar energy. We have a responsibility to obtain the optimum possible level of the countrys electricity generation from local sources."
He said: "We are producing half of the countrys electricity requirement from coal and fuel. This entails a heavy drain of foreign exchange. This is a grave problem. But we have many other cheaper unutilised power sources such as water, wind and solar power. Producing electricity through them will be cost effective. As a country in the tropics close to the equator, it will be more profitable for us to produce electricity from solar power. We are late in this endeavour. It is to catch up with lost time that we have launched the battle for solar energy. We will be able to have roof top solar panels in one million houses countrywide."

As the country is moving forward on economic, social, religious and spiritual development, the media should follow suit, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said yesterday.
He was addressing the Certificates Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Media Training Institute at the Government Information Department yesterday.
We have to create a situation where we can say to the world that we have professional media personnel and industry in Sri Lanka, he said.
Sri Lanka needs professional journalists. They need to have knowledge, practical training to become a professional journalist, adherence to media ethics and a desire to excell in their professional. A professional is the one who protects the ethics of his vocation, Paranavithana said.
If a journalist inflames racial or religious sentiments, it is a slur in the profession. It is a breach of media ethics, if journalists accept bribe or incentives to write in a partisan manner. We see a trend where media ethics are breached more when the media gets more freedom, he said.
The Deputy Minister said there is a big demand for journalist passing out of the Sri Lanka Media Training Institute (SLMTI) because it imparts professional and ethical studies to students.

Indian govt nod for 100 pilgrims to visit Katchatheevu
The Indian Central Government has given its nod for participation of 100 fishermen pilgrims from Tamil Nadu in the December 23 consecration ceremony of St Antonys Church at Katchatheevu.
The ceremony, scheduled earlier for December 7, was postponed by Sri Lankan government to December 23 following the demise of former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
As the Centre has granted permission to 100 fishermen from the state to attend the ceremony, the Tamil Nadu government said it would make adequate arrangements for the pilgrims.
Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had on December eight asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the External Affairs Ministry to facilitate the participation of all fishermen devotees from the state intending to participate in the consecration ceremony of the church at Katchatheevu, an islet ceded by India to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.
In the letter, he had urged Modi to instruct External Affairs Ministry to accord political clearance for the visit of pilgrims to the church without any cap on the number of visitors.
He also recalled that Chief Secretary P. Ramamohana Rao had also written to Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar seeking political clearance for upto 100 pilgrims from Rameswaram, but the MEA had allowed only 20.
Political clearance accorded for the participation of only 20 persons will disappoint the ardent devotees, he had stated.
He had recalled that his predecessor, the late J Jayalalithaa, had earlier written to him that the construction of the church should be jointly taken up by the Indian and Sri Lankan sides in view of the joint heritage of fishermen from both sides.
The states fishermen were keen on protecting their traditional and customary access to this important place of worship, he had said. Though he had stated that no restrictions should be placed on the number of participants, the Centre gave its permission for 100 fishermen to attend the ceremony, official sources said.

WB approves $75 m for SLs social safety net programme
The World Bank Board has approved a $75 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to support Sri Lankas main welfare programmes by developing an integrated system to better manage the selection, administration, and payments to beneficiaries of the programmes.
The project will contribute to improving the equity, efficiency and transparency of the social safety net.
The Social Safety Nets Project, to be implemented by the Finance Ministry, will assist the government to develop a single registry of citizens containing information on family structure and economic characteristics.
The Welfare Benefits Board, set up to manage the selection and payment of welfare beneficiaries, will develop and apply new selection criteria based on data in the registry.
This will make the identification process fairer and more transparent, and ensure that the benefits reach the intended households. The project will also strengthen the governments capacity to monitor and improve welfare programmes.
The project will be implemented in partnership with the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry, the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry and the Information and Communication Technology Agency.
Today, there are more than 30 welfare programmes in Sri Lanka, operated by 11 different ministries. A lack of digital record keeping limits the capacity of the government to coordinate amongst themselves, monitor and evaluate, and prevent fraud and mismanagement in these programs.
Although the programme costs have risen gradually over time, the share of the poorest households covered has fallen. Recent analysis conducted by the World Bank shows that Sri Lankas welfare programmes have had a decreasing impact on poverty over the past decade.
This poses a challenge at a time when the population is aging, which is likely to lead to increasing demands for social assistance in coming years.
Safety net programmes act as a safety valve for Sri Lankas poor and vulnerable populations, said World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough. By increasing the efficiency of safety net expenditures, the project will improve the sustainability of social spending while ensuring that targeted households receive the full benefit of such programmes. Over time, it will also enable the government to review and refine programmes to better address emerging fiscal challenges such as the burden of an ageing population.
As part of the project, data in the registry will be updated periodically, and records will be reviewed to ensure that only eligible beneficiaries remain in the programs.
To prevent fraudulent applications, each individual will be identified in the registry using biometric technology. A one-stop shop platform will also be developed to harmonise the management of different welfare programs at the divisional secretariat level. This will help improve the customer service experience and reduce application processing times for welfare beneficiaries.
Through these initiatives, the project will help to modernise Sri Lankas welfare system for the future needs of Sri Lankas citizens.
Governments around the world are increasingly focusing on system approaches to social protection, said Senior Economist and the World Banks Task Team Leader for the project Thomas Walker. Harmonising the delivery of different social protection programmes has the potential to enhance each programmes performance and increase the overall benefit of social spending for those most in need.
The credit is from the International Development Association (IDA)  the World Banks concessionary lending arm  the credit is from the IDA Scale Up Facility, which has a final maturity of 24 years including a grace period of five years.

SL vulnerable to sustained capital outflows - Moodys
Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan rank top in terms of vulnerability to the effects of sustained capital outflows, Moodys Investors Service warned yesterday.
In its latest report, it noted the marked drop in financial asset prices in the region since the US presidential elections in November which led to currencies in the Asia Pacific region to depreciate against the dollar together with falling equity prices and reversal in portfolio flows.
However Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan however have fiscal space to buffer negative shocks, it noted.
Moodys Investors Service says that financial asset prices in Asia Pacific (APAC) have fallen markedly since the US (AAA stable) presidential election in November 2016, with APAC currencies depreciating against the US dollar, equity prices falling and portfolio flows reversing. High levels of debt and links to global financial markets are sources of vulnerability for some Asia-Pacific sovereigns, said the report. Overall, vulnerability to the direct and indirect effects of sustained capital outflows is highest for Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia (A3 stable),Hong Kong (Aa1 negative), Singapore (Aaa stable) and Taiwan (Aa3 stable), although the latter three have fiscal space to buffer negative shocks, the report said.
The few countries in the region that currently face external liquidity challenges include Mongolia (Caa1 stable) and Pakistan (B3 stable) and, to a lesser extent, the Maldives (B2 stable), Papua New Guinea (B2 stable) and Sri Lanka (B1 negative).
If they last more than a few weeks, capital outflows or lower inflows will correspond to a tightening in domestic financing conditions for many Asian countries and, for some, could exacerbate difficulties in meeting their current account and external debt payment obligations.
Moodys points out that with a few exceptions, direct vulnerability to capital outflows is limited in APAC.

ICC chief Dave Richardson impressed with progress made by SLC: Sri Lanka deserves a place on the big table
ICC Chief Executive Dave Richardson paid a huge compliment to Sri Lanka Cricket and said that they deserved a place on the big table and they should be part of discussions that take place whenever they happen.
What we are asking from Sri Lanka Cricket number one is to see the ICC as an ally as opposed to an enemy because they as the governing body of sport should work together with our members not in competition with or in authority, said Richardson addressing a media conference at the SLC yesterday. Secondly, to play a meaningful role in discussions we had at the ICC board meetings.
This is an exciting time for international cricket, the international game has gone through a period of turbulence which you as the media has reported as the Big Three take over where the governance, the financial model, the playing were in turmoil by the resolutions passed by the ICC back in April 2014.
What happened in April 2014 took place really because unfortunately countries like South Africa, Sri Lanka and New Zealand were not able to stand up to the big boys. I dont think that will happen again. As youve shown on the field Sri Lanka deserves a place on the big table and needs to stay there and be in discussions that take place whenever they happen, Richardson said. The ICC CE emphasized that the new ICC president and the leadership of Shashank Manohar were reviewing the resolutions and are on the verge of putting forward to the board some proposals that would do wonders for international cricket.
Those proposals would cover the governance area and a new revised financial model which would hopefully provide all the full members with a bigger slice of the cake than what it is currently envisaged, said Richardson.
There are two parts to my visit to Sri Lanka the first one is to do with global development, he said.
The ICC has a strategy to develop more competitive teams playing at the highest level. For too long we had 10 full members and if we are honest with ourselves there are eight, probably nine teams that can play cricket at the highest level.
We like to increase that number to 15-16 countries the likes of Afghanistan, Nepal, Malaysia and various other countries in the Asian region. Its very important that we can progress their cricket to a level where they can play against the big boys on an equal basis.
Richardson said that the first part of his visit to Sri Lanka was a meeting with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).
Obviously we are responsible for global development we are taking a more target approach but our resources are limited. Number one we want to provide the guidance, principals overall strategy. Its important that the ACC with the resources they have both from a financial and a HR perspective make best use of those and the activities that we can carry out at global level are supplemented by what the ACC can afford to do on a regional basis.
Richardson said that he was highly impressed with the depth and quality of womens cricket.
Going back five years if it was not England or Australian cricket with due respect, it wasnt worth watching. Now Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa and West Indies these women are worth watching, said Richardson.
Richardson said that he had seen the progress the SLC has made over the last year or added, I am very pleased to see the strategy that you have in place going forward.
SLC and ACC president Thilanga Sumathipala also spoke.

Air Force - Navy a close tussle
The game between Air Force Sports Club and Navy Sports Club will be a closely fought out battle for supremacy at Air Force grounds in Rathmalana today in their Dialog A Division inter club league rugby tournament. The match will commence at 4:00pm.
The Navy Sports club has failed to live up to expectations losing (19-26) to Havelocks at Havelock Park last week.
The Airmen who have faced an unexpected plight losing some of their key players due to injuries are bound to field a couple of sidelined big names for todays game. However adding to the woes would be the absence of their play maker and scrum half Ashok Wijeykumar from todays game as he is touring with the Sri Lanka national under 19 team to take part in the Junior Rugby Asiad in Malaysia to be held from December 11-17. On the other hand Air Force who has won their outings against Police (22-12), CH and FC (26-12) and Army SC (32-29) last week after beating the mighty Kandy SC by 24-21 in the seasons second match is going all out to pull this one through with a victory.
Navy SC boasts of having in their ranks quality talented players in the form of Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Lee Keegal, Richie Darmapala and Chanaka Chandimal who are playing key roles for the sailors. Then comes the granite forward Danushka Perera Gertha and players in the caliber of Sathya Ranathunga, Supun Peiris, skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda and ever reliable full back in Thilina Weerasinghe.
Navy skipper and prop forward Roshan Ranasinghe faces another acid test after losing to Havelocks (19-26) last week while the Air Force skipper Gayantha Iddamalgoda has fared admirably with the resurgent force by pulling off a superb (32-29) win over formidable Army SC last week. Referee : Aruna Rankothge
Air Force (Probable XV): Pushpakumara Samarahewa, Lahiru Udayanga, Prasad Medagedara, Thilina Bandara, Ranil Medagedara, Dimithri Patabandi, Dinesh Weeraratne, Saraka Waralla, Isuru Jayaratne and Gayantha Iddamalgoda (Captain), Ranindu Padmasanka, Sooriya Crishan, Charith Seneviratne, Ishara Madushan, Nuwan Perera, Head Coach: Leonard De Zilwa

Youth Asia Cup: Unlucky Nepal lose to Sri Lanka by one run
Sri Lanka Under 19 recorded a face-saving one-run win from the jaws of defeat after Nepal spearheaded by a spectacular 90 off 99 balls (9 fours) by Dipendra Singh Airee nearly pulled off an improbale win in their opening game of the Youth Asia Cup cricket tournament at the NCC grounds yesterday.
Although the Lankans scraped through to an exciting win it was an ominous sign that the host will have have to improve almost in all departments of the game when they encounter tougher opposition like the other three Test playing nations  India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Nepal were set to make 227 to win in their stipulated 50 overs, but were all out for 226 in 49.3 overs.
The absorbing contest swung vigorously from side to side and tilting more towards the visitors most of the time. In the last over Nepal needed eight runs to win with a wicket in hand. But Jayawickrema who was entrusted with the last over trapped Dipendra Singh Airee leg before wicket after compiling a monumental 90.
Sri Lanka who were invited to bat lacked conviction while batting and the penetrative qualities while bowling which enabled the Nepalese to cruise along.
Lankan youth who were invited to bat were off to a bad start losing opener Chaturanga with no score on the board. But Raven Kelly and Boyagoda batted steadily to added 68 for the second wicket in 14 overs. But the rest couldnt make much headway amidst a steady Nepal attack who forced the Lankan batsmen into errors.
Besides two useful innings by Arachchige (28) facing 47 deliveries with two fours and K. Bandara (48 n.o) facing 47 deliveries with five boundaries the rest were unable to consolidate and Sri Lanka finally ended up with 227 for 8 in their 50 overs. K.S. Airee took 3 for 43 for Nepal.
