Beginning of golden stretch for young and ruthless South Africa 
There are certain seismic moments when it feels a shift at the top of cricket's landscape is unfurling before our eyes. In 1995, an injury-plagued Australia brought down the West Indies reign with a surprising series victory in the Caribbean, which also proved the breakout tour for legendary paceman Glenn McGrath. It started an utter domination of international cricket for Australia, which lasted until about 2008 when South Africa conquered their demons and won Down Under. Perhaps not quite as obviously dominant as their inimitable predecessors, the Proteas nonetheless were undoubtedly cricket's best team over the next five or six years.
In the last couple of years, the Test landscape has felt decidedly open with teams seemingly dominant in their creature comforts but rudderless abroad. Accordingly, the No. 1 world ranking has repeatedly hanged hands but the mantle has felt fraudulent because none of the recipients have been particularly good. In other words, there hasn't been a definitive best Test team since South Africa started to spiral after losing legendary duo Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith a couple of years ago.
Sliding down the rankings after comprehensively losing in India and suffering a shock series loss to England at home, South Africa were largely written off ahead of their Australian tour despite the hosts struggling abroad across the formats. Having now won their third consecutive Test series in Australia, a feat last achieved by the West Indies circa 1984-93, this unheralded team astonishingly achieved arguably two of South Africa's finest ever Test victories - in consecutive matches.
South Africa's comeback victory in Perth was achieved through sheer grit and plenty of heart, made the more incredible after losing spearhead Dale Steyn early in the contest. Neil Manthorp, South Africa's broadcasting doyen, rated it arguably their finest victory since readmission.
While that win was a grinding and resolute performance, which absolutely showcased South Africa's inherent characteristics, their innings and 80 runs evisceration of Australia in the second Test in Hobart was ruthless. It almost jarring seeing South Africa steam-roll through a dishevelled Australian team.
Marked by innate pragmatism, South Africa's philosophy has generally revolved around grinding teams into submission. At the post-Test press conference, man-of-the match Kyle Abbott hinted at this ingrained approach.
We always talk about winning in the last afternoon (of the Test) and taking it deep.... (it's about) being patient, he said.
In Hobart, South Africa sealed the series in effectively less than seven sessions due to the entirety of the second day being washed out with rain.
Australia's batsmen were abominable but South Africa's probing trio of pacemen deserve plenty of plaudits. Abbott, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada scarcely bowled a bad delivery and ensured Australia's batsmen - who aren't nearly as feeble as they have shown - couldn't muster any confidence..
Australia were humiliatingly bowled out for 85 on the opening morning and then suffered another indignity by losing 8 for 32 in 19 overs early on the fourth morning. The bereft batsmen were clueless and sinking further into the abyss but, impressively, South Africa put their foot down and grinded Australia into the Hobart dirt. Their brutal approach was reminiscent of Australia's halcyon days under Steve Waugh or the West Indies heyday.
Notably, South Africa displayed a killer instinct that was often missing even during their highly successful periods under Graeme Smith. Excitingly, South Africa has achieved this series victory through their precocious youngsters. Without Steyn and injured captain AB de Villiers, it felt like South Africa would have to heavily rely on veterans Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis and Vernon Philander. But that hasn't been necessary as South Africa's youngsters have impressively emerged in spades.Their batting has decidedly more depth than Amla and du Plessis, with Dean Elgar, Temba Bavuma and brilliant wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock shining thus far this series.
That trio ensures South Africa has a solid backbone in pivotal areas of the batting order, which looked so tentative on paper ahead of the series.
There was plenty of hype surrounding Rabada ahead of this series and the 21-year-old hasn't disappointed. Rabada has showcased sheer pace and hostility - as evidenced by a withering spell on the fourth morning to effectively end the second Test - but, perhaps most impressively, he has demonstrated maturity beyond his years by being far more consistent and probing than Australia imagined pre-series.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj was barely required in Hobart but showed enough ticker in Perth to suggest a long career awaits. All of this bodes well for them in the long-term and suggests South Africa is moulding into the next Test superpower.
Perhaps these victories will be the beginning of a golden stretch for South Africa. They seemingly have the requisite personnel and temperament to conjure something special. Abbott, who claimed 6 for 77 in Australia's second innings to prove a worthy replacement for Steyn, said South Africa have worked hard at creating a new culture following their malaise. The last four or five months we drew a line in the sand and it is up to us to start a new culture, he said. Our values are totally different to 18 months ago... but we've set down our goals and what we stand for. We walk it and talk it every day and that's how you turn it around. Du Plessis labelled the victory as one of South Africa's best ever achievements. We know this is something we will forever remember, he said. That is exactly what we came here to do, to create memories.
The skipper said South Africa was keen to become the first team to whitewash Australia in a Test series on their home soil. That's the mission, we want to do that badly (achieve the whitewash), he said. We have got Australia in a position where they are under pressure and we don't want to let it go.
(We must) stay nice and humble, for us as a team we want to go to special places, du Plessis said.

Father of Haseeb Hameed quit job to coach baby boycott
Haseeb Hameed's father Ismail hails from Umraj, a village in the state of Gujarat, six hours drive from Rajkot, scene of his England debut last week. His mother Najma is also Gujarati.
Haseeb Hameed is only the second teenager to make his debut for England since 1949. Hameed's father Ismail (left) and his brothers Safwaan and Nuaman were in attendance in Rajkot as the youngster made his debut
Ismail Hameed emigrated and settled in Bolton in 1969, working in the Lancashire town's cotton factories before becoming a driving instructor so he could devote more time to coaching Haseeb after school.
Ismail's love of cricket, and particularly Geoffrey Boycott's discipline towards batting, led him to coach his older sons Safwaan and Nuaman - now in their 30s - when they were younger.
An opening batsman himself in the Bolton Association League, he was known as Geoffrey for the way he played.
Although it was only a pastoral passion, coaching his sons in cricket became his other job.
He sent his eldest sons to play for Tonge Cricket Club in Bolton and attempted to provide them with a similar path towards professional cricket.
Neither made it past club level, although a series of injuries held back Safwaan, who has followed his father's lead by coaching in the area.. Haseeb would hijack their family coaching sessions at Rawsthorne Park, with his tiny Gray-Nicolls bat tucked under his arm.
According to Haseeb, his father sacrificed his life to help the brothers succeed in theirs. Last season he was still giving Haseeb throw-downs in the nets at Old Trafford.
The family make regular trips back to Gujarat and were on hand to witness his 82 against India. Sisters Ateqah and Subhana complete the five siblings.
They were all due to be in India anyway for Nuaman's wedding to Nadiya, which Haseeb missed to remain with England. - Daily Mail

Usain Bolt: What is the worlds fastest man really like
Most people know that Usain Bolt is the fastest human on Earth. But most people have absolutely no idea how that feels.
What is it like to command a frame of muscle and bone so perfectly conditioned that, at the bang of a starting pistol, you move so explosively that you leave the world behind
The remarkable thing about Bolt is that even his peers are not in a position to know. So what is it like to be Usain Bolt
And, as fast as the burst from his sprinters blocks, the 30-year-old responds: Awesomeness. This is a man very comfortable in his own skin. Sitting in a restaurant he owns in Jamaicas capital Kingston, his home since he was 16 years old, the busy market streets and city noise reflect the media frenzy around his every move.
Inside, everything is calm as he lopes slowly down the stairs. He allows his long, powerful body to adjust to the contours of a chair. How on earth does a man who is 6ft 5ins ever get out of the blocks
Staying motivated
Bolt is here to talk about his documentary I Am Bolt - a behind-the-scenes look at his life and journey to superstardom. He wants it, above all, to inspire everyone to be the best they can possibly be. The hardest thing is to motivate yourself, he says. I talk to myself... especially when Im in training and I dont want to do it anymore, I say If you wanna be a champion you gotta go, get up. I say Youre gonna lose. You dont wanna lose. So lets finish this.
The desire to motivate derives from the need to identify what every talented performer, especially someone as gifted as Bolt, hides: the sacrifices they make to reach their goals.
People always say to me Usain, it looks so easy. Its not easy... its a lot of work, you just dont see it. And all the injuries and stress that I go through and what Im thinking.... all these things I just want to share with the world.
Back to Bolts roots
To really understand the worlds fastest man, you have to leave Kingston and head to where it all began. There are a special few who have the ability to transcend their sports. Baseballs Babe Ruth, footballs Pele, basketballs Michael Jordan and boxings Muhammad Ali all come to mind. But how much did growing up in Pigtown, Bauru, Wilmington and Louisville have to do with the charismatic brilliance of their famous sons
The residents of the small village of Sherwood Content, hugged by wooded hills in the north of the island, are in no doubt: no Sherwood Content, no Usain Bolt the superstar. This secluded part of the countryside is three hours drive west of the capital but tracking down Bolts Aunt Lilly isnt hard to do - she has Welcome Aunt Lilly painted on the side of her house. She has a theory that the secret of her nephews success is really down to her cooking.
Breaking in and out of patois, she says that his speed comes from the yam, the dumpling and the pork... hes a man who really love food. Young Usain would pop by Lillys house before going home from school or track events. No one listening to Lilly could fail to believe in the magical power of her meals.
She never doubted that her nephew was special but we didnt know what was ahead of him. When asked about Bolts unique triple triple - winning three gold medals in three consecutive Olympics - she says: Well, I knew he would do it adding cos he said he was gonna do it. He was a sore loser Bolts sporting education began at Waldensia Primary School, a short walk from the house where his parents still live.
His former teacher, Sheron Seivwright, points out that he always commanded attention. I dont know what his parents fed him on but he was quite energetic, could run very, very fast at his tender age, she says.
Seivwright lives opposite the small, colourful school, a mural of Bolt in his famous lightning Bolt pose is visible from her window. During Thursday games time, she remembers watching Bolt win races against older children. On the rare occasions someone beat him, he was a sore loser.
She remembers: He would cry. Always cry. And I would rub his head and say no, man, you cant cry. One day youre gonna be a great runner.
When asked how she feels watching him race now, Seivwrights reserve falls away. Every time I hear his name or I see him run, [I get] goose pimples. I scream, I yell, I jump up and down. I cant believe hes such a great legend, a great hero. Im so very, very proud, she says.
And thats it: he is a world superstar, but Jamaicas champion. Hes the man who not only brought them dancing, screaming, leap-up-and-down joy, but also unbridled, smiling pride. Back in the restaurant, I tell Bolt that a family member had told me that all the Bolts are superstars. He instinctively identifies my source, Auntie Lilly, I bet, adding, But yeah, were cool people. Hes not a morning person Bolt recognises that his genes have played a part in his journey but so, too, has his environment and the management of his abilities. His success has brought great adventures but also a punishing schedule of media and commercial commitments. By his side throughout it all is his executive manager NJ Walker, his best friend since he was six years old. We look at my job as a buffer between him and the rest of the world, says Walker. So everyone comes to NJ and Usain can focus on track and field.
I oversee aspects of his life. I coordinate his appearances, review contracts, negotiate contracts - the only thing I dont do for him is sign. What is it like having a best friend who has won nine Olympic gold medals. To know that your friend you grew up with, played with in the street, has had such an impact on the world, has had such achievements - we never dream of stuff like this.
NJ speaks with such enthusiasm that it is clear this doesnt feel like a job for him, but there are times he has to keep his friend in line. Hes not a morning person - so when NJ knocks him up to go somewhere at 6am, he wants to knock me away. But I have his best interests [at heart]. Even though we have days where he might want me to be his friend more than his manager, we are very good at finding the balance. Triple triple under threat
For a long time Bolt has offered hope to a sport beleaguered by cheating. While he has stood clean, his rivals have fallen around him. Fellow sprinters Tyson Gay, Justin Gatlin and Jamaicas Asafa Powell have all served drugs bans and now another of Bolts team-mates is under investigation.
Should Nesta Carter be suspended for doping, it is possible that each of the members of the Jamaica relay team from the 2008 Beijing Olympics could be forced to hand back their gold medals. Retests of the sprinters Beijing 2008 doping samples found traces of a banned stimulant and his fate now rests in the hands of an International Olympic Committee (IOC) disciplinary panel. Through no fault of his own, Bolts triple triple is under threat.
He says it would be devastating for him to lose a medal but quickly points out that it is not just stressful for him but for everyone in athletics. I think the sport is in a really bad place right now, but I think the only place it can go is up, Bolt adds. I have one more season to help push forward and try and promote the sport in the brightest light I possibly can.
Life after racing
Bolt insists the 2017 World Championships in London in August will definitely be his last competition. But how will he cope when his races are run and his competitions are over Will he watch the Tokyo Olympics in 2020
I might be crying, he jokes. I will be there for sure. One thing Im looking forward to now is actually going to the Olympics as a spectator - to actually watch, so I can watch all kinds of different sports. But I dont know how Im going to feel... theyve told me that Im gonna miss it.
But you got to retire at some point. As Michael Johnson said, retire when you have done everything you wanted to and Ive done everything I wanted to do, so Im going to retire. As Aunt Lilly puts it, the stadiums wont be the same without him. Bolt says he is talking to IAAF president Lord Coe about his next focus to figure out which way I can help but what about another sport
This week it was reported he is to train with German club Borussia Dortmund a link-up seemingly initiated via shared sponsor Puma. But could the Manchester United fan really swap the track for the football pitch
Ive always said I wanted to play football, he says. Weve talked about it but Im not fully sure what were gonna do yet so well see.
But for now we have him, the greatest athlete in the world - perhaps of all time - ready to astonish, thrill, delight us once more. How does it feel to watch Usain Bolt Awesomeness.

West Indies Cricket Board cant buy respect-Darren Sammy
Former captain Darren Sammy has become embroiled in a row between Darren Bravo and the West Indies Cricket Board after the batsman was sent home from their tour of Zimbabwe.
The 32-year-old St Lucia all-rounder has not played for the West Indies since captaining the team to victory in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata in April but reacted on social media after news broke of Bravos punishment..
Dave Cameron
Sammy has his own issues with the WICB after his dismissal in the summer and wasted no time wading on Bravos behalf.
The Dhaka Dynamite star tweeted: So apparently @dmbravo46 is being sent home for this tweet. All Im going to say is you cant buy respect from a mall.. Respect is earned. And Some ppl just dont deserve the respect of others.
Bravo was replaced with Jason Mohammed after the former reacted on Twitter to an interview given by WICB chairman Dave Cameron.
Cameron said Bravo was downgraded to a Grade C contract due to his falling batting average, although the player refutes that he was ever on a top tier deal.
It is explicit that if your averages are not above a certain level it tells you what contracts you get. It is very, very explicit, Cameron told Caribbean television network SportsMax TV.
His averages in the last two years have been declining, so what do you do Reward poor performance or do you encourage him to get better
Bravo responded with a tweet saying he had never been offered a Grade-A contract. You hav been failing 4 d last 4yrs. Y dont u resign and FYI Ive neva been given an A contract. Big idiot @davec51, he tweeted.
Adding later on Instagram: Say what you want I have nothing to prove. So go ahead and judge me,just make sure you are perfect for the rest of your life.
A WICB release said Bravo had been replaced due to inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour, which is contrary to his contractual obligations to the WICB.
A clause in Bravos match/tour contract, the release said, clearly states not to make any statement in or to any form of media (which shall include, without limitation, print media, television, radio, internet or any social networking media), or any other public statement, which would bring yourself, WICB or any official or authorised representative of WICB or the game of cricket into disrepute, and your agreement to use all such media in a responsible manner.

Malik - 25 years with Kandy SC
Today, Kandy Sports Club is known as the cradle of rugby, it is said that Kandy SC takes to rugby like a duck takes to water. It also has a long and proud history and the man who has made a significant contribution to the game at this club is none other than Malik Samarawickrema who will be completing 25 years of dedicated service. When the history of Kandy Sports Club rugby is recorded, the name of Malik Samarawickrema will stand out as one of the greatest administrators of the club and Sri Lanka rugby.
His contribution to the club should be weighed in gold. It was he who was behind to see members of the club all working together to help the sport become a success. Malik ventured into areas where no other man had gone to bring Kandy SC to where it is today. He was a listener, mentor and father figure to players who will always cherish his contribution. If not for Malik, rugby would have suffered the same fate as cricket, football and hockey which now lies in the funeral parlor at club level. Malik startedhis rugby at Royal College as a scrum half from 1966 to 1968.

Kandy SC bounce back to beat Army 34-10
Kandy Sports Club bounced back quickly from their shock defeat at the hands of Air Force SC last week to record a fine 34 points (5 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) win against a somewhat off colour Army SC outfit in their Dialog A division
Inter-club first round rugby fixture played at Racecourse International Stadium yesterday. The winners led 24-3 at lemons.
Kandy started off brilliantly, racing to a score of 24-3 with a four-try blitz in the first half. But Army got their act together and did well to comeback in the second half with an improved performance.
Kandy centre Kanchana Ramanayaka was the first to score a try when he took the ball over the line after off a beautiful three quarter move. Kandy opened out the game and played to a good pace and earned more first half
tries through number eight Buwaneka Udangamuwa and winger Richard Dharmapala who touched down two tries with his clever foot work. Fly half Arshad Jamaldeen slotted in two conversions out of the four tries they scored.
Army bridged the gap with a penalty fired across by their full back Shanaka Kumara, before the teams went in for half time at 24-3 with Kandy in the lead. The game lost its momentum in the second half as both teams produced a
half-hearted attempt - most of the time Army was guilty of dropping the ball at crucial stages of the game due to heavy rain and the ball was difficult to handle because of wet conditions.
After the turn around in the 53rd minute Kandy fly half Jamaldeen put over a 35-metre penalty to increase the lead to 27-3.
Army caught up with a try by their third row forward Silva in the 62nd minute, which was converted by Shanaka Kumara to made the score 27-10 in favour of Kandy.
Both Army and the visitors had plenty of chances of breaching the line, but their moves lacked the finishing touches, despite getting so many over laps.. In the 73rd minute fly half Arshad Jamaldeen who shifted to centre, sealed the game for Kandy when he went over the line for a try off a three quarter move. Full back Thilina Wijesinghe slotted in the conversion to give Kandy a superb win.
Referee: Priyantha Gunaratne
Air Force continue to impress
In another Dialog A division match high riding Air Force SC beat Police SC by 22 points (1 try, 1 conversion, 5 penalties) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion) at Police Park yesterday after leading 9-0 at half time.
For the winners fly half Ashan Bandara scored the solitary try while centre Charith Seneviratne made the conversion and slotted in five penalties while for the losers a penalty try and try was scored. The conversion was fired across by full back Rajitha Sansoni.

Havies go out favourites against CR today
It will be an exciting tussle for supremacy when Havelocks Sports Club host arch rivals CR & FC in the first leg of the Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby tournament match played for the Commander Eustace Matthysz trophy at Havelock Park today. Kick off will be at 4.00pm.
CR red shirts, by which the Ceylonese Rugby and Football club is branded among the rugby loving fraternity in the country and going by how the two teams faired this season, Havelocks SC have a definite chance of coming on top and this factor makes the event a thrilling tussle.
The trophy is named after Commander Eustace Matthysz, a rugby stalwart and former dynamic Ceylon prop forward who also represented Sri Lanka Navy and Havelocks SC with distinction before he brought fame and honour to the country as the President of the Asian Rugby Football Union in 1974. This coveted trophy is on offer since 1991 and was won by the Red Shirts in the inaugural year, beating the Park Club by an aggregate of 14 points to 12.
It is the Park Club which won last year by an aggregate of 60 points to 39 after winning both legs (34-18) at Longden Place in the first leg and triumphed at the end of a closely contested battle by 26 points to 21 in the second leg at Havelock Park, hence they are the current holders of the trophy.
In the first match of the league this year Havies beat Air Force 29-5 while CR was really lucky to beat the Army outfit by 25-24. The lads from Longden Place lost to the formidable young Navy side by 21 points to 13 last week at Welisara while Havelocks carried out a scintillating performance to thrash Police SC by 38-8 at Police Park.
The Park club boys with the presence of a sturdy set of forwards who are capable of pulling the game in their favour will have to play a vital role in todays game and if the speedy three quarter line of the Havies spearheaded by their dynamic play maker former Peterite and present
national fly half Dulaj Perera delivers the desired results it will be a daunting task for the Red Shirts in countering their attack.

Grand debut for de Grandhomme as Kiwis take charge
CHRISTCHURCH: Late bloomer Colin de Grandhomme celebrated his first international call-up with record New Zealand debut bowling figures of 6-41 as Pakistan crumbled in their first innings of the opening Test on Friday.
After the 30-year-old de Grandhomme engineered Pakistans collapse to be all out for 133 at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, New Zealands other debutant Jeet Raval put them in a strong position to be 104-3 in reply at stumps.
New Zealand made a rocky start to their reply when the experienced Tom Latham, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor -- with 158 Tests between them -- could muster only 16 runs in total.
But the novice Raval (55 not out) and Henry Nicholls (not out 29 in his eighth Test) have added 64 for the fourth wicket to put New Zealand in charge.
On what was effectively the first day of a now four-day Test, after rain washed out the scheduled Thursday start, the honours lay with de Grandhomme.
The Harare-born, former Zimbabwe under-19 representative is more renowned as a big-hitting batsman but was picked for the all-rounder role ahead of the more experienced Jimmy Neesham in the swing-friendly conditions.
Only seven other New Zealand bowlers have taken five or more wickets on debut, with the previous best figures belonging to Tim Southee at five for 55.
The previous best six-wicket haul was Alex Moirs six for 155 against England 65 years ago.
Although conditions appeared ripe for bowling when Williamson won the toss his strike pair Southee and Trent Boult strayed too much to seriously trouble Pakistan openers Sami Aslam and Azhar Ali in the first hour. But it was all change when Williamson overlooked Neil Wagner as his first-change bowler and flicked the ball to de Grandhomme. With his 15th delivery the Aucklander tempted Ali to prod at a ball that seamed back and clattered into the off stump. AFP

Ashwin puts India on top in 2nd England Test
VISAKHAPATNAM, Friday : Ravichandran Ashwin starred with the bat and ball to put India on top in the second Test as Englands batsmen struggled against spin in their first innings reply on day two in Visakhapatnam on Friday.
England were reeling at 103 for five at stumps in response to Indias first
innings score of 455. The visitors still trail by 352 runs.
Ashwin, who scored a gritty half-century to propel the Indian score after skipper Virat Kohlis 167, claimed two wickets in the final session to rattle the English top-order.
Pace spearhead Mohammed Shami struck early to shatter skipper Alastair Cooks off stump in an early blow as England began their first innings reply before tea.
Shami bowled an inspired first spell with the new ball as he cleaned up Cook for two in the third over of the innings.
Shamis sensational delivery pitched on a good length before moving in a shade to hit the top of Cooks off stump and break it in two, leaving England 4-1. Haseeb Hameed, who impressed on debut with a well-made 82 in the second innings of the Rajkot Test, put on 47 runs with Joe Root (53) in his bid to steady the innings.
But Hameeds resistance did not last long as he was run out for 13 after being sent back while attempting to take a second run. Off-spinner Ashwin soon took charge to get Ben Duckett clean bowled for five and then got the big wicket of Root, who recorded his 24th Test half-century.
Root tried to counter the Indian spin attack during his 98-ball stay laced with six boundaries, but ran out of patience after giving away a catch to long-off.
Debutant off-spinner Jayant Yadav joined his senior partner from the other end to get his first Test wicket after trapping Moeen Ali lbw for one as England slipped to 80-5. Stokes and Bairstow then played cautiously to see off the rest of the days play with a 23-run unbeaten stand. Earlier Ashwin, who scored 70 in the Rajkot Test, continued his good run of form with the bat before the hosts were bowled out in the afternoon session.
