National Policy on Evaluation
Shifting focus to accountability
It is not often that Sri Lanka asks itself, where are we really going Are we doing the right thing Is what we are doing working Do we need to change the system But it was these very questions that recently appointed Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri was faced with when he happened to glance at yet another report on his own district, Moneragala.
Having represented it for over 30 years, he said the district has seen many programmes, aid agencies and NGOs come and go, and yet, year after year, Moneragala has become infamous for occupying the bottom of the poverty index.
The UNDP had prepared a five-year programme and when I looked at the draft report, I was surprised by some of the figures given by various departments. I felt embarrassed looking at the report. The targets given by certain government departments were unachievable. They had simply compiled some numbers and given it to the UNDP. Who would monitor them thereafter The report will sit on some shelf again, he said.
In the 1980s, former President J.R. Jayewardene invited countries to invest in any district of their choosing. Norway selected Moneragala.
They had discussions with the grassroots and other groups and Norway asked us what they could do for us. That brought in a lot of development - schools, roads, water services. Thereafter, NGOs and INGOs also spent funds on the district. If you speak to the District Secretariat in Moneragala, you will find out that a huge amount of money has been pumped into this district over the years, but where has it all gone There has been no proper monitoring. What is the ultimate benefit to the people
Today, Kumarasiri heads the Sri Lanka Parliamentarians Forum for Development Evaluation to promote the incorporation of the National Policy on Evaluation. The policy is expected to stress the need for all government projects to go through a cycle of evaluation and monitoring prior to the project, during and after. Earlier this month, the policy received Cabinet approval and he hoped to have it passed in Parliament in time for the International Conference on Evaluation hosted by the Forum on September 17. Over 100 Parliamentarians around the world are expected to arrive in the country for the event.
The Deputy Speaker has also received the Speakers approval to set up an Evaluation and Monitoring Unit in Parliament. Once an annual report comes in, they go through it and we get an executive summary. So we know what is happening at the beginning and end of the year and we know who the beneficiaries of the programmes are.
Together with 16 other MPs, they have also started promoting the concept of evaluation among public officials in their respective districts, to increase awareness on evaluation and the need to implement it.
It is about the will to get value for money, observed Kumarasiri, as he stressed that once implemented, every cent of public money spent would be accounted for.
Finding the needle in the haystack
When an email was sent out to all 225 MPs in Parliament asking them to come support the move to push for a National Policy on Evaluation, UNP MP Mayantha Disssanayake said only 30 showed up for the meeting. Today, only 14 are actively lobby for it and 10 are from the government. Ninety-five percent of them are young MPs.
It is the Opposition which should be pushing this really, because it will benefit them the most to know what the government is doing with public money. But they are not interested.
After much consultation, the National Policy on Evaluation was introduced to Parliament in 2016 by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana as a private members bill and since then, the MPs have been pushing for it to be turned into legislation. This year they had a breakthrough.
Dissanayake believes that this legislation would be as important as the Right to Information Act and would change the way government worked. It would also bring in a system of accountability and scientific reasoning to decisions and policies adopted by the government.
When Cabinet ministers change and get new portfolios, they do not look at overall government policies, they just implement whatever they perceive is advantageous to them. That should not be happening. When these things happen, people get affected, he said.
Dissanayake believed that introducing evaluation and monitoring to all government projects would also keep politicians and officials in check. People always ask where the money went, but until now we didnt have a proper mechanism to evaluate on what the money has been spent and if it was worth it.
Dissanayake is the fifth politician in his family and represents the Kandy District. If there was one project MPs in Kandy have been advocating for, it would be the Central Expressway. It was an election promise made by his father Gamini Dissanayake in his Presidential Election manifesto in 1994, but since then, consecutive governments have done little to implement the project.
For over 30 years we spoke of this. But this government is very keen. The difference between the last government and the present regime is that the last spent billions on projects that were politically motivated. For example, Hambantota. It is a poor district, but to develop an airport and port without supporting infrastructure which would only bring benefits in the next 25 years is a waste of money. We must look at and evaluate projects that would bring benefits to the country in the next 5-10 year period. If you are looking at the next 30 years, it is a waste of money.
Speaking of political decisions, he stressed that the presence of evaluation would also limit changing regimes shifting development to their own constituencies with no scientific logic to do so.
Hypothetically, say a politician from Kegalle becomes the President. Every economic project and development would suddenly shift to Kegalle. By that time, if this policy is entrenched, yes, there will be a lot of development in Kegalle, but everything will be evaluated and that would hopefully prevent someone from opening a port in landlocked Kegalle.
More importantly, MPs, he said, would have time to actually find the information they need to question bureaucrats and government in Parliament.
Now part of several Standing Committees in Parliament, MPs were overwhelmed by the information sent to them by ministries. More often than not, such a process means that vital information is buried among a stack of files,
At Budgeting times, it is very difficult to get information from ministries, especially the Finance Ministry. They flush you with files which reach three to four feet high. When you ask the official, he says it is in such and such a book. You would be lucky to have 15 minutes of reading time every day. But if there is a summary report which is concise, the MP can get all the information he needs. It can make politicians smarter and more able to do their job.
UNP Kegalle District MP Sandith Samarasinghe, in the meantime, said the Evaluation Policy would also question the effectiveness of legislation. For example, we can evaluate our policies in the education sector, look at unemployment, etc, he said.
Further, the policy would play an important role in ensuring that the government is on the right track when it comes to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. Both Dissanayake and Samarasinghe reiterated that Evaluation would help the government with its programmes on SDGs and alert them when it is not taking them towards the desired goal.
Managing for results
This is not the first time the government has taken up Evaluation. The former government too had promoted it in a bid to ensure that government projects were delivering results to the people.
Former Plan Implementation Ministrys Department of Foreign Aid and Budget Monitoring Director General under the previous regime, and former National Integration Secretary under President Sirisena, Velayuthan Sivagnanasothy, writing a paper in October 2007, explained that the government at the time was moving towards Managing for Development Results (MfDR), thus shifting focus from inputs, activities and outputs to accountability for results.
A good Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system should go beyond institutional boundaries to cover national, sectoral, programme and project level to ensure results orientation in government, he stated in the paper.
At the time, the Plan Implementation Ministry had taken on board MfDR and became the National Focal Point for Monitoring and Evaluation of all government development projects and programmes to ensure achievement of results and development effectiveness.
Today, what counts is not so much on how many clinics have been built, but whether citizens health has improved. Not how many schools have been constructed, but how many girls and boys are better educated, declared an ambitious government plan.
In the 1990s, with the technical support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Post Evaluation System was strengthened in the Plan Implementation Ministry. In the late 1990s, the UNDP provided technical support in a large way to strengthen the Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation System (RBME) in Sri Lanka. This enabled the government officials at the national and sub-national level to understand and recognise the importance of Results-Focused Monitoring. Also many positive factors such as political will, overarching policy, coordination of information collection, flow of information from line ministries and projects to the MPI/DFABM, strengthening of the electronic Information Management System in the National Operations Room (NOR) of the Plan Implementation Ministry and demand for information for decision making contributed to a positive enabling environment. However, concerns such as capacity in government agencies, a large number of ministries and the resultant coordination issues are some of the challenges that need to be addressed, wrote Sivagnanasothy further.
In addition, between 2006-7, a comprehensive Performance Measurement System was piloted with four key line ministries (Education, Health, Agriculture and Highways). A range of activities such as awareness programmes, advocacy and sensitisation to policymakers and training programmes were conducted with the technical support of the UNDP and ADB. MfDR was thus made operational in 35 line ministries.
Sivagnanasothy noted that it was necessary to have incentives to reward success to help government strengthen performance accountability and improve a continuous learning culture.
The implementation phase however was not smooth. Sivagnanasothy found that dissemination of M&E findings were inadequate. M&E institutions and the planning institutions functioned in isolation and did not have an effective formalised feedback arrangement to integrate lessons into the planning and design of new projects. Donors and partner countries continued to be disbursement-oriented and used their own donor systems rather than countrys systems to maintain visibility and attribution. In addition, there was a shortage of professionals, multiple results frameworks, too many indicators, lack of aid predictability and weak statistical capacity.
Further, it was also difficult to get consensus to set up Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for government departments.
Specifying and agreeing on expected results is not easy. The results chain is not always logical as expected. Indicators are missing for some results areas. Targets and baselines are not given. Setting achievable targets is not possible in the absence of a baseline. The greatest problem associated with performance management is unrealistic expectations.
Sivagnanasothy who is also helping the incumbent government to bring about the National Evaluation Policy helped by USAID, this time concluded in his paper, It is necessary to look at the balance between learning and accountability. While independent evaluation is important for ensuring objectivity, too much emphasis on accountability-focused donor-driven independent evaluation function can be a potential constraint for lessons learning and feedback.
SLEVA
Regardless of government or the funding agency, the Sri Lanka Evaluation Association (SLEVA), set up in 1990, has worked for the last 18 years to entrench evaluation and monitoring in the development process of the country.
Former SLEVA President and one of its founding members, Dr. Soma de Silva was very pleased with their journey thus far and said that no country in the world had progressed so far in such a short period of time with Evaluation Associations as Sri Lanka has done. Evaluation which started to be promoted within UN agencies in the 1990s was brought into the government process when Dr. de Silva and 35 interested professionals in various fields met to form SLEVA. The country having gone through many management styles, from command-driven to objective-oriented, was now being asked to look at whether management brought results.
Results meant positive changes for people, changes in their standard of living. If there is development there needs to be improvement in access to health, education, quality of services, etc., she said.
SLEVA which also started the first international conference on evaluation in the country helped set up a post graduate diploma in Evaluation at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The goal is to eventually make it a fully-fledged department. She stressed that this would help address the lack of professionals in the field.
Government officers are now working on a framework for implementation. I believe it has to be done carefully, giving sufficient flexibility while requiring adherence to certain standards, said Dr. de Silva.
You cannot be prescriptive, she explained, as no one can see the future.
Contrary to the Parliamentarians, Dr. de Silva said instead of having every project evaluated, it was more practical to prioritise the most important programmes in every sector and evaluate them.
I would be happy if we have at least one good evaluation done for every sector every year. The number of evaluations should not be the priority.
For this, the entire government mechanism would have to have an evaluation plan to continually make development processes efficient, sustainable and reach the marginal. She stressed that it should not be a fault-finding missing, but driven by a concern for the people and the desire to deliver them better results.
If you take higher education, rather than continuing with what has happened, can we stop and think What is the quality of the graduates we are producing What are we achieving Their employability Their ability to create a society to live in Then look at the programmes for that and prioritise the most important ones. Is this teaching working Is it giving us quality graduates Is it giving us necessary quantities or are we overproducing Under-producing in certain sectors Those questions should be brought out by the experts in those fields and it should be a consultative process with the people who are benefitting from the system and not benefitting from the system. Likewise, one must look at the most important questions in the education, healthcare systems and so on.
The issue, at times, she said was that many departments had well established procedures but few strong heads of departments to look at the system and say, Is what we are doing necessary What is our contribution Can we do an evaluation and see if we can do better
At times, we do so many things, everybody is busy, but are they leading to results Are they changing lives Can we check that More often than not, lack of money was not the issue in government; the question was how it was being utilised.
Further for evaluation to be most effective there needs to be a campaign to educate the people and officials to use the information that is found. If the people are to question authority, they must first understand the problem, said Dr. de Silva.
Learning from mistakes
The major complaint about comprehensive evaluations of systems, however, was that they took too long and the reports were often too technical to understand. Dr. de Silva recommended that these reports be disseminated in an official friendly manner and to the media, so the people understood the results better. Further, she said officials could learn while conducting the evaluation process through consultative discussions with various stakeholders. Results can be used from the word go.
At the end of the day however, for government to evaluate their policies, Dr. de Silva noted that it was important to create an enabling environment where it was acceptable for officials and politicians to admit when policies have not worked and thereafter adjust them for the better,
Why cant we get up in annual reviews, donor meetings or Parliament and say, Yes we did this, but it was a mistake We can do it without having to take personal responsibility. All this work is not personal, it is collective and it is a system approach. We are continuously trying to improve the system. But we must find out what has gone wrong first.
Sometimes if you put the basics right, the system will work, she said.

Sino Lanka joint venture to manufacture solar panels
Infinity Energy Company Limited (INFINITY), one of the leading solar panel manufactures and exporters in China has set up a joint venture with a local company- Helio Energy Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Battaramulla, to manufacture and export solar panels and invertors for the export market. It is a BOI approved project and the two companies would jointly invest US$ 15 million.
The company officials said a manufacturing plant is being set up in Madampe, Chilaw and the production will begin in September.
Athula Wickramaarachchi
Founder Chairman of Helio Energy Lanka, Athula Wickramaarachchi told the Daily News Business that their main objective is to supply to the export market. INFINITY China based in Jiangsu province China is one of the largest exporters of solar panels to Europe and the US. However INFINITY is now faced with high taxes when exporting out of China to the US. Hence they have decided to manufacture in Sri Lanka and re-export not only to the US but to the South Asian region as well, he said.
This project will reverse the trend where Sri Lanka is paying to import solar panels and instead we will bring in foreign exchange to Sri Lanka by way of a new industry.
The governments encouragement towards installing solar energy, tax benefits and quality of human workforce in Sri Lanka encouraged them to manufacture their product range here.
Initially over 30 Chinese technicians and 10 Sri Lankans would be employed and once the local staff is trained to handle the manufacturing process, the Chinese workers would move out, he said.
He said that they also hope to market 20% of their products locally under the brand Helio and this would help to lower the overheads of solar power installations and would also asset in the recycling of aging solar panels. Helio energy products have been sanctioned for use in Sri Lanka by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority.
He said that today two types of solar panels are being used in the world. Polycrystalline solar panels are moving away due to its high cost and low generation of power. INFINITY is manufacturing solar panels under the Monocrystalline technology which is now being used in Europe and USA and all over the world and we offer a 25 year worldwide guarantee for our products.
He said that under the first phase the factory will manufacture around 1,300 panels and invertors per month and will soon move to the manufacture of other products in one year of its operations.

SLFP MPs in Opposition set to rejoin government: Amunugama
Several Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) parliamentarians who sat in the Opposition recently are once again discussing to rejoin the unity government, Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
Speaking to journalists in Kandy, the Minister said that many of the SLFP members who left the government are dejected as they had not got what they wanted from the Joint Opposition.
He said many of the JO members, instead of welcoming the 16 members, have refused to accept them into their fold.
The Minister predicted that at least two or three SLFP members who left the government may re-join in the near future.
Earlier SLFP ministers who voted in favour of the No-confidence Motion brought by the Joint Opposition against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe resigned from their ministerial portfolios of the national government.
The SLFP Cabinet, State and the Deputy Ministers who voted for the No-confidence Motion and the Deputy Speaker resigned from their posts.

Sri Lanka plays key role in lessening tensions in Indian Ocean region: PM
Sri Lanka has the opportunity of leveraging its strategic location and friendly relations with the key maritime nations to take the initiative to lessen tension in the Indian Ocean region, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was speaking at the convocation ceremony for the Bandaranaike International Diplomatic Training Institute held at the BMICH recently.
He remarked that keeping sea lanes of communication open by ensuring freedom of navigation in the Indian ocean was key to achieve this objective for which Sri Lanka could take the initiative.
A stable maritime order is a prerequisite for Sri Lankas development to become a hub in the Indian Ocean, he said.
The most important Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC) runs past Sri Lanka making it a strategic location for the control and safety of the sea lanes and communication lines. It gives Sri Lanka the opportunity of becoming the Hub of the Indian Ocean as well, he said. The control of the strategic foothold of the SLOC and choke points in the Indian Ocean enables the control of energy which has resulted in a number of geopolitical issues, the Prime Minister said.
This he said includes China recognizing its strategic vulnerability, US being concerned of Chinese expansion in the Indian Ocean and India concerned about a possible change in status quo.
This political interplay in the Indian Ocean is in danger of becoming a major center of tension. A power struggle in the Indian Ocean will no doubt also adversely affect Sri Lankas objective of becoming the hub of the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lankas future prosperity depends on the stability of the Indian Ocean. A power struggle in the Indian Ocean also risks making the littoral states into spectators in the Indian Ocean, he said.
He reiterated that Sri Lanka has an important role to play in providing a space for discussions and consensus building on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and related issues such as maritime economy and environment. Regional initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, Indo-Pacific Strategy, Act East, Neighbourhood First, Free and Open Pacific and Indian Ocean, can all be treated as complementary. They can provide space for further integration of regional economies as well, he said.
He said Sri Lankas participates in Chinas Belt and Road initiative because it complements Sri Lankas own initiatives. The maritime silk road further strengthens our role as the Hub of the Indian Ocean, he said. Following the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and related Human Rights issues that arose, Sri Lanka since January 2015, has introduced a new multi-pronged approach to re-position itself in the regional order.

Stop journaling about bad things!
Writing about positive emotions may help to reduce stress and anxiety, according to our new study, published in the British Journal of Health Psychology.
Earlier research has also found that writing about negative emotions  getting things 'off your chest'  can improve your mental health. And it seems to benefit physical health, too.
Stress affects your physical health, so it is thought that improvements in mental well-being might stop people becoming physically unwell. Research has shown that writing about negative emotions can lead to fewer visits to the doctor, fewer self-reported symptoms of ill health, and less time off work due to ill health.
Not many studies have investigated writing about positive emotions, but if writing about negative emotions helps people deal with their negative thoughts and feelings, then it's possible that focusing on positive emotions might have a positive effect on people's mental health.
Earlier research has shown that writing about positive experiences for 20 minutes a day, for three consecutive days, improved people's mood and led to fewer visits to the doctor. Even writing for as little as two minutes a day about a positive experience has been shown to reduce the number of health complaints that people report.
While earlier studies showed that writing about positive experiences can improve your mood, we didn't know what effect it might have on stress and anxiety.
For our study, we investigated whether writing about a positive experience  which could include anything from being moved by a good book, painting or piece of music, to falling in love  could reduce stress, anxiety and common health complaints, such as a headache, back pain or coughs and colds. We also wanted to know if it would be helpful for all people, regardless of their level of distress.
We recruited 71 healthy participants, aged 19 to 77, and randomly allocated them to one of two groups. We asked one group (37 participants) to write about the most wonderful experiences of their life for 20 minutes a day, for three consecutive days, and we asked the other group (34 participants) to write about a neutral topic, such as their plans for the rest of the day, over the same time frame.
We measured levels of anxiety, as reported by the participants, immediately before and after they completed their writing task. We found a significantly greater decrease in anxiety for those people who wrote about positive experiences, compared with those who wrote about neutral topics.
The participants also reported their levels of stress, anxiety and physical health complaints four weeks after they completed the writing tasks.
Stress and anxiety decreased to a significantly greater extent for those who wrote about positive experiences after four weeks, compared with the levels reported before they completed the writing tasks. However, writing didn't improve participants' physical health problems.
We also found that writing about happy moments was effective, regardless of the levels of distress that people reported at the start of the study.

Troops into drug war
Different opinions have been expressed over the deployment of the Tri-Forces in the government's war against the drug underworld. With the escalation of drug related killings, perhaps, in a desperate move, the government has decided to enlist the services of the security forces to eradicate the drug menace. This is in addition to the operation of the death penalty as a deterrent against drug trafficking.
A joint Cabinet paper submitted by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as Defence Minister and Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara has pointed out that while the Police and Police Narcotics Bureau did a commendable job in apprehending drug related crime, the worsening drug situation in the country required the assistance of the Tri-Forces. The Minister in the paper pointed out that the Navy was already engaged in apprehending drug traffickers on the high seas, in accordance with their Customs Ordinance and the Emigration and Immigration Act, the planned move to deploy the Tri-Forces in the anti-drugs operations will only be an extension of this.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka though has begged to differ. He told journalists that it was improper to engage the security forces to prosecute the drug war and it was strictly the job of the police.
The Field Marshal may perhaps be of the opinion that it was infra dig for the security forces to go after drug racketeers after fighting a fierce enemy on the battlefield for three decades. The soldier in him may baulk at such an eventuality. He would also be of the opinion that it will be a stain on the military uniform to engage the military in drug busting operations. True, the military is no more a ceremonial army as it used to be, but a hardened combat outfit. But to the likes of Sarath Fonseka, who was the Army Commander, demeaning the troops by deploying them to fight drug traffickers was out of the question. Besides, drug racketeers were not opponents on the battlefield but run of the mill crooks who do not deserve to be pursued by gallant military men.
But the drug menace has grown out of proportion, which has even prompted the President to reintroduce the hangman after four decades. Hardly a day passes without a killing linked to the drug mafia in this country. Three local government politicians were gunned down within the space of three months- all three, drug related killings. The situation has developed to such a degree, the task has become too big for the police alone to handle.
True, there were operations carried out in earnest by the police recently to flush out the underworld and massive drug hauls seized. They (police) also netted in scores of dangerous underworld characters and even fought gun battles with some. But, as has been observed, the police tend to relax after such successes, when the main villains who go underground surface again.
It will be a different kettle of fish where the Tri-Forces are concerned. They (forces), with their combat training and discipline, are unlikely to let up on things and will fight the war to the finish. This factor, no doubt, would have prompted the authorities to engage the troops in the fight against drug related crime. As mentioned, the situation has reached alarming proportions that warrant desperate action. It is perhaps this desperation that drove Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to take drastic measures he has taken to combat the drug menace in his country. Here too it has come to a crisis situation and security forces are usually deployed and adept at dealing with crisis situations. We saw this during the recent flood disaster, where no other agency but the security forces could have performed the tasks at hand.
Besides, tackling the drug menace could turn out to be a complicated one. Like Minister Mangala Samaraweera said, most of the drug barons today pose as pillars of society and are clothed in respectability. According to the minister some drug kingpins in this country are not those languishing in jails but those heading charity and service organisations such as the Lions and Rotary, comments which are sure to cause a flutter among the membership of these bodies. If that is the case, they, with their money bags, could well afford to buy the silence of certain high ranking police officers. This certainly will not be the case with the Army, though there may be the odd rotten apple here as well, as Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, himself, admitted.
Nothing short of drastic measures would suffice in eradicating drug related crime in this country if we are to avert the fate of some of the Latin American countries which are awash with drugs and where drug lords rule the roost. The death penalty may or may not act as a deterrent. Even in countries where the death penalty exist for possession of drugs, the problem has been arrested only marginally. What is paramount is to go after the ringleaders and tackle the problem at the source. The police alone will not be equal to the task. The backing of the Tri-Forces will be inevitable.

Trump, Putin Helsinki summit today
FINLAND: Before coming to Europe, US President Donald Trump raised eyebrows by predicting that Mondays historic Helsinki summit with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin would be the easiest stage of his tour.
The rest of his trip, to Brussels and Britain, has indeed crackled with controversy so far.
But new indictments from an investigation into alleged Russian interference in US politics have dropped with embarrassing timing, focusing attention again on whether the Trump campaign may have benefited from Putins covert help to win the White House.
And it is far from the only charged issue to loom over the two leaders first full-blown encounter.
British accusations that Russia unleashed a deadly nerve agent in an English city, the fears of NATO allies that Trump is not serious about defending the Western alliance, and Putins support for the Syrian regime after years of civil war also form part of the crowded backdrop.
Putin headed to the Finnish capital on a diplomatic high after presiding over Sundays World Cup final in Moscow, basking in the glow of a trouble-free tournament that burnished Russias credentials.
Ahead of the leaders first one-on-one summit, the Kremlin said it considers Trump a negotiating partner.
The state of bilateral relations is very bad, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Friday. We have to start to set them right. Trump meanwhile teed up the summit with a quiet weekend of golf at one of his courses in Scotland, a calm end to his stormy visit to Britain, where he shocked his hosts by attacking Prime Minister Theresa Mays strategy for Brexit.
The visit heaped more trouble on the transatlantic alliance after Trump ripped into NATO leaders in Brussels for not spending enough on defence, and rebuked Germany for building an energy pipeline from Russia which he said would leave Europes biggest economy beholden to Moscow.
Trump was dogged by protests during his four days in Britain, and more are scheduled in Finland.
But this time Trump will share the opprobrium with Putin, with the biggest rally -- dubbed Helsinki Calling! -- on Sunday to focus on issues that demonstrators say both presidents neglect: human rights, democracy, freedom of expression, inequality and the fate of refugees.
All eyes Insight into their relationship will be on offer when Trump and Putin hold a joint news conference on Monday afternoon after their meeting in the Gothic Hall of the Finnish presidential palace.
The talks are set to begin with only their interpreters in the room, before opening up to their delegations over a working lunch.
Allies are nervously waiting to see if Trump sidles up to the canny Russian leader in the same way he has embraced other autocrats such as Chinas Xi Jinping, and even North Koreas Kim Jong Un.
Putin has proven himself to be incredibly savvy at reading personalities and characters, said Alina Polyakova, a foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, noting that Putin was trained as a KGB spy.
He will praise Trump and try to bond with him in sort of a mano-a-mano way. Trump will be responsive to that tack, she said.
On Friday, Trump said: Im not going in with high expectations, but we may come out with very surprising things. He also insisted that he had been far tougher with Russia than has been recognised by the dishonest media, and would absolutely bring up the question of election meddling.
Shortly after, news broke of the indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for hacking Democrats during the 2016 elections.
Democratic leaders quickly called for Trump to cancel the summit in light of the indictments.
After that suggestion was rebuffed by the White House, the Democrats said Trump should at least ensure his national security team is alongside him with Putin at all times, not wing it on your own.
Some in Washington -- along with US allies -- are worried about what Trump might bargain away after he used a stormy G7 summit in Canada to ponder whether it was time to readmit Russia to the club and move past sanctions imposed over Moscows seizure of the Crimea region from Ukraine.
Putin has less reason to cheer from Trumps imposition of trade tariffs on countries including Russia, and from his decision to abandon a nuclear pact with Iran.
Trump also says he intends to pressure Putin over the rapid growth and modernisation of Russias nuclear arsenal.
But for Putin, merely getting Trump to sit across the table counts as an informal recognition of Russia as a great power, political analyst Alexei Malashenko said. - AFP

VANITY OF INSANITY!
We have all had our encounters with at least one self-centred person in our lives. No matter where you go on any given day, there is a good chance you will bump into insensitive, blatantly disrespectful or demanding behaviour by someone who considers himself or herself the most important person in the world.
Just ask them! Many a time you are bound to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves, intolerant of people different from them, rude or downright conceited. These people can be a great source of potential pain to everyone around them.
Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience 'have got something over them'. Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning conceited people tend to generalise from their limited, narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others.
The first piece of advice for dealing with such people is to try to stay away from them, or to leave them at a healthy distance. That may sound easy but could prove a far dodgier prospect from a practical point of view.
What I am trying to emphasise is that it all depends largely on the relationship. If the offender happens to be your spouse, a close family member or your boss you will obviously have to deal with the problem in a far more understanding and sympathetic way.
Most of the time, these individuals display unmitigated arrogance. Basically, arrogance can indicate an excessive need for self-importance and wanting to be the centre of attention. In its extreme form, such delusional behaviour can turn into narcissism. Narcissistic personality disorder is characterised by dramatic, emotional behaviour, which is in the same category as antisocial and borderline personality disorders.
Its symptoms may include: Believing that you are better than others. Fantasizing about power, success and attractiveness. Exaggerating your achievements or talents. Expecting constant praise and admiration. Believing that you are special and acting accordingly. Failing to recognize other people's emotions and feelings. Expecting others to go along with your ideas and plans. Taking advantage of others. Expressing disdain for those you feel are inferior. Being jealous of others and believing that others are jealous of you.
It could be the root of many problems, from anxiety to depression to the inability to sustain healthy and fulfilling relationships. While normal levels of self-worth, self-confidence and self-value are all essential for people who want to live normally, there is a thin line between these characteristics and being arrogant.
A narcissist is someone who is concerned exclusively with oneself and seeking ones own pleasure or well being without any regard for others. They also have an exaggerated sense of self- importance, lack of empathy, a belief that they are special with a sense of entitlement, requiring excessive admiration, showing arrogant or haughty behaviour and taking advantage of others to achieve their own needs.
Differentiating between selfishness and narcissism is important because selfish people can change, and narcissists typically wont. When most selfish persons realise they are causing discomfort to others they can choose to do something to avoid it. But a full-blown narcissist finds it impossible to change.
If you live, or work with a narcissist, then you know what it is like when they are unhappy. The reaction can be anything from anger and acting up to pouting and giving everyone in their presence the silent treatment. They have no problem letting everyone else know how we have all disappointed them. If you think you are dealing purely with a selfish person, you may safely tell them about their frailties.
If you are clear and your requests are consistently ignored, you might well be dealing with a narcissist. The narcissist doesnt understand that you may have needs, and they often dont think your needs are important, particularly when compared with theirs. If you find that you may be dealing with a genuine narcissist, you may want to seek help in dealing with them, or managing to live with them. Certainly it can be extremely difficult.
Arrogant people take too many measures to protect their self-image. Their universe is usually the frog-in the-well type small and petty. Their friendship is mostly about quantity not quality. They can be charming, but have an agenda. Their agenda is to find an ego feeder.
They may have found ways to attract a lot of people into their small-minded world, but usually only the ones who feed into their arrogance. They feel incomplete. That is why they use other people to fill up the inner gap.
They are intolerant of differences. They devalue others and put them at a lesser position. They lack the ability to feel confidence internally, and instead find a sensation of superiority by seeing others as inferior. In addition, they can't see different viewpoints. They usually have points of views that are fanatically inflexible and opinionated
Although certain features of narcissistic personality disorder may seem like having confidence or strong self-esteem, it is not really the same. Narcissistic personality disorder crosses the border of healthy confidence and self-esteem into thinking so highly of yourself that you put yourself on a pedestal. In contrast, people who have healthy confidence and self-esteem do not value themselves more than they value others.
When you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may come across as conceited, boastful or pretentious. You often monopolise conversations. You may put down or look down on people you perceive as inferior. You may have a sense of entitlement. And when you do not receive the special treatment to which you feel entitled, you may become very impatient or angry. You may insist on having the best of everything, for instance the best car, clothes, medical care or social circles.
But scratch the facade underneath all this behaviour often lies a fragile self-esteem. You have trouble handling anything that may be perceived as criticism. You may have a sense of secret shame and humiliation. And in order to make yourself feel better, you may react with rage or contempt and efforts to belittle the other person to make yourself appear better.
We never know but we ourselves might be suffering from the same disorder while naturally not being able to admit it. When you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may not want to think that anything could be wrong. That is because doing so would not by any means fit with your self-image of power and perfection.
But by definition, a narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of your life, such as relationships, work, school or your financial affairs. You may be generally unhappy and confused by a mix of seemingly contradictory emotions. Others may not enjoy being around you, and you may find your relationships unfulfilling.
If you notice any of these problems in your life, consider reaching out to a trusted doctor or mental health provider. Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable.

Walking 10,000 steps a day is not enough to stay healthy
Just walking 10,000 steps a day is not enough to make you strong and improve your balance, the Daily Mail reported.
Health officials urge adults to take up strength-bearing exercises. They especially recommend it during women who are pregnant or going through menopause, as well as senior citizens.
Tai chi, cricket, weights training or ballroom dancing are some of the recommended activities by Public Health England (PHE).
To stay healthy, you should be doing some form of moderate activity150 minutes a week and do strength training twice, the report revealed.
"Alongside aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, all adults should be aiming to do strengthening and balancing activities twice per week," Dr Alison Tedstone, head of diet, obesity and physical activity at PHE, told the Daily Mail.
Adding, "On average we're all living longer and this mixture of physical activities will help us stay well in our youth and remain independent as we age."

Why I Added, Then Deleted, Trump from My Novel
I wrote the first draft of what became my novel Early Work from the summer of 2015 through the early fall of 2016. I was revising it when Trump was elected. There were already a few references to politics in that draftthe book is set mostly during that summer and fall of 2015, so Bernie and Hillary in particular were on the characters mindsbut my immediate, urgent inclination was to insert as many references as possible to the coming storm. Overnight, the book had become a historical novel, and in the immediate days and weeks after the election, it seemed foolish to write or publish anything that wasnt concerned with the immediate crisis. The novel was my best chance to say something on a large scaledidnt I have an obligation to use it as a vehicle, to whatever degree possible, to reflect on the rise of authoritarianism in America
So, in between the marches and the calls and the impromptu healthcare policy discussion groups of the winter of 2016 and early 2017, I filled the novel with lots of terribly subtle hints as to what was to comethe Republican debates on television in the background of every third scene, red state neighbors slowly shifting their allegiances from Rubio to Cruz to Nightmare Man, a stoner making a very stoned case for Gary Johnson, pre-What is Aleppo
Unforgivable response
These additions, my agent noted, were not very good. They were not helping the cause. They were the equivalent of characters happening to notice the sun glinting off the Twin Towers on the skyline in novels published in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks. I took them out, restoring one only after my editor asked, in the wake of the presidents unforgivable response to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, my former hometown, whether I might want just some hint at the junta thats taken control of our lives. I did.
The point here is not that politics dont belong in fiction. Dickens, Tolstoy, Kate Chopin, Isaac Babel, Joseph Roth, Grace Paley, Deborah Eisenberg: they pulled it off, and probably a couple of other people have, too.
Besides being geniuses, what makes their engagement with politics effective is its inextricability from their novels and stories. Eisenbergs Someone to Talk To is about a concert pianist invited to perform at a festival in a Central American dictatorship. The story is funny and grim and entirely concerned with the characters at hand; its about complicity because the plot enacts it.
Paley is more explicitly didactic at times, but the political opinions statedeven when we know or strongly suspect they are the authorsare rooted in those of the characters. (I mean, even if they werent, there arent any rules in fictionas in soccer, the rules are whatever you can get away with.)
I imagine that great fiction will come out of this political moment, though these things dont tend to arrive on a schedule, as much as we would like them to. In the case of my book, I came to the conclusion that it was best to let it stand as the inevitably myopic portrait of prelapsarian life that it is. These characters could have been thinking a lot harder about the political future in the summer of 2015, but they werent. They were getting drunk and talking about books and embarking on misguided affairs. I suspect that they may have been doing the same in the summer of 2017, but they would probably have spent some of their discretionary time protesting and getting into arguments about Antifa. I hope we live long enough to wring bleak, funny fiction from these days of anguisha missed connection at an airport rally The startling moment when a character thinks they might have glimpsed an ex-boyfriend in TV footage of a Trump rally Too cute, too soon. Lets drive them into exile first.
Explicitly political
I imagine that great fiction will come out of this political moment, though these things dont tend to arrive on a schedule, as much as we would like them to.
Standing beside the explicitly political is a tradition in which I feel more at home, and one that has consistently provided some kind of sustenance, however paltry, in moments of depression (i.e., most moments lately.) Im thinking of the literary tradition of rejection, of an ethos that thrives on the caustic comedy of being alive, reluctantly, in the 21st century. Im thinking of harsh, punkish novels like Molloy by Samuel Beckett, Cassandra at the Wedding by Dorothy Baker, Pushkin Hills by Sergei Dovlatov, and The Sellout by Paul Beatty, of story collections like The Babysitter at Rest by Jen George and Sam the Cat by Matthew Klam. These books are often gregarious and ugly, infused with an energy that comes from a repudiation of the standard terms of engagement. Their characters are flailing, breaking things down, fucking with people and with language in an attempt to reach something better, or at least different. Their virtuosic disaffection is a reminder of how fully one can refuse the options one has been given. There is joy in Beattys riffs and rants, music in Georges flights of nihilism. - Lit Hub

Why the novel matters
I dont mind you thinking me a scaremonger. Scaremongering has a respectable history. The fact that were still here after so many prophecies of doom doesnt, to my mind, prove the prophets were mistaken  only that the worst hasnt happened yet. That state of savage torpor, for example, into which Wordsworth saw the discriminating powers of our mind descending  did he get that so wrong Wrong about the torpid, maybe. We are too hectic to be torpid. We troll, wear trainers and fulminate. But is savage so wide of the mark Wordsworth was describing what made his age unpropitious to poetry. Need I state what makes our age unpropitious to the novel
The rival calls on our time and attention. The infinite distractions of the Jumpin Jack Flash screen, so deceptively alluring compared to the nun-like stillness of the page, whose black marks you can neither scroll through nor delete. The brutalism of those means of expression which the unironic internet has put at our disposal: our thumbs up/thumbs down culture in which everything is forgotten, discourse is reduced to statement, dramatic speech is inconceivable, words denote nothing but what is on our minds, writers are only as good as the side theyre on, and meaning is what we intend to mean. Intention is a good place to start.
Busy fixity
You start a painting, Picasso said, and it becomes something different altogether. Its strange how little the artists will matters. Every artist asks the question: Where the hell did that come from The distinction Picasso draws is between the intentional and the involuntary self. Art is the child of the involuntary. And it matters to remind ourselves of that in this age of busy fixity, when obduracy is thought a virtue, uncertainty is thought a vice, and creativity means doing stuff.
As it is for the artist, so it is for the reader. If we go in search of novels that contain characters with whom we can easily identify, a way of looking at the world with which we readily concur  it isnt really art were interested in. Its still ourselves. A book, wrote Proust, is a product of a different self from the one we display in our habits, in society, in our vices. So who is this different self and how do we come by him
I was ecstatic, Stendhal reported after his visit to the Basilica of Santa Croce. As I emerged from the porch I was seized with a fierce palpitation of the heart . . . . I walked in constant fear of falling to the ground. Was he ill or simply experiencing the sensation of being someone else The greatest art can do that to us. We see God. We become God. Under the illusion of reciprocity, we might even become the artist. We stagger, palpitating, from the gallery, or close the book with trembling fingers, and return  if we return at all  to being someone we only dimly recognize, like a half-sibling encountered on a foreign staircase.
Creative energy
Its not unknown for people of no remarkable genius to come away from reading, say, Anna Karenina, fancying that if only Tolstoy hadnt done it, they could. Id go so far as to say that its peculiar to the novel to empower readers in this way, stirring in them intimations of creative energy. The better a novel is, the more we feel its been found among the ruins of the language we share. Whatever is made of words belongs to us too. Do not forget, Proust warned, books are the creation of solitude and the children of silence. The children of silence can have nothing in common with the children of speech, those thoughts born of the wish to say something, to censure, to give an opinion . . . . There are, of course, noisy novels. Whats quiet about The Life of Gargantua and Pantagruel or Catch 22 Philip Roths novels are tumultuous. Cline spits bile. Steve Tesichs Karoo (read it if you havent) explodes with bitter disappointment. None of these fits the bill as Prousts child of silence.
But the noisiest novels still moderate their clamour, parting the rivers of their own cacophony, now by the dispersing influence of comedy, mocking hyperbole even as they exult in it; now through the dramatic interpenetration of sound  one character challenging or confounding another, as in an orchestra. Novels cannot by nature fail to be dialogic. No one gets the final word. Even in a spite-intoxicated monologue such as Dostoevskys Notes from Underground the narrator is bound by dramatic obligations. He cares what we think. The reader is his interaction. But isnt all that equally true of the best box set In which case might it be time to let the novel go
I am not snobbish about box sets. I even own some. But I think something of value happens when we read, say The Ambassadors  of value as an affective stimulus, I mean  that doesnt when we watch, say, The Sopranos. Dont tell me The Sopranos is more fun. That might only mean that Tony Soprano is more engaging than Lambert Strether. Hes certainly got a more engaging name. There is, though, more than one kind of fun. And to say that reading more closely resembles study is not to be a killjoy: concentration and enjoyment are not opposites. Strange that when everyones running marathons and otherwise raising sweat for the hell of it, working hard at a novel is thought to take the fun away.
Unexpected ways
To read a novel by D. H. Lawrence is to acquire  not always without resistance  a language of the feelings that is new to us: words we thought we knew well already are made to work in unexpected ways, locating places in the human heart we didnt know existed, even changing what we understand by human nature. What else, we now ask, were those words ever for To read Henry James is to inhabit an unaccustomed grammar of thought.
Some readers find Jamess style tortuous; but those snaking parentheses sharpen our wits; without them we will not keep up with the moral quandaries and vacillations of his characters. They are markers, not just of our penetration, but of our emotional largesse. We are inclined to believe its the characters in a novel that extend our sympathies.
We are all of us born in moral stupidity, George Eliot tells us, whereupon, chastened, we practise acts of reflective empathy on Mr Casaubon. But it is truer to say that it is first of all a novels language  its syntactical orchestration of our thinking and feeling faculties  that enables us to go where George Eliot wants us to go, to conceive another persons equivalence of self with what she rather wonderfully calls that distinctness which is no longer reflection but feeling. - Times Literary Supplement

Wimal, Prasanna summoned before Privileges Committee
Joint Opposition Parliamentarians Prasanna Ranaweera and Wimal Weerawansa have been summoned before the Parliament Privileges and Ethics Committee today.
The Committee has summoned the two MPs to proceed on the inquiry into their alleged misconduct in Parliament on July 3 and the two MPs have been asked to show cause as to why there should not be disciplinary action against them.
A formal complaint into the incident was made in the House by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera on July 4 and it was referred to the Parliament Privileges and Ethics Committee the next day.
The Committee which met on July 5 perused CCTV footage of the incident.
Deputy Minister Perera brought to the attention of the House that the two JO MPs with their foul language and aggressive behavior even threatened the Chair and tried to grab the Mace, ridiculing Parliament.
He stressed that this behaviour amounts to a breach of privileges of all other MPs.

A writers fridge
Do you see that half-eaten can of tuna on the top shelf That was a mistake. Most of the food in my fridge is inedible. It would be inedible even if the stink of tuna hadnt penetrated through it all, because its old. Im almost never at home in Los Angeles, where this fridge lives. I travel a lot, and when Im in California, I go to Lukes house, two hours away. Lukes fridge is a lot like Luke: exploding with deliciousness. Who could be luckier than me Luke opens his mouth and whole chocolate cakes fall out. He snaps his fingers and voilchicken cacciatore. One time he rolled over in bed and left in his wake an entire patch of strawberries. I dont know how to explain it. Hes the most wonderful man in the world. Im always well-fed when Luke is around.
Then I come home, alone, to thisrotten lettuce. I just tried pouring that Soleil carbonated water over ice, and even the ice smelled like fish.
Actually, the lettuce isnt completely rotten.
Parking spot
Its a boring story, how I ended up being someone who hates to go to the grocery store. I used to love it. But then I found an apartment in East Hollywood with such limited street parking, I very rarely drive anywhereI dont want to risk losing my parking spot. And I have spinal stenosis, among other back problems, which makes carrying heavy things, like groceries, difficult. But the Vons supermarket near my place is kind of great, when I actually get thereits huge, and the cashiers are really nice. One woman told me she takes a ninety-minute bus ride to and from work every morning. Three hours per day on a bus to work at Vons Unbelievable. Another woman said her boyfriend had dumped her on Valentines Day, and that hed been dodging her calls, and that he owes her money.
One man with long hair who reminded me of a friend who died last year talked to me a long time about tonic water. I try to look unfriendly when I leave my apartment, to avoid these interactions. Its not because I dont like people; its justwho can move on with her day after having her heart broken so easily by a stranger With no man to pull waffles out from behind her ear like quarters No, no. When Im home at night, I look in my fridge, and I end up ordering some vegan garbage from Grubhub, and its always disgustingeverything tastes like old salad dressing, just like that two-year-old bottle of Wish-Bone Italian you can see in the fridge door. You see those containers of takeout They were all disgusting. But dont pity me. If you know me at all, you know that I like it when things are a little disgusting.
What did you have for dinner Luke asks me over the phone.
Salad, I answer. I think theres something wrong with my teeth. Theyre all soft now.
Soft teeth, thats a symptom of anxietyinsecure realities.
What did you have for dinner, Luke
Roast pork loin, mashed potatoes, fresh grilled asparagus, pesto pasta, a bagel and lox, a goat-cheese omelet, a plate of tiny cucumber sandwiches, apple pie my great-great-great grandmother baked, a glass of milk, a glass of Perrier, a glass of pineapple juice, a glass of tonic water with olives, a three-tiered passion-fruit wedding cake, nuts and dried berries found buried in King Tuts tomb, a vegan hot dog  
Bumper sticker
I didnt buy that pancake syrup. Its not real maple syrup. As a native New Englander, I take maple syrup very seriously. I also didnt buy that squeeze bottle of grape jelly hiding in the door. That huge jug of Crystal Geyser was left by a dear friend, Matthew Lessner, who stayed in my apartment last year. I keep it as a memento. He sent me a bumper sticker he designed a few weeks ago: HONK IF YOU DONT EXIST. What else You must see all the vitamins and supplements in the door. I havent been taking any of them. That copper pitcher is my favorite thing in the fridge.

Brexit services plan will speed up relocation
The Lloyds of London chief says the governments plan for relations with the EU after Brexit will speed up the departure of firms from the UK.
Inga Beale told the BBC the White Paper would see the 300-year old insurance market go full speed ahead to set up its subsidiary in Brussels - and spur others on as well. Service sector groups say the plan will affect employment and is a real blow.
However, non-services groups were more positive.Services, including banks, insurance companies and investment firms, make up 80% of the UK economy and are one of its most successful exports to the EU.
The government wants UK financial services in future to adopt a beefed-up version of a system already used by certain non-EU countries, including the US, Japan and China, whereby they agree to meet certain EU rules to keep access to the bloc.
Beale, the chief executive of Lloyds, said: Professional and financial services are really not catered for at all and its very disappointing. We make up basically 80% of the economy of the UK.
Lloyds is to open a subsidiary in Brussels so we will be full steam ahead, and many other banks, insurers and other financial services firms will be moving at pace now. BBC

Grateful for removal
I am grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena for removing me from the post of media spokesman of the SLFP. I admit that I am not suitable for holding that post now. While holding that post, I criticised former President Chandrika Bandaranaike and several other seniors of the SLFP. Disciplinary measures were taken against me, said SLFP Dilan Perera was contacted by the Daily News from Kurunegala.
President Maithripla Sirisena, being the head of the SLFP should take the same disciplinary measures on the present SLFP senior members who openly insult and criticise the present senior Advisor of the SLFP Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former President and the Head of the SLFP. I was appointed to the media spokesman post by the Central Committee of the SLFP and I would propose to the Central Committee of the SLFP to second that proposal to remove me soon. I am going to send an e-mail to the President thanking him for his decision to remove me.

Ramanathan Nadarajah
A loss to the banking community
It was with profound shock and grief that the banking community, his friends and relatives received the sad news of the demise of Ramanathan Nadarajah on June 24, 2018, at the age of 74.
He was born on May 9, 1944, the only son of Mr. and Mrs. Kasipillai Ramanathan, a highly respected and religious family in Thirunelvely, North Jaffna. He had his primary and secondary education at Parameshwara College, one of the leading colleges in Jaffna founded by late Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan. He excelled in studies and graduated from the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya) with a degree in double Mathematics and Physics with a Second Class (Upper Division).
Nada, as he was fondly called by his friends, started his banking career when he was 24 by joining Bank of Ceylon as a staff officer. Since he had passed his degree with a Second Class (Upper Division) he was placed in the higher grade of Staff Assistant Grade  II. His hard work, dedication and commitment earned him respect and admiration from all and although he never craved for positions or limelight, he was able to move swiftly up the hierarchical ladder of the bank.
He obtained extensive experience in branch banking having worked as the manager of the Kurunegala and Main Street, Colombo, branches of the Bank of Ceylon for long periods. He then moved to Credit Support Department, Imports Department, Treasury Division Corporate Credit (Restructuring and Recoveries) Department and the Finance and Planning Division, making him a complete banker with the widest possible exposure.
It was when he moved into the Corporate Credit Division that he displayed his true talent. He was a master in scrutinising credit papers and added value in no uncertain manner to the banks credit evaluation process. He began his career as a trainer by conducting classes for young bankers in the Bank of Ceylon. Thereafter, he went on to become a much sought-after resource person for seminars, especially on bank lending.
Having served in almost all key functions of commercial banking, he also kept on moving up the banks hierarchy to be an Assistant General Manager and thereafter a Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Ceylon.
He was always striving to develop his knowledge and did not neglect hisprofessional education. He passed the Diploma in Banking Examination conducted by the Chartered Institute of Bankers London and was awarded its Associateship. He then went on to be elected as a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, London (FCIB) in recognition of his services to the banking industry. Whilst he was in Kurunegala, he also completed his Masters in Business Administration from the University of Colombo. It is remarkable that he succeeded in his MBA as he had fallen and broken his pair of spectacles on entering the examination hall and had to answer the first paper whilst holding the only undamaged lens to his eye with his left hand, which showed his true character,
He retired from Bank of Ceylon at 55, even though he was entitled to request extensions of service until he was 60 and the bank would have more than loved to retain his services for the maximum period. He was immediately picked up by Pan Asia Bank as its Deputy Chief Executive Officer, with right of succession, and he was appointed Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Pan Asia Bank within a short period of time. After a few years of guiding that bank to a sound position, the unselfish person he was, he wanted a younger person to take over the leadership of the bank as he believed in succession planning. He did not look for alternative appointment, but was happy to leave the bank when a successor was found.
Thereafter, his services were sought by Seylan Bank to come out of the crisis they were in at that time. He was appointed an Executive Director of Seylan Bank and was placed in charge of the Banks Operations. He proved his worth in the next few years, by helping the bank out of the crisis situation to a more stable footing before leaving the bank. He also functioned as the Chairman of its subsidiary Seylan Developments PLC, at that time.
In spite of all this he did not shy away from service to the Sri Lankan banking community. When he was the Deputy General Manager (International and Treasury) at the Bank of Ceylon he was elected the inaugural President of the Primary Dealers Association in Sri Lanka. He was also elected the President of the Banks Hindu and Tamil Literary Association.
He was elected to the Council of Association of Professional Bankers  Sri Lanka (APB) which he served as a member of the Council and as an Office Bearer, until he was elected its President in 2001. After a few years, he came back to serve the APB as a member of the Fund Management Committee and was its Chairman for some time, looking after the APB Development Fund. He was awarded the Honorary Life Membership of the APB in recognition of his contribution. He was thereafter appointed a member of the Council of Advisors of APB.
He was a member of the Forum of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka, the apex body of professional associations in Sri Lanka. He also served in the Panel of Industrial Experts, for the Annual Report Awards Competition conducted by the Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, for several years.
At the time of his demise, he was serving as a Member of the Council of Advisors and a Member of the Fund Management Committee of the Association of Professional Bankers  Sri Lanka and a Member of the General Forum of the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka
He was a man of undoubted integrity and a fountain of knowledge. He had a very wide circle of friends, not only in the banking industry but also in very many specialised fields, some of them being his batch mates at the university who are or were occupying high positions at various governmental and private sector institutions. They were Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and others. For him race or religion of a person did not matter.
Nada was a gentleman of the highest order and a fabulous human being, He practised yoga and meditation and encouraged others also to do so as he has benefited immensely by practising them. He was soft spoken, always had a smile, and what he said came straight from the heart. He was an epitome of simplicity, humility and modesty.
He was always keen to help anyone who needed assistance. His friends, relations, colleagues, superiors, subordinates and all loved and respected him. He had no enemies, had no grudges against anyone nor did anyone have a grudge against him. He was a teetotaler and strict vegetarian, but he did not want to miss any functions that he was invited to. However, he used to get himself excused from staying on for the dinners saying that his loving wife would be waiting for him.
He was a practising and devoted Hindu who never missed any Hindu religious ceremony. Nada was very fortunate to have Umayal, as his wife. She was always there to support him and never grumbled about his late hours in the bank. They were a happy couple, always together except when he was away on his official duties.
According to Hinduism, Lord Shiva and Parvathi were inseparable and Nadarajah (another name for Lord Shiva) and Umayal (another name for Parvathi) were no different, so much so that even when he met with the fatal accident, they were together, but by grace of God she escaped miraculously without any major injuries.
Our association with Nada goes back many years with the privilege and pleasure of having been a close friend and colleague for a number of years at the Bank of Ceylon and later working together at the Association of Professional Bankers  Sri Lanka. His demise is not only a loss to his family, friends and fellow bankers, but also to Sri Lankas banking industry.
He leaves behind Umayal his devoted wife, two daughters Marthangini and Ajahini and three loving grandchildren, who along with his relatives and all his friends will miss him forever.
May his soul attain Moksha.

He was a founder member of the Sri Lanka  Thailand Society and served in the executive committee. He also served in the executive committee of the Colombo Plan International Society. AA served a Trustee of the Sasakawa Memorial Sri Lanka  Japan Cultural Centre Trust.

AA was a beloved father, devoted husband and a good friend. He lived a full life as a gentleman par excellence.
May his sojourn through Samsara be short. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Leslie Gunawardene
He gave his today for our tomorrow
Leslie Gunawardene is no more. He died after a brief illness at the age of 70. He hails from St. Marys Road, Ratmalana and began his schooling at St. Ritas Roman Catholic School, Ratmalana, from where he shifted to St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa. In 1967, at age 19, he was enlisted in the then Royal Ceylon Air Force (presently Sri Lanka Air Force).
After combat and military training at the Air Force Training Centre, Diyatalawa, he was drafted to the Air Force Regiment, Katunayake Base, for his trade training. During the JVP insurrection in the 1970s, he served in many parts of the island and later served for a long period in Ridiyagama.
He followed the advanced course in gunnery too. After the completion of 12 years, he did not seek re-engagement and joined the Security Division of Port Cargo Corporation, presently Sri Lanka Ports Authority, and retired in 2008.
During his educational stage, he was a civilian; he then served in the Air Force as a serviceman; and later he was in the Air Force as civilian, until his demise. Not only Leslie, all the service personal come under this category. He was about five years junior to me in service, but our hometwons were in close proximity to each other.
So I knew him earlier and at the Air Force, our friendship began to grow. Though two of us served in separate sections, we used to meet at the number two mess when dinning, and in the evenings, at the cinema. In addition, he was a Member of the Executive Committee of St. Sebastians College Old Boys Association and as Cambrians, we used to work in hand in hand at the Big Matches. On the invitation of the former Sebastianite and Past President of Ex-Servicemens Association Captain Patrick Jayasinghe, I joined the Media Unit of the Ex-Servicemen Association under the guidance of Brigadier J.P.A. Jayawardene. Leslie too was a member of this Media Unit. At first, I was reluctant to join the Media Unit due to pressure of work, but my college and Air Force friend K.L.S. Fernando encouraged me.
Our team presently works under President of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemen Association, Brigadier K.A. Gnanaweera and we forward news to the Daily News and Dinamina every Monday, which is published every Friday. This column is very popular, not only among ex-servicemen, but also among the present officers of the three Armed Services.
Leslie never showed any signs of sickness. He suddenly fell ill while at home. He was rushed to Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital, where he breathed his last. With his sudden demise, we lost a sincere friend and a gentleman par excellence. He was an All Island Justice of the Peace too.
He was a true Sebastianite and during his youth, he served as an altar server at St. Ritas Church, Ratmalana. He was a devout Catholic.
Leslies funeral took place with service honours from the Air Force, amidst a large and a distinguished gathering at St. Ritas Church cemetery, Ratmalana. He leaves his wife Philomina (Dorris), son Asela (who is domiciled in England) and two daughters Dilinika and Darshika.
He gave his today for our tomorrow. There is a saying, Old soldiers never die, they just fade away. May the turf lie lightly on my Air Force colleague and the media partner. May his soul rest in peace.

Balasubramaniam Surendra
He epitomised kindness
July 16, 2018, marked the third month of the passing of Balasubramaniam Surendra  Suren, as he was known to many of us. It was with profound shock and sadness that his family, countless friends and associates learnt of the news of his passing.
Suren was born with the proverbial silver spoon and was nurtured in a privileged background. Yet, he never lost the common touch or the ability to empathise, feel and respond to anothers need. He had his education at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia and following his professional studies, joined the family business, which he was heading at the time of his untimely demise.
Suren was indeed a lively, sensitive, kind and gentle human being and always saw the good in every person. Throughout his life, he epitomised the values of kindness and uprightness. He was an honest and ethical human being who was respected by all he associated with. He valued human beings over monetary gain and had a strong sense of commitment and duty towards the staff of the company he headed. I remember a staff member saying, He would always greet us and inquire about our well-being and that of our families, each day as he came into work.
He believed in the dignity of all human beings, especially the downtrodden. Following his death, many were the tales of his selfless generosity, charity and kindness, all done quietly. A simple incident that comes to mind that demonstrates Surens empathy was that whilst we were trying to park outside his home during the funeral, even the parking attendant appeared overcome with grief and commented that he would always greet him, say a few words, inquire about his well-being and see to his needs.
Suren had a tremendous zest for life and was happiest when surrounded by his family and friends. His subtle sense of humour brought laughter and the memories of those wonderful times will be cherished. He would always choose to talk of the funny side of life rather than dwell on the gloomy and dreary. He was a dutiful, caring and beloved spouse to his wife Uma, a devoted and loving father to his children Aparna and Santheep, a wonderful brother to his sisters Shyama and Vanaja and an affectionate and doting uncle to his nieces and nephews.
Being a diehard Thomian, he greatly valued the kinship and camaraderie he shared with his STC batchmates. He was a generous host and, together with his wife Uma, hosted many get-togethers which will be remembered by all.
The widow of a batch mate who passed away recently told me that Suren had been a tower of strength to her and was always there for her family in their darkest hours, offering her help and support in her time of bereavement. The countless number of relatives and friends who flew in from different parts of the world for his funeral, all in the brief time of three days, bore ample testimony to the respect and love with which he was held.
Today, we live in a society that encourages and advocates hedonism, glorifying self-interest and narcissism amidst an ethic that admires and values unbridled ambition, amassing material possessions and the abandonment of human decency with no respect for human dignity. Rarely are we privileged to encounter an individual such as Suren, whose values, ambitions, character, priorities and motivations, run counter to the worldview of our time and age.
Reflecting on the life of Suren, we realise that the world is indeed poorer for his loss. It is hard to believe that this larger-than-life personality is no more, yet, the lives of the people he touched will inspire us to serve our fellow human beings with love, compassion and kindness and remember that every human being has his own worth and dignity.
Farewell, dear friend. May you find eternal rest and peace.

Removal of camps in North
Army Chief rejects media reports
The Army rejected recent news reports on the alleged removal of military camps in the North. Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake said yesterday these reports were incorrect and misleading.
The Sri Lanka Army under any circumstances will not resort to any decisions that would pose a threat to national security, and it always prioritizes national security concerns.
It is therefore emphasised that the Sri Lanka Army as a responsible one will not close down any Army camp as alleged in those misleading reports, Senanayake said in a statement.
The Army Commander noted that some media reports have published untruths and have distorted facts about the ongoing rightsizing process of the Army.
The rightsizing process has always been happening in the Army and had even taken place during the war and also in the post-war period before this one. Through that, the troops mainly deployed for administrative duties are relieved and mobilized for field duties to gain better productivity, thereby doubling their efficiency.
This process does not allow any Army camp to be closed, but it instead enables the majority of troops in those camps be deployed for emergency disaster needs and nation-building tasks in an effective manner. Nevertheless, some false media reports try to claim that this process has led to a large let-up in the security arrangements in the North and East. It certainly is not a disbanding of battalions, but is only a restructuring with the intention of distributing human and material resources equally among other battalions, the Army Commander explained.
The Army Commander charged that some of those media organisations, operating as cats paws of disgruntled politicians are malicious towards various development projects, being undertaken by the majority of Army personnel island-wide under the guidance of the President.
The peace-loving public in the country are therefore urged with respect, not to be misled by those unfounded and false media reports, but continue to repose the full confidence in the Army, considering its past services as well as the roles and tasks, now being performed across the country, he added.
In the statement, the Army Commander further said, the Sri Lanka Army is prepared round the clock to respond to all security requirements in the country. During the war, the Army adopting its own structural reforms and succeeded in winning the war at that time.
In similar vein, the Army while performing a gigantic role in development has thrown its full weight behind the governments ongoing nation-building projects as the prime mover. However, some opportunistic politicians and mass media organisations, envious of the Armys commitment to the countrys future are in the practice of spreading malicious and false propaganda to inculcate the public with untruth and distortion regarding the ongoing rightsizing process of the Army, he added.

Behold, Avozilla!
Sometimes, one regular avocado just isnt enough. And its in those times that you probably need to get your hand onthe Avozilla.
Its a massive avocado thats now being sold in Australia. It weighs on average 1.2kg, with each fruit being four times the size of a regular avo and offering up to 20 servings.
The biggest one Ive weighed is 1.73 kilos, says Cameron Perna, Tropical and Exotic Fruit Manager at Mercer Mooney.
Originally from South Africa, these beasts actually came to the UK back in 2013, but theyve now gone down under and  we suspect  may send us wild for them all over again.
According to the farmer who has brought the variety down under, Ian Groves, these whoppers taste just like regular avocados but are slightly softer to spread (useless if youve got a load of avo toasts to put together!).
He tells the Guardian that this is the first harvest hes had, and that hes distributing the fruits to grocers in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. There is a nursery we buy different trees off and when we were planting a bunch of avocados 10 years ago they gave us one as a trial, he says.
And after about four or five years, we tried a few of the fruit and thought wed give them a go. So we planted a small block of about just under 400 trees. Theyre coming up to about four years and this is their first production. Its quite an exclusive club of farmers who can even grow these giant avos. The South African company who first developed them still owns the rights so you have to get its permission and pay royalties before you even get planting. And anyone thinking of undercutting Ian is going to have to wait a long time because, as he says, it takes four years between sewing and harvesting. But just imagine how wild hipster cafes will go if they do manage to get their hands on an avocado the size of an ostrich egg.. Avozillas are being sold for $14.99 (11.30) and while that might seem quite a lot, this is a lot of avocado. Metro

## Title: Blood pressure linked to Alzheimer's

Blood pressure linked to Alzheimer's
Having high blood pressure in later life could put you at greater risk of developing Alzheimers, a study found. Older people with high blood pressure were almost half - 46 per cent - more likely to have brain lesions - areas of damage linked to the disease.
They also had higher levels of tau tangles, a type of protein which harm the brains of people with Alzheimers disease. The findings add to growing evidence that adopting healthier lifestyles could be key to staving off dementia.
High blood pressure - known by the medical term hypertension - affects one in three British adults and is one of the leading causes of heart attacks and stroke. America's rate was deemed the same - with 75 million people (a third of the population) diagnosed with high blood pressure.
There are often no symptoms until it is too late, with only around half of people even aware that they are at risk. An ideal blood pressure is a reading of anywhere between 90/60 and 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).
Patients are normally diagnosed with high blood pressure and prescribed treatment only if the top reading - the systolic pressure - is above 140 mmHg. Scientists from Rush Alzheimers Disease Center in Chicago wanted to examine the impact blood pressure changes in old age can have on the brain.
They studied almost 1,300 elderly people from the US, who had their blood pressure taken every year until they died, an average eight years later. Two-thirds of those taking part already had high blood pressure, which is common in the elderly, with most (87 per cent) participants on medication for it.
Researchers found those with above average systolic pressure -pressure when the heart beats- had a significantly higher risk of lesions, called infarcts. These are areas of tissue death, caused by a lack of blood supply to the area, which can often be caused by blockages to the artery.
Those with very high blood pressure - defined as 147mmHG - had a 46 percent higher chance of large lesions and were more than a third (36 per cent) more likely to have small lesions. Higher than average diastolic pressure, when the heart rests between beats, had a 28 per cent higher risk of lesions, they found.
When the brain was examined post-mortem, researchers found a link between high blood pressure and brain tangles but not plaques, the other protein linked to the disease. Taking blood pressure medications did not make any difference, according to the findings, published in the American Academy of Neurology.Lead author Dr Zoe Arvanitakis said: Blood pressure changes with aging and disease, so we wanted to see what kind of impact it may have on the brain.
We researched whether blood pressure in later life was associated with signs of brain aging that include plaques and tangles linked to Alzheimers disease, and brain lesions called infarcts, areas of dead tissue caused by a blockage of the blood supply, which can increase with age, often go undetected and can lead to stroke.
Dr Doug Brown, Chief Policy and Research Officer at Alzheimers Society, said high blood pressure in middle-aged is known to increase dementia risk in later life.
While this study linked raised blood pressure later in life to early changes in the brain associated with Alzheimers disease - a build-up of tangles - it was an observational study and we dont know if the people studied had a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease so we cannot draw firm conclusions.
With the number of people diagnosed with Alzheimers ever growing, we need to look at all ways we can reduce the chance of getting dementia. The next step could be to explore the effects of controlling blood pressure at a healthy level during mid and late life to see whether this can reduce the risk of developing Alzheimers.

Law not to be discredited
They say you cannot have the cake and also eat it. Similarly, if we want to maintain the law we must implement it. If we don't implement a law which is in the Statute books wont we bring the law into disrepute People may interpret that the law is not a good law and that is why the authorities are not implementing it.
The rational societies have not blindly followed those in religions who want criminals to be shown mercy. Mercy should be shown only to the repentant who regret the crime committed. A non-discriminating sweeping exercise of mercy and forgiving criminals will make the criminals who have not regretted their crimes to assume that their crimes were not so blameworthy. Every criminal wants to justify his criminal action.
Such exercise of mercy and waiver of punishment for the crime is undermining the validity of the law against the crime. After all, there is plenty of differences in the nature of crimes and their seriousness as well as on the principle of punishment to fit the crime. Should a murderer be punished by a weeks sentence in jail Or should punishment fit the crime
These are issues not debated or discussed in our society. These are issues not for the religious clergy but for practical statesmen involved in governing a country. Their first duty is to maintain law and order and curb serious crimes like murder, kidnapping and child abuse in the society. It is true that capital punishment has not proved a deterrent to serious crime. But it cannot be argued there from that the abolition of capital punishment will not undermine whatever the deterrent effect it has. The foolproof experiments cannot be designed in social matters since it is difficult, if not impossible, to test for a particular cause with a particular effect as required for a sound experiment.

## Title: CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICE AND PRESCRIPTIONS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, July 16, 2018 - 01:00
CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICE AND PRESCRIPTIONS
Culture is what defines us. We are embodiments of our culture. Our way of life is defined by cultural prescriptions, values, norms and customs that have been internalised during our years of growing, learning, working and living. Culture is a framework of knowledge, wisdom, ritual and accumulated prescriptions for this worldly (and otherworldly) issues that humankind face universally and in specific localities. Irrespective of the changes that we face due to external influences, generally fundamentals of culture remain intact. For example, among the Australian Aborigines (the indigenous people) after 200 plus years of invasion, colonisation and displacement, the main elements of their culture remain to this day.
They express these through art, storytelling, dance, poems, rituals etc. Cultural fundamentals are held intact primarily by the elders and passed down to the younger generations against many odds. Indigenous peoples around the world struggle with endurance to preserve their cultural heritage. Contacts with other cultures, especially those that are dominant due to the power of modern dissemination methods, can alter aspects of ones own culture in substantial ways. In this context, cultural conversions or inversions also take place leading some people to change their whole identity over time-manifestly or latently.
Cultural knowledge and associated practices continue in some form and shape against many odds in the face of colonisation, modernisation and now globalisation in countries like ours. They correspond to indigenous modes of treatment for varied illnesses, farming and agriculture, fishing, architecture, governance, education and learning, trade, travel, interaction with and preservation of the environment, universe, religion, literature, art, dance, music, and the broader region surrounding us.
In some fields, the cultural knowledge and cultural practice have passed down from the older generation to the younger generation of trust; hence it was a family affair. However, due to the exigencies of life - continuity of such family and kin-based transfer of cultural knowledge and practice was disrupted leaving a significant gap and a loss to the society. Our libraries and archives house some of the written cultural knowledge pertaining to various fields. For example, Peradeniya University library houses an Ola leaf collection. However, it is the slow rate of their use and absorption by the emerging generations for everyday living that is under a cloud.
External influences
How far can the cultural knowledge and practice continue in the face of external influences being felt in society in the name of neo-colonialism, neoliberalism, modernisation and globalisation today Is it worth preserving and using cultural knowledge and associated practices (and public rituals) when we are supposed to be governed by reason, science, logic and technology (remember the idea of the scientific Cabinet) Do our formal education systems(in schools and universities contribute to the preservation, use and transfer of cultural knowledge and practice or do they, in fact, contribute to the demise of such knowledge and practice
Are traditional educational methods sufficient to maintain these in current contexts Do our government policies promote or hinder cultural knowledge transmission and adoption for everyday use Is it necessary to look at science and technology as competing paradigms of thought and action compared to our traditional cultural knowledge and practice or as complementary sources of wisdom It is not possible to answer all these questions in a short article. For the time being, it is sufficient to raise these questions for further discussion and reflection. Increasingly, with the expansion of neoliberal, free market economic policies and projects, both in the developed and developing countries people are realising the adverse effects of such policies and projects on their lives and the impact they can have on children and grandchildren. Furthermore, they are beginning to realise the devastating effects these policies and projects have on our continuing cultural knowledge, practice and scripts.
While a few have become billionaires and another few have materially progressed, a large mass of people is falling behind in trying to find an income to meet their daily needs. Against heavy advertising and marketing of what we need (and what we dont need) by conglomerates of multinational business houses to our living rooms, and while our incomes are being eaten away by these consumer goods and services, the stability we experienced in life and community living in our own way is being taken away step by step making us highly vulnerable-materially and otherwise.
The corporate world has opened up spaces for emerging young professionals together with its facilitator- the State- but this world is about competition, consumption and production of surplus for the owners of multinational corporations more than anything else. Pressures to replace our cultural knowledge, prescriptions and practices with those imported from elsewhere are increasing in the name of fancy labels, promoters, and incentives. Career oriented professionals are playing key roles in such promotions in their own fields in collaboration with their foreign counterparts until later in life when they realise the careers they led did not provide the satisfaction of life on an enduring basis. Westerners and Easterners engulfed by the magic world of globalisation, mobility and competition are living this conundrum as to whether their traditional cultural prescriptions are the right path or the consumerist culture bestowed on us can lead us to a promised land in terms of ultimate happiness, serenity and fulfilment.
Intercultural contact
Intercultural contact is an important element in contemporary life. I am not suggesting that we become cultural exclusives or adopt a nativist attitude in our dealings with other cultures. We need to be open to other knowledge and knowledge practices, learn their prescriptions and even apply where they are suitable. But we need to realise that all knowledge is cultural and specific to the historical, geographical, economic and social context-not necessarily universally applicable without modification.
Modern science claims to be universal but recent critics have pointed out that it is not so at least in terms certain aspects. If we take the example of Buddhism, we can see how it is adapted to suit different country and cultural contexts in various parts of the world over millennia. One danger in such adaptation is that many tend to translate foreign knowledge to ones own language and audiences without critical analysis and interpretation. This happens in the teaching of social science disciplines in universities also.
It is important to adopt a critical and comparative approach to our cultural knowledge, practices and prescriptions because the uncritical use of these can lead to myth building, blind faith and imitation. However, even to do so, such knowledge, practice and scripts have to exist in the first place - not only in the minds of academics and researchers but also in the society as a living phenomenon.
Language is the vehicle of transmitting cultural knowledge and associated practices plus prescriptions. In formerly colonised countries, there is a tendency to understand ones own culture through the language of the coloniser rather than ones own language because of the importance placed on the former as international languages. There are positives and negatives of such a trend. The way culture is constructed in an alien and dominant language can lead to certain biases and distortions compared to the way the same is constructed and described in indigenous language/s. The ability of those who do not speak or write in the indigenous languages to comprehend the core meanings of a given culture and its embodiments can be limited. On the other hand, over time indigenous constructions of cultures can have various biases and distortions.
Learning institutions
Debates about the complexities of translating knowledge available in one language to another is familiar to many of us especially if we look at the manner knowledge of Buddhism was translated from Pali to Sinhala. However, we dont seem to adopt a critical attitude when translating Western disciplinary knowledge into our languages in our learning institutions. Instead, very often translations alone are accepted as true and higher knowledge and streamed into the educational processes.
My worry is that in the face of a higher value placed on anything and everything foreign in formerly colonised, now neo-colonial and neoliberal countries such as Sri Lanka, we seem to be moving fast to denigrate and delete our cultural knowledge, practice, and prescriptions with both hands and embrace the consumerist culture, practices and prescriptions plus western disciplines without question. I wonder if this trend is being sufficiently researched by our social scientists. Are there any educational and policy-making bodies taking enough interest in such matters
The opening of two growth corridors along the Colombo-Galle highway and Colombo- Kandy highway may have detrimental effects on the sources of our cultural knowledge, practice and scripts.
The dismemberment of our cultural heritage and knowledge etc. and replacement of these with imported cultural knowledge, practice and scripts can make us nobodies not only in our own land but also in the wider world. It can make our identity bereft of any epistemological, philosophical or aesthetic foundations to rely on. Such a situation can lead to the emergence of fake truths and practices as well as those who promote the same young and old- for a penny.

## Title: The dignity of labour

The dignity of labour
The piece today focuses on those engaged in agriculture, fisheries, plantation workforce, domestic workers and migrant workers. They represent essential lines of the food supply, labour and income. Have we ever thought of recognizing the skills they possess by providing certification, giving dignity to their labour and vocations, providing pathways to graduate to higher incomes and positions
Market segments in Sri Lanka
The Census and Statistics Department, reports 28.5 per cent of the labour force as working in the agriculture sector - farming. The labour force survey counts as agriculture includes farming what is planted on the ground in terms of paddy, vegetables, fruits, spices, tea, rubber, coconut, etc. It further includes forestry, fishing and livestock farming.
* Sri Lanka's total foreign employed workforce stood at 1,189,359 in December 2016.
* Over 4 million direct and indirect employment is found as fishermen, breeders, processors, logistics, cold chain, packing and other service suppliers.
* Domestic, Live-in maids, Caretakers and private drivers are considered domestic workers. The statistic is not complete but clearly, it represents a significant labour component.
Prior Learning and Competency certification
We have a significant population in the formal and informal sectors whose competencies acquired on-the-job and home-grown skills can be mapped and certified to reap the benefits of a better skilled and more productive workforce.
NVQ 2 is on offer as a right to returnee migrant workers. This should be formalised across all other sectors with competency certification aligning competencies of the informal workforce to the mainstream. Recognition of Prior Learning is one of the key components, whereby informal skills acquired through family trades or gained from life experiences, are assessed and certified based on the standards starting from NVQ 2 set by the National Vocational qualification framework.
****
* Training courses
Training standards- the minimum age of entry into fishermen's training schemes; medical examinations, including chest X-rays and hearing and sight tests, required for persons entering training schemes; the examinations, particularly the hearing and sight tests, may differ for persons entering deck and persons entering engine courses; the level of general education which is required for admission to fishermen's training schemes; fishing, navigation and seamanship, safety, engineering, catering and other subject-matter which should be included in the training curricula; the amount of practical training, including time spent in engineering shops and at sea, which trainees should undergo; the duration of the training courses for the various fishing occupations and the different levels of competency; the nature of any examinations following the completion of the training courses.
They should be periodically reviewed and kept up to date with technical developments and should, as appropriate for the functions to be exercised, include training in-- (a) fishing techniques, including where appropriate the operation and care of electronic fish-finding devices, and operation, maintenance and repair of fishing gear;(b) navigation, seamanship and ship handling appropriate to the sea area and to the type of fishing for which the course is designed, including a proper knowledge of the international Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea;(c) stowage, cleaning and processing of fish on board;(d) vessel maintenance and other related matters;(e) operation, maintenance and repair of steam or internal combustion (gasoline or diesel) engines or other equipment which the trainee may be called upon to use;(f) operation and care of radio and radar installations which the trainee may be called upon to use;(g) safety at sea and safety in handling fishing gear, including such matters as stability, effects of icing, fire fighting, water-tight integrity, personal safety, gear and machinery safeguards, rigging safety measures, engine-room safety, lifeboat handling, use of inflatable life rafts, first aid and medical care and other related matters;(h) theoretical subjects relevant to fishing, including marine biology and oceanography, which will enable trainees to gain a broad foundation for further instruction and training leading to promotion or to transfer to another fishing occupation or another type of fishing;(i) operation, maintenance and repair of refrigeration systems, fire-fighting equipment, deck and trawling winches and other mechanical equipment of fishing vessels;(j) principles of shipboard electrical power installations, and maintenance and repair of the electrical machinery and equipment of fishing vessels;(k) health and physical education, especially swimming, where training facilities permit;(l) specialised courses in deck, engine and other subjects after an introductory period of general fishing instruction.
****
* Agricultural practices
Plant production- Learners may come from both genders. Provides learners with the opportunity to gain a qualification in plant production. It forms the basis for learners to extend their learning into more specialised areas of plant production and provides the basis of the establishment of sustainable farming operations through the inclusion of a wide spectrum of competencies required by farmers.
Whilst technical production orientated competencies are ensured, other aspects such as agri-business and good agricultural practices are included in the range of competencies required by farmers in order to enable them to strive towards agricultural management standards and practices at higher levels.
Competent qualifying learners in this qualification will participate in the production of quality agricultural products in plant production whereby enhancing the overall agricultural process and gain opportunities to access local, national and international agricultural markets.
****
* Labour market challenges
Migrant workers- Potential, current and returning migrant workers are often confronted with numerous challenges in the labour market including lack of recognition of their skills and competencies gained abroad or in their country of origin. A returning migrant does not translate into automatic social and labour market integration and returnees may need support for the following services: career counselling; domestic/international labour market information; support for self-employment; recognition of skills and competencies acquired through non-formal and informal learning while abroad.
****
* Better employment conditions
Domestic workers- The skills development and professional recognition play an important role in promoting decent work for domestic workers. Training and certification based on national competency-standards can help raise the status of domestic workers as a recognized profession. This, in turn, would improve domestic workers employability and prospects for better employment conditions.
Across each of the sectors mentioned, we have very many institutions that can design and deliver certification programmes in this country. A hindrance, for now, is that it falls between the cracks at times given the plethora of Ministries and agencies. Nevertheless, the thought of empowering a crucial component of the labour force to newer heights should inspire many. Ironically it has not been the focus of any political cry in the recent past. Not even from those who reportedly espouse the cause of either the downtrodden masses or peasants and workers!

Fuel price hike
Disagreement, not a protest - Minister
The view that the fuel price should not be increased was not a protest, but a disagreement, said Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga on Saturday.
He also said that when a sensitive decision like increasing fuel price is made, the authorities should not neglect the public. He added that the authorities should think from the peoples point of view. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation should not only function as a profit-making body, but also as one that provide a service to the people, the Minister said.
He made these observations to the media at a ceremony in Ganemulla on Saturday.
He also said that he did not agree to increase the fuel price last Tuesday (11) thinking from the peoples point of view. It was not a protest, Minister Ranatunga said. It was a disagreement.
He added that he was of the view that not only the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, but also the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Water Board should function as bodies that provide services to the public. He said further actually the CPC does not suffer a loss at the point-of-sale. He added that the fuel could be sold at a low price. But the issue is the tax, the Minister said. However the tax is needed for the development programmes in the country.
He added that the price of the crude oil in the world market is higher than in the days that this government came to power and they expect it would go down in future. He said that the fuel price would go down then accordingly.
I also expect that the prices of the other commodities that were increased in parallel to the fuel price hike would drop when the fuel prices drop, Minister Ranatunga said.

London, Sunday: Novak Djokovic raced to a fourth Wimbledon title and 13th career Grand Slam crown on Sunday when he defeated a battling but exhausted Kevin Anderson 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3).
World number 21 Djokovic added the 2018 title to his wins in 2011, 2014 and 2015 as he became the lowest-ranked champion since Goran Ivanisevic in 2001.
It also took his Slam total to within one of Pete Sampras and just four behind the 17 of Rafael Nadal who he defeated in the semi-finals.
Its more special as its the first time I can hear my little boy say daddy, daddy, said Djokovic whose son Stefan was up in the players box.
I would like to congratulate Kevin, he had an incredible run. He had quite a few hours on the court.
In his first Wimbledon final he didnt play his best in the first two sets, but in the final set he was a better player and I was quite lucky to get through.
This time last year, Djokovics career was in turmoil after he retired in the quarter-finals with an elbow injury which required surgery and forced him off the tour for the rest of the year. AFP

Point of view
Sri Lankan equities reversed 7-consecutive weeks of negative returns this week, helping the ASPI end on a positive note for the 1st time since late-May18.
Despite temporarily falling below the key 6100 level, the benchmark Index gained ~29 points or 0.48% over the week (cf. -86 point loss last week).
Similar to last week when the Index breached the 6100-mark to hit a 15-month low of 6044.03, the ASPI lost ~31 points on Monday to drag the index once again below this key 6100-mark. However, the ASPI rebounded notably over the latter half of the week, and the ASPIs ~61 point gain between Wednesday and Friday more than offset the losses recorded earlier in the week and helped push the Index safely above the 6100-mark for the 2nd consecutive week.
The stronger performance on the Index was mainly attributable to the return of Institutional and HNI investors and crossings accounted for 46% of weekly turnover (cf. just 36% last week) with Jetwing Symphony and HNB accounting for 53% of the bulk parcels.
Despite the Indexs stronger performance, overall activity levels on the Bourse remained dull, with turnover decreasing 31% W-o-W to Rs.2.0Bn.
Daily turnover levels subsequently hit a 12-week low on both Monday (Rs.155Mn) and Tuesday (Rs143Mn) cf. the previous low of Rs.102Mn recorded in Mid-April amid the traditional New-Year holidays.
The foreign equity sell-off on equities meanwhile, continued once again this week with net outflows from the CSE amounting to Rs.221Mn cf. Rs.900Mn last week.
Net foreign outflows from the CSE widened further to Rs.2.8Bn, reflecting the heightened risk-aversion for EM/FM assets since Feb18. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues both from domestic political & economic developments.
Industrial production in May edges higher
The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) in May rose to 105.7 (from 97.7 in Apr18) indicating greater manufacturing activity over the month.
The IIP which is a leading economic indicator, measures short term changes in the volume of industrial production in the countrys manufacturing sector and the higher index value indicates greater manufacturing sector activity over the month.
However, on a year-on-year basis the index rose just 2%, as slower manufacturing activity in electrical equipment, machinery, paper and paper products and non-metallic minerals offset strong manufacturing activity in fabricated metals, chemicals, Coke and refined petroleum and pharmaceuticals.
Meanwhile, the LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index (BCI) declined by four basis points to 102 in June, falling short of its 12-month average of 115 once again, as concerns over inflation heading higher (on the back of higher fuel prices) has impacted sentiment.
The BCI also noted that high taxes, political interference and the value of the rupee are the main corporate concerns, with survey respondents believing that the constant political interference and inconsistency in policy implementation has negatively impacted the economy.
LMD-Nielsen added that in terms of future projections of the Index, it believes that positive news to propel a major comeback of the barometer of corporate sentiment remains scant and that several sectors remain vulnerable to the depreciating LKR, the prospect of higher inflation/cost structures and world events.

Finch sets Surrey record with T20 ton
LONDON, Friday - Australias Aaron Finch made an unbeaten 131, the highest score by a Surrey batsman in a Twenty20 match, as his side ended Sussexs unbeaten start to English crickets Blast tournament with a 52-run win at Hove on Friday.
But it might have been a different story for the Australia Twenty20 captain had he not been dropped on just one by Sussex paceman Jofra Archer.
Finch then made Sussex, coached by former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, pay with a blistering 79-ball innings including 10 fours and seven sixes as visitors Surrey piled up 192 for three.
It was a total Sussex never came close to and they were bowled out for 140 in the 18th over.
Archer is a fine fielder, particularly off his own bowling, so it was a shock when he dropped a gentle return catch after Finch pushed forward uncertainly to the first ball of the second over.
Finch was not in a mood to give a second chance, with even Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan, the worlds top-ranked T20 bowler, unable to escape punishment as the Australian hit him for two fours and two sixes.
Together with Ollie Pope (23 not out), Finch shared an unbroken
fourth-wicket stand of 100 from 50 balls.

First teenager to go to space
People have been fascinated with the final frontier since the dawn of the day when space travel became possible, if not before. With movies like Star Trek and Star Wars being at the peak of popularity and the global reaction to Elon Musks SpaceX rocket launch, the interest in colonization outside of our planet has never been higher. But while some of us only dream of space travel, one girl is making it her reality.
Alyssa Carson is a 17-year-old girl from Baton Rouge, Louisiana whom NASA is training to become an astronaut. Her dream is to be the first person on Mars and shes aiming for the 2033 first human mission to Mars. And the girl certainly has everything she needs to get there.
Being the first person to complete the NASA Passport Program by going to all 14 NASA Visitor Centers, Alyssa is also the youngest person to be accepted and graduate the Advanced Possum Academy, officially making her certified to go to space and an astronaut trainee. On top of astronaut training, she is also studying all of her school subjects in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Spanish).
The biggest [challenge] is time and getting everything done at such a young age while also still attending high school. Continuing to train at a young age will also be further difficulties for me but I have done great with it so far. Alyssa said.
Alyssa is well aware she cant get married and start a family, however, she is determined to put it aside to achieve her dream.
Besides all studying and training, Carson is also a public speaker, aiming to draw interest to space exploration, as well as encourage everyone to seek their dreams.
Always follow your dream and dont let anyone take it from you, she says. When asked about personal inspirations, Carson said that All astronauts, especially women astronauts as they have made the road for me to follow inspire her.

Fitch removes  RWN on Sri Lankas  Distilleries  Company
Fitch Ratings has removed the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka PLCs (DIST) National Long-Term Rating, and has affirmed the rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
The removal of the RWN reflects our view that DIST and parent Melstacorp PLC have effectively concluded the groups restructuring exercise without an increase in credit risk after the private placement of DIST shares to Melstacorp in February 2018. Melstacorp, which owns 92% of DIST, has yet to meet the requirement set by the Colombo Stock Exchange to increase the companys public float to 7.5% from 3.2% but we think this is more of a formality at this stage.
Fitch rates DIST based on the consolidated profile of Melstacorp due to the strong linkages between the two entities, as defined in our Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage Criteria. The affirmation of DISTs National Long-Term Rating reflects the groups strong credit profile, underpinned by its entrenched market position in Sri Lankas alcoholic-beverage sector and the high entry barriers, which drive strong operating cash flows and low leverage, and offset the weaknesses in its other, less operationally significant, investments.
DISTs rating also factors in the groups enhanced operating scale and cash flow diversity following the increase in its effective shareholding and management control of Aitken Spence PLC (ASP) to 51% in March 2018, from 49% previously.

Five teenage footballers drown in Bangladesh
DHAKA, Sunday - Five teenage footballers drowned in a river in southeast Bangladesh moments after they played a friendly match between supporters of Argentina and Brazil, police said Sunday.
Police recovered the bodies from the Matamuhuri river at Chokoria town Saturday night, some six hours after the boys drowned as they went to bathe in the coastal river following the match.
Local police chief Bakhtiaruddin Chowdhury told AFP that 22 boys from a school played the friendly after dividing themselves between supporters of Brazil and Argentina. Six of them went swimming afterwards clad in jerseys from the South American rivals.
The river at that place was very deep. We rescued a boy. Later five bodies were recovered. The dead included two brothers, Chowdhury said. Tens of thousands joined their funeral on Sunday, he said.
Bangladesh is traditionally cricket territory, but every four years the country of 160 million people -- whose national team is ranked 197th out of 202 in the world by FIFA -- goes World Cup crazy.
Flags in the colours of Argentina and Brazil take over the streets as the two Latin American teams are favourites among Bangladeshi fans. Fans across Bangladesh hold flag-waving processions to honour their favourite team. And there have been several clashes between rival supporters, prompting police in another coastal town to ban flag processions. - AFP

Five-year development programme for Anuradhapura
The governments Gam Peraliya village development programme and Enterprise Sri Lanka programme would bring about the long-felt economical emancipation in Sri Lanka, emphasised Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said so following the launching of UNDP-funded five-year development plan for Anuradhapura (2018-22), held at Anuradhapura Kachcheri auditorium recently.
The minister stated that Gam Peraliya programme would be launched in Anuradhapura district next month. Under this revolutionary development programme, rural roads, tanks and schools would be upgraded and green parks equipped with jogging paths on the basis of one green park per DS division. Village temples including shrines belonging to other religions would be offered minimum Rs. 500,000 for repairs. The tourist industry would be promoted and aid granted for having permanent roofing for dwellings. In addition, a range of loan facilities, interest-free or on micro interest would be introduced under the Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme. A special loan amounting to Rs. 350,000 would be given for installation of solar panels and domestic electrification and a loan up to Rs. 1.5 million for graduates studying further, both interest-free. Businessman entrepreneurs and self-employment seekers would be granted loan facilities at six percent interest. All these projects are aimed in enhancing national production and alleviating poverty and bringing economic stability to the country, Dissanayake said.The minister said that there would be close coordination among ministries, departments and various other agencies working.
The minister requested the officials to study the five-year plan and come out with shortcomings and practical problems in implementation, suggestions for changes to be made in any particular component for betterment, and oversights if any. He pointed out the high importance of discussing with the grass root level rural organisations about the 2018 - 2022 five year development plan for enhancing the masses participation in it.

France beat Croatia to win second fifa World Cup
Moscow, Sunday: Goals from Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe, as well as a controversial VAR-awarded penalty, helped France beat Croatia 4-2 in an incredible World Cup final in Moscow on Sunday to lift the trophy for the second time in their history.
In a match that had a bit of everything, Mario Mandzukic scored the first ever own goal in a World Cup final to put France in front at the Luzhniki Stadium, only for Ivan Perisic to equalise.
However, Antoine Griezmanns penalty put France back in front after Perisics handball was penalised with the aid of the video assistant referee, before Pogba and Mbappe both scored in the second half.
The first team to score four times in a final since Brazil in 1970, the French could even afford to see Mandzukic pull a goal back following a ridiculous goalkeeping mistake by Hugo Lloris.
France join Uruguay and Argentina in winning the World Cup for a second time, after their 1998 triumph over Brazil when Didier Deschamps -- now the coach -- was the captain.
The game will be remembered as the highest-scoring World Cup final since Englands win over West Germany in 1966, and for Mbappe becoming the youngest player to score in the final since Pele in 1958.
But while the celebrations begin on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris and across France, Croatia will wonder what might have been had the first-half penalty not been awarded just as they were in the ascendancy.
The smallest country to reach the final in the modern era will feel they were ultimately beaten by modern technology.
The questions before the match surrounded whether a tired Croatia side could pick themselves for this game after needing extra-time to beat England in the semi-finals.
Croatia played all the football early on, with Mbappe on the fringes of the game, but it was France who went in front in the 18th minute.
Griezmann won a soft free-kick wide on the right and his delivery into the area was flicked into his own net by the unfortunate Mandzukic.
It was harsh on Croatia, especially with Pogba possibly a fraction offside when the free-kick was played.
Zlatko Dalic looked rueful, but his team continued to assert themselves and were back level just before the half-hour, Domagoj Vida laying the ball off for Perisic, who shuffled the ball from right foot to left before drilling a superb shot past Hugo Lloris with the aid of a touch off Raphael Varane.
But Perisic was at the centre of the controversy that led to Frances second goal in the 38th minute.
His handball at a corner could hardly be described as deliberate, but Argentine referee Nestor Pitana reviewed the video by the side of the pitch and gave the penalty.
As a thunderstorm erupted in the sky over Moscow, Griezmann stroked home the penalty, his fourth goal of the competition and his third from a spot-kick.
It was also Frances first actual attempt on goal, but they picked off Croatia after the break.
Shortly after three pitch invaders briefly interrupted proceedings, the third French goal arrived in the 59th minute.
Pogba started the move with a drilled pass for Mbappe on the right. His cutback found Griezmann, and he laid the ball off for Pogba to score at the second attempt from 18 yards.
Mbappe then added his name to the scoresheet in the 65th minute when he collected a Lucas Hernandez pass and fired low past Subasic from 25 yards, capping what has been a fine tournament for the 19-year-old.
That should have been that, but Croatia were given something to cling to as Lloris absurdly tried to dribble away from Mandzukic on the edge of his six-yard box, and the striker stuck out a foot to divert the ball in.
But for Lloris the World Cup winners medal will help make up for the embarrassment of that moment. AFP

Not issuing the gazette notification on the minimum standards of medical education recommended by the SLMC, not responding to the proposals presented by doctors to amend tax policy, violating the National Wages Policy are some of the reasons that will led the GMOA to a strike, he said.
Signing of the Singapore FTA, delaying election for the four vacancies in the SLMC and interrupting SLMCs functions, not solving grade promotions, not granting schools for doctors children and intervening in appointments and transfers in the medical administrative service and ignoring rules and regulations are the other reasons, he said.

Holder wraps up Windies rout of Bangladesh
KINGSTON July14: Skipper Jason Holder produced another devastating burst of bowling as the West Indies completed a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh on Saturday, romping to a 166-run victory inside three days at Sabina Park.
Chasing a daunting target of 335 after the hosts were dismissed for 129 in their second innings, Bangladesh slumped to 162 all out off just 42 overs.

West Indies captain Holder was responsible for most of the carnage, taking six for 59 in the second innings to finish with match figures of 11 for 103.
We played as a team and different players stood up at different times, said Holder, named Man of the Match and Series.
Its all about heart, about putting in the effort every day to ensure that we are able to come away with the results and the performances that we wanted. Holders opposite number, Shakib al Hasan, fought with both bat and ball in a vain attempt to stave off defeat.
He took six for 33 with his left-arm spinners to engineer the West Indies second innings collapse from their overnight position of 19 for one. Shakib then offered the lone meaningful resistance with a topscore of 54 as the wickets tumbled around him.
I knew coming back as captain it would be tough but I didnt expect it to be this tough, said Shakib.
Our batting just didnt show up at all as a team. We continue to have this problem when we play away from home and I am really disappointed that we didnt show any of the fight that we are known for.
When he was eighth out, bowled fittingly by Holder, the home side knew the match was in their grasp, along with a promotion up the international rankings to number eight.
Earlier, Holder initiated the collapse by trapping Tamim Iqbal leg-before without scoring. Liton Das played positively for 33 but fell in the penultimate over before tea, caught by Shai Hope in the gully off debutant Keemo Paul.
Worse was to follow with the interval just seconds away when Roston Chase, brought on to bowl his off-spin in the final over of the afternoon period, caught Mominul Haque plumb in front and then accounted for Mahmudullah at the start of what proved to be the final session of the match.
Only when Mushfiqur Rahim partnered Shakib in a 54-run fifth-wicket stand did Bangladesh show any degree of competence at the crease.
It took the return of Holder for another spell to breach Mushfiqurs defences for 31.
In the West Indies second innings, Chase topscored with 32 as the hosts struggled to build on a huge first innings lead of 205 runs. AFP

How Dimuth succeeded when others failed
GALLE: The big difference between victory and defeat in the first Test between Sri Lanka and South Africa at the Galle International Stadium was the contribution made by opener Dimuth Karunaratne in both innings of the match.
It was Karunaratnes monumental unbeaten innings of 158 that largely contributed towards Sri Lankas first innings total of 287 after they were reduced to 176-8 and he was again his teams highest scorer in the second innings with 60 when Sri Lanka was bowled out for 190.
The next highest score in the match was 49 by South African captain Faf du Plessis. So it was easy to see how Sri Lanka ran out easy winners by 287 runs.
Karunaratne deservedly won the Man of the Match award for his two contributions on a pitch which all the other batsmen failed to come to terms with.
The biggest thing is that I am always looking for runs and trying to bat positively. Often my strike rate is in the 70s - like it was in this match. When you are playing spin you need to have a defence, but more than that you have to dominate the spinners before they dominate you, said Karunaratne.
When you are playing spin if you give the bowlers a chance to dominate you, they will step all over you to avoid that I use my feet, and Im trying to create scoring opportunities as much as I can. What Im trying to do is make them bowl in areas that are good scoring zones for me.
If you move around the crease and take a little risk when scoring those runs, you can get the bowlers to bowl where you want them to, he said.
Karunaratne said he plays best when there is a challenge.
I like the challenges the spinning Galle track offers you. I know that there is spin after those early overs, because Galle is anyway a spin-friendly track. I like that challenge, because it tests you. You get better when you face challenges like that. I think Im applying my skill and doing well on turning tracks as well, said Karunaratne.
When I go to bat, Im thinking of the first 15 overs because its in those overs that an opener has it tough. If you can get through that 15 overs, then you should know how to carry on. Rather than doing all the hard work and passing the job on to someone else, its better to build the innings yourself. As an opener if you want to score runs, thats really important, he said.
Karunaratne has scored hundreds against all Test playing nations except against England and Australia. Of his eight Test hundreds four have been over the 150 plus mark.
Karunaratne still feels he has a lot of work to do to get to where he wants to be.
You cant say I have a complete technique. We learn every day. When you play in New Zealand you need a lot of good technique. You have to learn to play straight and when theres pace, you need to adjust your backlift as well. When you go to those countries you need to make those changes and adjustments, said Karunaratne.
On turning wickets, you dont score a lot of runs straight, so you need to know which areas to score in. You can adjust to those things with your experience, and the style in which you play. In domestic cricket you get lots of turning wickets, so the more experience you get playing on those types of wickets. Its that experience that has taught me what I need to do in different situations. I think Ive matured since I first came into the team. But Im not complete yet. The more I play, the better I will become, I feel, he said.
Karunaratne is a great believer that the quicker you learn the quicker you rise.
You should know when you face certain conditions how exactly you need to play there. Like we were tested in South Africa (on their fast and bouncy pitches), we test them here as well. If theres something to learn, you have to do it outside your comfort zone. Thats how you become a good Test batsman, said Karunaratne.
There were runs in this (Galle) pitch - you just had to play positively and have self-belief. Even Suranga (Lakmal) and (Lakshan) Sandakan scored runs. When we went to South Africa - Thilan (Samaraweera) had scored runs there, as had Kumar Sangakkara. But what you need to learn quickly is how exactly you have to approach those different challenges. If you learn quickly, you rise quickly, he said.

International legal protection for Sri Lanka folk medicines
In a major boost to Sri Lankan folk medicine tradition, Sri Lanka today announced that it is moving the centuries old system for protection under Genevas well-known Traditional Knowledge regime.
I am pleased to say that we are working with Genevas World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in the last five years to introduce intellectual property support to our traditional, indigenous medicine system, said the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on July 13 who was addressing the inauguration event of National Chamber of Commerce Ayurveda Expo 2018 at BMICH. Sri Lankas very own indigenous medical practice is centuries old, and co-exists with the countrys Ayurveda practice. Joining the event were Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne and Minister of Social Welfare and Primary Industries, Daya Gamage.
Ayurveda practice is a long-standing tradition in Sri Lanka existing with our indigenous medicine system. Similar to our local medicine system it supports our wellness and medical tourism development as well said Minister Bathiudeen, and added, There has also been experience sharing between Ayurveda and the local medicine systems. When we say Ayurveda in Sri Lanka it sometimes includes the practice of our own, other indigenous traditional medicines as well. And it is a priority that we safeguard our local heritage. A force that protects our heritage is the intellectual property system of Sri Lanka. Realising this our intellectual property system is being expanded to meet modern needs as well. The long awaited amendments to Intellectual Property Act on Geographic Indicators (GI) and copyright for artists have also been finalized by my Ministry and ready for approval.
We are expanding our intellectual property system to protect our traditional medicine system as well. For example our historic local medicine system which is part of our Ayurveda can be placed under global traditional knowledge support. Therefore I am pleased to say that we are working with Genevas World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in the last five years to introduce intellectual property support to our traditional, folk medicine system. In that we started working to introduce global traditional knowledge protection support for local medicine system, other than Ayurveda and western medicine practiced here. This effort will protect the valuable indigenous medicine practiced in Sri Lanka across many other countries and competitors. It also ensures the Unity governments continued efforts to develop wellness tourism goals of Sri Lanka, the minister said.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is a supporter of this Ayurveda exhibition series from very early on-helping the expo series since 2007.

JICA lends 10.639 billion yen for health, medical services
Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) signed a loan agreement with the Government on July 11 to provide Japans Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan up to 10.639 billion yen for the Health and Medical Service Improvement Project.
The project will improve medical services for the diagnosis and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by strengthening the medical facilities and equipment at the tertiary care hospitals, providing equipment to training institutions for medical laboratory technologists(MLT) and strengthening the maintenance and management system for medical equipment at the Bio Medical Engineering Services under the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MOH) Ministry and target medical institutions.
The targeted tertiary care hospitals of the project are Anuradhapura, Badulla, Kandy, Kurunegala and Trincomalee. The loan funds will be mainly allocated towards the improvement of cath labs in the hospitals, facility and equipment improvements and technical assistance for medical equipment maintenance and management at the institutions.
The government has made remarkable strides in basic health services such as communicable diseases and maternal and child health over the past decades. Despite these measures, since 1980s NCDs are on rise due to the increase in the elderly population and lifestyle changes. Approximately, 60 per cent of the total deaths in the country during 1990s which were caused by NCDs were increased up to 81 per cent in 2015 including cardiovascular diseases.Despite the numerous programmes implemented by GOSL to improve NCDs in the country, inadequate medical facilities and equipment for necessary diagnosis and treatments,especially in the rural tertiary care hospitals, have been hindering the achievement in the NCD management. The equipment at training institutions for MLTs who carry out the tests needed for the diagnosis of NCDs and other diseases arealso seen as either insufficient or in poor condition.
Managing the existing medical equipment,maintenance and management system also needs to be strengthened. The new JICA project is expected to address these issues at the targeted medical institutions noted above.
This project is a remarkable milestone of JICA cooperation extended towards the health sector of Sri Lanka and the outcome of the project is expected to contribute immensely to improve diagnosis and treat NCDs.

The Joint Opposition will step up its calls to recognise them as the largest group in the Opposition in Parliament this week, Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the Joint Opposition along with the SLFP Group of 16 will press Speaker Karu Jayasuriya asking to recognize them as the largest group in the Opposition and give them the due official rights including the post of Leader of Opposition.
MP Gunawardena said a written communication in that regard will also be submitted to the Speaker this week. He said a final decision as to whether they function as an independent group was yet to be made.
We altogether have 70 MPs. Ours is much more than the TNA and the JVP put together. It is high time the Speaker accept the principles of democratic Parliament procedure, he said. The Speaker had previously declined to recognise the National Freedom Front led by MP Wimal Weerawansa as a separate group in Parliament.
The Speaker then said Parliament can only recognise the six parties, the UNP, UPFA, ITAK, JVP, EPDP and SLMC that contested at the General Election on August 17, 2015.

Karunaratne and Holder achieve career-high rankings
Sri Lankas Dimuth Karunaratne and Jason Holder of the West Indies have achieved career-high positions in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Player Rankings after inspiring their sides to impressive victories in the Galle and Jamaica Tests, respectively, which concluded on Saturday.
Karunaratne, the 30-year-old left-handed opener, has been rewarded for his knocks of 158 not out and 60 in Sri Lankas 278-run victory over South Africa with a leap of 21 places that has put him in 10th position among batsmen, while Holders figures of five for 44 and six for 59 in his sides 166-run victory over Bangladesh moved him up nine places to 13th in the latest rankings, which were released on Sundaymorning.
Karunaratne is now his sides second-highest-ranked batsman behind Dinesh Chandimal (ninth), while Holder is also his sides second-highest-ranked bowler behind Shannon Gabriel, who is now in 11thposition. With Chandimal not available for the Colombo Test, Karunaratne has an opportunity to become his countrys highest-ranked batsman, provided he performs strongly.
From the Galle Test against the second-ranked side in the world, Karunaratne has collected 128 points and he now trails Chandimal by 20 points, while Holders efforts in Jamaica have earned him 98 points, which means he is now 11 points behind 12th- ranked England fast bowler Stuart Broad and 26 points behind Gabriel.
Other batsmen to make major upward movements from the just-concluded Tests include Kraigg Brathwaite (13th, up by three places) and Shakib Al Hasan (22nd, up by two places), while bowlers to head in the right direction are Rangana Herath (eighth, up by two places), Dilruwan Perera (25th, up by seven places) and Mehedi Hasan (33rd, up by three places).

Prisoners on death row for drug trafficking
List of 18 submitted to Justice Ministry
A list of names comprising 18 prisoners convicted for drug trafficking and sentenced to death was handed over to the Justice Ministry yesterday, Commissioner of Prisons (Administration/Intelligence and Security) H.M.T.N. Upuldeniya told the Daily News yesterday. He said the majority of those inmates were being detained at the Welikada Prison while several have been detained in outstation prisons.
The list has been prepared after perusing the details of 352 inmates serving death sentence. However, Upuldeniya said the Prisons Department is not in a position to identify as to how many among them or who among them continue to be involved in the drug business, while in prison cell. According to statistics in the Prison Departments annual report for 2017, there are currently 879 on death row sentenced prisoners who had appealed against the judgment given to them.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the implementation of the death penalty requires the President to sign off the execution.
President Maithripala Sirisena last week announced that he was ready to sign the implementation of the death sentences on criminals convicted of drug related offenses, who are still involved in drug trafficking in the country from within prisons.
The Cabinet of Ministers which met last week approved the Presidents decision.
However, many human rights activists expressed their opposition to the decision and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka writing to the President on Saturday urged him reconsider the decision.
Sri Lanka has not executed the death penalty since 1976. The Presidents decision to end the countrys moratorium on capital punishment was in the wake of rising drug-related crimes.

Making all voices count
The cure is not an easy catchphrase in a country that experienced a decade-long war. The process is possible only if the right steps were taken. Sri Lanka ended the war in 2009, but whether the peace was achieved or not is a question emerging from many quarters.
That is where reconciliation and peace-building fit in. Declaring open the Youth Conference on International Relations at the University of Kelaniya, its Vice Chancellor Professor D M Semasinghe said that more attention should be drawn to achieve and ensure reconciliation and peace-building.
We hear catcalls from many sides. The north calls for a reawakening of the LTTE, while the south needs to resurrect the Hitlerism. This indicates the mental status of both hemispheres. They are not at peace yet. The first step of the reconciliation is devolving power. We must then be able to abolish the executive presidency. These steps lead to the reconciliation, Professor Semasinghe noted.
Professor Semasinghe added three more measures which should be applied to the war-affected victims. First comes healing, which is followed by repair. Finally, it is a transformation. Even though the war was over years ago, these steps have not been implemented properly.
Grievances of the war-affected victims must not be ignored. When the victims are not healed and their shattered lifestyle left without repair, it means their grievances are not addressed properly. In such a background it is not possible to execute the healing process. Transformation counts much more significant than both healing and repairing. Every citizen shall feel equal in the country. If any citizen feels second-class, it means they have lost the national identity in the country.
The conference, organized by the Department of International Studies Students Association of Kelaniya University, centred its theme on how reconciliation and peace-building can lead to the voice for a better world. This event created a platform for the undergraduates who are interested in the field of international affairs to voice their views on contentious global issues.
The International Studies Degree Programme was first introduced to the University of Kelaniya in 2002 with the participation of delegates from the University of Colombo. For more than one decade with an overwhelming demand for the subject, the Department continues to accommodate a large number of students each year since its initiation.
International Studies Department Head Senior Lecturer Thumira Gunasena stressed on the need of the international voice in a local forum.
We have chosen the theme of reconciliation and peace-building with our experience on the past events. It is a timely theme, especially as delegates from the Jaffna peninsula have also joined hands with us. This is an international issue with relevance to the Sri Lankan context. The most crucial aspect in the reconciliation process is the attitude. Changing your attitude is the most difficult task, but it is the most important issue in the process, Thumira Gunasena said.
Addressing the gathering, G L Peiris former professor of Law and former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo noted that the reconciliation process should be handled in a balanced manner.
The majority community should not be alienated from the reconciliation process. It is what happens usually during a reconciliation process. The majority is also an important factor. All the communities are important for democracy to be practised.
Norway Ambassador Thorbjrn Gaustadsther in his keynote address elaborated on the role of Norway in the reconciliation process world over.
Norway has earned the reputation as the facilitator between parties to settle conflicts. The conflict resolution is a focal aspect of Norwegian foreign policy which ultimately leads to reconciliation and peace-building. The country always remained a facilitator in terms of peace and reconciliation, especially with its support given to the UN since the early 1990s.
The International Studies Department offers two Degree programmes: the Honours Degree Programme (English medium) and the Bachelor of Arts Degree Programme (Sinhala medium). International Studies Degree programmes offer a unique blend of multidisciplinary subject areas for the students to enhance their knowledge in different dimensions of International Studies.
The course content includes international and regional politics, foreign policy studies, Strategic studies, international and regional organizations, human rights, international law, international migration, diplomacy, geopolitics, International business management, international trade etc. covering a variety of subjects in the field of international studies. The Honours Degree Programme requires students to learn one of the foreign languages such as Chinese, German, Korean and Russian which have an added advantage for the students in shaping their future aspirations in the field of Foreign Service. One of the potentials of the Degree Programmes is beside improving their academic and research competencies, the students are directed to develop many soft skills such as critical thinking across multi-disciplinary dimensions, English and Foreign languages competencies, analytical thinking and computing through their respective curriculums. The Youth Conference was also the venue to a joint collaboration of Secretariat of the Pakistan High Commission, Kuwait Embassy, Norwegian Embassy and The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute in various enlightening sessions on international relations.
A session was held for the current undergraduates of international studies to explore their employability in areas such as diplomacy. The undergraduate syllabus was also reviewed at the session offering a comprehensive framework to the subject. The schoolchildren interested in studying the subject also attended a separate session.
Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd was the print media sponsor of the event.

Mastercard partners with Singapore Police Force
To combat fraud, Mastercard announced its partnership with the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force to implement the Mastercard Forensic Reader (MFR) - the worlds first device to help law enforcement agencies detect payment card fraud with greater speed, accuracy and efficiency.
Resembling an in-store point-of-sale terminal, the MFR aims to improve the effectiveness, timeliness and accuracy in investigating payment card fraud of Mastercard and other payment cards.In the past, such investigations required protracted processes involving multiple parties such as investigation agencies, payment solution companies and card issuers.
The introduction of the MFR enables law enforcement agencies to quickly process seized fraudulent cards and verify with the relevant card issuer if the card is a suspected counterfeit in a matter of seconds.
Ian Wong, Deputy Director, Financial Investigation, Commercial Affairs Department, said, Mastercard had been working very closely with the CAD in fighting payment card fraud since the 1980s. Besides providing invaluable assistance in our day-to-day investigations, Mastercard has also partnered CAD and other organizations in efforts to prevent payment card fraud. Mastercards donation of 10 pieces of Mastercard Forensic Reader will enhance CADs ability to investigate into payment card fraud and related offences.
Derek Pak, Regional Head, Customer Fraud Management, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, said, With criminals constantly thinking of new ways to bypass security systems, industry-wide collaboration has never been of greater importance when staying one step ahead of the game. The Mastercard Forensic Reader is a practical example of how were putting our expertise and resources to innovating new ways to fight fraud, partnering with like-minded organizations such as local law enforcement agencies to implement this on-ground.It is the combined force of the industry that will allow us to effectively combat card fraud, with the common goal of safeguarding cardholders private information.
Originally piloted in 2015, law enforcement agencies in Macau and Taiwan were among the first to adopt the MFR in Asia Pacific.
Key features of the MFR include: Greater speed: Fraud investigations require immediate coordination across organizations. The MFR enables law enforcement agencies to instantly contact the issuing bank to determine if the card is authentic or counterfeit within seconds. Greater flexibility: The reader is designed to be able to readchip, magnetic stripe or contactless cards. Data security: The MFR meets industry standards and does not store any card information.

Mastering the art of gardening
Humans have always had a symbiotic relationship with the natural world of plants. Plants have always been our simplest way of living and sustenance. Daily News spoke toDistrict Agriculture Instructor, Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office, K. N. K. Jayathilake on Home Gardening and its value. Throughout history as agriculture evolved, man has learnt the value of cultivating in his land various plants for consumption, beautification (aesthetic needs), medicine and economic benefit.
These include vegetables, fruits, timber/wood, spices and medicinal plants, said Jayathilake.
Humans have being the one species that has reached out to the natural environment and changed it to suit his desires- the domestication of plants and animals.
As man progressed through the ages he understood the need and importance of self- sufficiency and began to modify his environment to suit his needs. As societies evolved, home gardening started to make sense because it was a way where ones livelihood could be supported. It was a way where so many needs could be addressed in one plot of land and it was a way where one could make sure that ones lifestyle was healthy and there was no shortage of nutrition. It was a way of ensuring productivity. It was a sustainable way of living, explained Jayathilake.
Also decades back society was different and there was no space problem and one could grow the crops without any hindrance and there was no obstacle when it came to health and nutrition.
The crops would not be exposed to insecticides and ones health would be looked after. One could make sure that his/her family would be able to have a balanced diet. One could also ensure that the plot of land one had, could be utilized to the maximum, said Jayathilake.
Also household waste could be used as compost to make the soil rich, in other words soil management. The crops can be plucked fresh from the garden and there is no need to store them in a refrigerator. It is easily accessible throughout the year.
The next generation needs to learn this way of living because it will benefit them. This knowledge must be passed down. They need to be educated about the benefits of home gardening. Every generation needs to be enlightened on why Home Gardening is so important. Home Gardening also makes the environment around you more comfortable because of the coolness and is pleasing to the eye. We know that trees consume carbon dioxide and supply the environment with oxygen. Home Gardening makes your garden livable and it becomes a paradise, pointed out Jayathilake.
Home Gardening is also easy on the wallet. With the cost of living going up, the value of having a good home garden is great.
When you have an excess in vegetables in your garden, then one can have the option of selling them in the market. There is no need to depend on the market because you have everything you need to eat at home. This benefits your savings and budget since you dont need to buy vegetables and fruits from the shop. It is clean and you need not worry about your health, stated Jayathilake.
Peace of Mind is something we all aspire to. Life is not just about trials. It is about the quality of living, since you get to live life only once.
It does wonders for you terms of security and peace of mind. The satisfaction you get by operating your own home garden is indescribable. It makes you happy because you are able to get rid of mental stress. It soothes your mind.
With the evolution of societies tension became a factor that contributed towards negativity in life. But because of the simplicity of a home garden this factor is not there. But now with the emerging of urbanization and the ever increasing complexity of life and because of the rat race, life has become so hectic and people are becoming stressed out.
They are also physically inactive. We have also got used to buying vegetables in the market some which have been exposed to insecticides. This is why we need Home Gardens, explained Jayathilake.
It is true that because of this rat race we have very little time to devote to home gardens but we need to make the effort and make the time for our home gardens. Home Gardens must be popularized for everyones sake in this country.
Also you have the pleasure of working in your garden which is good for your physical health and is a very beneficial way of spending your time. Our daily intake of fruits must be around 200g. And our daily vegetable intake 175  200g, must be given important consideration for a healthy lifestyle. It is essential that the vegetables and greens are not exposed to chemicals, said Jayathilake.
Your home garden must be organized according to your unique desire. Just like people are different a home garden will also differ according to the personality of its owner.
That is why the Home Garden should be made a part of our household, and various spices need to be grown in limited amounts in the garden.
Also when deciding which crops to plant we need to select those that are suitable to the environment we live in. It must be suitable to the climate. We also need to think about family patterns e.g. number of family members, age range in a house, nutrients that they need to consume, likes and dislikes when it comes to taste, said Jayathilake.
It is also important to give priority to diversity. We need to look at where to grow these crops in the garden because some crops are sun loving crops and the crops have their own sunlight requirements.
Some crops are shade loving crops. Crops are not only for food but to beautify the environment. Also bee- keeping is another recommended activity in a home garden in order to make the home garden a success and in order to provide a good lifestyle.

My garden, a barometer of climate change
The clematis is in full bloom right now: a riot of purple flowers up the side of the deck, aiming for the wall.
Being a vine, a clematis will twine around anything that crosses its path, including itself, at all available opportunities. The result is often, even with a short period of gardener inattention, a snarly mess; the leafstalks curl, and curl, in on themselves in order to find some  any  purchase. In this situation, if you want to coax the vine outward, you have to unwind the intricate tendrils very gently and place them against better climbing scaffolds: a thin stick, a wire. One long Canadian spring afternoon in May, that is what I did: slowly and carefully took apart the knots, suggesting to each shoot a less tangled path up a new, metal trellis.
On that particular afternoon, I had to wait until the sun had passed over the deck to do this work, or it would have been just too hot. It was nearly 31C that afternoon with high humidity: not quite record-breaking, but unseasonable for Toronto. Summers, here, are getting longer and hotter, and winters warmer and more unpredictable.
This year, the thermometer hit 16C in February: thats in a Canadian city in which the historical average high for the month is -3C. Now, we are in the middle of an extended heat-wave.
From my perspective as caretaker of this little plant community, the problem is also that many of the seasonal understandings that have been basic to gardening in Toronto can no longer be assumed. Lavender might not survive the winter without wrapping. Tomatoes might need to be shaded in order to survive what is forecast to be an especially hot summer. Plants that require specialist pollinators may find their calls unanswered because the short-lived insects on which they rely may now have lives out of sync with the blooms.
There is a multitude of opinions about gardening in these climate changing times. Many urban gardeners talk about how to protect their plants from climate change: shielding them from extreme temperatures, conserving and/or diverting water, planting a greater range of resilient species in more cohabitative arrangements, and being extra-aware of the presence of both predatory and pollinator insects.
Some gardeners understand their work as itself a form of climate change mitigation: getting rid of lawns that require mowing, planting to preserve and foster biodiversity, moving toward organic and permaculture practices to decrease the use of chemical fertilisers, and favouring native species that know what resilience means. Some are preparing for an intensified food security crisis, adapting flower beds for vegetables, and planting fruit-bearing shrubs and trees for future sustenance.
To me, more than anything, gardening in these times means two things. First, looking after my little backyard demands that I pay close attention to the present and future: what are the plants telling me about the ways the climate is changing What do they need that I can give them What do these needs tell me about the larger scale of the changes in which we are immersed What can I do, concretely, to mitigate change, to adapt to it, and even to resist it
What does it mean, then, to worry about this beautiful, compromised, plant in the midst of climate change, when it is already so clearly implicated in global colonialism and capitalism Yes, we can tend to gardens as acts to mitigate climate and foster biodiversity. But we can also challenge the relationships that have brought these particular gardens into being as part of, rather than as a refuge from, climate changing times.
Gardens are microcosms of the complicated relationships that are the difficult world in which we are living, whether we like it or not, even as we may consciously refract those relations into new possibilities. In the garden, this practice involves taking careful stock: of the plants that are here, of the travels that have brought them here, and of the possibilities that here might yet bring about.

Nailed it!
Its the end of an era for the man who holds the world record for Longest Fingernails on One Hand.
Shridhar Chillal, of Pune, India, hadnt cut the fingernails on his left hand since 1952, when he was 14 and a teacher got mad at him for breaking a nail. Chillal decided to see how long he could grow them, even though the Guinness Book of World Records didnt exist then.
The 82-year-old record holder managed to get his nails to grow a collective length of about 29 feet, 10 inches before being officially honored by Guinness in November 2014.
But he decided to cut away an important part of his life earlier this week when he flew to New York to have the nails removed by a doctor. The nails are now on display at the Ripleys Believe It Or Not! Odditorium in Times Square.
I was a little bit scared that my celebrity favor would go now, but today after coming here I realize that after this I have become a real celebrity, Chillal told Patch New York through an interpreter.
Now, forever my nails will be remembered and forever my nails will be seen by people from all over the world.
There were other reasons why Chillal was willing to cut away an important part of his life: The collective weight of the nails has made it impossible for Chillal to open his hand from a closed position or flex his fingers.
I am in pain, he told Guinness World Records. With every heart beat all five fingers, my wrist, elbow and shoulder are hurting a lot and at the tip of the nail theres a burning sensation always.
Chillal attempted to cut his supersized nails with a manual clipper, but that didnt work.
The doctor used a hand-held power grinder in a process that took about 20 minutes, according to Patch New York.
No word on how Chillal is adapting to the lighter load on his left hand, but life just became easier for him in many ways. In 2015, he told HuffPost India how hard it was to sleep with his long nails.
I cant move much, so every half an hour or so I wake up and move my hand to the other side of the bed.

Narcotics boom due to past political patronage - PM
Narcotic drugs have become a big problem because it is found everywhere in the country today. Narcotic drugs would not have reached the villages if law and order was properly administered in the country before 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said. Although orders came from top echelons to conduct raids on drug racketeers, most persons at the lower rungs were connected to the drug racket.
Whenever a suspect in possession of drugs was arrested in a raid, politicians at that time spoke over the phone and ordered the release of the suspect, the Prime Minister said.
Drug racketeering and sexual abuse of women were considered as qualifications to become Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman then. But since 2015 we have issued strict orders to police to act firmly to combat drug trafficking and racketeering, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made this observation addressing a meeting after opening a newly built auditorium at Ibbagamuwa on July 14.
The Prime Minister said in 2015 the government decided to break the drug supply chain because once its done, there wont be any drugs available for distribution.
He said countries such as Singapore advised us to first pay attention to the supply chain and disrupt if they were to curtail distribution. Thereafter, we asked Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the IGP to get cracking in this endeavour.
According to reports received by the Prime Minister, the amount of heroin seized had been 46 kg in 2015, 207 kg in 2016, 350 kg in 2017 and 150 kg during the last 6 months of this year. The amount of ganja seized had been 6,570 kg in 2015, 4,178 kg in 1,016, 4,987 kg in 2017 and 2,900 kg during the past seven months. The amount of Cocaine seized had been 6 kg in 2015, 1,571 kg in 2016, 221 kg in 2017 and 14 kg in the last seven months. Now, the law enforcement authorities wee targeting the supply chains.
Two things happen when there is a shortage in supplies. One is the increase in price due to short supply and the second is the decrease in supplies resulting in clashes among the distributions, the Prime Minister said.
Now clashes among distributors had escalated into shooting incidents causing loss of life among the distributions. When chases occur among drug distributors police find it easy to arrest them, the Premier added.

National Export Strategy  to be launched on July-19
The National Export Strategy (NES) is a fantastic opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together and the NES target is achievable, Harin De Silva, Chairman, Export Association of Sri Lanka (EASL) said.
Speaking to Daily News Business in the sidelines of the 21st EASL AGM in Colombo on Friday he said the government in collaboration with exporters has put together a fantastic document (NES) which will be launched on July 19. He however cautioned that the government should drive it and there should be a political will that comes from the top to execute the plan. The private sector cannot get involved in running these things because we run our own businesses, the EASL chief said.
The success of this document will depend entirely on the political will of the incumbent government to drive the National Export Strategy, he pointed out.
De Silva said the targets stipulated in the NES were achievable although it may not happen overnight. With the necessary infrastructure behind the export fraternity in the next couple of years we can get there, he asserted insisting that the exporters were also keen in having a clear direction to forge ahead with their export plans.
The EASL chairman emphasized five main points that could formulate the foundation for the growth in the Sri Lankan export sector. Among them were driving the NES. Here the government must ensure that a predictable transparent policy and regulatory framework was in place to promote the Sri Lankan export industry. He said the second point was improving the investment climate in Sri Lanka and the third addressing the constraints for market access promotion. De Silva added that the fourth point was the coactive engagement in trade liberalization and fifth point was fostering innovation driven exports.
The NES is a comprehensive and carefully structured five-year strategy aimed at increasing exports and generating enhanced revenue for Sri Lankas SMEs and exporters. The implementation of this endeavour is expected to increase Sri Lankas export revenue to US$ 28 billion by 2022.

A presentation on the final report of The Project on Electricity Sector Master Plan Study was held at the National Economic Council (NEC) chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena on July 10.
The key Cabinet Ministers including Finance and Mass Media Minister, Power and Renewable Energy Minister and the ministerial secretaries were present at the council meeting.
The presentation was made by Master Plan Study Team Leader Noboru Seki. Ambassador for Japan Kenichi Suganuma and JICA Sri Lanka Chief representative Fusato Tanaka were also present at the meeting held at the Presidents Office in Colombo.
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is responsible to develop, operate and maintain a stable, efficient and economical electricity supply system, prepares mid to long term investment plans. These plans which identify future investment projects, such as power generations, transmission lines, substations and distribution network to meet the future demand projections are formulated based on the Master Plan which covers 25 years and includes elaborated electricity demand modeling and power system analysis.
Any master plan needs to be reviewed and updated at least in every 10 years to meet such requirement. With this Master Plan completed in March 2018, the latest master plan which was also formulated through the support by JICA in year 2006 has been updated by considering development in the country and the latest technologies available in the field of power system for the next 25 years.
The JICA supported Master Plan has developed a comprehensive master plan of 25 years to generate, transmit and distribute development for the whole country. The Master Plan covers new technical challenges which the CEB as an implementing organization may face by 2040.
The JICA supported Master Plan recommends the best mix scenario which include various power sources in a balanced way. Similar scenarios have been endorsed in the recently approved energy policy by the Cabinet and the latest Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) of the CEB.

No doctor at hospital: Two accident victims die
Medical officers were not available at the Thammennawa hospital on July 14 to attend to those who sustained fatal injuries in a motorcycle accident at Ambagahawela in Seeppukulama, residents complained.
A student who assisted to carry the injured to the Thammennawa hospital said the life of the eight-year-old boy who died in the accident could have been saved if a doctor was on duty that day.
Three in the same family were seriously injured when the motorcycle they were riding veered off the road and collided into concrete utility pole.
The father, Sumanapala Thilakaratnage Prasad Lanka Thilakaratne (41), and son Malitha Thilakaratne (8) succumbed to their injuries while the mother, Deepika Udayangani Kumari (37) is receiving treatment at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital ICU. The Police suspect that the inability to control speed or the rider falling asleep could be the cause for this accident. Residents complained that even though the injured were rushed to the Thammennawa government hospital, a doctor was not available to attend to them.
We immediately carried the small child to the hospital and he showed signs of life. As a doctor was not available we had to carry him to Mihintale government hospital, but the child passed away before we reached that hospital, a student who assisted to carry the injured to the hospital said. Mihintale Police is conducting further investigations.

Over $16 bn investment projects  under discussion with Singapore
Sri Lanka is gearing to reap the benefits of the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, with four mega projects being discussed by the Board of Investment, (BOI).
According to the BOI projects with a total investment value of over US$ 16 billion in manufacturing mainly for exports are the first projects to realize since the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA was implemented on May 1, 2018.
The largest of these is an export oriented oil refinery valued at $14.8 billion in Hambantota. The second is a $1 billion investment in a steel manufacturing plant in Trincomalee.
The other two projects will be both in Hambantota: a $200 million sugar refinery and$50 million flour mill, both for local and export markets. These proposals are being evaluated and will be implemented as soon as land is identified, the BOI said. Last week, Sri Lanka held a highly successful investment forum in the city state targeting Singapore companies encouraged by the FTA. The forum was attended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama and officials of the BOI, Sri Lanka Customs and MODSIT.
The Singapore delegation was headed by senior Minister S. Iswaran. Presentations were also made by two recent Singapore entrants to Sri Lanka in the food and beverage sector who highlighted the strong investor facilitation now being offered by the BOI and the high living standards including housing, healthcare and education facilities which make it easy for job creating investors and their families to be based in Sri Lanka.
In the early years of Sri Lankas open economy, Singapore was one of the largest investors with marquee investments by companies such as Shin Kwan Group and Prima Group. While Singapores outward FDI has skyrocketed over the past two decades, Sri Lankas portion had trickled downwards.
The FTA is expected to place Sri Lanka firmly on Singapores investment map, and the serious interest is an indication of a massive upswing now underway.

## Title: Preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Monday, July 16, 2018 - 01:00
Preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance
Antibiotics are medicines used to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response to the use of these medicines.
Bacteria, not humans or animals, become antibiotic-resistant. These bacteria may infect humans and animals, and the infections they cause are harder to treat than those caused by non-resistant bacteria.
Antibiotic resistance leads to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality.
The world urgently needs to change the way it prescribes and uses antibiotics. Even if new medicines are developed, without behaviour change, antibiotic resistance will remain a major threat. Behaviour changes must also include actions to reduce the spread of infections through vaccination, hand washing, practising safer sex, and good food hygiene.
Scope of the problem
Antibiotic resistance is rising to dangerously high levels in all parts of the world. New resistance mechanisms are emerging and spreading globally, threatening our ability to treat common infectious diseases. A growing list of infections  such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, blood poisoning, gonorrhoea, and foodborne diseases  are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become less effective.
Where antibiotics can be bought for human or animal use without a prescription, the emergence and spread of resistance is made worse. Similarly, in countries without standard treatment guidelines, antibiotics are often over-prescribed by health workers and veterinarians and over-used by the public.
Without urgent action, we are heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries can once again kill.
Prevention and control
Antibiotic resistance is accelerated by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, as well as poor infection prevention and control. Steps can be taken at all levels of society to reduce the impact and limit the spread of resistance.
Individuals
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, individuals can:
* Only use antibiotics when prescribed by a certified health professional.
* Never demand antibiotics if your health worker says you dont need them.
* Always follow your health workers advice when using antibiotics.
* Never share or use leftover antibiotics.
* Prevent infections by regularly washing hands, preparing food hygienically, avoiding close contact with sick people, practising safer sex, and keeping vaccinations up to date.
* Prepare food hygienically, following the WHO Five Keys to Safer Food (keep clean, separate raw and cooked, cook thoroughly, keep food at safe temperatures, use safe water and raw materials) and choose foods that have been produced without the use of antibiotics for growth promotion or disease prevention in healthy animals.
Policy makers
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, policy makers can:
* Ensure a robust national action plan to tackle antibiotic resistance is in place.
* Improve surveillance of antibiotic-resistant infections.
* Strengthen policies, programmes, and implementation of infection prevention and control measures.
* Regulate and promote the appropriate use and disposal of quality medicines.
* Make information available on the impact of antibiotic resistance.
Health professionals
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, health professionals can:
* Prevent infections by ensuring your hands, instruments, and environment are clean.
* Only prescribe and dispense antibiotics when they are needed, according to current guidelines.
* Report antibiotic-resistant infections to surveillance teams.
* Talk to your patients about how to take antibiotics correctly, antibiotic resistance and the dangers of misuse.
* Talk to your patients about preventing infections (for example, vaccination, hand washing, safer sex, and covering nose and mouth when sneezing).
Healthcare industry
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, the health industry can:
* Invest in research and development of new antibiotics, vaccines, diagnostics and other tools.
Agriculture sector
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, the agriculture sector can:
* Only give antibiotics to animals under veterinary supervision.
* Not use antibiotics for growth promotion or to prevent diseases in healthy animals.
* Vaccinate animals to reduce the need for antibiotics and use alternatives to antibiotics when available.
* Promote and apply good practices at all steps of production and processing of foods from animal and plant sources.
* Improve biosecurity on farms and prevent infections through improved hygiene and animal welfare.
Recent developments
While there are some new antibiotics in development, none of them are expected to be effective against the most dangerous forms of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Given the ease and frequency with which people now travel, antibiotic resistance is a global problem, requiring efforts from all nations and many sectors.
Impact
When infections can no longer be treated by first-line antibiotics, more expensive medicines must be used. A longer duration of illness and treatment, often in hospitals, increases health care costs as well as the economic burden on families and societies.
Antibiotic resistance is putting the achievements of modern medicine at risk. Organ transplantations, chemotherapy and surgeries such as caesarean sections become much more dangerous without effective antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of infections.

Key facts
* Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.
*Antibiotic resistance can affect anyone, of any age, in any country.
* Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals is accelerating the process.
* A growing number of infections  such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, and salmonellosis  are becoming harder to treat as the antibiotics used to treat them become less effective.
* Antibiotic resistance leads to longer hospital stays, higher medical costs and increased mortality.
****
WHO response
Tackling antibiotic resistance is a high priority for WHO. A global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, including antibiotic resistance, was endorsed at the World Health Assembly in May 2015. The global action plan aims to ensure prevention and treatment of infectious diseases with safe and effective medicines.
The Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance has five strategic objectives:
* To improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance.
* To strengthen surveillance and research.
* To reduce the incidence of infection.
* To optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines.
* To ensure sustainable investment in countering antimicrobial resistance.
A political declaration endorsed by Heads of State at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2016 signaled the worlds commitment to taking a broad, coordinated approach to address the root causes of antimicrobial resistance across multiple sectors, especially human health, animal health and agriculture. WHO is supporting Member States to develop national action plans on antimicrobial resistance, based on the global action plan.
WHO has been leading multiple initiatives to address antimicrobial resistance:

Prisons to monitor goods brought in for inmates
Prison authorities are planning to ban food and other essential items from being taken into prisons by visitors.The measure is on at the Agunakolapelessa prisons.
A spokesman for the Prisons Department said the Department will soon submit a proposal to the Justice Ministry to implement it in all prisons in the country.
He said the Department will seek to impose a ban on bringing in food and other essential items for inmates by visitors.
The spokesman said visitors often deliver banned drugs such as heroin hidden inside food items and other essential items to prisoners.
He said visitors bring phones, SIM cards and other items to inmates hidden inside food and other items.
If visitors need to deliver food or other essential to inmates, they can do so by paying the relevant cost of the items to the Department office. Then we will buy those items and give them to the prisoners, he said. He said a number of foreign countries were adopting this method successfully.
The spokesman said this will help minimise crimes and other wrongdoings inmates commit.

## Title: Public integrity to prevent corruption

Public integrity to prevent corruption
The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is a global initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from national governments to promote open government, empower citizens and fight corruption to strengthen good governance. It was launched in 2011 on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly meeting. Today it has 75 participating countries, including Sri Lanka.
Three years ago, addressing OGP summit, the British Prime Minister set out the golden thread of four conditions which allow any country to prosper- the rule of law, the absence of conflict, the presence of strong property rights and most importantly, the absence of corruption.
Although the first three conditions are in order, the most important element  corruption - is missing in Sri Lanka. We do not have a strong track record in tackling corruption. Our level of corruption is far higher than the majority of other developing countries around the world. For example, we are 91 least corrupt nation out of 175 countries, according to the 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index. And, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), recently revealed that according to their surveys done on the public sector, 25 per cent of public sector officials are corrupt.
The latest unfolding scandal involving former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his election campaign of 2015, along with dozens more in the past many years, raises a question in the minds of ordinary citizens: how we regulate officials who are elected to regulate us - the public.
Types
In reality, there are many different types of corrupt practices, all of which fit the classical definition of misuse of resources for personal gain, and each of which requires different solutions.
Of all those corrupt practices, political corruption is the most notable crimes of the modern era. A classic example of political corruption in Sri Lanka. We have seen in the past years how cases of unscrupulous politicians and the abuse of power have become surprisingly common in Sri Lanka. Political corruption can come in many forms. They may be payoffs and bribes, graft and embezzlement, blackmail and extortion and preferential treatment like nepotism and patronage.
Adverse effects
Corruption connected to elected officials and politicians can undermine the integrity of Parliament and the democratic process in a number of ways. Organised groups may seek to corrupt the public procurement systems for financial gain; Corrupt private sector professionals can provide organised groups with access to the legitimate economy; Local Government may be targeted by those who wish to corrupt local processes, such as housing or planning, for their own gain; and organised crime groups may target local officials to consolidate their safety in communities. There are many others.
Three ways
If the government is really determined to end political corruption, it must have at its core the full participation and involvement of young people. As the next generation of political and business leaders, civil servants, educators and community workers, the young represent the fundamental fabric of society.
The government will need their engagement to achieve the three key ways to curb political corruption and to ensure the generational advancement of the community towards a better tomorrow.
(1) Changing the outlook of education
Today, the education system in Sri Lanka is quite out-dated. The required change would involve ensuring that school and university curricula are updated and modernized in line with societal changes and global developments.
The emphasis, as at present, should not be limited to only the formal school or university setting. It should include the holistic education of the next generation through community and religious institutions, vocational and internship opportunities, and participation in public and political processes as an integral part of socialization. If we adopt such an approach, it would be more likely to bridge the gap between the younger generation and political institutions.
(2) Changing the culture of integrity
Closely connected to the focus on education is the need to create a culture of integrity that is hard-wired in society. Although a comprehensive education system will foster a culture of integrity, we need to extend the efforts to other sectors beyond the young, such as top government servants, political leaders, private sector officers etc. If properly done, it will strengthen a culture of integrity that concentrates on high-quality service delivery and professional performance standards.
(3) Changing the culture of accountability
It is up to the public to demand accountability from their political leaders, civil servants and private-sector actors. And this demand must be sustained through challenging times of political transition or economic downturn when the temptations for engaging in unlawful and corrupt behaviour will be at their highest levels.
Translating these three key focus areas into concrete action can help free the country from corruption and lead to long-term sustainable development. However, it is a long-term process but the country needs the short-term solutions, also.
Lessons
For short and medium-term solutions, perhaps we could pick up few lessons from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In one of their recent reports on the elimination of political corruption, they state: Traditional approaches based on the creation of more rules, stricter compliance and tougher enforcement have been of limited effectiveness. A strategic and sustainable response to corruption is public integrity. The report further says: To effect change, action should go beyond the executive and government. The legislative and judiciary bodies and individuals and the private sector must get involved. Rendering information publicly is not sufficient but should go hand in hand with effective scrutiny and accountability mechanisms. OECD also recommends few strategies.
Guidelines
We do have anti-corruption bodies and accountability measures at national levels. While strengthening and empowering them to the highest level, there is also an urgent need to promote a political and cultural environment which is conducive to a corruption-resilient society.
Such an initiative should: (a) take into account the diversity and richness of our cultural traditions and make the stakeholders be aware of them, (b) receive strong grass-root level backing from a broad coalition of groups in society who are opposed to existing corrupt practices, (c) be flexible enough to adapt and respond to new forms of corruption as they emerge.

Rajapaksas have not changed their ways - Duminda
The Rajapaksa family rule was one reason why we opposed Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Rajapaksas have still not changed their ways, SLFP National Organiser and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Today they are bandying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa as Presidential candidates, he said. He was speaking at a meeting of the Medawachchiya electorate SLFP Central Organisation recently.
Dissanayake said even three and a half years after their defeat, the Rajapaksas did not talk about putting forward a Common Candidate other than a member of the Rajapaksa family.
Dissanayake said if a person like Dinesh Gunawardena or Vasudeva Nanayakkara was projected as the next Presidential candidate, they could easily reconsider their stand. But, the Rajapaksas were still talking about protecting their family interests.
The SLFP and the country were not the private property of the Rajapaksa family, Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said personally, he had a high regard for Mahinda Rajapaksa as an individual. He had both good and bad qualities. But lately, his bad qualities had overtaken his good qualities.
The New York Times newspaper had recently alleged that a Chinese Company had paid off millions to Mahinda Rajapaksa. If Mahinda Rajapaksa denies the allegation, he should take the New York Times to task without trying to resort to an eyewash by targeting Sri Lankan journalists who assisted the New York Times Journalist who published the report, Minister Dissananayke said.
Dissanayake said the 16 member Group of Parliamentarians who left the government ranks had now got stranded because a majority of the Joint Opposition members had given them step-motherly treatment.
Although Mahinda Rajapaksa had done a media show by accompanying Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to Basil Rajapaksas SLPP office, all three of them were not legally entitled to contest the next Presidential election.
The meeting was organised by Medawachchiya SLFP Organiser and Director Special Projects Presidents Office, Tissa Karaliyadda.

Reforms must bring about economic freedom: Anura Kumara
The country should have reforms to bring about justice, equality and freedom in economy, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said.
The JVP leader was speaking at a meeting held at the National Youth Service Council Auditorium, Maharagama.
He said the political parties that come into power do not have genuine need in this regard. They are only interested in ensuring perks and privileges for themselves, he said.
Ten per cent of the population with the lowest income rate get only 1.1 per cent of the GDP, while the 10 per cent of the population with the highest income rate enjoy a 38.4 per cent of the GDP, Anura Kumara said.
Although the per capita income in the country is USD 4,300, 42 per cent of the population receive an income of USD 730. Sri Lanka was elevated to a lower middle income country that exceeds USD 4,000 annually. But 42 per cent receive below USD 730, he said.
MP Anura Kumara said that over 61 per cent of the population are indebted to official institutions and ten per cent of the houses in the country are below 250 square feet. How could a family live in a house so small MP Dissanayake asked.
People should be given the dividends of the development. The government has to ensure a mechanism that would uplift peoples economy, he said.
Anura Kumara said the Western Province contributes 52 per cent of the GDP while the North Western Province gives 9 per cent and the North Central Province 4 per cent. It shows inequality of the development, he said.
As many as 3,363 persons had committed suicide in 2017. Now Sri Lanka has recorded the fourth highest suicides in the world. Many in Jaffna commit suicide over their indebtedness,: he said.
MP Dissanayake said the situation must be changed or the country would be in economic chaos before long.
This government does not make reforms that the public need, MP Dissanayake said.

Root urges England to remain ruthless against India
LONDON, Saturday: Joe Root insisted England must stay ruthless when they go in search of a one-day international series victory over India at his Headingley home ground on Tuesday.
Roots well-constructed 113 laid the platform for an 86-run win at Lords on Saturday that saw England square the three-match contest at 1-1.
His innings, allied to fifties from captain Eoin Morgan (53) and David Willey (50 not out) helped England post a total of 322 for seven. India could only manage 236 all out in reply as they batted out their full 50 overs, with England fast bowler Liam Plunkett taking four for 46.
Victory saw England remain at number one, with India second, in the International Cricket Council mens ODI standings. It was a win made all the more satisfying by the fact England, the 2019 World Cup hosts, had suffered an eight-wicket drubbing in Thursdays series-opener at Trent Bridge.
That ruthless side of the ODI team really came out today (Saturday), said Test skipper Root. And were seeing it more and more. Hopefully we can back that up and finish the series off now, added Root after his first century at this level since March.
England were faltering at 239 for six but Willey picked a good time to make his maiden ODI half-century, with his innings coming during a quickfire seventh-wicket stand of 83 with Yorkshire team-mate Root.
David came in and took a lot of pressure off me, to help us turn in what was at least a par score, so it was a fabulous effort from him, said Root. Prior to Saturday, Root had faced just three deliveries from Indias Kuldeep Yadav, whose left-arm wrist-spin had been proving something of a mystery for Englands batsmen.
They certainly appeared to have little idea of how to play him while Kuldeep was enjoying a stunning return of six for 25 at Trent Bridge. But Root looked far more assured at Lords, even if Kuldeep still took three for 68.
Root was dropped recently from Englands Twenty20 team and there have been suggestions that his brand of patient accumulation is no longer suited to the modern one-day game.
TRUST YOUR GAME
But when it comes to rebuilding an innings, there appears little wrong with Roots approach.
Ultimately youve just got to trust your game and trust your technique; I felt I was picking him (Kuldeep) OK, he said. He added: I feel Ive got a solid approach against spin bowling. On a turning surface its important to make sure you feel youre playing it in the right manner and working things out.
Thankfully I managed to follow through here. I thought we were quite smart in getting to what we thought was a good total; we didnt go too hard too early.
No India batsman made a fifty and the tourists struggled after Englands quicks took three wickets early in their chase. When we lost three wickets in around three overs that really hurt us, said Virat Kohli, the India captain, who was out for 45. With India desperately needing quick runs, MS Dhoni produced a curiously laboured innings of 37 off 59 balls -- a display that saw the former captain booed by some sections of the normally polite crowd at Lords.
But Kohli defended Dhoni, who on Saturday became just the 12th man to score 10,000 ODI runs but the only one with an average of over 50, by saying: When he does well, people call him the best finisher ever and when they dont go well, they all pounce on him. We all have bad days in cricket and today was a bad one for everyone, not just him. AFP

Samoa seal Rugby World Cup spot with win in Germany
BERLIN, Germany, Saturday - Samoa became the 18th country to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan after a 42-28 play-off second-leg victory over Germany in Heidelberg on Saturday.
The win, coupled with a 66-15 first-leg triumph in Apia two weeks ago, gave the Pacific island state a 108-43 aggregate victory.
Full-back Ahsee Tuala bagged two of Samoas three late tries as the plucky Germans led 28-21 with 14 minutes to go before the visitors pulled away.
Tuala, the Northampton Saints full-back, hit the line at pace and converted his own try to tie the scores at 28-all on 69 minutes.
Then right wing Ed Fidow, who scored a hat-trick of tries in the first leg, went over for a try Tuala converted to make it 35-28 with five minutes remaining. With the German defence tiring, Tuala then crossed in the right corner on 80 minutes to seal the win with his second converted try.
Tuala finished with a haul of 22 points, having also converted all six of Samoas tries in Heidelberg.
Samoa go into Pool A with Ireland, Japan, Russia and Scotland in the first Rugby World Cup to be staged in Asia. Germany get another chance to qualify for a maiden World Cup appearance when they face Canada, Hong Kong and an African team -- probably Kenya -- in a repechage competition.
The last chance saloon round-robin tournament is set for Marseille during November with each country playing the other three once.
We showed a high intensity against a team like Samoa for 80 minutes, said Germanys Uruguayan coach Pablo Lemoine.
Weve seen where we need to improve at that level to qualify for the World Cup.
