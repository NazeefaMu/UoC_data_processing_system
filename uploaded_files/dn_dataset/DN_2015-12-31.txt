Businessmen, officials jailed for Argentina train crash
ARGENTINA: A court in Argentina sentenced 21 people including an ex-railway company boss and two former state officials to jail Tuesday for a train crash that killed 51 people in 2012. Judges handed a three-and-a-half year sentence to the driver of the train that ploughed into the buffers at a rail terminal in Buenos Aires with 1,200 passengers on board.
But they reserved the longest sentences for the businessman who ran the Buenos Aires Trains company (TBA) and for two former senior transport officials. A judge in the court announced a nine-year sentence for Claudio Cirigliano, head of TBA, for "fraudulent administration and culpable harm."
The court also sentenced former state transport secretary Juan Pablo Schiavi to eight years and his predecessor Ricardo Jaime to six years.
Various other state officials and transport entrepreneurs were also sentenced for crimes including negligence and mismanagement.The court said the businessmen and state officials bore greater responsibility than the driver, Marco Cordoba.
The driver had said the train's brakes failed but technical evidence showed that other safety procedures were not carried out.
As well as the 51 people killed, 789 were injured in the crash in February 2012. The disaster prompted then president Cristina Kirchner to nationalize and modernize Argentina's rail network.
The court said it would release full details of the ruling in 2016.

England crush SA by 241 runs in first Test
DURBAN, Wednesday - England captain Alastair Cook hailed the performance and potential of his team after they completed a crushing 241-run win over South Africa on the fifth day of the first Test at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
It took England only 80 minutes to take South Africas remaining six wickets for the addition of 38 runs, with man-of-the-match Moeen Ali setting the tone by dismissing batting kingpin AB de Villiers with the third ball of the day. He followed up with two more wickets and had match figures of seven for 116.
Cook said a key factor had been batting solidly in bowler-friendly overhead conditions on the first day after being sent in.
It was an interesting toss, the overheads were suggesting you want to bowl first but the pitch was quite dry, said Cook. We would also have bowled first.
It was a matter of getting through that first day. The way Nick (Compton) played really set up the first innings. From that moment on, the guys bowled particularly well to take 20 wickets and we scored enough runs in the second innings.
Cook said a convincing win against a strong South Africa A team in the build-up to the Test had given the players a lot of confidence. It was particularly pleasing to back up our form under pressure in a Boxing Day Test match.
With only a two-day turnaround before the second Test starts in Cape Town on Saturday, Cook said it was important to recover well and to avoid complacency. It can turn very quickly. They have world-class players so we cant get too carried away. But it would be nice to get our noses ahead again and to continue to put pressure on South Africa.
Despite his fifth-ranked side defeating the current Test number ones, Cook said it was too early to predict a period of ascendancy for England. But he said: The guys have taken big strides forward as a team over the last eight months or so. Its a good side to captain, theres a good balance, the guys are happy and they seem really hungry.
Potentially this team can do some really good things. Theres so much talent in this side. But it will take relentless hard work and good results over a long period of time.
South African captain Hashim Amla, meanwhile, admitted that his teams batting had been most disappointing, especially following a poor performance on a similarly good batting pitch in the final Test in Delhi earlier this month during a losing series in India.
Amla said his teams lack of batting form was a confidence thing and acknowledged that his own lack of runs was a concern. As captain you want to lead from the front not being in the runs is most disappointing from me. Its a developing team but certainly from my perspective getting runs on the board is most important.

Lanka take on Afghanistan in crucial semi-final
Whether Sri Lanka will qualify for the South Asian Football Championship final or not is the question every football fan in Sri Lanka will be anxiously waiting for when our lads take on Afghanistan in the crucial semi-final today at 6.30 pm local time. If Sri Lanka can pull off a win over Afghanistan, the island nation will qualify for a South Asian Football final after 20 years.
In 2009 Sri Lanka reached the semis and had to taste a defeat at the hands of Maldives. Sri Lanka did not perform well in recent times, but with the present teams performance has become the talking point among the regional football fraternity.
Afghanistan is ranked 150 and Sri Lanka ranked behind them at 194 in the world rankings. From 2003 the two countries have met on seven occasions and Afghanistan has won five times while Sri Lanka has secured victory only once. One match was drawn.
According to Afghanistan coach Peter Segt, even though he is aware of most of the South Asian teams, he is lacking in knowledge of the Sri Lankan team which includes many young players.
Sri Lanka coach Sampath Perera said that Sri Lanka has been tested in the counter attack strategy and proved good at it. We hope to follow the same method in the semi-final against Afghanistan, said Perera. We will follow a new technique by using two attackers with a one not being exposed directly. Captain Roshan Nalaka will not play in the first segment but will be used during the middle of the game, he said.
The Sri Lanka team includes nine under-23 players and the inclusion of Sujan Perera who is a professional player in Maldives has strengthened the local side. Goalkeeper Sujan won the Man of the Match award in the game against India, even though Sri Lanka lost. The Afghanistan side includes many professional players and they have won all three group matches and scored 11 goals. Sri Lanka won against Nepal but lost to India in the group matches. The other semi-final is between India and Maldives kick off at 3.30pm local time.

A look at the women in his life
At 50, Salman Khan continues to remain the most sought after irresistibly charming bachelor of Bollywood. The actor has had his share of affairs but he has always been careful not to wash the linen of his affairs in public. But the actor has never shied away from flaunting his glamorous girl pals at social dos and other events. We take a look at the women who have been a part of in Salman's love life.
Sangeeta Bijlani: Sangeeta was a Miss India who started trying her luck in films. Salman fell for this beauty queen and sister Alvira apparently played cupid. If there is one woman who Salman came too close to marrying, it was Sangeeta Bijlani. Rumour has it that wedding cards were also almost printed. But unfortunately, the love story ended. Both, however, continue to remain the best of friends.
Somy Ali: A 19 year old Somy Ali was the next one to walk into Salman's heart. The two made for a happy couple but this one turned out to be a brief relationship. Rumour has it that Salman's drinking ways played spoilsport and the couple called it quits.
Aishwarya Rai: Salman Khan fell hook, line and sinker for the light eyed former Miss World Aishwarya Rai and the duo whipped up some legendary chemistry in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Salman was reportedly madly in love with Aishwarya who too reciprocated with equal warmth initially. However, problems cropped up with Salman's alleged abusive behaviour towards Aishwarya being seen as the prime reason behind the couple going their separate ways.
Katrina Kaif: This one went on for a long while. Salman was apparently besotted by this London beauty who had just made her debut in Bollywood with a disaster called Boom. Salman took Katrina under his wings and love blossomed between the duo and so did the latter's career in Bollywood. Katrina was quite faithful having stood behind Salman through his turbulent times especially when he was incarcerated. However like every other Salman love stories this one too came to an end. Apart from the above four women, Salman has also been linked to a lot many other actresses.
Sneha Ullal: Salman launched an Aishwarya Rai look alike, Sneha Ullal in Lucky and the duo were linked up very soon. However the sizzle died down after the movie flopped at the box-office.
Zareen Khan: Yet another newcomer who was launched by Salman. Link up rumours started doing the rounds after Zareen was spotted with Salman at various social dos.
However all such news became history soon.
Daisy Shah: The umpteenth newcomer who Salman launched. Gossip mills were soon churning with news of the two seeing eqch other. As always, they turned out to be nothing but rumours. Daisy is seen hanging out with Salman these days.
Claudia Ciesla: Claudia's only claim to fame has been her brief association with Salman Khan. Like others, Claudia too accompanied Salman to many events and it didn't take long for gossip mills to get out news churning of their affair. Nothing great emerged out of the association.
Iulia Vantur: Salman's fixation for foreign beauties continues and this time it is Romanian beauty who seems to have captured his heart. Iulia is Salman's current constant companion leading to speculations of the superstar's plan to settle down with her. Only time will tell if this romance is for the keeps.

Maharoof helps NCC regain Premier l/o title with a hat-trick
Former Sri Lanka all-rounder Farveez Maharoof sounded the national selectors that he is playing some of the best cricket in his career when he performed a hat-trick to lead NCC to topple defending champs Colts by 77 runs in the AIA Premier limited-over final played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
NCC winning the toss and batting first put up a challenging total of 255-8 courtesy of an opening stand of 86 between two former Sri Lankan players Niroshan Dickwella (49) and Upul Tharanga (34) and dismissed Colts for 178 in 45 overs with skipper Maharoof all but making the final a one-sided affair by producing a hat-trick in the opening over of the innings.
He picked up a wicket off his fourth, fifth and sixth deliveries to have Colts reeling at two for three wickets. The defending champs would have been in a worse plight had Maharoof not suffered a hamstring injury in his second over and had to retire taking no further part in the game.

Colts somewhat recovered through a 105-run partnership between Hashan Dumindu (72) and Angelo Jayasinghe (50) but once the pair was separated there was no further resistance to stop NCC from pushing for a comfortable win. Angelo Perera with a 74-ball half-century, Maharoof (34) and Isuru Udana (25 off 14 balls) contributed towards NCC's total despite Sri Lanka off-spinner Dilruwan Perera threatening to run through their batting taking six wickets for 28. NCC last won the title in 2006-07.
NCC 255-8 in 50 overs (Niroshan Dickwella 49, Upul Tharanga 34, Angelo Perera 50, Farveez Maharoof 34, Isuru Udana 25, Dilruwan Perera 6/28)

## Title: Not a productive year on all fronts

Not a productive year on all fronts
The calendar year 2015 was undoubtedly not a productive one for Sri Lanka cricket with the national team undergoing a period of transition following the retirement of the last of the three batting icons Kumar Sangakkara. The previous two years had seen Tillakaratne Dilshan (in 2013) and Mahela Jayawardene (in 2014) bowing out of international cricket after lengthy and successful careers.
The last bastion Kumar Sangakkara bid goodbye to international cricket during the Indian Test series at home, thus bringing to an end a glorious cricketing career that marked him as one of the 'greats' in world cricket.
The meticulous left-hander appeared in five of Sri Lanka's 11 Tests played for the calendar year - one in New Zealand, and two each against Pakistan and India at home before signing off. His farewell though momentous did not have a fairytale ending as everyone would have wanted, but finished on a more somber note with Sri Lanka losing to India by 278 runs at the P Sara Oval and Sangakkara's final contribution to his country being 32 and 18 - falling on both occasions to the off-breaks of Ravichandran Ashwin.
Milinda Siriwardana and Dushmantha Chameera two exciting prospects for thefuture.
Sangakkara had his name engraved in virtually every Sri Lankan batting record and he set a world mark for a wicket-keeper in ODI cricket with 482 dismissals of which he also had the highest number of stumpings 99.
He marked his final appearance at a World cup by scoring four consecutive hundreds - a record in ODI cricket.
Sangakkara's exit created a big void in Sri Lanka's batting for the number three slot which he had so diligently held on for nearly 15 years and contributed lavishly. Not only in the Tests but also in the ODIs Sri Lanka struggled to fill the hole created by the retirements of Sangakkara and Jayawardene who were a solid no. 3 and 4 in the order for many years.
The two heir apparents to that throne Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal had rather ordinary years although much was expected from them. Thirimanne managed just 310 runs in 8 Tests averaging 23.94 with two fifties and 774 runs in ODIs average 38.70 with century and five fifties. Chandimal having to bat lower down the order because of wicket-keeping duties had a fairly good run in Tests accumulating 901 runs from 11 matches, average 47.42 with two centuries and an average run in ODI cricket with 298 runs (avg. 33.11) and two fifties.
The performances of skipper Angelo Mathews also suffered slightly due to the extra burden of having to shoulder more batting responsibilities aggregating 845 runs (avg. 42.25) from 11 Tests that included three centuries.
Of the younger brigade opener Dimuth Karunaratne performed best scoring 761 runs (avg. 36.61) from 11 Tests inclusive of two hundreds.
Dilshan who is continuing his international career in the ODIs and T20Is turned out to be Sri Lanka's most prolific run-getter in all formats by scoring over 1000 runs in ODIs in the calendar year. With one match to play on New Year's eve against New Zealand, Dilshan sported an aggregate of 1116 runs (avg. 50.72) with four centuries - the fourth time in his illustrious career he has passed 1000 runs for a calendar year.
On the bowling front the most impressive development was the form shown by fast bowler Dhammika Prasad. Prior to the start of 2015 Prasad had just 34 wickets from 17 Tests in an injury hit six years.
He worked himself assiduously towards getting fit and, free from injuries he became the spearhead of the Lankan Test bowling attack ending the year with 41 wickets (avg. 24.95) from nine Tests even outdoing left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who had borne the brunt of the bowling since the retirement of legendary spinner Muthiah Muralitharan in 2010.
Prasad could have easily topped a half century of wickets had he not got injured ahead of the two Tests in New Zealand on the current tour.
He more or less compensated for the loss of another fast bowler Shaminda Eranga who went through 2015 without playing a single Test for his country suffering a series of recurring injuries starting off with his back.
Herath not having the best of season's managed 37 wickets (avg. 35.59) from 10 Tests and even suffered the rare ignominy of being dropped from one Test when the Pakistani batsmen whom he had tormented over the years found out a ploy to counter him.
Young off-spinner Tharindu Kaushal looked as if he had a promising career ahead of him and was even being touted as Herath's successor when he took 22 wickets in five Tests for the year before his world fell apart when his doosra was deemed to be illegal and was banned.
In the following Test against West Indies Kaushal was nowhere as effective as he was before and the selectors were forced to drop him and recall another off-spinner Dilruwan Perera to partner Herath.
Dinesh Chandimal the leading run getter in Tests
It is not the end of the world for Kaushal who is only 22, he has enough time in his hands to regain his confidence and become a match-winner for his country as Herath's days of retirement are not far away. The 37-year-old veteran is battling fitness to keep himself going against recurring knee problems.
The emergence of Milinda Siriwardana as a left-handed all-rounder and Dushmantha Chameera as a young a fiery fast bowler are some of the positives Sri Lanka can draw from the year. A late developer Siriwardana at 30 has already displayed his talent in all three formats of the game with his free-flowing hits and useful left-arm orthodox spin.
Chameera (23) is the most exciting 'find' for Sri Lanka bowling consistently at 140 plus and unsettling opposing batsmen with his lively pace and bounce.
Likewise Kusal Perera who was emerging as the most exciting batsman since Sanath Jayasuriya had his budding international career on the line following a dope test taken during the home series against West Indies that turned out to be positive and saw him fighting hard to save himself.
Result wise Sri Lanka did not have a good year winning only four of the 11 Tests played during 2015 and losing seven to be ranked as low as seventh out of 10 in the ICC Test standings.
In ODI cricket they were knocked out of the World Cup by South Africa in the quarterfinals and overall had 11 wins against 12 losses to show from 24 matches and a ranking of five.
Sri Lanka however managed to cling onto top spot in the T20I rankings despite having an unimpressive year where they won only one out of four matches (3 losses).
It was not a good year for long-standing curator of the Galle International Stadium Jayananda Warnaweera who was suspended by Sri Lanka Cricket for two years from cricket, cricket management and representation after he failed to attend two interviews with the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit and also failed to assist them on alleged match-fixing investigations.
Since April 1 Sri Lanka Cricket was administered by a nine-member interim committee appointed by Navin Dissanayake during his short tenure as Sports Minister to get rid of 'system corruption' at SLC. The committee headed by former Sri Lanka cricketer Sidath Wettimuny cut down severely on unnecessary expenditure and diverted it towards infrastructure development around the country.
However with a new Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera in place elections are scheduled for January 3 which meant the interim administration would cease to exist by the end of the year. We end this review on a rather solemn note as during the year Sri Lanka cricket lost one of its finest coaches Lionel Mendis who passed away at the age of 80. He was widely referred to as the father figure on cricket coaching in the country.

Sri Lanka enjoy mixed fortunes
Sri Lanka sport enjoyed mixed fortunes during the year 2015. As the curtain comes down ending another calendar year, its time to take a stock and evaluate how our sportsmen and women have fared during the year.
Although Sri Lanka did not figure in the biggest sporting event of the year  Rugby World Cup 2015 worked off in the UK, there was tremendous interest on the tournament among local sports fans.
Although a World Cup berth remains a distant dream for Sri Lanka, its national rugby team put up a blistering performance to win the 2015 Asian Rugby Championship Division 1 title. Sri Lanka became the biggest climbers in the World Rugby Rankings moving up nine places from 47th to 38th in the world to equal their highest ever position since the IRB rankings were introduced in October 2003.

The newly-crowned Asia Rugby Championship Division 1 champions earned 2.84 rating points after they overcame Kazakhstan in midweek before beating the hosts Philippines 27-14 in the final worked off in Bulacan on May 9.
Marathon runners in WC
History was created at the 15th IAAF World Championship when two Sri Lankan marathon runners  Anuradha Indrajith Cooray and Niluka Geethani Rajasekera qualified to compete at the 2015 Championships in Beijing, China.
Cooray figured on the opening day of the meet on August 21 and secured 29th place clocking an unimpressive two hours, 25 minutes and four seconds, well behind his Sri Lanka record of 2:13.47 registered at 2015 London Marathon last April.
Rajasekara, who came fifth in the womens event of the 2015 Hong Kong marathon with a time of two hours, 40 minutes and seven seconds last January, set a new Sri Lanka mark. Her feat also bettered the qualifying time to participate in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, along with Cooray who booked his passage to Rio at the 2015 London Marathon. However, Rajasekera returned a timing of only two hours, 50 minutes and 40 seconds to finish 49th at the IAAF World Championship womens marathon worked off in Beijing on August 30.
Long jumper N. Chamali Dilrukshi Priyadarshani and hammer thrower Ayesha Maduwanthi maintained their superb form this year, establishing new Sri Lanka records at the 41st National Sports Festival in Diyagama this month.
South Asian Games gold medallist Priyadarshani had a record-breaking jump of 6.43m in her fifth attempt to better the previous mark of 6.35m held by Nayanthi Chandrasena in 2002. Maduwanthi threw 43.18m to account for the other Sri Lanka mark.
Earlier in September, Ishara Sandaruwan of Sri Lanka Air Force cleared 4.90m to set a new Sri Lanka record in pole vault at the Thailand Open Athletics Championship.
He narrowly missed the bronze medal, finishing fourth after he erased the previous Sri Lanka record for the event - 4.85m by Ruwan Pradeep Perera in 1999.
Bronze for Nimali
Middle distance runner Nimali Liyanarachchi secured womens 800m bronze medal at the Asian Athletics Championships in Wuhan, China last June. She clocked two minutes and 39.4 seconds. It was Sri Lankas first Asian Championship medal in womens 800m after Sriyani Dhammika Menikes dream run in Manila, 1993.
In May, former Asian Games gold medallist Sugath Tillakaratne was elected President of the Athletic Association of Sri Lanka. Tillakaratne who won mens 400m gold medal at the 1998 Bangkok Asian Gmaes is only the second Asian Games gold medallist to become Sri Lanka athletic chief after Sunil Gunawardena, a member of the mens 4 x 400m relay team that won the gold medal at the 1974 Teheran Games.
On October 10, Olympic Silver medallist Susanthika Jayasinghe launched her athletic training academy, her official website and her autobiography to coincide with the 15th anniversary of winning the Olympic medal at the Sydney Games in 2000. She also received a token presentation of one million rupees from President Maithripala Sirisena to flag-off her project in the company of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and her ex-coach and manager during her illustrious athletic career, American Tony Campbell.

Singapore enjoyed two wins out of eight matches in the 10-day NWC2015 campaign, with both wins coming against Asian rivals Sri Lanka. Singapore beat Sri Lanka 56-43 in the opening day and put up a stronger performance in the placing match to cement their kingpin status in Asia.
Playing in pool C in their ninth world cup, Sri Lanka opened with a defeat at the hands of Singapore 43-56. The Lankan lasses suffered a humiliating defeat in the next game as Malawi scored a smashing 101-18 victory. In the last Pool C qualifier, South Africa crushed Sri Lanka 89-17.
Wisden honours Sanga
Sri Lanka star batsman Kumar Sangakkara was named the cricketer of the year in the 2015 Wisden Cricketers Almanack. The former Sri Lanka captain, who retired from international cricket this year, joined Indias Virender Sehwag as the only two players to be named as Wisdens Leading Cricketer in the World for a second occasion.
The 37-year-old wicket keeper batsman won the award after a stellar 2014 that saw him score an all-time record 2,868 international runs in the calendar year, including a triple century. Sangas feats, which added to an already brilliant career, included a man-of-the-match performance in Sri Lankas World Twenty20 final win over India last year. He later endorsed Wisdens judgment by scoring a record four successive hundreds at the last World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Gold in weightlifting
Former national weightlifting champion Ransilu Jayatillake brought glory to Sri Lanka when he won the gold medal in the 120kg category at the Singapore Open Power Lifting Championships in Singapore. |He had a total lift of 685kg consisting of 305.5kg Dead Lift. It was the highest lift by a Sri Lankan in the history of this sport. He also lifted 260kg in squat and 122.5 in bench press.
Sports Ministry-NOC patch-up differences
It was heartening to see the Sports Ministry and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka (NOC) shedding their differences to reach an understanding to get rid of the controversial amendments to the National Sports Law, which have been highly criticized by many international sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee.
Thanks to the broad vision of the new Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who assumed office last September, the NOC and the Sports Ministry have already declared that they would soon reverse the controversial amendments brought during the tenure of former minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
The new sports minister has taken steps to amend the sports law and regulations according to the principles of International Olympic charter. He has also taken action to submit the issues arising in relation to amending the sports law and regulations to the Olympic committee. He has agreed to amend the sports regulations at a discussion in Lausanne with the deputy director General of the International Olympic committee Pero Miro and NOC Secretary General Maxwell de Silva in October.
As a result of the new laws, which also barred officials serving in any executive committee position of a national sports association for more than four successive years, almost all senior sports administrated were disqualified from seeking re-election to their respective sports governing bodies. Hence, this years election to most national associations saw amateur officials being elected to top positions, thereby seriously affecting the smooth functioning of those bodies.
Three sports ministers served during the year 2015 - only the second time since the formation of the Ministry of Sports that it has happened. The previous instance was in 2010 when ministers Gamini Lokuge, C.B. Ratnayake and Mahindananda Aluthgamage served the ministry. Since Minister Aluthgamages tenure ended on January 12 this year, Minister Navin Dissanayake served for a brief period until September 4 before Minister Jayasekera succeeded him on September 4 as the countrys 13th sports minister.
